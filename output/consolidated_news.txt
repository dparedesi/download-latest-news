US clean energy might seem an early victim of policy shifts and funding cuts, but BlackRock says its still a key source of power and an area of the stock market that could rise. Even with renewable power facing heightened scrutiny from the Trump administration, coupled with the erosion of tax benefits in the congressional reconciliation bill, two things should keep investors interested in the space. First, energy demand isn't ebbing, and clean energy will be needed more than ever. "The US likely needs more of all kinds of energy to meet AI's needs," BlackRock wrote in a note on Tuesday. "Industry projections see US data center electricity consumption rising between 50% and 200% by 2030 — a big jump after 15 years of flat national power demand." In other words, Washington can't afford to slash a leading source of electricity if the US is to maintain its artificial intelligence leadership. According to the Energy Information Administration, solar is projected to lead US power generation growth through 2026. Together with wind, solar overtook coal in the nation's energy mix for the first time in 2024. Second, BlackRock says industry headwinds are priced into renewable power stocks. "Longer term, we see clean energy stocks positioned for strong growth," BlackRock wrote. "Renewables are quick to build and valuations are attractive: the factors that contributed to their slump — like high rates and tariffs — are now priced in, we think." BlackRock also suggested that investors keep tabs on nuclear stocks, with the Trump administration's focus on nuclear making the sector poised for growth. "Last week, President Trump signed executive orders aimed at expediting nuclear power reactor deployment, and the most recent revisions to the House bill preserved the existing tax credits allotted to nuclear project developers," BlackRock wrote. "But given how long it takes to build nuclear power plants, we see natural gas and renewables benefiting sooner." Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly.

Title: 'Full hit from China': Analysts are staying bullish on Nvidia ahead of earnings, but tariffs loom large

Nvidia will report fiscal first-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the closing bell. The impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs on Nvidia will be in focus, as will the company's shrinking market share in China. The overall outlook for Nvidia earnings on Wall Street is generally upbeat, but uncertainty looms in the second half of 2025. The earnings-release time is shortly after 4 p.m. ET, and its conference call with analysts will start around 5 p.m. Nvidia's stock was up 0.9% year-to-date through Tuesdays's close, slightly outpacing the S&P 500's 0.7% increase. While earnings for Nvidia should be "fine" for the first quarter, guidance will likely be lowered in the second quarter to account for a hit to the company's revenue in China, analysts estimated. "With regard to the F2Q26 we are slightly lowering estimates to account for a full hit from China," the firm wrote in a note this month. Still, demand for Nvidia's products will likely remain on a solid trajectory in the coming years, the firm said, pointing to Nvidia's recent deal with Saudia Arabia. The research firm reiterated its "buy" rating on the stock and issued a price target of $150 a share, implying 11% upside from current levels. Nvidia's almost 25% share price jump this past month has come hand-in-hand with several announcements that place its chips at the center of vast new AI data centers. During a trip to Saudi Arabia this month, Jensen Huang revealed a deal to ship 18,000 of Nvidia's top chips to the country. Last week, the FT reported that Oracle will buy $40 billion worth of chips from Nvidia for a US data center. Any sign that more deals are coming down the line could reassure investors that huge revenue growth in the chip giant's lucrative data center business is still achievable. — Hasan Chowdhury Nvidia's stock is up 25% in the last month. In an earnings preview note, Jefferies analysts led by Blayne Curtis wrote that Nvidia's stock "has been running over the past few weeks" following an easing of AI restrictions by the US government and recent announcements of AI projects with the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. The analysts wrote that they don't expect these developments to help today's results or guidance for the current quarter. The main drag on earnings will likely come from the Trump administration's restriction on selling H20 chips to China. Still, the analysts expect quarter-on-quarter growth to be viewed positively by investors and that Nvidia's supply chain issues will be resolved. The networking business should also pick up, alleviating some investor concerns around potential market share loss in that sector, the analysts wrote in last week's note. — Shubhangi Goel Restrictions on chip sales in China will likely remain an "overhang" on Nvidia until new rules are implemented, analysts at DA Davidson wrote. New restrictions on chips sold in China could also come "any day," they added, despite the Trump administration recently rolling back Biden's AI diffusion rule. The firm reiterated its "neutral" rating on the stock and issued a $120 price target, which they said was dependent on factors like how regulation in China will shake out and if some of Nvidia's neocloud customers face borrowing challenges. The price target implies 11% downside from current levels. In April, President Donald Trump placed restrictions on exports of Nvidia's H20 chips to China. The chipmaker said it expected a $5.5 billion write-down in its first-quarter earnings as a result of the new restrictions. During the Computex Taipei tech conference in Taiwan on May 21, Huang said the chipmaker's market share in China dropped to 50%, down from 95% four years ago. He added that Chinese companies have benefited from US chip export rules, and they have been "a failure." The chipmaker is reportedly planning to begin mass production for a less powerful AI chipset for China at a lower price as early as June, Reuters reported on Monday. — Ana Altcheck Piper Sandler said it expects Nvidia to miss on revenue for the first quarter. That's due to uncertainties related to the US economy, tariffs, and the ban on its H20 chip in China. "All in all, we think that NVDA is poised to be flat to down into the print this week," analysts wrote. Still, the firm sees Nvidia benefiting from a strong second half of the year. That's due to strong capital expenditures from other tech firms and an improving macroeconomic backdrop. "We advise investors to weather the uncertainty and stay long the stock as this is likely largely the last wave of negative news for NVDA this year." The firm reiterated its "overweight" rating on Nvidia and issued a $150 price target, implying 11% upside from current levels. A concern often raised by Nvidia investors is the small pool of customers it has depended on to generate billions of dollars in revenue. A handful of Big Tech firms have accounted for more than half of Nvidia's data center revenue as the AI boom has taken shape. But Nvidia has shown signs that its days of depending on West Coast tech firms may soon be over. Deals to sell its chips to nation states with plans to build sovereign AI capabilities have been picking up. Investors could look to get a clearer roadmap on plans to widen its customer base. — Hasan Chowdhury Nvidia should post a "modest" sales beat in the first quarter, but analysts at Bank of America said the company's guidance for the current quarter could be "messy. " They pointed to the impact of tariffs on Nvidia's shipments from China. The bank estimated that Nvidia could see a $4 billion to $5 billion headwind on shipments from China in the second quarter. Sales guidance for the second quarter could be revised down to $41 billion, down from the $46 billion consensus estimate. BofA estimated that Nvidia's total sales for the 2026 fiscal year could be around 6% below consensus, while earnings could be around 10% below consensus. "Despite these near-term headwinds, we maintain Buy on NVDA, a top sector pick given its unique leverage to the global AI deployment cycle and possibility for China sales recovery on new redesigned/compliant products later in the year," analysts wrote.

Title: Enduring value: Traditional assets with modern strategy
URL: https://www.privatebankerinternational.com/features/enduring-value-traditional-assets-with-modern-strategy/
Time Published: 2025-05-27T16:24:20Z
Full Content:
Dominic Kohler, head of investment and client solutions at Brown Shipley, a Quintet Private Bank, reflects on the resilience of traditional assets, equities and bonds, amid inflation, volatility, and a new generation of investor expectations. Marked by rapid macroeconomic shifts, traditional asset classes such as equities and fixed income are being tested like never before. According to Kohler, the investment landscape is one of complexity and opportunity where prudence, adaptability, and trust are more valuable than ever. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more “We have been navigating a challenging environment over the past couple of years,” Kohler notes. “High interest rates, sustained inflationary pressure, volatile markets and continued geopolitical uncertainty” have reshaped how traditional assets are perceived and deployed. For equities, Kohler stresses, “being more selective; quality and resilience matter more than ever.” On the fixed income side, the outlook has brightened. “Things are looking up again now that yields are more attractive.” This combination of cautious optimism and tactical flexibility underscores Brown Shipley’s broader approach. “It’s a market where careful positioning is key – with a focus on the long term whilst also looking for opportunities as and when they present themselves.” Even as inflation shows signs of cooling, Kohler maintains that preserving wealth remains a core priority especially for private clients seeking long-term stability. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. “Apart from capital appreciation, our investment philosophy also includes a focus on wealth protection,” he explains. “Even with inflation starting to ease, this remains key. Quality shares and government or corporate bonds remain reliable tools to help us deliver on our philosophy.” While new asset classes and financial innovations continue to emerge, Kohler believes in the continued importance of traditional investments. “We are convinced that – even with changing market conditions, new asset classes and product innovation – traditional assets will continue to play a key role.” Brown Shipley employs a flexible yet disciplined approach to asset allocation, allowing it to respond quickly to market developments without losing sight of long-term objectives. “We have a dynamic asset allocation approach,” Kohler explains. “We actively adjust our positioning as the market changes, always guided by our long-term outlook but responsive to short-term shifts.” During periods of heightened volatility, this might involve reducing exposure to riskier assets like equities and increasing allocations to higher-quality bonds. “Within equities, we lean towards sectors and companies that are better positioned to weather uncertainty,” he adds. “On fixed income, with yields now more attractive, bonds have become an effective tool not only for capital preservation but also income generation.” While traditional assets form the core of most portfolios, Kohler highlights the growing relevance of alternatives in achieving true diversification. “It’s all about finding the right mix,” he says. “Alternatives can help reduce risk, increase diversification and provide an illiquidity premium.” Private markets, in particular, are gaining traction especially with younger, more growth-oriented investors. However, Kohler offers a word of caution. “Private markets are complex and often poorly understood. Clear communication and positioning of the benefits – and risks – is therefore important.” Despite the rise of alternatives and digital investments, Kohler remains confident in the long-term performance potential of traditional assets. “We are focused on providing consistent risk-adjusted returns over the long term,” he says. “Traditional assets still have a strong role to play. They can offer stability and consistency, particularly when clients see uncertainty and risk in the market.” Moreover, risk management is central to Brown Shipley’s investment philosophy. Through its parent company, Quintet, the bank partners with BlackRock to gain access to cutting-edge risk assessment tools. “As part of our partnership with BlackRock, we utilise best-in-class risk management tools to stress-test portfolios and consider various market scenarios,” Kohler explains. But numbers alone aren’t enough. “It is critical that advisers are close to clients and understand what is most important to them – spending time with them and ensuring their strategy remains aligned to their investment objectives and personal circumstances.” Where geopolitical developments can move markets overnight, Kohler’s advice is to remain level-headed. “Whether elections, conflicts or tariff announcements, we look at how such events may affect markets and adjust portfolios as required,” he says. “However, as we have seen at the start of this year, it is key to filter out the noise – whilst it is important to seek out opportunities, sometimes standing firm in our positioning can be the best course of action in the long run.” Looking ahead, Kohler sees several forces reshaping the future of traditional investing from regulatory shifts and product innovation to the expectations of younger investors. “We are in the midst of the largest wealth transfer in history,” he says. “Younger investors have an increased focus on thematic and sustainable investing. We are continuing to evolve our product offering accordingly, providing clients more choices about how their wealth is managed and invested.” Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) considerations are increasingly front and centre. But Brown Shipley’s approach is personalised rather than prescriptive. “ESG is often about deeply held beliefs, reflecting the individual values of the families we serve,” Kohler explains. “That’s why we do not impose our values but rather offer our clients a wide range of choices so they can invest in alignment with their values.” Incorporating ESG, he notes, is also a matter of sound investing. “Investors are constantly seeking to limit their investment universe by excluding poorly run or excessively risky companies. Incorporating ESG metrics is an attempt to evaluate and avoid risk – and identify opportunities – based on factors not always associated with investment decisions in the past.” While the human relationship remains at the core of client service, technology is playing an increasingly important role in portfolio construction and management. “Technology helps us make more informed decisions faster,” Kohler says. “We have a number of key partnerships that have given us access to market-leading technology that our clients benefit from as they feed into our internal processes and decision-making.” Still, he adds, “human interaction and judgement remain essential.” Traditional assets continue to offer a solid foundation for wealth preservation and growth. For Brown Shipley, it’s not just about selecting the right stocks or bonds, it’s about building long-term trust, leveraging innovation responsibly, and staying anchored to what matters most to clients. As Kohler puts it: “With the right allocation and solid instrument selection, traditional assets can continue to deliver superior long-term returns.”

Title: Piper Sandler Warns Of The “Last Wave Of Negative News” Ahead Of NVIDIA’s Pivotal Q1’25 Earnings

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. NVIDIA shares have been firmly pegged on a dizzying roller-coaster ever since DeepSeek released its R1 model back in January, having contended with peak AI fears, a full-fledged global war and the ensuing rapid de-escalation, and the fallout from the ongoing decoupling between the US and China. Yet, NVIDIA seems to have emerged from these Sisyphean obstructions relatively unscathed, and is on the cusp of clearing its last remaining negative catalysts for the year, as per a new investment note from Piper Sandler. To wit, Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar has reiterated an 'Overweight' rating and $150 share price target for NVIDIA, while noting: "All in all, we think that NVDA is poised to be flat to down into the print this week. We think that April quarter is poised for a miss in revenues largely from macro uncertainty and from the H20 ban." For the benefit of those who might not be aware, the Trump administration recently imposed licensing requirements on NVIDIA's China-specific H20 GPUs, which is expected to translate to a $5.5 billion inventory-related charge in Q1. As per an estimation by Susquehanna analysts, these licensing requirements cost NVIDIA $1 billion in China-related sales over the last three weeks of the company's April-ending quarter. For the rest of the year, these lost sales are likely to amount to $3.5 billion per quarter. What's more, the H20-related write-downs might depress NVIDIA's margins by 11 percentage points to 67.7 percent in Q1, as per an analysis by Wedbush. Last week, NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang declared that his company had walked away from $15 billion in potential annual sales in China following the imposition of licensing requirements. Concurrently, Huang predicted that the market for AI GPUs in China would swell to $50 billion in 2026. Of course, NVIDIA has been working on a China-specific, watered-down version of its Blackwell GPUs to comply with existing US export controls. However, given Washington's mercurial temperament towards all things China-related, the world's second-largest economy remains a persistent point of concern for NVIDIA. Coming back, Piper Sandler's Harsh Kumar believes NVIDIA's new China-specific Blackwell GPU will only launch in the latter half of its July-ending quarter. Kumar also believes that the factors responsible for NVIDIA's underperformance in Q1 are largely "outside" its control. The analyst goes on to note: "Despite this, we see a strong back half of the year given HPC capex coming on strong coupled with macro forces improving driven by sovereign investments following the announcements of several large deals over recent weeks." Kumar ends his note with solid advice: "We advise investors to weather the uncertainty and stay long the stock as this is likely largely the last wave of negative news for NVDA this year." Of course, while Piper Sandler appears cautious heading into NVIDIA's Q1 earnings print on Wednesday, Lynx Equity is anything but, boldly declaring that the stock could break out to new highs. "After a couple of quarters of inline results, we think NVDA has the potential to provide upside to muted investor expectations." Lynx Equity also took pains to note the resurgence of CoWoS capacity build at TSMC, which strongly suggests recovery in NVIDIA's supply chain. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Title: ETFs’ impact on Bitcoin – Is the classic bull-bear cycle over?

BTC’s cycle is becoming less predictable – Are ETFs and institutions changing the rules? The typical bull-bear Bitcoin [BTC] cycle may be facing a structural shift, according to DeFi analytics platform Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock). During previous cycles, Bitcoin’s long-term holders (LTH) accumulated during bear markets and unloaded later during bull runs (mostly halving). This helped form the typical bowl-shaped (red) patterns on the crypto’s on-chain charts. Source: Sentora/X However, the current cycle has been different and confusing even to seasoned BTC cycle analysts, noted the analytics firm. “This time, however, the script is different: distribution kicked off much earlier, has unfolded in a slower, stop-start fashion, and shows none of the clean, symmetrical rhythm we’ve come to expect.” Most analysts have linked the perceived cycle changes to a greater number of institutions embracing BTC. Especially after the approval of U.S Spot ETFs in early 2024. In fact, CryptoQuant founder Ji Young Ju shared a similar outlook after making a wrong bear market call in early 2025, only for BTC to hit a new all-time high two months later. He said, “It feels like it’s time to throw out that cycle theory. New liquidity sources and volume are becoming more uncertain, signalling a transition as the Bitcoin market merges with TradFi.” Despite the aforementioned changes in demand and supply dynamics, the present cycle (epoch 5) has been closely trailing the third (blue) and fourth (green) cycles. Worth pointing out, however, that it slightly diverged in January 2025. Source: Glassnode Since the last April halving, Bitcoin has rallied by over 70%, rising from $63k to over $109k. However, over the same period, the past cycles saw much higher returns. In the 2020-2021 cycle (epoch 4), BTC pumped by 354% while in 2017 (epoch 3, blue), the asset gained by over 500%. When the returns were zoomed out on a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) basis, it revealed a steady decline. The 4-year BTC cycle CAGR dropped from over 850% in 2015 to about 30% in May 2025. In short, annual investor returns have shrunk over the years – A move some have linked to BTC’s “asset maturity” status as TradFi embraces it. This thesis can also be supported by easing volatility (price swings). Source: The Block Since the debut of U.S Spot ETFs, annualized BTC volatility (30-day) has dropped from 78% to 35% – A sign that the asset became relatively less volatile from early 2024. When zoomed out from 2017, its volatility has been trending southwards, indicating that BTC has become more mature. Further adoption by institutions may make it even more like stocks or gold. Going forward, BTC’s massive upside potential may diminish. Despite it being the best asset on a risk-adjusted basis, compared to most traditional investments.

May 27, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, May 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming July 11, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) common stock between April 18, 2024, and October 16, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR ELEVANCE INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On July 17, 2024, Elevance disclosed that it was “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $32.21, or 5.8%, to close at $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance released its third quarter 2024 financial results, missing EPS consensus estimates by 13.7% “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Additionally, the Company lowered its EPS guidance for 2024 by 11.3%. On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $52.61, or 10.6%, to close at $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024, thereby injuring investors further. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) sicker patients with higher acuity tended to remain on Medicaid after redetermination, leading to higher per-patient costs; (2) this increase in cost was occurring at a rate that was not adequately reflected in Elevance's rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024; and (3) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Elevance common stock during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than July 11, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

The president floated a 25% tariff on iPhones imported into the U.S. on Friday, adding that Apple (AAPL) would foot the bill. “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.,” President Trump said in a TruthSocial post on Friday morning. Shares in Apple were down almost 4% by market open. The threat followed a report by the Financial Times that Foxconn (HNHPF), Apple’s supplier, would spend $1.5 billion on a plant in India for iPhones. “I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump said during business roundtable in Qatar last week. I said to him: ‘Tim, you’re my friend. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.’” Cook was absent from the president’s Middle East tour, which was attended by Big Tech’s leaders. “I mean, Tim Cook isn’t here but you are,” Trump said to Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang at an event in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The spat over Apple’s plans for Indian manufacturing marks a shift in Trump and Cook’s relationship, as the pair have historically been close allies. The president mistakenly called the CEO “Tim Apple” in 2019. That same year, the president told reporters that Cook is a “great executive because he calls me and others don’t.” Cook even donated $1 million of his personal money to Trump’s inauguration. On top of that, Apple committed to spend more than half a trillion dollars in the U.S over the next four years, with a focus on boosting domestic manufacturing, winning an exemption from April’s “reciprocal” tariffs. That exemption has since been made temporary, however. The possible 25% tariff comes at a bad time for Apple. It’s is the worst-performing Magnificent Seven stock this year, dropping 22%.

Title: BTC reclaims $110k as Trump Media announces $2.5B Bitcoin treasury
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/btc-reclaims-110k-as-trump-media-announces-2-5b-bitcoin-treasury/
Time Published: 2025-05-27T14:40:56Z

Trump Media and Technology Group, a Donald Trump-linked company that’s publicly traded in the US, has announced it’s raising $2.5 billion to invest in Bitcoin (BTC). Bitcoin price, which had hovered around $109k before the news, jumped to above $110,000 as bulls looked to reclaim the upper hand. The news comes as Bitcoin 2025, a major Bitcoin conference, begins in Las Vegas, with Trump sons Eric and Trump Jr expected as speakers. Nasdaq and NYSE Texas-listed Trump Media, trading under the ticker DJT, is the operator of Trump’s social media app Truth Social as well as streaming platform Truth+ and financial technology firm Truth.Fi. On Tuesday, the company revealed plans to raise $2.5 billion from 50 institutional investors, with subscription agreements targeting $1.5 billion of Trump Media common stock and $1 billion in convertible senior secured notes. The funds raised from this private placement offering will close on May 29, 2025. According to the announcement, the proceeds of the offering will be used to adopt a Bitcoin treasury. “We view Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets. Our first acquisition of a crown jewel asset, this investment will help defend our Company against harassment and discrimination by financial institutions,” said Devin Nunes, chief executive officer and chairman of Trump Media. Adding Bitcoin to the Trump family-owned company’s balance sheet will see it join other publicly-traded companies that now hodl billions of dollars worth of the digital asset. The biggest player in this corporate frenzy for BTC is Strategy, which has amassed over $40 billion in BTC since first buying it in 2020. The surge in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has also seen BlackRock gobble up thousands of BTC as inflows mount. Crypto.com and Anchorage Digital are Trump Media’s custody providers as it embarks on this BTC treasury venture. Other companies to help TMTG are Yorkville Securities and Clear Street as co-lead placement agents, and Cantor Fitzgerald as financial advisor. Bitcoin price changed hands around $110,065 at the time of writing, just 1.7% off its all-time high of $111,970 reached on May 22, 2025.

Title: The luxury housing market is cracking — and tech-heavy cities are getting hit hardest
URL: https://qz.com/luxury-home-prices-jumbo-mortgages-economic-uncertainty-1851782446
Time Published: 2025-05-27T14:39:00Z
Full Content:
Luxury home sales fell 10% in April from a year earlier, according to new data from Redfin (RDFN). While prices remain near record highs — with the median sale hitting $1.35 million, up nearly 7% since 2024 — beneath the surface, demand is cracking. The 10% drop in sales makes for the steepest decline since 2023 and the lowest April level in over a decade. Rising prices and rates on jumbo mortgages stubbornly stuck near five-year highs help to explain the sales decline. But this isn’t just a housing story. It’s a broader signal. For years, wealthy Americans bought the dip and shrugged off volatility. Now, they’re blinking. Evidence from the housing market and beyond suggests that the top 5% of U.S. households are growing skittish. Consider the location of the steepest declines — San Francisco, an extraordinarily tech-heavy market, but with its own finance-sector presence, too. Since 2022, nearly 500,000 tech workers have been laid off as major tech companies and smaller players have quietly offshored high-paying roles, from engineers to product managers. Even Walmart (WMT) is trimming corporate headcount — not out of desperation, but arguably because it can. The Wall Street Journal (NWSA) recently captured the new mood in boardrooms: “Everybody’s replaceable.” Such attitudes are likely to particularly affect white-collar workers in the wealthiest 5% who rely on their corporate salaries for the bulk of their income. In short, if such workers are anxious, they’re right to be. So they’re not buying mansions or rushing to close — they’re wondering if the floor beneath them is as solid as it felt a year or two ago. It’s a quiet kind of panic: the pullback of those who still have money, but no longer feel safe. The result is weakening demand in what should be the most interest-rate-immune and resilient segment of the market. There’s other evidence to suggest that the wealthy are parking capital, not deploying it. Numerous news reports, ahead of Nvidia (NVDA) earnings expected Wednesday, are pointing out that some $7 trillion is sitting in money-market funds. While not all this cash reflects U.S. upper-middle-class wealth, a portion of it certainly does, suggesting affluent Americans may currently see more risk than reward in assets such as stocks and housing. At the other end of the market, would-be buyers are priced out by 7% mortgage rates and $400,000 median homes, an affordability crisis devouring some 43% of median household income. When the housing market locks up at both ends, cost alone can’t explain the crisis. You have to look to confidence, and how that has gone missing.

Title: Google slashes quantum requirement to crack Bitcoin by 95% with technology a decade away

Expert predictions point to a possible Bitcoin split due to rising quantum computing capabilities. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin’s cryptographic resilience is facing renewed questions after a Google researcher suggested that quantum computers may be capable of breaking its encryption far sooner than expected. Craig Gidney, a leading quantum computing researcher at Google, published new findings indicating that the hardware requirements to break 2048-bit RSA encryption, a key mathematical element similar to that of Bitcoin, have dropped significantly. Gidney pointed out that his earlier estimates placed the threshold at 20 million noisy qubits, but the new projection requires fewer than one million. The reduced computational burden marks a significant leap in quantum capability, though it might take several days instead of a few hours. The Google researcher attributes the advancement to more refined quantum algorithms and enhanced error correction techniques that reduce the number of physical qubits needed by encoding logical qubits more efficiently. The revelations arrive as concerns grow over the pace of quantum computing development. Last year, Google introduced its Willow chip, a next-generation quantum processor that many believe brought real-world threats to digital security closer than previously assumed. In response, major financial institutions are updating their disclosures. For example, BlackRock recently flagged quantum computing as a material risk for its Bitcoin ETF product, IBIT. According to the firm: “If quantum computing technology is able to advance and significantly increase its capacity relative to the capacity of today’s leading quantum computers, it could potentially undermine the viability of many of the cryptographic algorithms used across the world’s information technology infrastructure, including the cryptographic algorithms used for digital assets like Bitcoin.” This shift reflects growing awareness that technological breakthroughs could challenge Bitcoin’s foundational encryption earlier than anticipated. Despite the concern, some experts believe the crypto sector still has time to adapt to the potential risks. Today’s logical-qubit demos top out at dozens (e.g., Quantinuum’s 12 logical qubits). Gidney’s 1,000,000-qubit figure is about physical (noisy) qubits, not logical. We’re three orders of magnitude away in sheer qubit count, and need major error-rate breakthroughs. Even the physical-qubit goal is likely 8–12 years out, and a true million-logical-qubit machine is decades away. Meanwhile, Bitcoin analyst Fred Krueger believes the emergence of a “quantum-resistant” version of the top crypto is inevitable. He anticipates a network split between a newly fortified Bitcoin and a legacy version, similar to how Ethereum split into ETH and Ethereum Classic. He stated: “Ulimately there will be a fork. ‘Quantum Resistant Bitcoin (QRB)’ and ‘Bitcoin Classic.’ The big money will recognize and push QRB. Some will fight it. Bitcoin Classic (BTC) will become the new Ethereum Classic.” Still, if Bitcoin becomes vulnerable in eight years, the network will not have long to adopt a quantum-resistant upgrade. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

Nvidia’s (NVDA) delicate dance in China continues. Amid U.S. export restrictions on its advanced AI chips, the chip giant valued at $3.3 trillion is reworking its product line — again — to maintain its hold on one of its most important markets without crossing Washington. Reuters (TRI), citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, reported that the company is preparing to release a stripped-down version of its popular Blackwell AI chips that have been specifically designed to comply with U.S. export rules. The news comes days before Nvidia prepares to release its first-quarter 2025 earnings. The Blackwell-based, China-only chip will reportedly cost from $6,000 to $8,000 and use conventional GDDR7 memory, a step down from the high-bandwidth tech in Nvidia’s flagship models. The previous H20 chips offered in the country sold for between $10,000 and $12,000. This coming chip also would ditch packaging in technology from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) An Nvidia spokesperson told Reuters that the company is looking at its “limited” options: “Until we settle on a new product design and receive approval from the U.S. government, we are effectively foreclosed from China’s $50 billion data center market.” This isn’t Nvidia’s first regulatory rodeo. After the U.S. blocked chip exports to China in 2022, the company responded with watered-down versions. When those got swept up in restrictions in late 2023, Nvidia developed chips with further reduced performance to comply with regulations. And that regulatory merry-go-round has continued. In April, Nvidia took a $5.5 billion charge after the U.S. government moved to block exports of the company’s H20 AI chips to China. Now, Nvidia is hoping that this China-specific chip variant will thread the needle. CEO Jensen Huang has been increasingly vocal about his frustrations with U.S. policy. At an event earlier this month, he called the export controls “a failure,” saying they’ve only accelerated China’s push to develop domestic AI hardware — sidelining U.S. players in the process. Tech has become the next battleground in the trade war between the U.S. and China. As a result of Nvidia’s export restrictions, Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei is gaining ground with its AI chips, which are quickly becoming the preferred alternative for Chinese tech firms. Nvidia’s market share in China has reportedly fallen from 90% to around 50% since 2022. But China remains a huge market for Nvidia, accounting for 13% of its sales in the past financial year. And this new chip is expected to help the company keep pace overseas despite its market share loss — because as good as Huawei is becoming, Nvidia is still considered better.

Title: Google CEO Sundar Pichai on the future of search, AI agents, and selling Chrome

Full Content:
The head of Google discusses the next AI platform shift and how it could change how we use the internet forever. by Nilay Patel Today, I’m talking with Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. We recorded this conversation in person after the Google I/O developer conference last week in what’s becoming a bit of a Decoder tradition. This is the third year that we’ve done Decoder after I/O, and this one felt really different. Google is in a very confident place right now, and you can really feel that in this conversation. If you caught any of the news from I/O, you know that it was all about AI — particularly a huge new set of AI products, not just models and capabilities. Sundar told me that these products represent a new phase of the AI platform shift, and we talked about that at length: how that shift is playing out, what the markers of these phases are, and whether any of these products can actually deliver a return on the huge investments Google has made in AI over the years. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! This year’s I/O also marked the beginning of what appears to be a new era for search and the web. Google’s new vision for search goes well beyond links to webpages to something that feels a lot more like custom app development. When you search for something, Google’s new AI Mode will build you a custom search results page, including interactive charts and potentially other kinds of apps, in real time. You can see that vision in the new AI Mode, which is now available to all US users. Google’s plan is to “graduate” features from AI Mode into the main search experience over time. I wanted to know how Sundar was thinking about that graduation process and how he thinks that will affect the web itself, which is shaped more than anything by the incentives of Google Search and SEO. You’ll hear Sundar say in several different ways that the web is still getting bigger and Google is sending more traffic to more websites than ever before, but the specifics of that are hotly contested. Just before we talked, the News Media Alliance — the trade group that represents publishers like Conde Nast, The New York Times, and The Verge’s parent company Vox Media — issued what can only be described as a furious statement, calling AI Mode “theft.” So we talked about that, too, and about what happens to the web when AI tools and eventually agents do most of the browsing for us. What does it mean for the web to go from a series of websites when AI tools just see it as a series of databases instead of as sites for people to use? Why would companies like Uber, DoorDash, or Airbnb allow their businesses to get commoditized in that way? If you’ve been listening to the show, you know I’ve been talking about this idea a lot, so Sundar and I spent some time on this idea; it was a real Decoder conversation. Of course, we also talked about the smart glasses that Google announced at I/O and when the next era of AI hardware might arrive — including what Sundar thinks of the big OpenAI and Jony Ive deal that was announced just before we spoke. And I couldn’t let this go without asking about the major antitrust trials that Google is involved in, including the government’s demand that Google sell Chrome, and what the negotiations with the Justice Department have involved. President Donald Trump has long complained about his search results being too negative, but Sundar told me that he will not change search rankings in response to political pressure, calling search “sacrosanct.” There’s a lot in this one — I’m eager to hear what you all think of it. Okay: Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Here we go. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Sundar Pichai, you’re the CEO of Alphabet and Google. Welcome back to Decoder. Nilay, good to be back. Feels like a nice tradition post-I/O to be talking to you. So good to be back. I think this is the third year we’ve done this after I/O. I’m excited. Thank you for keeping the tradition alive. Lots to talk about. You announced a lot of things yesterday during the keynote. There’s AI mode rolling out for US users, and big updates to Gemini. There’s Veo 3 and Imagen, the generators that you solved Pokémon with, which is very exciting. My takeaway from yesterday was that Google feels very confident now. There’s a real confidence about the technology coming to life and the products. A lot of things are shipping imminently. What’s the one piece that gave you that confidence? Is it just the volume of things that are shipping? Is it one technology that clicked into being ready for consumers? Where is it coming from? I think it comes from the depth and breadth of the AI frontier we are pushing in a more fundamental and foundational way. We spoke a lot about this theme called research becomes reality, but it is… We’ve always felt we are a deep computer science company, and we’ve been AI-first for a while. So putting all that together and bringing it to our products at the depth and breadth is what I think is really pleasing to see. For example, people may not have noticed it much. It was so quick. We spoke about text diffusion models in the middle of the whole thing, but we are pushing the frontier on all dimensions, right? And Demis [Hassabis] spoke about world models. So I think that’s the exciting part, like how deep we are pushing this frontier and then bringing it to users, and maybe that’s what makes it feel that way. You mentioned research into reality several times. Obviously, a lot of these projects have been cooking in the labs for a long time. You’ve said many times over the past many, many years that you and I have talked about it that you think AI will be as profound as electricity. But you said something yesterday that I think adds to that, which is that we are in a new phase of the platform shift. People have talked about AI being a platform shift for quite a while, but that always has meant to me that there’s a user interface platform shift coming, right? We’re going to interact with computers in natural language in more natural ways, they’ll interact with us back in that same way, and everything will change. Is that the platform shift? Yeah, you are right. Each of these platform shifts changes many things on the I/O front. Nothing to do with Google I/O, just I/O in the traditional computer science sense. You could feel it. Yesterday, when I watched the Android XR… I’ve used them and played around with them, but watching it, with two people talking in different languages, you can envision the future one day where it’ll actually be seamless. In a way, you couldn’t have done it with phones, you couldn’t have done it without AI because there’s nothing in your way. You’re looking at the other person and talking, right? And that is an element of platform shift, but there are many more elements. This is the only platform where I think the actual platform is, over time, capable of creating, self-improving, and so on. In a way, we could have never talked about any other platform before, so that’s why I think it’s much more profound than the other platform shifts. It’ll allow people to create new things because, at each layer of the stack, there’s going to be profound improvements. And so I think that virtuous cycle you get in terms of how you can unleash this creative power to all of society, be it software engineers, be it creators — I think that is going to happen in a much more multiplicative way. So when I say it’s a next phase, I’m talking about that part too. Let me just make that more concrete for people. I think the last platform shift we all understand is the shift to mobile. That’s right. And that was, we’re going to have multi-touch, we’re going to have faster cell connections, we’re going to increase processing power that can go with you everywhere. And then there was a layer of applications that was enabled by all of those things. You can push a button, and a Toyota Camry will show up wherever you are in the world. It’s like a very powerful thing that requires all of those ideas. How would you describe the phase we’re in now compared to that? The phase of this, that first phase of AI was that the transformers work and the models work, and we can all see this capability. The second phase, what is it to you? Just imagine when the internet came, blogging became a thing. Pre-internet, very few people had a means by which they could put their thoughts out to the world. With the internet came a new medium, which allowed people to create and express themselves in a new way. With mobile came cameras, and you could shoot and you could create videos. Look at what’s happened with YouTube. For me, a similar part of this is that we are all talking about things like vibe coding. Yesterday, you saw Veo 3, so we are now in that phase. I think people are going to be able to create AI applications, you can call it, vibe coding, there are many names for it. But that power is yet to be unleashed. We are barely scratching the surface, and these models aren’t quite there. You can kind of do one-shot coding, but you really need to be a programmer to iterate and create something with polish, right? But that frontier is evolving pretty rapidly. So I think you’re going to see a new wave of things, just like mobile did. Just like the internet did. I came to Google at the time when AJAX was the revolution, the fact that the web became dynamic. You had things like Google Maps, Flickr, and Gmail, that all suddenly came into existence. But I think AI is going to turbocharge in a way we haven’t seen before. It feels like what you’re describing is that we’re in the phase where the products are developed, right? The capabilities were the first phase, and now we’re going to make some actual products. And more people can build products than ever before. That’s the multiplicative part I’m talking about. Not just this platform that helps you create more products. The process of creating, developing, etc., is going to be accessible to a much wider swath of humanity than ever before. I’m wondering, when you look at the landscape of products that exist now, most people experience AI in Gemini or ChatGPT as a chatbot. It’s a general-purpose interface to a bunch of knowledge that will talk to you. What products do you see that will have the same kind of impact as the Web 2.0 products you were talking about, besides the general-purpose chatbot? Well, obviously, you’ve seen a wave with coding IDEs, like that entire landscape is… I can’t even keep track of how many new companies have come into it, and people are using a lot of it. And yesterday we showed a bunch of partners with whom we are working. So that’s an area where AI is making the most progress. You’re seeing the application layer, at least in terms of code editors, really come into vogue. We’ve had success with NotebookLM. We launched Flow yesterday. Flow is a new [AI video] product that allows you to create and imagine. So those are all the applications we are doing. I think others are beginning to do it. People are working on legal assistance, and there are all kinds of startups. I was recently in a doctor’s office, and they have an AI that transcribes the whole thing, puts it all in reports, and so on. That’s an enterprise application layer. It kind of works completely differently from when I went on a visit two years ago. So all that change is happening across the board, but I think we are just in the early stages. You will see it play out over the next three to five years in a big way. Did you ask your doctor what model their transcription software is running on? [Laughs] No, I didn’t. No, I didn’t. One of the reasons I’m asking this, and I’m pushing on this, is that the huge investment in the capability from Google and others has to pay off in some products that return on that investment. NotebookLM is great. I don’t think it’s going to fully return on Google’s data center investment, let alone the investment in pure AI research. Do you see a product that can return on that investment at scale? Do you think in 2004 if you had looked at Gmail, which was a 20% project, which people were internally using as an email service, how would we be able to think about Gmail as what led us to do workspace, or get into the enterprise? I made a big bet on Google Cloud, which is tens of billions of dollars in revenue today. And so my point is that things build out over time. Think about the journey we have been on with Waymo. I think one of the mistakes people often make in a period of rapid innovation is thinking about the next big business versus looking at the underlying innovation and saying, “Can you build something and put out something which people love and use?” And out of which you do the next thing, and create value out of it. So when I look at it, AI is such a horizontal piece of technology across our entire business. It’s why it impacts not just Google search, but YouTube, Cloud, and all of Android. You saw XR, etc., Google Play, things like Waymo, and Isomorphic Labs, which is based on AlphaFold. So I’ve never seen one piece of technology that can impact and help us create so many businesses. AI is going to be so useful as an assistant. I think that people will be willing to pay for it, too. We are introducing subscription plans, and so there’s a lot of headroom ahead, I think. And obviously, that’s why we are investing, because we see that opportunity. Some of it will take time, and it may not always be immediately obvious. I gave the Waymo example. The sentiment on Waymo was quite negative three years ago. But actually, as a company, we increased our investment in Waymo at that time, right? Because you’re betting on the underlying technology and you’re seeing the progress of where it’s going. But these are good questions. In some ways, if you don’t realize the opportunities, that may constrain the pace of investment in this area, but I’m optimistic we’ll be able to unlock new opportunities. One reason I wanted to start here as the foundation of the conversation is that you showed off Android XR yesterday. You showed off some prototype glasses, and you have some partners making glasses. A lot of people think augmented reality glasses powered by AI will be the realization of the full platform shift, right? You will have an always-on assistant that can look at the world around you. You showed some of those demos yesterday. The form factor will change, and the interface will change. This will be marketed as big as smartphones were. How close do you think we are to that as a mainstream product? It was a nice reflective moment all the way back from Google Glass. Wearing the product, I think there’s a difference between goggles and glasses. Everyone at The Verge understands as well, but obviously, we are also shipping goggles. We have announced products with Samsung to come later this year. On the XR side, I’m excited about our partnership with Gentle Monster and Warby Parker. We’ll have products in the hands of developers this year, but I think those products will be pretty close to what people eventually see as final products. I’m excited. I think the pace is actually pretty palpable. I’d be shocked if you and I were sitting next year and I wasn’t wearing one of those when I’m doing this. Do you think that will be a mainstream iPhone-level replacement product? Because there’s a lot of hardware that needs to be developed along the way to pull that off. You’re wearing something on your face. I have a prescription. The bar is higher in terms of making the experience seamless enough that you’re willing to wear it on your face and enjoy it for all. I don’t necessarily think next year it will be as mainstream as what you’re talking about, but would millions of people be trying it? I think so, yeah. Both are true. I have to ask you… Just before we sat down, OpenAI announced that Jony Ive was selling a company he had started called “io,” and Ive and his design consultants in Lovefrom would take overall design. They didn’t announce a product, but they said it’s the future of computing and it’s coming next year. Do you anticipate more of that competition, that your competitors who don’t have a smartphone operating system will go even harder in this direction? I’m looking forward to an OpenAI announcement ahead of Google I/O, the night before. First of all, look, stepping back, I mean Jony Ive is one of a kind. You look at his track record over the years, I’ve met him only once or twice, but I’ve admired his work, obviously like so many of us. I think it’s exciting. This is why I feel like there’s so much innovation ahead, and I think people tend to underestimate this moment. In some ways, I always like to point out that when the internet happened, Google didn’t even exist. I think AI is going to be bigger than the internet. There are going to be companies, products, and categories created that we aren’t aware of today. I think the future looks exciting. I think there’s a lot of opportunity to innovate around hardware form factors at this moment with this platform shift. I’m looking forward to seeing what they do. We are going to be doing a lot as well. I think it’s an exciting time to be a consumer, it’s an exciting time to be a developer. I’m looking forward to it. Ive, in that video, described the phone and the laptop as legacy platforms, which is very interesting considering his own history. Are you all the way there that the phone and the laptop are legacy platforms? I think these things, if anything, I’ve found through this AI moment that I’m using the web a lot more, because it’s easier to create a Veo 3 video in my browser on a big screen, right? And so I think the way I’ve internalized this, computing will be available, and you don’t have to make these hard choices. Computing will become so essential to you. You’re going to have it in multiple ways around you when you need it, right? I use a phone, a tablet, a laptop, and I have my workstation. And so I have the breadth of it, but over time… It makes sense to me that at some point in the future, consuming content by pulling out this black glass display rectangle in front of you and looking at it is not the most intuitive way to do it, but I think it’s going to take some time. I feel like we could do a full hour just on Android tablets and where they could go. We’re going to come back for that. A big part of what you’re describing implicates search in really big ways, right? We’re going to be surrounded by information search, Gemini, or some future Google product. We’ll organize that information, take action for you across the web in some way, and you will have a companion. Maybe you only pull out your tablet to watch a video or something. A lot of what’s going on with search has downstream effects on the web, and downstream effects on information providers broadly. Last year, we spent a lot of time talking about those effects. Are you seeing that play out the way that you thought it would? It depends. I think people are consuming a lot more information, and the web is one specific format. We should talk about the web, but zooming back out, there are new platforms like YouTube and others. I think people are just consuming a lot more information, right? It feels like an expansionary moment. I think there are more creators, and people are putting out more content. And so people are generally doing a lot more. Maybe people have a little extra time on their hands, and so it’s a combination of all that. On the web, look, things that have been interesting and… We’ve had these conversations for a while. Obviously, in 2015, there was this famous meme, “The web is dead.” I always have it somewhere around, and I look at it once in a while. Predictions… It has existed for a while. I think the web is evolving pretty profoundly. I think that is true. When we crawl and look at the number of web pages available to us, that number has gone up by 45% in the last two years alone, right? That’s a staggering thing to think of. Can you detect if that volume increase is because more pages are generated by AI or not? This is the thing I may be worried about the most, right? It’s a good question. We generally have many techniques in search to try and understand the quality of a page, including whether it was machine-generated, etc. That doesn’t explain the trend we are seeing. Generally, there are more web pages, right? At an underlying level, I think that’s an interesting phenomenon. I think everybody as a creator like you are at The Verge, has to do everything in a cross-platform, cross-format way. I look at the quality of video content you put out, it’s very sophisticated and very different from how The Verge used to be, maybe five to 10 years ago, right? It has profoundly changed. I think things are becoming more dynamic, and cross-format. I think another thing people are underestimating with AI is that AI will make it zero friction to move from one format to another, right? Because our models are natively multimodal. We tease people’s imagination with audio overviews in NotebookLM, right? The fact that you can throw a bunch of documents at it, you have a podcast, and you can join and learn from it. I think this notion, the static moment of producing content by format, whereas… I think machines can help translate it. It’s almost like different languages and they can go seamlessly between. I think it’s one of the incredible opportunities to be unlocked right ahead. But maybe, I didn’t want to drift from the question we were having. Look, I think people are producing a lot of content, and I see consumers consuming a lot of content. And we see it in our products; others are seeing it too. That’s how I would probably answer at the highest level. The way I see it currently is that the web is at an all-time high as an application platform, right? The fact that Figma exists and is as successful as it is, and its primary interface as a web app is, I think, remarkable. A lot of the products you are talking about are expressed as web apps. Even some of the most interesting search results you showed yesterday are how Google would generate a custom web app for you and display it in a search result to do some data visualization. I think that’s all looking incredible. I think the web as a transaction platform is reaching new highs, especially with rulings that mean smartphone makers have to let people push transactions to the web. There’s something very interesting happening there. As a media platform, it feels like it’s at an all-time low, right? Do you mean the web as a media platform? The web as a media platform, as an information platform. If I were starting The Verge today with 11 of my co-founders and friends, we would start a TikTok channel, and we might start a YouTube channel. We would definitely not start a website with the dependencies we have as a website today. And that’s the dynamic that it feels like AI is pushing on even harder. I’m not fully sure I agree, right? I think if you were to go and restart The Verge again, I bet you would have an extraordinary web presence. At best, no, I’ve thought about this a lot. I think at best our web presence would look like a Substack or a Ghost or something, right? Maybe. I’m not fully sold on that, but you know the space. I acknowledge that you know that space better than I do. I don’t have that intuition, which you do here. But look, in fact, you say the web application platform is at an all-time high, but I’ve looked. I was vibe coding with Replit a few weeks ago. The power of what you’re going to be able to create on the web — we haven’t given that power to developers in 25 years. That is going to come ahead. It’s not exactly clear to me. Maybe today you’re looking at it and say, I wouldn’t put all the investment in because it looks like a lot of investment to do that. But that may not be true two years out, right? If you feel like you would create a TikTok channel, then maybe with 2% extra effort you could have a robust web presence. Why wouldn’t you, right? And so I’m not fully sold on it, but I think it’s a good question to ask. But you have to somehow reconcile that with the fact that overall, web traffic seems to be growing. We see more web pages. Somewhere, we have to explain all of that, too. The publishers, as they often do, responded to Google I/O announcements. So, the News Media Alliance, after AI mode was announced yesterday, I would say they’re very upset. Here’s a statement from the President of the News Media Alliance, “Links for the last redeeming quality of search that gave publishers traffic and revenue. Now, Google takes content by force and uses it with no return, no economic return. That’s the definition of theft.” And they go on to say the DOJ and lawsuits must address it. That’s pretty furious. That’s not a negotiation, right? That’s a “We just want this to stop.” How do you respond to that very loud set of people who say, “Yeah, okay, maybe it’s growing somewhere, but for us, it’s crushing our businesses.” First of all, through all the products, AI mode is going to have sources. And we are very committed as a direction, as a product direction to make... I think part of why people come to Google is to experience that breadth of the web and go in the direction they want to, right? So I view us as giving more context. Yes, there are certain questions that may get answers, but overall… And that’s the pattern we see today, right? And, if anything over the last year, it’s clear to us that the breadth of area we are sending people to is increasing. And so I expect that to be true with AI mode as well. But if it was increasing, wouldn’t they be less angry with you? You’re always going to have areas where people are robustly debating value exchanges, etc., like app developers and platforms. That’s not on the web, etc. There’s always going to be — when you’re running a platform — these debates. I would challenge, I think more than any other company, we prioritize sending traffic to the web. No one sends traffic to the web in the way we do. I look at other companies, newer emerging companies, where they openly talk about it as something they’re not going to do. We are the only ones who make it a high priority, agonize, and so on. We’ll engage, and we’ve always engaged. There are going to be debates through it all, but we are committed to, I’ve said this before, everything we do across all... You will see us five years from now sending a lot of traffic out to the web. I think that’s the product direction we are committed to. I think it’s what users look for when they come to Google, and the nature of it will evolve. But I am confident that that’s the direction we’ll continue taking. Is there public data that shows that AI overviews and AI mode actually send more traffic out than the previous search engine results page? The way we look at it is... I mean, obviously, we take a lot of... We are definitely sending traffic to a wider range of sources and publishers. And because just like we’ve done over 25 years, we’ve been through the same with featured snippets, the quality of... It’s higher-quality referral traffic, too. And we can observe it because the time that people spend is one metric. And there are other ways by which we measure the quality of our outbound traffic, and it’s also increasing. And overall, through this transition, I think AI is also growing, and the growth compounds over time. So whenever we have worked through these transitions, it ends up posted. That’s how Google has worked for 25 years, and we end up sending more traffic over time. So that’s how I would expect all this to play out. So why do you think that there is so much general economic turmoil on that side of the house? If you’re sending more traffic and the goal over time is to make sure that that works… We’re a year into it, and it doesn’t seem to have gotten better over there. No, look, we are sending traffic to a broader source of people. People may be surfacing more content, looking at more content, so someone may individually see less. There are all kinds of... At the end of the day, we are reflecting what users want. If you do the wrong thing, users won’t use our product and go somewhere else. And so you have all these dynamics underway, and I think we have genuinely… We took a long time designing AI overviews, and we are constantly iterating in a way that we prioritize this, sources, and sending traffic to the web. I mean, my criticism of this industry, just to be clear, is that everyone’s addicted to Google, and it would be better if they weren’t. But they’re addicted to Google, right? And they’re feeling it. And then on top of that, you see… You’ve mentioned several times that overall queries are increasing on Google surfaces, but they’re changing. They’re getting longer, they’re getting more complicated. AI mode might walk you through several steps. Maybe some people are searching on TikTok now. Eddie Cue on the stand in the trial the other day said that search in Safari for the last month dropped for the first time in 22 years. That’s a big stat. Obviously, your stock price was affected by it. There was a statement. Is that trend bearing out that the standard Google search is dropping from devices, and different kinds of searches are increasing? No. We’ve been very clear. We’re seeing overall query growth in search. But have you actually seen the drop in Safari? We have a comprehensive view of how we look at data across the board. There can be a lot of noise in search data, but everything we see tells us that we are seeing query growth, including across Apple’s devices and platforms. Specifically, I think we quantified the query growth from AI overviews. And what’s healthy is that the query growth is continuing to grow over time. So to step back, and this is what I’ve said before, it feels very far from a zero-sum game to me. I said this last year. I think people are... It’s interesting we spoke about TikTok, right? Think about how profound of a new product TikTok was. How has YouTube done since TikTok has come, right? You could ask all these questions there. Why is it that TikTok arrives and YouTube has grown? And so I think what we always underestimate in these moments is that people are engaging more, doing more with it. We are improving our products. And so that’s how I would think about these moments. Let me just broaden that out to agents. I watched Demis Hassabis yesterday. He was on stage with Sergey Brin and Alex Kantrowitz asked him, “What does the web look like in 10 years?” And Demis said, “I don’t know that an agent-first web looks anything like the web that we have today. I don’t know that we have to render web pages for agents the way that we have to see them.” That kind of implies that the web will turn into a series of databases for various agents to go and ask questions to, and then return those answers. And I’ve been thinking about this in the context of services like Uber, DoorDash, and Airbnb. Why would they want to participate in that and be abstracted away for agents to use the services they’ve spent a lot of time and money building? Two things, though. First, there’s a lot to unpack, a fascinating topic. The web is a series of databases, etc. We build a UI on top of it for all of us to conceive. This is exactly what I wanted, “the web is a series of databases.” It is. But I think I listened to the Demis and Sergey conversation yesterday. I enjoyed it. I think he’s saying for an agent-first web, for a web that is interacting with agents, you would think about how to make that process more efficient. Today, you’re running a restaurant, people are coming, dining and eating, and people are ordering takeout and delivery. Obviously, for you to service the takeout, you would think about it differently than all the tables, the clothing, and the furniture. But both are important to you. You could be a restaurant that decides not to participate in the takeout business. I’m only going to focus on the dining experience. You’re going to have some people that are vice versa. I’m going to say, I’m going to go all in on this and run a different experience. So, to your question on agents… I think of agents as a new powerful format. I do think it’ll happen in enterprises faster than in consumer. In the context of an enterprise, you have a CIO who’s able to go and say, “I really don’t know why these two things don’t talk to each other. I am not going to buy more of this unless you interoperate with this.” I think it’s part of why you see, on the enterprise side, a lot more agentic experiences. On the consumer side, I think what you’re saying is a good point. People have to think about and say, “What is the value for me to participate in this world?” And it could come in many ways. It could be because I participated in it, and overall, my business grows. Some people may feel that it’s disintermediating, and doesn’t make sense. I think all of that can happen, but users may work with their feet. You may find some people are supporting the agent experience, and your life is better because of it. And so you’re going to have all these dynamics, and I think they’re going to try and find an equilibrium somewhere. That’s how everything evolves. I mean, I think the idea that the web is a series of databases and we change the interface… First of all, this is the most Decoder conversation that we’ve ever had. I’m very happy with it. But I had Dara [Khosrowshahi] from Uber on the show. I asked him this question from his perspective, and his answer attracts yours broadly. He said, first, we’ll do it because it’s cool and we’ll see if there’s value there. And if there is, he’s going to charge a big fee for the agent to come and use Uber. Because losing the customer for him, or losing the ability to upsell or sell a subscription, none of that is great. The same is true for Airbnb. I keep calling it the DoorDash problem. DoorDash should not be a dumb pipe for sandwiches. They’re actually trying to run a business, and they want the customer relationship. And so if the agents are going across the web and they’re looking at all these databases and saying, okay, this is where I get food from, and this is where I get cars from, and this is where I book… I think the demo was booking a vacation home in Spanish, and I’m going to connect you to that travel agent. Is it just going to be tolls that everyone pays to let the agents work? The CIO gets to just spend money to solve the problem. He says, “I want this capability from you. I’m just going to pay you to do it.” The market, the consumer market, doesn’t have that capability, right? Well, look, all kinds of models may emerge, right? I can literally envision 20 different ways this could work. Consumers could pay a subscription for agents, and the agents could revenue share back. So that is the CIO-like use case you are talking about, that’s possible. We can’t rule that out. I don’t think we should underestimate... People may actually see more value in participating in it. I think this is... It’s tough to predict, but I do think that over time, if you’re removing friction and improving user experience, it’s tough to bet against those in the long run. And so I think if you are lowering friction for it and then people are enjoying using it, somebody’s going to want to participate in it and grow their business. And would brands want to be in retailers? Why don’t they sell directly today? Why won’t they do that? Because retailers provide value in the middle. And why do merchants take credit cards? Why... I’m just saying. So there are many parts, and you find equilibrium because merchants take credit cards so they see more business as part of taking credit cards than not, which justifies the increased cost of taking credit cards. It may not be the perfect analogy, but I think there are all these kinds of effects going around, and so... But what you’re saying is true. Some of this will slow progress in agents just because we all are excited about Agent2Agent (A2A) and Model Context Protocol (MCP)... And we think no, some of it will slow progress, but I think it’ll be very dynamic. Yeah. Yeah. There are other pressures on Google. There are antitrust pressures. The government would like you to sell Chrome. Can you do all the things you want to do if you’re made to sell Chrome? I don’t want to comment on... We are in a legal process. I look at having been directly involved in building Chrome. I look at... I think there are very few companies that would’ve... We not only improved our product, but we also improved the state of the web by building Chrome. We open-sourced it. We provided Chromium. Everyone else has access to the browser. So I think the amount of R&D, the amount of innovation we put into it, the investments in security, etc., we do, so I think we- But if you’re made to sell it, can you do all the things that you want to do? I don’t think that’s the scenario we’re looking at, but stepping back… Look, I think as a company, we think of ourselves as a deeply foundational technology company, which then translates into products that touch billions of people. So we do it across many, many things. And so, of course, I think, look, as a company, we’re going to continue investing and doing our best to innovate and build a successful business in all scenarios. So this is how I would answer it. The Trump administration is extremely transactional, I would say. The tech industry has a new relationship with Trump in his second term. You were at the inauguration. Have you had conversations about what a settlement might look like and what the Trump administration might demand to make these problems go away? We’ve engaged with the DOJ, like we did over the years, in the context of all the cases we have. So that’s how we normally do these conversations. Trump has very publicly said he doesn’t like his search ranking, and he wants it changed in some way. Would you ever adjust the search ranking for Donald Trump? No. Look, we have a... I can’t... Today, the way Google Search works is that I cannot... No person at Google can influence the ranking algorithm. AI mode is different, right? We’ve seen system prompts adjusted in very chaotic ways from some of your competitors. Is that something that you would be open to in a world where you’re serving the full answer? Would you adjust the AI mode responses in response to political pressure? No. Because we’ve certainly seen in Grok and others, the system prompts change the answers in dramatic ways. The way we do ranking is sacrosanct to us. We’ve done it for over 25 years. We make a lot of... There are a lot of ranking signals we take into account and stuff. And if there’s broad feedback from people that something isn’t working, we will look at it systematically and try and make changes, but we don’t look at individual cases and change the rankings. When you think about those sources of information, one of the things that I have been thinking about a lot is, I don’t know, how the CDC web pages have changed a lot recently. Diversity, equity, and inclusion language has been removed from pages across the government. Those used to be very high-ranking sources in Google Search. We just implicitly trusted the CDC’s web pages in some ways. Are you re-evaluating that? How there might be misinformation on some of these pages that then gets synthesized into AI results? Oh, it’s a misunderstanding of how search works. We don’t individually evaluate the authoritativeness of a page right then. It’s what our signals do. Obviously, our signals are multiple orders of magnitude more complicated than PageRank today. But to use PageRank as an example, we weren’t the ones determining how authoritative a page is. It’s how other pages were linking to it, like an academic citation, etc. So we are not making those decisions today. And so I don’t see that changing. As you synthesize more of the answers, do you think you’re going to have to take more responsibility for the results? We are giving context around it, but we’re still anchoring it in the sources we find. But we’ve always felt a high bar at Google. I mean, last year when we launched AI Overviews, I think people were adversarially querying to find errors, and the error rate was one in 7 million for adversarial queries, and so... But that’s the bar we’ve always operated at as a company. And so I think to me, nothing has changed. Google operates at a very high bar. That’s the bar we strive to meet, and our search page results are there for everyone to see. With that comes natural accountability, and we have to constantly earn people’s trust. So that’s how I would approach it. What do you think the marker is for the next phase of the platform shift after this one? We opened by talking about how we’re in a second phase. What’s the marker for the final phase, or the third phase? Of the platform shift, do you mean? Yeah. Of the AI platform? What are you looking for as the next marker? I think the real thing about AI, which I think is why I’ve always called it more profound, is self-improving technology. Having watched AlphaGo start from scratch, not knowing how to play Go, and within a couple of hours or four hours, be better than top-level human players, and in eight hours, no human can ever aspire to play against it. And that’s the essence of the technology, obviously in a deep way. I think there’s so much ahead on the opportunity side. I’m blown away by the ability to discover new drugs, completely change how we treat diseases like cancer over time, etc. The opportunity is there. The creative power, which I talked about, which we’re putting in everyone’s hands, the next generation of kids, everyone can program and will... If you think of something, you can create it. I don’t think we have comprehended what that means, but that’s going to be true. The part where the next phase of the shift is going to be really meaningful is when this translates into the physical world through robotics. So that aha moment of robotics, I think, when it happens, that’s going to be the next big thing we will all grapple with. Today they’re all online and you’re doing things with it, but on one hand… Today, I think of Waymo as a robot. So we are running around driving a robot, but I’m talking about a more general-purpose robot. And when AI creates that magical moment with robotics, I think that’ll be a big platform shift as well. Yeah. I’m looking forward to it. Next year we’re going to do this with glasses and robots. It’s going to be great. [Laughs] We’ll give it a shot. Thank you so much, Sundar. All right. Thanks, Nilay.

This article first appeared on kyndinfo.notion.site. For more more information, updates, and additional resources, please see here. I’ve been wanting to write books that are like introductory science texts but not superficial. Books that go beyond pop science explanations but aren’t dry and dense like academic texts. Take quantum physics as an example. A pop science book might explain that the world is made of tiny particles, even smaller than atoms, and that these particles are also waves. Very intriguing. But after reading it, you realize that you still don’t actually understand how to make sense of wave-particle duality, how it really works, or what it means mathematically. So I turn to a college-level book, thinking, “This will give me the answers.” Instead, I find a wall of formalism. Dense derivations, little motivation, and an assumption that I already know what’s important. These books explain the details, but they don’t help me much, not having a real math or science background. Having said this, I’ve been struggling to write a book or article that’s truly for beginners. Many of my past articles were written for relative beginners, often based on lectures, workshops, or explanatory documents I’ve shared with colleagues and friends. I’ve been trying to keep them more engaging rather than feel like dry textbooks. But at the same time, they are not really for beginners. Many of them assume a certain level of prior knowledge, since it is a massive effort to build up all the knowledge from scratch. There are already great resources out there. For example, I don’t think I should write yet another book on vector math, and I’m not the best person to do that. So after contemplating this, I’ve decided to let go of the idea of perfect thoroughness or consistency, at least for now. Chasing that feels like an overwhelming amount of work without yielding much more of what the world might be missing. Instead, what I find could be more fun and uniquely valuable is externalizing the maps in my mind. The overviews, the relationships between key concepts, and the motivations behind them. As always, these are also an exercise for myself. They are like notes to organize and structure ideas, which might one day evolve into a more structured book. At the same time, I’m trying to create something that helps readers orient themselves better. To provide a sense of where things fit, what’s important, and what gaps they might need to fill in from somewhere else. There are 8 sections in this article covering various perspectives.

In an everyday sense, space feels like a void for objects and matter to fill. We are all in space and move within space. It seems like a backdrop that exists independently of everything inside it. That’s what Newton thought too. He wrote: Absolute space, in its own nature, without regard to anything external, remains always similar and immovable. But Newton also thought that even if absolute space exists, it is practically inconceivable to us. Where in the absolute are we? We’d never know. So he continues: Relative space is some movable dimension or measure of the absolute spaces; which our senses determine by its position to bodies. What he is saying is that we can only measure position relative to something. When we walk, we know we move relative to the ground, or the Earth. The revolution of the Earth is the movement relative to the Sun. Then the Sun or the solar system moves relative to the galaxy. From a relativistic perspective, both geocentrism and heliocentrism can be seen as correct in their own reference frames, but neither is absolutely correct. It’s just that heliocentrism provides a much simpler model for the motion of planets. However, there is a huge gap between those who only believe in geocentrism and those who discovered heliocentrism, or dogmatists and inquirers. “Orb – on the movement of earth” is a great historical fiction on this topic. We want to draw stuff on a computer. To do that, we need to have three things: an origin (a reference point to measure the position relatively from), axes along which we measure distances, and a unit to define what distance corresponds to a number 1. In theory, you can pick them freely, but most software has its own default coordinate system. For 2D drawing, like Photoshop, Illustrator, Figma, P5.js, and openFrameworks, the origin is usually the top-left corner of a canvas, and axes are horizontal (x) and vertical (y). The unit is usually a pixel or the device unit. For example, on a Retina display Mac, 1 point corresponds to 2 or 3 (or other numbers depending on your settings) physical pixels. This factor is set so that the numbers you choose appear about the same size perceptually regardless of the actual resolution of the device. A bit more about “perceptually the same size” : for example, text of size “14” is usually rendered smaller on mobile devices than on a laptop, and much bigger on a TV, because these devices are designed to be seen from different viewing distances. There is no perfect formula for this, but most manufacturers converge in the same range, so you don’t have to worry too much about each device separately. I said “default” because in many cases, you can manipulate the space, or rather the coordinate system. In design tools, you can drag the canvas and zoom in and out. Programming frameworks often provide methods to translate, scale and rotate the space, such as p5.js’s translate(), scale(), rotate() functions, or you can write your own functions to process the coordinates. You can also skew the space. Axes are usually selected to cross at 90° but this isn’t necessary. As long as they are independent, meaning they are not parallel, you can express a position uniquely by selecting one value for each of the axes. The demo below from the Mapping page demonstrates affine transformation, which is a simple method to enable these kinds of coordinate transformations. Once you have a coordinate system, you can move things around in this space. Newtonian physics is the perfect stating point. In Newtonian physics, you start from a position, then apply velocity to move it, and apply acceleration to change the velocity. All of these are expressed by vectors, which is basically just a few numbers (called components) put together. Expressing them as vectors makes it much easier to handle them, as opposed to manipulating the values per axis, and there are several very useful operations defined for vectors that you cannot avoid because they’re too good. Newton and VectorsVector Operations Of course, what comes after 2D is 3D. Moving up one dimension is just simple. You define a position is a vector with 3 components instead of 2. Do the same for the velocity, acceleration, etc. as long as they are defined as vectors, the math stays basically the same. What is different, and can be a lot more challenging, is rendering. Because your canvas is 2D, you cannot just place things defined in a 3D space on it. You need to translate the points in 3D space to 2D space somehow. This is called projection, which dates back to the 15th century during Brunelleschi’s time. Projection and 3D Rendering A post shared by kyndinfo (@kyndinfo) Also, to make things look 3D, lighting or shading (basically the same thing — you add light to the scene, which creates shade too) plays an important role. Without light and shade, a sphere would look like just a circle. Shadows casting from one object onto another will clarify their spatial relationship. Light It is your choice of style though. You can choose to draw your scene flat and cartoonish. You can go up to higher dimensions. No matter how much you go up, vectors will help you keeping the math the same. Thinking about higher dimensions not usually for graphics, but any data that can be represented with multiple numeric parameters are thought as a vector in multi dimensional space, with each parameter corresponding to a single axes. Then you can apply familiar concepts and operations to the data, such as addition, multiplication, calculating distance and angle, etc. In fact, large language models (LLM) represent concepts like “dog,” “human,” “run,” “happy,” etc. as points in a mega-multidimensional space (like, 3072 dimensions), and you can do math between them to, for example, measure conceptual distance or similarity between two words or sentences. Getting familiar with this is critical for understanding how current AI models work. Dimensions Colors can be represented with a series of numbers, such as R, G, and B. So they are vectors, and they live in a space. In fact, people have invented many different spatial models to represent colors “accurately” for different purposes. Imagining the relationship of colors spatially helps grasping them holistically and intuitively. Changing the hue is rotation, brightening is ascending, etc. Each different color model organizes colors differently, offering different mental models. Choosing the right model for your purpose can be critical for making your work easy and look good. Colors and Numbers In a space, you can measure distances between points. The most common way is the Euclidean distance, which is basically the length of the straight line between two points. In math, there are various kinds of spaces and some of them don’t have the concept of distance. But that is not the only distance we care about. How do you measure the distance from Tokyo to São Paulo? What you want is probably not a straight line distance between two points, but a curved length along the surface of the Earth. This is called spherical geometry. How about a checkerboard? How do you measure distances between two squares? Perhaps the number of moves it takes? Various distances The concept of distance becomes important in various cases, for example in finding the shortest path to move characters along in game design, or dividing territories based on the distances. Visualizing Distances In computer graphics, functions that returns the distance from a point to the surface of object, called signed distance functions, or SDF are often used for 3D rendering. Signed distance functions So, what is space, after all? The answer depends. For most of our purposes when sketching something with code, Newtonian or Euclidean spaces provide the most intuitive and familiar way of thinking about space — flat, predictable, and measurable with straightforward distances and angles. But this is neither the only space nor the true shape of space. It’s not the true shape of space because Einstein’s general relativity describes spacetime as a curved, four-dimensional manifold. Meanwhile, quantum physics reveals that at the smallest scales, space and time behave in probabilistic, discontinuous, and often counterintuitive ways. Scientists have shown that our naive, everyday understanding of space and time breaks down at both the micro and macro scales. It’s not the only space because mathematicians have been generalizing and expanding the concept of “space.” Riemannian geometry broadens the idea of geometry to include uniform and non-uniform curved spaces, including Euclidean, spherical, hyperbolic, and other geometries we touched upon in the distance discussion above. Space isn’t even just about distance or geometry. Topology focuses on how shapes are connected, regardless of size or distance. Mathematics even defines spaces that aren’t intuitively spatial at all, like the space of all polynomials of a certain degree, where the focus is on the coefficients rather than the shape or a curve. If you’re interested, go forward and explore these fascinating concepts. Color is a fascinating topic that lies between science and human perception. Physically, we know how humans perceive colors. We have photoreceptors called cones in our eyes that react to different frequencies of light, and the levels of stimuli to these three types of cones determine what color we see. The coverage of each type of cone roughly matches with the spectrum of red, green, and blue; that’s why RGB displays can show us various colors even though they have only three colors of light-emitting elements. Spectrum and Cones However, this model doesn’t necessary explain what we actually experience. For example, the violet and red at both ends of the spectrum are actually continuous, with purple in between them. We see different brightness depending on the hue even when the amount of physical light is the same (in general, yellow looks much brighter than blue). We even associate different feelings, emotions, and meanings to the colors. People have been creating different models to describe colors. These are roughly divided into two categories: ones that are mainly derived from physical properties, and ones are more based on the ways we normally describe colors. The first challenge in systematizing colors is that different people have different responses to the spectrum of colors. To find a sort of average, called the standard (colorimetric) observer, an experiment called Wright-Guild color matching was conducted. The basic idea is that the participant is presented with a monochromatic color, which is a color with a single frequency of light, and asked to reproduce the same color by mixing three primary colors (red, green, blue) to match with a target color. The tricky part is that the three physical lights can’t reproduce every color. The participants could match a lot of the target colors just by adjusting the brightness of each primary. But for some colors, they couldn’t get it right unless they actually subtracted one of the primary lights. There isn’t such a thing called negative light, so they solved this by adding the “negative” light to the target color side instead of the mixing side. To better understand this, look at the chart above again. Because each cone covers a relatively broad range, there is no light that can stimulate them independently. There are inevitably certain balances of cone stimulations that can’t be achieved using just a combination of three lights. They eventually transformed the data into something called the CIE 1931 XYZ color space, which is basically a remapping of the RGB measurements to get rid of the negative values by picking new “primaries” that were more imaginary concepts than actual lights. CIE Color spaces Most color models today are based on this CIE color space, meaning that the values in a system can be converted to values in XYZ. The RGB color model that we use on computers today completely fits within the XYZ color space (because by definition, XYZ space has all the human-perceivable colors and even more). Some other ways of describing colors are based on the ways we talk about colors. When we see colors, we say which kind of colors they are (reddish, yellowish), how bright or dark they are, how saturated or vivid, or dull or grayish, etc. The Munsell color system is a system to break down colors by three attributes: hue (such as red, blue, and green), value (lightness), and chroma (vividness or purity of the color). The many color models we use on computers are similar to Munsell’s model, but are designed to be able to be mapped to the RGB values on the screen and thus to XYZ values. Various Color Models These models allow us to compute colors. For example, we can add, subtract, multiply, or rotate colors. What operations make sense and the results you get vary from model to model, and it is important to select a model for your purpose. Computing Colors Being able to process colors to get the desired tone is a critical skill in image and video production. Color Processing Mixing colors is its own deep world. There are so many ways to mix colors. If you are familiar with tools like Photoshop, you probably know there are a bunch of “blending modes” such as add, multiply, screen, overlay, etc. These are different ways to calculate a new color based on the input colors. Most of them are defined with RGB color model. Using the other models can yield different results. Mixing colors in the real world is even more complex, because the color mixing in the real world is the result of various materials reflecting, refracting, and absorbing light. There isn’t a single formula to solve this, but the Kubelka-Munk model is known for emulating real paints consisting of a medium and different colored particles inside. Mixing Colors Light striking the retina lets us see colors. To fully understand how colors happen to us, we must understand how light travels from its source to our eyes, bouncing off surfaces while reflecting and refracting along the way. Reflection and Refraction When the light hits an object, the object absorbs some of the light and reflects the others. On transparent objects, some also passes through. Different materials behave differently. If the material absorbs red and yellow spectrums of light more than blue, then the object will look blue. Rough surfaces will scatter the light in all different directions, thus you don’t see clear reflections of other objects on them, while smooth surfaces will mirror the surroundings more clearly. There are many different methods to simulate this process, from very rough to more accurate approaches. Studying these methods can help you understand how we see colors on objects and better control the colors and appearance of your rendering. Illuminating objects The last section is just an example of using these theories in practice. This installation for KAF Digital space mixes several methods discussed above to fill the space with colors that have the more meditative quality of Fangor’s oil painting, appearing less digital and flashy. A post shared by kyndinfo (@kyndinfo) Filling Space with Colors One of the most fun parts of sketching with code is that it’s not static. Let’s draw both in space and time. How do you move a thing? Just push it. Sir Isaac Newton basically said that things stay at rest in the same position, or keep moving at the same velocity until you apply force to accelerate them. Position, velocity, acceleration, and force are the most fundamental concepts to understand physical motion. Emulating these concepts is extremely simple: frame by frame, just add force to acceleration to change it, then acceleration to velocity, then velocity to position. Newtonian mechanics Position, velocity, acceleration, and force are in relationships of differentiation and integration. Differentiation is the rate of change, and integration is the accumulation of changes. For example, velocity is a quantity that describes how much position will change at a certain moment, and position is the result of velocity being applied and accumulated over time. These subjects might have been annoying in math class. But the foundational ideas are quite simple, and luckily in sketching motion with code, you usually don’t have to solve any equations, but instead can use a very rough approximation called numerical integration, which breaks down the changes into simple additions per small amount of time. You probably have been using this method already without knowing it, for example, the Newtonian physics simulations above are based on a numerical approach instead of mathematically accurate methods. DifferentiationIntegration The proper way to solve differentiation and integrations by solving equation is called analytical solution. Then the approximation by dividing the changes over a small amount of time is called numerical approximation. As mentioned above, the latter is the most common and actually more useful in so many cases, but understanding the relationship between these two approaches is important since both have their own merits and drawbacks. The numeric approach is preferred not just because it’s easier, but because it’s also more flexible. Solving motion through equations is like predicting the future. Once solved, you know exactly what will happen at any moment. But it’s often difficult or impossible to account for all variables. Even calculating the movement of three objects drawn by gravity becomes unpredictable. Any system involving external factors, like human interaction, cannot be determined in advance. Since the numeric approach calculates changes bit by bit (very often frame by frame), it is pretty easy to react to unpredictable changes by updating parameters in real time. The prediction of the gravitational motion of three objects, made popular by Cixin Liu’s bestseller The Three-Body Problem, is called the Three-Body Problem. While solving the two-body problem (like the Earth and Moon) is relatively straightforward and has a neat, predictable solution, the three-body problem is usually chaotic and unpredictable. A common drawback with numerical methods is their inaccuracy. Because these methods approximate smooth motion through discrete changes, the results can go slightly off from physically accurate motion. There are several ways to minimize this problem. The most popular approaches are called the Improved Euler method and Runge-Kutta method (the Euler method is actually a special case of Runge-Kutta). Continuous Time and Discrete Time Simulations are, by nature, hard to predict precisely, because that’s the point. They’re meant to create or mimic phenomena that can’t be fully described in advance. We simulate weather, for example, because we don’t know exactly what will happen. But this can be a problem when you want more direct control over how things move, where they end up, and when. Also sometimes, you may even want to break the laws of physics. Great animators and motion designers often exaggerate movement and timing, bending or ignoring realism to create something more expressive or impactful. A very common technique in motion design is called tweening, short for in-betweening. You start from defining a start and end state, then fill the intermediate frames by interpolating between them. The word comes from the days when animators hand-drew the frames that filled the gap between key poses (many still do — some expressions simply can’t be captured any other way). In computer animation, we often use easing functions to control these transitions. Easing functions connect one value to another, changing the pace in between, like slowing in, speeding out, bouncing, etc. In motion design, you can think of an easing function as a kind of mapping between time and another value, such as position, scale, or opacity. Interpolation and Animation Things don’t just move freely in the real world. On Earth, everything is bound by gravity. Our body movement is constrained by the structure of bones and muscles, but this constraint is what lets us move around and lift things using our bones as levers. Adding constraints to objects is a way to add reality to the motion. Verlet Integration is a way to create simple physics simulations by connecting dots with sticks which constrains the distance between two points. Though simple, this technique is very flexible, and by combining multiple points and sticks, you can create various kinds of objects from rigid bodies to soft string-like objects. Building Ragdolls To control movement more precisely and intentionally, you might want to study kinematics. Forward kinematics and inverse kinematics are common techniques used in robotics, games, and so on to describe the motion of jointed parts, such as mechanical arms or human bodies. Both methods handle structures made of multiple segments and joints to connect them. Forward kinematics starts from the root of the connection and propagates the posture going forward to the end. You directly manipulate the rotation of each joint, and that will determine the overall movement. Kinematics Inverse kinematics is more goal-driven. You define where you want the endpoint to be, then the algorithm figures out the rotation of each joint that makes the desired result happen. Kinematics Motion of objects and life in the real world is often unpredictable, and you can always introduce some randomness to your design. The demo below shows four random walkers with different methods to generate random values. In real applications, you might want to combine more predictable methods like above with some randomness. Depending on your goal, play around and find a sweet spot. Taming Randomness While we’ve explored how to move objects and characters, there’s one more crucial but invisible actor to consider: the camera. How you frame the scene and position the viewpoint dramatically shapes the final result. Camera in Action When you sketch with motion, you’re not just placing things in space but you are giving them life in time. Whether you follow the rules of physics, break them for expressiveness, or invent your own systems, motion opens a lot possibilities for exploration and creativity. If you’re curious, keep experimenting and see where the next movement leads. A post shared by kyndinfo (@kyndinfo) Human perception has evolved over a long time to give us useful information about the world. But what we perceive is only a little sliver of what’s actually out there. For example, light, or electromagnetic waves more broadly, spans a vast range of frequencies, but we can only see a small part of that spectrum. The reason we probably settled on this specific range is that it was good enough to detect and distinguish everyday objects, plants, and animals, helping us survive and navigate our environment. Another reason is more physical: many parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, like X-rays or gamma rays, tend to pass through objects or scatter unpredictably. That makes it difficult, if not impossible, for animals to evolve organs that can capture them. The way we perceive different physical phenomena doesn’t always match their actual physical nature. Light and sound are both waves, but we almost never experience them as vibrations (except for very low-frequency sounds). In both cases, frequency affects what we perceive, but in very different ways. Sound frequencies are perceived as pitch, and we describe them as “high” or “low.” On the other hand, different frequencies of light appear to us as different hues of colors without any sense of high or low frequency. Studying perception is fascinating because every person’s experience of the world is different. No one else sees exactly the same colors you see. Your perception exists only within you and doesn’t exist without you. For this reason, the study of perception can’t be purely objective. We have to ask people how they feel. In fact, the color models we use today are based on data collected from many people comparing colors and describing how similar or different they appear. Some people may extend this to say the world doesn’t exist without you, or it is impossible to understand someone else. Let’s not go there yet. How we perceive and use color is shaped by many different factors. First, our biology. As we touched upon earlier, we perceive different light frequencies as different hues, not as a one-dimensional gradient from red to violet, but arranged in a circle. This is because we perceive colors based on the balance between three receptors (cones) for different ranges of frequencies, each roughly corresponding to red, green, and blue. The actual light is a mixture of different frequencies. If a light contains more blue and red but less green, we perceive it as purple, a color that doesn’t actually exist in the spectrum itself — below red is infrared, and above violet is ultraviolet. This reminds us that color might be more about what’s happening inside us than something intrinsic to the light itself. Colors are also cultural and social. Despite not knowing exactly what other people are seeing, we tend to generally agree on how we see colors. We can think of this in terms of semantics, such as red or yellow-and-black stripes for danger, to feelings and aesthetics like “blue feels cool” and “green is relaxing,” to what feels pleasing versus jarring. These associations likely started from nature, where certain objects and phenomena have specific frequencies, and then were influenced by cultural aspects, as certain colors are used repeatedly in specific ways to reinforce our associations. For example, unripe fruits are usually green, and they turn yellow, orange, or red when they are ready to eat, and we’ve been reinforcing these associations by using these warm colors on food packages, signboards, etc. Our view on colors has also been significantly influenced and constrained by our tools. People have been working hard to reproduce and create various colors—from using plant-based dyes, to making expensive gemstones into paints, chemical and synthetic compounds, to analog and digital displays, and even nanotechnologies to create structural colors (such as iridescence). As colors became more available, they got more involved in our culture and even economies, creating trend cycles of colors to drive consumption. The fact that people don’t see colors in the same way cannot be emphasized enough. It is estimated that there are approximately 300 million people in the world with color vision deficiency. I’d even hesitate to call it a ‘deficiency’—it’s really just a different way of seeing. We often use charts like the one below to simulate different perceptions (the demo is emulating deuteranopia). This probably does a good job of illustrating where people may have difficulty distinguishing colors, but this is not representing the world they’re seeing. It’s not true to say the world appears mostly yellow and blue to people with deuteranopia. Representing someone’s vision for someone else is impossible, but at least understanding how we see colors and how to manipulate them systematically can help us imagine and approach this challenging and fascinating problem. Computing Colors All of this shows that color perception is a complex mix of physical phenomena, evolutionary quirks, instinct, culture, and tools from pigments to pixels. And all of it is, in a way, somewhat arbitrary. It’s just the way the world and we humans happened to turn out. Depending on the angle you look from, you can describe color in many different ways. That’s why we have so many color systems and models. We are only scratching the surface of this topic in Colors and Numbers, but there are tons more that we can discuss. I recommend the following book for the history of color theories and their use. The History of Colour: A Universe of Chromatic Phenomena This comprehensive, beautiful book delves deep into the complex but fascinating story of our relationship with colour throughout human history. Amazon Sound is also a wave. Unlike color, we can actually feel its frequency more directly, though we don’t always notice it as physical vibration. Lower frequencies feel “low,” and higher frequencies feel “high.” This height of sound is called pitch. Interestingly, we don’t experience pitch as just a straight line—it feels more like a spiral. For example, if you start at 440 Hz (the A note) and go up, you’ll eventually hit another A at 880 Hz at exactly double the frequency. It’s not the same sound, but we hear it as the same note, just in a higher octave. Western music typically divides the octave is into 12 pitches, each spaced evenly in terms of frequency ratio. Other musical cultures divide the octave differently. Some use more notes, some fewer, but the concept of the octave itself shows up pretty much everywhere. Pitch and Frequency Not just pitch, we can also tell sounds apart based on their timbre, which is like the texture or color of a sound. That’s how you can tell apart different sounds, like a bird chirping, car horns, or instruments like piano and trumpet. In Japanese, timbre is called 音色 (on-shoku), which literally means “sound color.” Both pitch and timbre are tied to the physical characteristics of the thing that’s making the sound. Let’s take a guitar string as an example. The pitch depends on its length and weight. The longer or heavier the string, the lower the pitch. But the sound a string makes isn’t just one pure frequency. When you pluck it, the string vibrates in many ways at once. The main pitch is called the fundamental frequency, but parts of the string also vibrate in smaller sections—halves, thirds, quarters, etc. These create harmonics or overtones, which are simple multiples of the base frequency. This happens with any object, though the mix of frequencies might be a lot messier. Just like colors are usually a blend of frequencies, sounds are too. But unlike color, where a certain frequency always looks like the same hue (e.g., 440 THz light always looks red), sound doesn’t work that way. A guitar sounds like a guitar no matter what note it plays, because its timbre comes from the relationship between the overtones, not the absolute frequencies themselves. That’s why we can tell a violin from a flute, or recognize someone’s voice, or know what kind of object made a noise, based on how that sound’s overtones are structured regardless of the frequency. You can sing a high note or low note, and you will still sound like you. It is interesting to think about this from an evolutionary standpoint. Our hearing has evolved to react to frequency ratios probably because that was useful in identifying different sources, people, animals, objects, etc. This sensitivity also lets us enjoy the different tones of sound and the relationships between different pitches of sound, which is known as harmony in music. Understanding wave properties helps us better comprehend the relationship between physical vibrations and the sounds that we hear, and sketch ideas playing around with and visualizing sound. Sound visualizationSine waves and Additive SynthesisFourier Series Something that I think is understated, but has been a very useful insight for sketching and designing things, is that the relationship between physical quantities and their impact on human perception is logarithmic in many cases. For example, the strength of the light we feel is depends on the number of photons our eyes catch. But twice the photons doesn’t mean it feels twice as bright. Physically, a sunny day outdoors can have 200 times more light than a well-lit office. But does it feel 200 times brighter? Probably not. The same goes for sound. Loudness is related to the energy of the sound, which is directly related to the amplitude of the sound wave. But again, the relationship to the way we feel is not direct. A subway might have 100 times more sound energy than someone talking, but it doesn’t feel 100 times louder. This can be seen in a couple of ways. Life had to survive across wildly different conditions, like daylight and moonlight. So our perception systems likely evolved to compress all that information into a manageable scale. The other way to look at it is that when numbers are huge, small changes matter less. Imagine you’re stuck in traffic — a 10-minute delay feels huge when your trip is only 15 minutes, but it doesn’t matter as much if you’re going for a 5-hour drive. Similarly, adding a candle doesn’t help much when you’re already under the sun, while it can make a huge difference when you’re in a cave. Physical values and human perception Humans could have evolved more sensitive eyes like cats to see in darkness, but we haven’t. Perhaps our ancestors were not as nocturnal as cats, or they weren’t nocturnal because they didn’t have cats’ eyes. Either way, we managed to survive.There is an important nuance here. Life doesn’t evolve with purpose. A statement like “giraffes acquired long necks in order to eat leaves high up” is misleading. The reality is more like something random happened to the genes, and that change happened to give the genes themselves a better chance to be passed on to following generations. This taps into another important topic. Resolution is how detailed something can be represented or perceived. There is a certain limit to our senses regarding how small a difference we can detect, or how finely we can distinguish things from one another, and various technologies actively exploit these limitations to deliver experiences. For example, computer displays are made of small dots. But when these dots are small enough — somewhere around 300 DPI（dot per inch) at reading distance, or a viewing angle of 1 arcminute (1/60 degree) — our eyes and brain stop seeing the dots and start to see images and characters. Movies have only 24 frames per second, but that’s enough to make us believe they are smooth and real. The majority of digital audio uses 44,100 samples per second, which means a second of sound is represented by 44,100 numbers. This rate was selected because it is enough to reproduce sound up to 20,000 Hz, which is about the upper limit of pitch that humans can hear. If humans had different capabilities, these technologies could have been designed differently. An interesting part is even when there isn’t enough resolution, our brain often try to see continuity by complementing the missing details. Early monitors were much more coarse and the pixels were far more visible. But people were accepting the quality, and there is even appreciation and nostalgia for the low resolution graphics aka 8-bit style. Animations, especially cartoonish ones, can utilize a lower frame rate to add unique effects. Sometimes, letting the brain fill in the gaps is better than trying to draw everything in detail and having the illusion fall apart by having discrepancies here and there. When we sketch with code, we are always engaging with how humans perceive things. Our senses are full of quirks. They compress, filter, and interpret the raw physical world in different ways to make sense of it. Understanding how human perception works helps us see things and make things from different perspectives. It feels fascinating and freeing that when it comes to human perception, there’s no one right model, just many ways to look at things. Embrace the differences and complexity, and have fun. Humans are wired to spot patterns. Our ancestors survived by recognizing various footprints to avoid danger and find food, spots and dots on fur, rotational patterns of petals, cycles of the sun, moon, stars and repeating seasons, tides, and weather. Repeating patterns are fundamental to design and art. We see them everywhere, like in the repeating columns of ancient buildings, brick patterns, glass tiles on skyscrapers, and street pavements. Checkers, stripes, and other repeating motifs appear universally in decoration and textiles. Musicians create structure through rhythms, phrases, and chord cycles. Patterns are powerful vocabulary. Following patterns makes things predictable. It is often relaxing and comforting, but intense rhythm can also bring energy and even trance. Breaking a predictable rhythm creates tension, drawing people’s attention, and going back and forth between tension and familiar patterns is a way to drive a song or a story. At the basis of patterns is repetition. We recognize patterns because the same thing happens again and again. There are many methods to create and handle repetitions mathematically and programmatically. For example, modulo is basically a mathematical way of saying “count to n then go back to one and repeat,” which is just dividing a number by another number and taking the remainder. This is common in everyday life, like the time on a clock or the days of a week, and is a basis for many repeating patterns, such as repeating tiles and musical rhythms below. This can be easily expanded to repetition of continuous values. Repetition The sine wave is another fundamental building block for repeating patterns. A mind-blowing fact is that with an infinite set of sinusoidal waves, each with its own frequency, amplitude, and phase, you can synthesize any pattern in theory. This idea is called the Fourier series for repeating patterns and the Fourier transform for ones that don’t. They are so universal and useful that you’ll bump into them in many places, such as audio and signal processing, and a whole lot of physics. Sine waves and Additive SynthesisFourier Series Tiling is one of the most obvious visual patterns. By repeating the same elements in a space, or dividing a space based on some rules, we can create various interesting patterns that can continue forever. The patterns can be simple repetition of the same geometric shapes to something more unique and interesting like M. C. Escher’s drawings. There are patterns that are not exactly regular and predictable like Penrose tiles or Truchet tiles. A Voronoi diagram is a method to create more organic patterns. Cells in Voronoi diagrams are all different, but humans can still see that they follow the same rules or a “pattern.” Just like when you look through a microscope, no cells in nature are exactly the same, but we can intuitively see they are the same thing regardless. Instead of dividing space, we can create musical rhythm by dividing time. Even within the same tempo and time signature, time can be divided differently, and the way you divide dictates the “feel” of the rhythm. Experienced musicians have a finely tuned resolution of time, meaning they can feel this division more granularly and accurately and precisely position their notes. Many players also adjust the timing slightly off from the exact timing naturally or intentionally to create add more nuances, such as heavy or bouncy rhythms. Resolution – Rhythm Click on “Run Pen”, then click one more time to play the sound. Music has many layers of repetition beyond basic drum loops. From guitar riffs that stick in your head to rhythmic and melodic patterns of phrases, song structure is built by repeating different sections, such as verses, bridges, and choruses. There is so much more that I can write here that we can talk about. Again, nothing follows a perfectly regular pattern. Randomness is a great tool that can help make our sketches more interesting and natural. Randomness is, by definition, hard to predict, but that doesn’t mean it’s uncontrollable. There are many different ways to “shape” randomness for your purpose. Let’s take a die as an example. A single throw of a fair die is completely unpredictable. The probability for all possible results is equal. But if you throw it twice and sum the results, you will get more 7s than 12s. The more times you throw a die, the more the sum or average will converge to a certain expected value. This is called the Law of Large Numbers. You can also apply some function to random results to adjust the distribution. For example, if you take a square of a random floating number from 0.0 to 1.0, you get this shape. Can you see the difference between these two cityscapes? These are made by using the exact same regular grid with two different functions that give them subtly different impressions. In most cities, building heights in the suburbs show little variation because nearly everything is only a few stories tall. Downtown, though, the range is much wider. While many buildings are still modest in height, a handful of skyscrapers rise far above the rest. You can think of this as a “pattern” that can repeat across many cities. Taming Randomness Noise functions are methods to get randomly but continuously changing, like the up and down of terrain, the change of temperature, or the direction an animal wanders. These are all unpredictable, but unlike dice rolls, they look smoothly connected and values next to each other seem to be somehow related. There are many noise function algorithms, but most major ones share a simple idea of smoothly connecting random numbers. So the values are random, but if you pick a point close to another, they return relatively close values, and there is no abrupt jump, or discontinuity between them. Noise functions are often layered by adding them together at different scales to create a more natural look. Imagine a mountain range. From far away, you see its jagged silhouette. As you hike closer, you start to see smaller ridges, and up close, you notice every rock face has tiny cracks and ledges that are similar to larger forms. It is quite a common pattern in nature for things to repeat similar shapes at many levels of zoom. You can find this in rolling clouds, breaking waves, cracked desert ground, leaf veins, and the shape of coastlines. Taming RandomnessReading a Noise FunctionDrawing Landscape This common pattern is called fractal. A fractal is a pattern or shape that repeats the same structure at different scales, in such a way that a part of the shape resembles the whole, and a sub-part of a part resembles the larger part. Layering of noise functions can be seen as a way to emulate the fractal nature of the real world with a finite number of computations (for example, the landscape demo above is made of 9 iterations of the same noise). Some mathematically defined fractals, such as the Mandelbrot set or Julia set, have literally infinite details. The real world is messy with infinite detail. When we see or hear things for the first time as a baby, we can’t make sense of them because they are like a raw stream of data with no structure. But as we keep experiencing similar things appear and occur, our brain starts to grasp patterns. We no longer track every speck of bark on a tree, but we just think “tree.” This is a shortcut to let us deal with overwhelming complexity and act quickly. It works the other way around, too. When information is missing, like in a blurry photo or garbled phone call, our brain tries filling the gaps with its library of familiar patterns. Resolution Does this sounds like data compression? Yes, many technologies like ZIP, JPEG, or MP3 borrow the basically same trick. They hunt for repeated structure in data, toss the redundant bits, and keep a smaller blueprint. Decompressors rebuild the original (or close enough) by reading that blueprint plus a few rules, just like our brain filling in a pixelated image. I wanted to study and write an article about information theory and data compression. I might, someday. And AI image generation. The foundational idea of diffusion models is to show the AI the process of adding noise to an image until it becomes unrecognizable, and have it learn the backward process to re-imagine plausible details of images from noise. “Pattern” is a broad word. We started from simple repetitions and reached our recognition of the noisy world. At a meta level, patterns what let us make sense of the world. They are so crucial for us to grasp and organize information. But at the same time, it is also important to remember that leaning to match on patterns can make us overlook the details that matter, sliding into stereotypes and snap judgments. We need to free ourselves from familiar patterns sometimes. A fun and useful practice is to jump between levels. Spotting big patterns while appreciating the subtle differences, nuances, and noise without falling into excessive generalizations. Master that dance and you’re using your built‑in compressor to its fullest, while staying aware of both its strengths and its traps. Yes I’m taking about both life and art. Interpolation is about estimating the values that lie between the points you already know. When you’re moving a character from point A to B, you interpolate between them so you know where the character is at a given time. You know the stock price in May and July, so you interpolate between them to estimate what the price was in June. The idea is so simple, and applicable to so many things. Let’s start from the simplest case where the value changes at the same rate all the way. Suppose that point P moves from one point A to another point B, and the variable t is the ratio how much P has moved between them. If t = 0, P is in the same position as A. If t = 1, P is in the same position as B, and if t = 0.5, P is exactly at the midpoint between A and B. This can be expressed as follows. A, B, and P can be either numbers or vectors. Interpolation and Animation – Linear Interpolation If we interpolate between points in 2D, we can draw a line segment. But things don’t always change at the same pace. To manipulate the rate, we use different functions called easing functions. Easing functions are not a clearly defined category, and they can be any function that can map a range of values (usually 0 to 1) to the same range continuously, keeping the start and end the same. MappingEasing functions On a one dimensional line, you can draw only a single path between two points, but in higher dimensions, like 2D or 3D, there are infinite ways to connect two dots. Defining a path between points in flexible but precise way is very crucial for computer graphics to draw lines and shapes. One of the most common methods called Bézier curve is basically to repeat linear interpolations multiple times. The demo below illustrates this idea. Bézier and Spline There are many different methods to draw curved lines similar to Bézier curves but with more advanced features. For example, B-spline introduces additional parameters to adjust the weights of each point to add more nuanced control over the line’s shape. Bézier and Spline – B-Spline When we draw curves, we often care how smooth they are. What smooth means can vary, but to deal with a specific kind of smoothness, there is a very useful mathematical concept called continuity. To measure how smooth a curve is in a mathematical sense, you can take the derivative of the function that represents the curve. The first derivative shows the rate of change of position, and the second derivative shows the rate of change of the rate of change. An algorithm called natural spline is designed to guarantee C2 Continuity at anywhere through a curved line goes through multiple points. While a natural spline is mathematically smooth, it may not always look like the smoothest line to human eyes. The Hobby curve algorithm minimizes curvature at each point along the line, making strokes that look like Henri Matisse’s stroke drawn with a very long brush. Controlling curves For connecting lines or interpolations smoothly, Hermite interpolation, or so-called smoothstep functions are often used. When t moves from 0 to 1, these functions can adjust the rate of change to make the derivative at the beginning and the end be zero. The first formula guarantees C1 continuity and the second one is for C2, the last one is the general form for any level of continuity. The formulas themselves are not very intuitive, but if you look at the graphs below, you can visually confirm that the rate of change becomes zero. The graph to the left shows the first derivative, and the one to the right shows the second derivative. For example, these demos for the noise functions from the Taming Randomness page use the Hermite functions. Instead of trying to control the interpolation precisely, there are methods to use algorithms to figure out the exact way to interpolate between points. This is particularly useful when there are multiple data points spread across a space. RBF interpolation is one of those methods. It solves for weights automatically and produces a smooth surface that passes through however many points you throw at it, even in higher dimensions. Take a look at the demo of RBF interpolation in 2D space. You can drag white points to play around. Continuous Mapping Interpolation is not just about moving things and drawing lines. Colors are another good example. You can mix two or more colors by interpolating between them. Your result can be different depending on which color model you use. You could even draw a curved line in a color space to get an interesting gradient. You might have seen a menu to select (re)sampling method when you are resizing an image in graphics software like Adobe Photoshop. These software programs take colors from the closest pixels and interpolate between them. In case of Photoshop, “Nearest Neighbor” means no interpolation (just pick a color from a single closest pixel), “Bilinear” linearly blends the 2 × 2 neighborhood, “Bicubic” uses a cubic function to give it C1 continuity. Mixing Colors As you might have noticed already at this point, you can interpolate between anything that can be represented as vectors. By seeing things through the lens of concepts like vectors and interpolation, we can treat many things in the same way (that is the power of abstraction). Interpolation is indeed a powerful and versatile technique to add to your toolbox. There is a very similar and related concept called extrapolation. As the name suggests, extrapolation is to extend a line beyond the ends. Extrapolation are used to predict values beyond the boundary of known data points (predict the future!). It’d be interesting to explore this topic too if you are interested. Waves are everywhere. I suppose the word originally meant just waves on the water surface, like the ocean or a lake. However, there are many other things that exhibit characteristics of waves, such as sound, earthquakes, electromagnetic waves, and light. In terms of design and graphics, wavy shapes are one of the most common patterns and are often seen in fashion, architecture, and various art and craft pieces. Wave Mathematically, the sine wave is the most fundamental wave shape. It represents the position of a point on a unit circle as the center angle changes. A sine curve can be drawn as a result of a physical object following the spring equation (Hooke’s law, F=-kx). Basically, this means if you vibrate a thing attached to a spring and plot its position over time, you get a sine curve. It is fascinating that these seemingly very different methods result in the exact same curve, which indicates that there’s something special about the sine curve (yes, it is). Waves propagate and spread in space. Many waves are mechanical, meaning they are caused by physical materials pushing against each other. When you pluck a guitar string, it vibrates and pushes the air around, which pushes the air next to it, and so forth. Sound is propagated across a room as oscillations of air pressure this way. Earthquakes, ocean waves, etc., all belong to this category. Direction of the wavesVibration and Propagation Electromagnetic waves are a different class of wave that needs no material medium at all. Electromagnetic waves have properties of both particles (photons) and waves. Light, radio, microwaves, X‑rays, etc. are the same phenomenon at different frequencies. What oscillates is simply the electric (E) and magnetic (B) fields themselves. What is light? Even without a medium, electromagnetic waves still obey the same wave physics, such as reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction. The concept of “wave” is an abstraction to capture these common characteristics between different things and phenomena. It’s not that they behave the same because they are waves, but we call them waves because they follow the same rules. For example, electromagnetic waves are diffractive, meaning that they can go around behind obstacles just like waves on the surface of water. Thanks to diffraction (along with reflection and scattering) we can watch TV or use cellular phones even when there is an obstacle between the antenna and the devices. What is light? Electromagnetic waves between about 400–800 terahertz are what we normally think of as light, and they are visible to human eyes. Depending on the frequency of light, we see different colors. Understanding how different frequencies of light interact with objects before they reach our eyes is crucial for thinking about our vision and how we model these phenomena to create graphics. Spectrum and ConesLight Sound is also a wave. When you clap your hands, pluck a string, or hit a drum, it makes the air vibrate. In the case of light, the frequency corresponds to the color. In sound, the frequency corresponds to the pitch, how high or low it sounds, and the amplitude affects the loudness. “Seeing” the sound wave helps us understand the sound a lot. For example, you can see how different frequencies of sine waves sound, or how various sounds from different instruments look. Sound visualization Musical intervals are based on frequency ratios. The equal temperament commonly used in Western music divides an octave evenly into 12 semitones. No matter where you start on the piano keyboard, the ratio of the frequency from one note to its right neighbor (e.g., C to C#) is 21/12. With the semitone as a unit, we can think of the distance between notes as a simple number relationship. Interestingly, we don’t experience pitch as just a straight line—it feels more like a spiral. For example, if you start at 440 Hz (the A note) and go up, you’ll eventually hit another A at 880 Hz at exactly double the frequency. It’s not the same sound, but we hear it as the same note, just in a higher octave. Upon these notes, we can construct different harmonies. It is all about ratio and relative relationships, and depending on how you lay them out vertically (play at the same time) or horizontally (play in sequence), you can evoke totally different feelings from the same sets of notes, or frequencies. In the slightly more song-like example below, the chord (F major 9th) chord is repeated every second time. Notice how the same chord can sound different depending on the preceding chord. Pitch and FrequencyNumbers and IntervalsThe secrets of sound (for kids) Other than the pitch and loudness, sound also has timbre, which is like the texture or color of a sound. That’s how you can tell apart different sounds, like a bird chirping, car horns, or instruments like piano and trumpet. Timbre comes from the fact that most of the sound don’t consists of a single frequency, but rather a mix of many different frequencies. And the balance between these different frequencies determines the timbre. Let’s take a guitar string as an example. When you pluck it, the string vibrates in many ways at once. The main pitch is called the fundamental frequency, but parts of the string also vibrate in smaller sections—halves, thirds, quarters, etc. These create harmonics or overtones, which are simple multiples of the base frequency. We can visualize this too. In the demo below, you can see the shape of the wave changes as we add extra sine waves with different frequencies and amplitudes (the radius of the circle), in this case, getting closer to a so-called square wave. Sine waves and Additive Synthesis I wish I had added sound playback to these demos. I may try later. You can compare the sound of square wave vs. sine wave on this Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_wave_(waveform) This bring us to the favorite topic of synthesizing everything with sine waves. If you have an infinite set of sinusoidal waves, each with its own frequency, amplitude, and phase, you can synthesize any periodic pattern in theory. This idea is called the Fourier series for repeating patterns and the Fourier transform for ones that don’t. For example, an arbitrary shape, like an alphabet can be written as a Fourier series, or a series of waves. The Fourier transform is widely used in various fields such as sound processing, signal processing, and image compression. By applying Fourier transform to sound data, we can determine the amount of different frequencies contained within it. This lets us manipulate the data by reducing or increasing a certain range of frequencies. Sine waves and Additive SynthesisFourier Series The Navier-Stokes equations describe the properties and behavior of media such as water and air, including mass conservation, momentum conservation, and viscosity. This is a fundamental theory that explains how waves work in these media, but that’s not all. In computer graphics, these equations are often used for fluid simulation. Understanding and simulating waves using the Navier-Stokes equations can be a fun and interesting research topic. Fluid Simulation Shapes seem like an obvious topic. Since they are ubiquitous, we take them for granted. Many tools provide ways to draw shapes, and many of them are pretty simple, like these functions in p5.js. But as soon as we look more closely, things get complicated. In fact, there are infinite ways to define and draw shapes, and most of the shapes in the wild, from industrial products to nature, have so many nuances. Let’s start with geometric shapes that are (relatively) easier to define mathematically and handle with code. It is easy to draw line segments, circles, etc. in various environments including HTML canvas. However, it is not so easy to draw figures like those in geometry textbooks. Even a simple operation such as drawing a circle around the intersection of two straight lines requires a bit of calculation. The ability to draw a picture and the ability to handle geometry mathematically are two different things. Of course, there are many well-designed libraries out there, but it is also a good learning experience to implement basic functions by yourself. Well it was at least for myself. Geometric Drawings Understanding basic shapes gives us a foundation for drawing many other more complex shapes. You might have experience in drawing shapes with just a compass and ruler in math class. It is sometimes fun to limit your tools and play within the constraints. It is fascinating to see we can create pretty complex shapes just with circles and lines. Geometric Drawings – Other drawings Geometric shapes are widely used in our design. Repeating them in patterns is a major vocabulary of decorative and graphic design. Since ancient times, people have been crafting intriguing patterns by repeating graphic elements or organizing space based on specific rules. Tiling Not just for directly drawing shapes, we often use geometric shapes as proxies for more complex shapes as well. A good example of this is collision detection in games and 3D simulations where we want to detect object intersections. We usually use basic shapes like circles, triangles, rectangles, and combinations of them to approximate complex shapes at different precisions as needed. If you’re making a NES game, Mario can be just a rectangle. If you’re making a 3D fighting game, you might want boxes to represent a character’s body, upper and lower arms, fists, etc. separately. A human can tell if two figures overlap or not at a glance. But it is difficult to solve this generally with a computer, and different problems often require different tricks. Various methods of checking whether figures overlap are used to detect collisions between objects in physics simulations and games. You may rely on the functions of existing tools and libraries in actual projects. But knowing the basics will not only help you understand these tools but will also enable you to quickly implement only the functions you need yourself. Detecting Collision The linked page above (Detecting Collision) only covers collision detection in 2D. 3D collision detection can be much more intricate, but understanding in 2D can extend and help a lot in 3D too. Below is a simple reference I found for 3D. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/3D_collision_detection?utm_source=chatgpt.com While straight lines are much easier to handle, curves are the norm on Earth. Nature doesn’t have many straight lines. Almost nothing goes straight, except for light. Curves are obviously a very essential tool for sketching. However, unlike straight lines, which can be defined with just two points and a linear formula, curves have infinite possibilities and are much harder to handle. There have been many different methods of defining or drawing curves, each with its own advantages, disadvantages, and constraints. Cumulative Curves One of the most common ways that curves occur in the physical world is through cumulative motion or buildup, meaning a point starts moving from one location and changes its course over time. This can include freehand drawing, paths followed by insects, animals, vehicles, and the growth patterns of plants and other organisms. While the cumulative approach is straightforward and versatile in theory, it is often not the best for many practical use cases where you want more precise control over the overall shape and details, such as in drawing or design tools. These tools usually adopt parametric approaches. In the parametric approach, a shape or curve is defined mathematically using one or more parameters. By varying these parameters, you can generate points that make up the shape. For example, if the parameter is called t, you can get all the points from beginning to end by moving t within a certain range. Parametric Approaches Among parametric approaches, there is a category of methods that are designed to define curved lines freely and precisely with multiple control points. These methods are widely used in design tools such as Adobe Illustrator or Figma, CAD, 3D modeling tools, and others. A spline curve is a mathematically defined curve that smoothly passes through or is close to a series of control points. It is like a big family, and there are many variations including Bézier curves, B-spline curves, NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines), Cardinal Splines, Catmull-Rom Splines, Hermite Splines, etc. Bézier and Spline When we talk about shapes, it is important to discuss their quality, not just methods, since after all, we are sketching to express something. Curves can have various visual characteristics. For example, some curves might look more organic and natural, while others might appear more geometric and mechanical. How can we create these different looks of curves? There is another very different category of defining shapes than drawing outlines. “Signed distance functions”, or SDF sounds scary but it is not too crazy to understand. A SDF is a function that can tell you how far a point is from a surface of a shape, say a sphere (usually in Euclidean space) For example the distance of a point of from the surface of a sphere can be expressed as below where p is the coordinate of the point, c is the center of the sphere, and r is the radius: Signed distance functions This is very interesting because SDF is the technique used as basis for many mind-blowing 3D graphics demos with really small amount of code you often find on ShaderToy. Using this method in 3D, you can create different shapes pretty flexibly with a relatively short amount of code using shaders. Projection and 3D Rendering Reading “Raymarching – Primitives” Shaders and 3D rendering have a very steep learning curve. There isn’t a common or obvious way to build knowledge step by step, and it takes learning from multiple resources and examples. Shadertoy is one of the best resources with tons of cool demos with publicly available code. However, understanding this demo code can often be daunting. There are many techniques to grasp, and it’s often difficult to understand what’s happening in the code at first glance. There isn’t really a shortcut here (as far as I know). Studying demo codes step by step, a little by little is the best way. Two following pages are my attempt to help with the journey. Drawing Landscape The landscape example just above shows a lot more intricate and organic shape than other shapes we have been seeing on so far. Many naturally occurring shapes follow a pattern called a fractal, where a shape repeats its structure at different scales. In fractals, parts of the shape resemble the whole, while smaller parts resemble the larger parts. This property, called self-similarity, is key to modeling many complex structures and patterns found in nature, such as coastlines, mountains, clouds, and tree branches. Objects and lives in nature often to form fractal-like structures in the process of building themselves, where similar patterns recur at progressively smaller or larger scales. Understanding this principle can help us sketch them. Fractal Natural shapes are also unpredictable. The ups and downs of terrain, the changes in temperature, or the directions animals wander towards all seem random, but they look smoothly connected too, and values next to each other seem to be somehow related. Noise functions are the go-to methods for this, and we often overlay multiple layers of noise functions in a fractal manner (scale and add) to get desired complexity. Taming Randomness Reading a Noise Function As I said in the beginning, there are infinite ways of defining and drawing shapes. A couple of major topics I didn’t touch upon are: That said, if you’re interested, I recommend building basic tools yourself to learn the fundamentals. Even trying to render a few polygons can provide good insights (hint: project 3D points to 2D screen, calculate normals using cross product of vectors, and apply lighting). All of these sections were originally published as introductory articles, or maps of things in my mind, to provide overviews of different topics in Sketching with Code from different angles. Most of the contents is from Sketching with Math and Quasi Physics (2019), and the other workshop materials or self-educational notes. The majority of them were originally in English, but some were in Japanese first. The translations were done with the help of AI in both directions. I used p5.js for most of the code samples, unless otherwise noted. However, I tried to write them in a way that can be applied to any environment as much as possible. I am not a mathematician or computer engineer. This is simply a compilation of ideas that I have found useful from the perspective of a visually oriented person. If you notice any mistakes, have better examples, or know of links that would aid in learning, please share them with me. In this context, I am less interested in show-off demos, so please refrain from providing tweet-length shaders or similar content. Hope you enjoyed these intros.

Title: Is Nvidia Stock A Buy Ahead Of Earnings?

ByJason Kirsch ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. Record revenue expectations underscore continued demand as Nvidia remains at the forefront of ... More next-gen computing. Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) stands at a pivotal moment as it prepares to release its first-quarter fiscal 2026 earnings on May 28, 2025. The semiconductor giant has transformed from a gaming graphics company into the backbone of AI infrastructure worldwide. However, recent stock performance and mounting geopolitical challenges have investors questioning whether Nvidia remains a compelling investment opportunity. This analysis examines Nvidia's year-to-date performance, key earnings metrics, macroeconomic headwinds and expert sentiment. With Wall Street projecting record revenue of $43.3 billion alongside a significant $5.5 billion writeoff related to China restrictions, the earnings report will be closely watched. Understanding these business dynamics is crucial for investors considering their position before quarterly results are unveiled. Nvidia’s 2025 journey has been volatile, with shares trading approximately 5% lower year-to-date as of late May. The year began turbulently when Chinese startup DeepSeek released a cost-effective AI model that challenged Big Tech’s AI infrastructure spending assumptions. This development and signals from Microsoft regarding potential slowdowns in AI data center investments created uncertainty about the sustainability of Nvidia’s growth. Geopolitical tensions under the Trump administration have further complicated Nvidia’s stock performance. Trade restrictions led to export bans on Nvidia's specialized chips to China, with CEO Jensen Huang acknowledging these policies cost the company approximately $15 billion in sales. The subsequent $5.5 billion write-off of H20 inventory designed for the Chinese market represents a tangible impact on Nvidia's financials. Despite challenges, Nvidia maintains exceptional financial strength, with $38.5 billion in cash versus $8.5 billion in debt. Recent developments, including expansion into Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and President Donald Trump’s repeal of certain chip trade restrictions, have provided positive momentum. Options traders are pricing in potential movements of up to 7.4% following earnings — continued volatility. Nvidia’s earnings will be widely scrutinized, with investors seeking insights into near-term performance and long-term positioning. The company has historically beaten quarterly guidance while providing forward estimates that exceed consensus. However, these "beat-and-raise" scenarios have become less dramatic as Wall Street caught up with Nvidia's trajectory. The earnings call will be crucial for understanding how to navigate geopolitical challenges while capitalizing on AI demand. Supply constraints remain the primary U.S. growth limitation, while international expansion strategies are critical for offsetting substantial China revenue loss. CEO Jensen Huang will provide vital future insights on competitive positioning and customer diversification. Wall Street projects record quarterly revenue of $43.3 billion for Q1 fiscal 2026, representing 66% growth versus $26 billion last year. While impressive, this means decelerating from the prior year's 262% revenue growth. Earnings per share are expected at $0.73, up from $0.61 year-over-year, with some analysts projecting adjusted EPS of $0.88, a 44% increase. These projections must consider the $5.5 billion H20 inventory write-off impacting reported results despite underlying business strength. Historical data shows that Nvidia shareholders who purchased before earnings and held for 12 months achieved median returns of 120% over the past decade. However, as always, given evolving competitive and regulatory landscapes, past performance doesn't guarantee future results. Data center revenue represents Nvidia’s crown jewel, growing from $3 billion in fiscal 2020 to $115 billion in fiscal 2025. This segment exited recent quarters with $35.6 billion revenue and $142 billion annualized run rate. Morningstar models $40 billion for April 2025, but reduced July estimates from $44 billion to $37.6 billion because of restrictions on sales to China. Supply constraints continue to limit Nvidia’s ability to fulfill demand. Analysts expect incremental quarterly growth of approximately $4 billion through fiscal 2026, driven by additional supply and continued AI adoption. Sustainable growth depends on broader AI infrastructure investment trends and diversification of the Nvidia’s customer base beyond hyperscale cloud providers. AI demand remains Nvidia’s fundamental growth driver, dominating GPU provision for AI training and inference workloads. The CUDA software platform creates significant switching costs, establishing competitive advantages beyond hardware. However, recent developments, including DeepSeek’s model and scaling-law debates, have introduced questions about AI investment sustainability. Nvidia's unique position provides superior AI trend visibility across industries. The earnings call will reveal whether AI investment slowdown concerns are materializing or demand remains robust across customer segments and regions. Expansion beyond cloud providers into government and sovereign initiatives, particularly in the Middle East, could provide significant diversification benefits. Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell architecture represents a critical future growth strategy, offering significant performance improvements over Hopper chips. Launch timing and execution face competitive pressure from semiconductor rivals and custom cloud provider chips. Early adoption, production schedules, and pricing will indicate Nvidia's ability to maintain technological leadership and premium positioning. Blackwell's strategic importance extends beyond immediate revenue, demonstrating continued innovation and commitment to evolving AI workload requirements. Supply chain execution is critical, given that historical demand exceeds supply for new generations. Success could offset China revenue headwinds while reinforcing Nvidia's preferred AI infrastructure provider position. The AI chip competitive landscape evolves rapidly, with major cloud providers investing in custom silicon while traditional semiconductor companies expand AI portfolios. Amazon's Trainium and Inferentia, Google's TPUs, and Microsoft/Meta design plans represent direct threats. AMD aggressively expands GPU lineups for cloud customers, while Intel develops AI accelerator products. Nvidia's competitive strategy extends beyond hardware to software, networking and services, creating comprehensive ecosystems that are difficult to replicate. However, major customers' desire to diversify suppliers and reduce single-vendor dependence represents structural challenges. Maintaining the pace of innovation while preserving switching costs through software advantages will determine sustained market position and premium valuations. U.S.-China geopolitical tensions represent the most significant macroeconomic headwind, with trade restrictions fundamentally altering Nvidia's addressable market. The Trump administration's export controls effectively blocked access to one of the world's largest AI markets. The $15 billion in lost sales represents just the beginning, as China's domestic semiconductor industry develops competitive alternatives like Huawei. Broader trade tension implications extend beyond direct restrictions to supply chain vulnerabilities and technology transfer concerns. Given Taiwan tensions, Nvidia's TSMC reliance on advanced production creates additional geopolitical risk. Middle East expansion attempts to diversify geographically, but newer markets may not offset the Chinese business scale. Reciprocal tariff threats could impact broader technology sector sentiment. Global economic conditions influence Nvidia through enterprise IT spending and AI startup venture capital impacts. Higher interest rates can reduce speculative AI investment appetite while slowing industry adoption. However, Nvidia shows remarkable economic cycle resilience, with AI infrastructure investment appearing relatively insensitive to traditional indicators. Well-capitalized customer bases provide some economic downturn insulation. Morningstar assigns Nvidia a 3-star "fairly valued" rating based on a $125 fair value estimate, suggesting the current $132-135 trading represents a slight overvaluation. The analysis acknowledges the potential for a higher fundamental value if geopolitical concerns diminish or AI demand proves more durable. The wide economic moat rating reflects confidence in competitive advantages, while the "Very High" uncertainty rating acknowledges AI market nascency and geopolitical complications. Wall Street sentiment remains generally positive despite challenges, with $43.3 billion consensus revenue projections showing continued growth confidence. However, decelerating growth rates and a focus on execution challenges suggest the "easy money" AI expansion phase may be ending. Analysts increasingly focus on navigating supply constraints, competitive pressures and geopolitical headwinds while maintaining premium pricing. Market indicators suggest continued volatility, with options pricing implying significant post-earnings movement potential. Historically strong 12-month pre-earnings buyer returns provide long-term investor comfort, but changing competitive and regulatory environments may limit historical trend applicability. Given concentrated Nvidia holdings among major index funds, institutional investor behavior will be closely watched. Bottom Line Nvidia looks like a clear buy heading into earnings, with strong fundamentals, dominant AI leadership and the potential to outperform if growth holds steady. Record revenue expectations underscore continued demand, and despite its $5.5 billion China write-off, the company remains at the forefront of next-gen computing. Still, risks remain. Geopolitical pressures, export restrictions and growing competition could affect future performance. While the stock appears reasonably valued, any upside will depend on Nvidia’s ability to maintain its technological edge and weather a more complex global environment.

Title: This 1 Simple Trick Can Make CEF Management Fees Vanish
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2025/05/27/this-1-simple-trick-can-make-cef-management-fees-vanish/

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Wooden Blocks with the text: Fees Plenty of investors miss out on the huge yields (often north of 8%) that closed-end funds (CEFs) offer. There’s one simple reason why: They get way too hung up on management fees. We’re going to look at a few reasons why that is today—and one easy way you can make those fees disappear entirely. But first, just how high are the fees we’re talking about? Well, the average fee for all CEFs tracked by my CEF Insider service is 2.95% of assets. In contrast, the largest ETF on the planet, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), has a fee of just 0.09%. So, to be sure, we are talking about a big gap here. But although CEFs’ fees are much higher, there are many reasons why we shouldn’t put too much weight on them when making buying decisions. Let’s talk about those now. SPY holds every stock in the S&P 500—in other words, the 500 large-cap companies that represent the biggest public firms in America. And while these stocks do well in good times, they can have rough runs, like we saw in April, for example. That’s why we want to make sure we’re investing in assets beyond stocks, like corporate bonds. CEFs let us do that, and they give us access to smart human managers (not to mention high dividends), too. An actual person at the helm is vital in a lot of these asset classes, and in particular corporate bonds, because deep connections are key to getting access to the best new issues. We all know deep down that diversification works. But using CEFs to do it really can take things to another level, thanks in part to their high dividends. Look at the performance of the PGIM Global High Yield Fund (GHY), in purple below, since the start of 2025 to the time of this writing. GHY is a CEF Insider holding that yields an outsized 9.8%. GHY Total Returns As you can see, GHY outran SPY (in orange) while diversifying its shareholders beyond stocks and the US, too. In addition, the bond CEF barely fell below breakeven in April, while stocks were down 15%. And bear in mind, as well, that these numbers are net of fees. Speaking of which, GHY’s fees are far higher than those of SPY (1.5% of assets compared to 0.09%) All that said, some CEFs do focus on S&P 500 companies, and still have higher fees, which brings me to my second point… GHY, as mentioned, has total expenses of 1.5%, better than the CEF average but still quite high. Compare that to the Nuveen S&P 500 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (SPXX), an S&P 500–focused CEF whose fees are much less, at 0.97%. But wait, if SPXX is focused on US large caps, why are its fees around 10 times those of SPY? It’s largely because SPXX also sells call options on its holdings—or rights for investors to buy them at a fixed date and price in the future. The fund gets paid for these rights (and uses those fees to help fund its 7.7% dividend). There’s some cost and work attached to that strategy, hence the higher fees. But it’s a small price to pay to get a dividend that’s nearly six times that of SPY. Currently, all CEFs covered by CEF Insider have an average yield of 9.1%, while SPY, as mentioned, yields 1.3%. In other words, a million dollars spread across all CEFs would get you over $90,000 in annual income, or $7,572 a month, versus less than $13,000, or about $1,075 monthly, from SPY. Income Potential This is why many investors use CEFs to fund an early, or partial, retirement; if it takes $682,286 in savings to replace the average paycheck in America (as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ median weekly earnings survey) with CEFs but a staggering $4.8 million saved with SPY, you can see why CEFs could attract more attention—and thus, CEF issuers can charge higher fees. Now, here’s the kicker: CEFs have an unusual structure that means they often trade for less than their assets are actually worth. Let’s say you have a CEF that has $100,000 spread across shares of NVIDIA (NVDA), Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN), among others, and the CEF has 10,000 shares in total. Each share is worth $10. Easy enough. But CEFs are, as the name says, closed. That means CEF issuers can’t issue new shares to new investors, so all of the shares trade on the public market, like stocks, and their market prices fluctuate based on investor demand, sometimes diverging from the actual value of the underlying holdings. If that demand is higher than the actual market value of the CEF, it’ll trade at a premium to its portfolio’s net asset value, or NAV; if lower, it’ll trade at a discount. On average, CEFs trade at a 6% discount, according to CEF Insider data. So if your CEF trades at a discount wider than its annual management fee, the discount can effectively offset the cost of that fee. And bear in mind that some CEFs are steeply discounted, with discounts of 10% or more. It’s worth pointing out that the fees are taken out of the CEF’s portfolio by managers automatically as a matter of course; investors don’t have to mail off a check. Let’s wrap with a quick recap, then: CEFs give you access to discounted, high-quality assets, far higher income than most ETFs, and they give you a high-income, low-cost way to diversify, too. Plus, the best CEFs outperform their benchmarks—including the S&P 500. This is why CEFs are a passive income weapon that many wealthy investors are happy to keep in their arsenal.

May 27, 2025 08:46 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, May 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: Should You Buy AVGO Stock At $230?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock is up nearly 45% in the last six months, significantly outperforming the broader Nasdaq index, down 1%. This strong performance is largely due to the company’s rising sales, up 40% in the last twelve months. A major driver of this growth is Broadcom's AI product line, which saw an impressive 220% year-over-year increase in revenue to $12.2 billion in fiscal year 2024, fueled by high demand for its custom AI accelerators (XPUs) and Ethernet products. Broadcom is strategically positioned to capitalize on the generative AI surge with its extensive suite of networking, storage, cybersecurity, and semiconductor offerings. Considering this strong performance, we believe AVGO stock is a good buy at its current price of around $230. While its current valuation is extremely high, making it sensitive to adverse events, we see minimal cause for concern. Our conclusion is based on comparing AVGO's current valuation with its recent operating performance and its current and historical financial health. Our analysis across key parameters—Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience—shows that Broadcom has a very strong operating performance and financial condition. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Also, see – What Sparked UNH Stock Crash? Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, AVGO stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market. Broadcom's Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. Broadcom's profit margins are much higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Broadcom's balance sheet looks strong. AVGO stock has been less resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. In summary, Broadcom's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: AVGO stock has performed exceptionally well across these parameters. While the stock's valuation is currently high, it appears justifiable given its massive sales growth and solid operating cash flow margins of around 40%. Therefore, despite its extremely high valuation, the stock remains attractive, supporting our conclusion that AVGO is a good buy. However, investors should be aware of certain risks. The stock's high valuation makes it more prone to significant declines during adverse events, as demonstrated by its larger corrections than the broader market in two of the last three market crashes. Additionally, any slowdown in AI spending by companies would directly impact Broadcom's growth. Overall, investors should carefully consider these potential risks before investing in AVGO. Not too happy about the volatile nature of AVGO stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. In summary, Broadcom's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: AVGO stock has performed exceptionally well across these parameters. While the stock's valuation is currently high, it appears justifiable given its massive sales growth and solid operating cash flow margins of around 40%. Therefore, despite its extremely high valuation, the stock remains attractive, supporting our conclusion that AVGO is a good buy. However, investors should be aware of certain risks. The stock's high valuation makes it more prone to significant declines during adverse events, as demonstrated by its larger corrections than the broader market in two of the last three market crashes. Additionally, any slowdown in AI spending by companies would directly impact Broadcom's growth. Overall, investors should carefully consider these potential risks before investing in AVGO. Not too happy about the volatile nature of AVGO stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Markets soar after Trump walks back EU trade threats

U.S. stocks rose sharply Tuesday, with the S&P 500 climbing over 2%, the Nasdaq gaining 2.5%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 740 points, or 1.8%, in a rebound from last week’s selloff. Bond yields declined around the globe, including in the U.S., where the 10-year Treasury dipped below 4.5%. Gold tumbled 2%. The catalyst: President Donald Trump announced a delay in his threatened 50% tariff hike on European imports, opting instead for expedited trade talks with the E.U. The move followed a weekend call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and marks a sharp turn from Friday’s rhetoric, which had markets on edge — especially after Trump warned Apple that foreign-assembled iPhones could soon face steep levies. Consider the actual events: Trump escalated a conflict by threatening 50% tariffs on the E.U., including on Apple’s (AAPL) foreign-assembled iPhones, essentially manufacturing a crisis. Then, after a phone call, he announced a delay on those tariffs, positioning the pause as a negotiated victory or goodwill gesture. But since he created the crisis in the first place, the “deal” or “pause” is just Trump backing off his own threat. Another weird twist in the story? In the same social media post that kicked off the weekend’s trade crisis, Trump threatened a specific 25% tariff on iPhones not assembled in the U.S. This prompted critics — including hedge fund manager Spencer Hakimian in a widely shared tweet — to point out that such policy would mean firms like Samsung, which fully produce their products abroad, would in fact face lower levies and effectively be granted a price advantage vs. actual American companies like Apple. After the tweet went viral, Trump pivoted, issuing a similar tariff warning to Samsung. Markets have been whipsawed again and again in 2025 as the White House pivoted, then pivoted again, repositioning global trade policy in posts and offhand comments. The current reprieve hinges on progress in fast-tracked talks between now and July 9, the new deadline Trump has set for potential tariff implementation. For now, though, stocks are flying — helped along by rallying bonds and the hope that this latest tariff scare will end not with a bang but a negotiation. The rest of the week promises more market-moving news. Semiconductor giant and AI bellwether Nvidia (NVDA) reports after the bell tomorrow, with investors watching closely and the results likely to dominate headlines for several days. The results of the Fed’s early May meeting will also be released Wednesday. While no surprises are expected, every word is still likely to be parsed for any clues on inflation and potential rate cuts in the back half of 2025.

Title: Prometheum Eyes U.S. Tokenization Boom With Acquisition and Fully Regulated Stack

Time Published: 2025-05-27T12:26:44Z
Full Content:
Prometheum, the controversial digital asset securities firm, is aiming to achieve a jumpstart in the lucrative tokenization boom, acquiring a broker-dealer and launching a digital transfer agent registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company told CoinDesk exclusively. ProFinancial, the firm’s newly acquired FINRA-member and SEC-registered broker-dealer, can offer primary sales of various securities products, giving issuers a pathway to raise capital directly in tokenized form. Prometheum Coinery, meanwhile, handles shareholder records and corporate actions both on and off the blockchain. The additions build on existing services for custody, clearing, and secondary trading via its affiliated broker-dealers, Prometheum Capital and Prometheum ATS. With the latest move, the company aims to position as one of the few U.S.-regulated players offering a vertically integrated route for bringing real-world assets into a blockchain-native format—a capability likely to become more critical as the tokenization trend matures. "Securities, commodities, everything else is moving on-chain, and there needs to be an infrastructure for that. [There's] a pie that's going to grow significantly, just like everything went from paper to electronic," Aaron Kaplan, co-CEO told CoinDesk in an interview. "We are in a prime position, in my opinion, to be a significant player in that growing ecosystem." The expansion comes as asset tokenization emerges as one of the fastest-growing corners of crypto tech at a time when U.S. regulators signal a friendlier approach towards digital assets. Tokenization stands for using blockchain rails for moving and managing traditional instruments like bonds, funds and other securities, with global asset managers and banks increasingly getting involved to achieve operational efficiencies and cheaper, faster settlements. It's potentially a lucrative opportunity: the tokenized asset market could balloon to multiple trillion dollars over the next few years, a range of reports from BCG, Ripple, McKinsey, 21Shares projected. It's no surprise then that tokenization firms are jockeying for position to seize the opportunity as the sector heats up. Recently, digital asset manager Superstate registered its transfer agent with the SEC and unveiled a tokenized equity trading platform. Securitize, a tokenization firm backed by BlackRock and Jump Crypto, purchased MG Stover's fund administration business, while financial services provider Apex Group last week announced the acquisition of tokenization specialist Tokeny. Prometheum, founded in 2017, made headlines over the past years with efforts to comply with the Gary Gensler-led SEC, known for its harsh stance towards crypto. The company also divided the digital asset industry with wanting to provide securities-focused services for cryptocurrencies like ether ETH$2,657.09. With the new entities, the firm is now able to offer a fully-integrated platform for tokenized securities, from initial issuance to secondary market trading and custody, all within U.S. securities laws, something that's difficult to achieve, Kaplan argued. "It's a much bigger lift than what was done previously with these other [tokenization] firms," Kaplan said. Creating a digital token of an asset is the "low-hanging fruit," while being able to handle trading and post-trading are "exponentially harder," he explained. "The harder parts are what we built first," he said. "Other [firms] went the other route, which was the lowest hanging fruit first, and they've had a harder time transitioning the other way." "So with this announcement, it's pretty clear that the low-hanging fruit is in our purview," he said. Jesse Hamilton contributed reporting.

ByMax (Chong) Li ByMax (Chong) Li, Contributor. ABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - MAY 15: U.S. President Donald J. Trump signs the guestbook as UAE ... More President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan looks on and gives a thumbs up gesture after a meeting at Qasr al Watan (Palace of the Nation) on May 15, 2025, in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Trump is on the third day of his visit to the Gulf to underscore the strategic partnership between the United States and regional allies including the UAE, focusing on security and economic collaboration. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) I’ve spent a decent amount of springtime in Abu Dhabi this year, seeing the UAE orchestrate a remarkable transformation from a traditional oil giant to a competent leader in the global digital economy. The push? AI and crypto, leveraging the nation's favorable policies and strategic geographic location while the two biggest economies in this world are at odds. Despite their individual strengths, AI and blockchain are increasingly interlaced, both striving towards systems that offer better autonomy, transparency, and data-driven intelligence, reshaping industries through their combined innovative potential. This drive will largely help the UAE capitalize on their complementary advantages to rewrite the global economic and technological race during this time of uncertainty. To know how the UAE is playing their range, we must look differently through the lens of Dubai and Abu Dhabi, the two iconic sites that share responsibility for the nation’s strategic ascent to leadership in Web3 and AI. Dubai's strategy is characterized by its emphasis on agility, a strong commercial focus, and a clear ambition to be a global hub for FinTech, AI, and Web3. It leverages its established reputation as a business-friendly environment with world-class infrastructure, together with its latest push to build supportive regulatory frameworks to attract innovation, talent, and capital. Abu Dhabi's strategy is more geared towards a top-down, institutional approach, emphasizing foundational research, advanced technology development, and the establishment of strategic, large-scale infrastructure projects. It aims to become a global leader in AI and institutional-grade digital assets through significant government investment and fostering deep partnerships. To conclude, this dual approach allows the UAE to capitalize on a broad spectrum of opportunities in the global digital economy. As for the long-term results, questions that remain to be asked include:

Title: BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard Accused by US Government of Colluding To Drive Up Energy Prices

US government authorities are accusing the asset management giants BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard of colluding against the coal industry. In November of last year, 11 state attorneys general, led by Texas AG Ken Paxton, accused the three financial firms of engaging in an anticompetitive conspiracy to drive down coal production. The attorneys general allege the firms tapped their influence as shareholders in competing coal companies to reduce industrywide coal output, illegally sharing competitively sensitive information in the process. Now, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ) have filed a “Statement of Interest” in support of the AGs’ case. The federal officials argue that BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard’s alleged conduct increased energy prices for consumers and businesses. “This case is not about ordinary activity by asset managers such as passive index investing or even pro-competitive activism. As alleged, the holders of large quantities of stock in competing companies agreed to use those shareholdings to reduce the output of US coal to increase profits at the expense of American consumers and businesses. This case is about precisely the sort of conduct, including concerted efforts to reduce output, which have long been condemned under the antitrust laws.” Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Title: Google Researchers Claim Quantum Computers Could Break Bitcoin with 20x Less Effort than Previous Estimates

Google has released a research paper which suggests that quantum computers may be able to crack encryption standards, such as those used by Bitcoin, with 20 times fewer quantum resources than previously estimated. A Google quantum researcher, Craig Gidney, said developers must ascertain the costs of creating quantum-safe cryptocurrencies to achieve the transition process. Cryptography standards, such as RSA, may be at a higher risk of being cracked than previously thought. Bitcoin users, especially those with custodial funds, may need to measure the risks to safeguard their crypto from quantum attacks. Quantum computing can solve complex puzzles, such as the ones used by Bitcoin to measure proof-of-work, thus presenting a new threat vector that places Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at risk. Bitcoin was designed for older computers, which are quickly becoming obsolete. Peter Shor, cryptographer and computer scientist, created a method called Shor’s algorithm to solve the complex puzzles used by cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Shor’s algorithm could be combined with a quantum computer to crack crypto wallets rapidly. An efficient algorithm, combined with a powerful computer, could increase the risk of a crypto portfolio, including digital assets that use proof-of-stake algorithms. Craig Gidney and Sophie Schmieg, quantum researchers at Google, discussed their findings on their Google security blog. They addressed the ability of quantum computers to crack public key cryptography, particularly RSA, which could be compromised with a quantum computer of around 1 million noisy qubits. They made this conclusion after taking into account recent advancements in quantum computing. The number of qubits required to crack cryptography is lower than previous estimates. The researchers outlined strategies corporations could take to mitigate the risks of quantum computers, such as collaborating with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to transition to a post-quantum computing world. Symmetric cryptography is largely unaffected by this attack. However, cryptography, such as that used by cryptocurrencies, is vulnerable to this attack due to the public exposure of addresses and the longevity of these wallets, providing attackers with a target they can attack for an extended period. NIST has set a timeline to phase out vulnerable systems by 2030 and ban them by 2035. Google has been confirming its strategy with NIST by implementing PQC signatures on its Cloud KMS service. IBM’s Condor, the most powerful quantum computer to date, can only reach 1,121 qubits, which is way short of the million qubits needed to crack RSA encryption. Cryptocurrency seems to be safe for now, unless a new technological innovation can dramatically increase the number of qubits. Google’s Sycamore, another quantum computer, can only get 53 qubits. However, the trend of quantum development suggests that crypto users must take these risks seriously. The Google researchers argue that the increased risk occurs because of technological advancements such as improved error correction and better algorithms. Modular exponentiation, for example, has been made more efficient, effectively doubling its speed. Modular arithmetic is a vital part of cryptographic systems. Further, the researchers found that error correction improvements can speed up their algorithm. They found that creating a separate layer for error correction allowed the qubits layer to be more dense, holding more information to be processed, speeding up the algorithm overall. The researchers could drop the qubit requirement by optimising code at a programmable level. Hackers could further exploit such optimizations to secretly lower the qubit requirements until a future date when quantum computers are more accessible. In early May 2025, BlackRock added a line to their iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing, stating that quantum computing poses a risk to the long-term security of Bitcoin. The filing states that if quantum computing advances enough, it could be used to crack the underlying encryption algorithms used to power Bitcoin. BlackRock is concerned that quantum computers will undermine crypto markets and technology. Quantum computers can potentially disrupt the business model of Silicon Valley, potentially causing a market crash. BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, should consider the potential risks of quantum computers. The fact that such a large bank like BlackRock is taking the risk seriously shows that quantum risks could be closer than we think.

Title: Locked Out of the Dream: Regulation Makes Homes Unaffordable
URL: https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2025/05/27/locked_out_of_the_dream_regulation_making_homes_unaffordable_around_the_world_1111741.html
Time Published: 2025-05-27T11:34:16Z
Full Content:
The first in a two-part series on the global housing crisis. Next to inflation, Americans ranked housing as their top financial worry in a Gallup survey last May. It’s only gotten worse. January home sales were down 5% from last year’s dismal numbers. Record numbers of first-time buyers are stuck on the sidelines as housing affordability stands at the lowest level ever recorded, while one in three Americans now spend over 30% of their income on mortgage or rent. The housing crisis is not just an American problem, but a global phenomenon that hits the middle and working classes the hardest. Studies of the Canadian, British, European, and East Asian markets have also found that housing prices have risen far faster than household incomes and inflation. A report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development concluded that “housing has been the main driver of rising middle-class expenditure.” In prosperous and communitarian Switzerland, Zurich studios sell for well over $1 million, and small houses even more, making downpayments unaffordable to affluent people despite the overwhelming financial advantages to homeowners. Underlying the plight of home buyers worldwide is a sometimes overlooked but profound influence – the spread of restrictive land-use regulations. It’s reshaping political and economic alignments in ways that may further destabilize the social order. Home ownership is strongly correlated with positive social indicators, and as renting grows twice as quickly as buying, this trend poses a threat to Western democracy by deepening economic inequality, depressing demographic vitality, and undermining the upward mobility that has driven Western progress for the past century. Cost of Over-Regulation The price increase may seem surprising because there has not been a huge spike in fundamental demand. In California, and most of the United States, as well as Europe and East Asia, population growth is tepid, if not declining. Today’s higher interest rates are below those that prevailed from 1970 to 1995, when housing costs were considerably lower relative to incomes. Nor is this predominantly a technical problem; the rise of remote work, which is connected to migration to smaller metros, as well as new technologies for building, including using 3D printers, actually offers the chance to build more cheaply. And yet, the principal cause for housing shortages and rising prices stems from the failure to build enough new housing units, particularly the single-family homes consumers most desire. Homebuilders built 1 million fewer homes (including rental units) in 2024 than in 1972, when there were 130 million fewer Americans. One estimate puts the U.S. housing market shortage at an estimated 4.5 million homes, according to Commerce Department data. The rapid inflation of housing costs stems primarily from ever more constricting land-use regulations. Inflated prices are particularly rife in countries and states with strict regulations like California, where high-income households now utterly dominate the housing market, and more than a third of all real estate transactions in recent years topped $1 million. At the crux of the problem is a series of housing policies referred to as “urban containment.” First implemented in Britain at the end of the Second World War, urban containment policies typically seek to manage growth by imposing boundaries or greenbelts around urban areas, outside of which new development is either prohibited or severely limited. Decades ago, there was ample land within these boundaries, but this has changed as population growth has stimulated more demand. The simple fact is that once the urban limits are reached, land prices along the boundaries – the suburbs and exurbs – and in the areas still open to development inevitably rise. This mimics the effects of the 1970s gasoline embargoes that drove prices through the roof – and is nothing more than basic economics. Rationing tends to increase prices. To this flawed approach, many jurisdictions have imposed other costs such as high-impact fees, lengthy environmental reviews, minimum parking mandates, and historical preservation designations. But generally, nothing quite compares with urban containment, as it drives up land costs by restricting development on the periphery, where land prices are the lowest. In almost all cases, the highest housing prices occur in markets that are characterized by this planning strategy. This includes all markets in Australia and New Zealand and many in Canada, the United Kingdom, the U.S., Western Europe, and China. In the U.S., the worst housing inflation has been in California, Oregon, Washington, Hawaii, and Colorado, all states that apply the tightest large regulatory noose around new developments, particularly on and beyond the urban fringe. The connection between policy and prices is clearly evident. As late as 1970, only a few markets were shaped by urban containment. As its influence grew, so did prices. As late as about 1990, national price-to-income ratios were “affordable,” at three or less in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the U.K., and the U.S. Today, the median multiple in these countries tends to be over five. But the worst results, as seen in most recent Demographia International Housing Affordability Study – Hong Kong, Sydney, San Jose, Vancouver, Los Angeles, Adelaide, Honolulu, San Francisco, Melbourne, Brisbane, as well as Greater London, are at a remarkable nine or above. Perhaps counterintuitively, higher density development – often seen as the alternative to “sprawl” – does not lower prices, as is sometimes suggested. In fact, U.S. data suggests a positive correlation between greater density and housing costs. Among 53 major metros, those with more single-family housing and larger lot sizes (key indicators of lower density) have substantially better housing affordability. The effects of density-focused policies on people and regions are profound. One study found the median family in San Jose or San Francisco would need 125 years (150 in Los Angeles) to save enough money to afford a down payment on a median-priced home; in Atlanta or Houston, the figure is 12 years. Highly restrictive planning policies also impact renters. A recent RAND study of California found that policy-driven delays, strict architectural standards, green mandates, and the requirement to pay union-level wages have increased the cost of construction of subsidized apartments twice as much as in Texas, while taking almost two years longer to get approved. Portland, Ore., a pioneer in urban containment, embraces high-density housing, but high prices have driven multifamily construction to the lowest level in a decade. Collapse of the Dream Urban containment and other planning policies have devastated middle-class aspirations in every country or region that adopts them, even in countries like Australia, which enjoy a vast land mass and a smallish population. Australian cities once characterized by family-friendly neighborhoods are now dominated by dense apartments and condominiums. Planning regulations now add 55% to the price of a home in Sydney, according to a recent Reserve Bank of Australia study. In greater Sydney, the median home price recently passed A$2 million (approximately US$1.3 million). This is higher relative to incomes than in Los Angeles, London, New York, Singapore, and Washington. Even Adelaide, geographically isolated and far from a dynamic global business locale, has higher prices, based on income, than Seattle, one of the world’s most dynamic tech hubs. According to projections from the Urban Taskforce, apartments will make up half of Sydney’s dwellings mid-century, whereas only one quarter of Sydney dwellings will be family-friendly detached homes. Young people are most impacted by this policy regime. In the U.S., homeownership for people under 35 has fallen fairly steadily since the Great Recession of 2008 and is now half that of people over 45. Similarly, in Australia, the percentage of households aged 25 to 34 owning homes has dropped from more than 60% in 1981 to only 45% in 2016. Similar trends are seen in other high-income countries, including Ireland, where only a third of millennials own a home, compared with almost two-thirds of baby boomers when they were the same age. At least one-third of British millennials are likely to remain renters permanently. Much of the same is occurring in the U.S. Whereas in 1969, the median price of a home cost about five years of a young adult’s income, today it costs nearly nine years. A new Institute for Family Studies report, “Homes For Young Families: A Pro-Family Housing Agenda,” says that since 1970, the share of young adults who own the home they live in has declined from 50% to around 25-30%. Ignoring Preferences In advocating such urban containment and other high-density housing policies, planners, backed by academia and most big media, set themselves against the overwhelming preferences of the public for less density and more spacious housing. Judge Glock, who is now affiliated with the Manhattan Institute, has noted that in Census Bureau data since 1950, the average density of the major continuously built-up urban areas has dropped from 6,000 people per square mile to 3,000. In recent years, smaller metropolitan areas have been growing the fastest, while net domestic migration is away from areas of higher density to areas of lower density. Since 1950, the share of U.S. population in core cities has fallen from 24% to under 15%. Even in California, despite government resistance, virtually all the growth over the last decade has been in farther-flung suburbs. As elsewhere, the preference for single-family homes is “ubiquitous,” according to recent research by Jessica Trounstine at the University of California, Merced. “Across every demographic subgroup analyzed,” she observes, respondents preferred single-family home developments by a wide margin. Relative to single-family homes, apartments are viewed as “decreasing property values, increasing crime rates, lowering school quality, increasing traffic, and decreasing desirability.” Once, it was widely suspected that young people would head to big core cities like New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Denver. But surveys reveal that nearly three in five younger people see homeownership as an essential part of the American dream, while two-thirds favor suburbs as their preferred residence. Three out of four Californians, according to a poll by former Obama campaign pollster David Binder, opposed legislation that banned single-family zoning. A big driver of suburban growth is minorities and immigrants. In the 1950s and 1960s, mass suburbanization was widely associated with “white flight” and discrimination against minorities. But in the past decade, over 90% of all suburban growth in the U.S. came from minorities; currently, more than three-quarters of all African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians in major metropolitan areas in the U.S. live in the suburbs. Similar patterns are also evident in Canada, Australia, and the U.K. Today, most high-income countries are primarily suburban. A Statistics Canada analysis of 2021 census results indicates that more than 75% of the population lives in the suburbs, which absorbed more than 80% of the growth between 2016 and 2021. Even in transit-rich and land-short Japan, residents of Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya are dispersing away from the urban core to suburban and exurban areas after these cities nearly monopolized national population growth over the previous decade. Much the same can be said of Seoul, South Korea, which is even denser than the Japanese megacities. An analysis of the 53 U.S. major metropolitan areas finds that more than 85% of residents live in suburban or exurban neighborhoods and that more than 90% of the population growth since 2010 has been in the suburbs and exurbs. These choices underscore an analysis of Canadian poll results by Sotheby’s, which suggests a “disconnect” between urban planning and consumer preferences: The “picture is of young urban families overwhelmingly preferring detached houses, and decidedly not the condominiums into which planners are driving them.” As Sotheby’s puts it, “The report dispels myths about young, urban families’ housing preferences.” Among Americans under 35 who do buy homes, four-fifths choose single-family detached houses. According to a recent National Homebuilders Association report, over 66%, including those living in cities, prefer a house in the suburbs. Almost two-thirds of U.S. millennials (25 to 44) favor being owners, which is also the case in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada. The future vision of the planners has little attraction among the public. Upward Mobility or Neo-Feudalism? Whatever their desires, without an affordable home, millennials and Gen Z will face a formidable challenge in boosting their net worth. Homes today account for roughly two-thirds of the wealth of middle-income Americans; homeowners have a median net worth more than 40 times that of renters. Not surprisingly, most young people still believe in creating wealth through ownership. Yet rather than allowing for greater dispersal of wealth, as was the case in previous decades, the decline of housing affordability is a critical factor driving inequality, notes a recent study by Bank for International Settlements (Berne) economist Gianni La Cava. In more historically feudal Great Britain, land prices have risen dramatically over the past decade, and less than 1% of the population owns half of all the land. On the continent, farmland is increasingly concentrated while urban real estate has fallen into the hands of a small cadre of corporate owners and the mega-wealthy. The left-wing economist Thomas Piketty has identified high housing costs as a driver of increasing inequality even in purported social democracies like Germany and France. This is also the case in the U.S., where about 71% of the increase in housing wealth between 2010 and 2020 was gained by high-income households, according to the National Association of Realtors. Increasingly, home ownership relies on the classic feudal formula – being born into “the funnel of privilege.” In the U.S., millennials are three times as likely as boomers to count on inheritance for their retirement. Among the youngest cohort, those ages 18–22, over 60% see inheritance as their primary source of support as they age. In high-price markets like Los Angeles and Orange County, California, close to 40% of loans rely on family money for qualification, up from 25% in 2011. Threat to Democracy Most democratic or republican societies in history – in Athens, Rome, the Netherlands, Britain, France, North America, Oceania – were created and sustained by a broad property-owning middle class. In the twentieth century, middle-class asset growth was accomplished in large part by the expansion of an urban footprint beyond the city core, allowing many more citizens to buy property in spacious, safe environments offering a measure of privacy. The ideal of broadly dispersed property ownership has long been promoted by politicians, both right and left, in most high-income countries. “A nation of homeowners, of people who own a real share in their land, is unconquerable,” said President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He saw homeownership as critical not only to the economy but to democracy and the very idea of self-government. Today, the trend towards democratization of landownership is being reversed, with more and more people being pushed into living in rented apartments or houses, with little chance of gaining financial independence. An economy where most people rely upon wealth transfers from the more fortunate cannot easily coexist with a tradition of individual initiative and self-governance. At the very least, the drive to create lifetime renters and forced densification sets a stage for a future political conflict and social disruption, particularly for the younger generation. In a Harvard poll of 18- to 29-year-olds this year, housing ranked as the third-most important issue overall, after inflation and health care. In California, almost 70% of residents consider housing costs a major concern, while in Britain, housing rose to be one of the top five issues for voters, well ahead of defense, security, poverty, and crime. The housing affordability crisis impacts a host of life decisions. Studies of the U.S. have found that higher house prices had a direct impact on the decision of couples to have children. Research in Germany and across 18 European and North American nations also found that high housing prices defer family formation, leading to lower fertility as well as marriage rates, particularly among the working class. On the flip side, a new study by the Federal Reserve Board reports that homeowners are not only more affluent than renters, they are also physically and mentally healthier, vote more often, and their children achieve higher levels of education. Many advocates of forced densification and renting justify their views around “green” and “sustainability” concerns. The environmental magazine Grist has envisioned “a hero generation” that will escape the material trap of suburban living and work that engulfed their parents. One magazine editor proudly declared herself a part of the GINK generation (as in “green inclinations, no kids”) that she said meant not only a relatively care-free and low-cost adult life, but also “a lot of green good that comes from bringing fewer beings onto a polluted and crowded planet.” Less motivated by planetary concern, major Wall Street investors are also focusing on crowding people into small spaces and a life of permanent rentership. Britain’s Lloyds Bank and BlackRock have placed multi-billion-dollar bets on buying homes for the rental market. In the first quarter of 2021, investors accounted for roughly one out of every seven homes bought, a marked increase from previous years. A notion embraced by some financial groups as well as greens is one of a rentership society where people remain renters for life, enjoying their video games or attending to their houseplants, never knowing the pleasure of having a real garden or backyard of their own. It might assure a steady profit for the landlord class, but it would destroy the dream of ownership for the average person. The broader effect may resemble a modern form of feudalism, where both inherited wealth and institutional ownership, often the Church, concentrate control over housing. Need for Reform If unchecked, the pattern of declining ownership and rising prices for housing could shape the politics of the future, particularly among young people. Not surprisingly, many renters tend to favor leftist policies such as rent control and housing subsidies. The development of a class of permanent renters seems ideal for fomenting class warfare directed at an ever-shrinking number of owners, by a vast majority with no real assets, and little chance of getting any. Ultimately, the battle over land and property will define our future. We either accommodate hope among those in the next generation or force them to accept a lifetime of rental serfdom and permanent subservience to the state, or big capital, or both. As Conor Dougherty of The New York Times put it, “For all the focus on billionaires and stock prices, it’s home values that are a primary source of wealth inequality and the root of a generational schism between the housing-rich baby boomers and young adults today.” He quotes Edward Glaeser, a premier housing economist at Harvard, who said that the housing crisis has become “a huge hindrance on the quest for well-being and the pursuit of happiness.” We're proud to make our journalism accessible to everyone, but producing high-quality investigative pieces still comes at a cost.

Title: Economic Shifts Are Impacting Opportunities For Self-Directed IRAs

ByEric Satz ByEric Satz, Forbes Councils Member. Eric Satz is Founder and CEO of AltoIRA, which provides investment access with retirement savings to private market assets for all. Self-directed individual retirement accounts (IRAs) allow investors to put their retirement savings in private market assets like real estate, private equity, venture capital and crypto. The demand for self-directed IRAs has steadily grown as it has become easier for retail investors to open these accounts and tap into alternative markets. Anticipated major economic shifts will likely accelerate this trend in investor preferences. Investors must navigate several challenges in 2025 that make private market investment strategies through a self-directed IRA more appealing. Inflation has been stubbornly high since the Covid-19 pandemic. Prices could rise even more throughout 2025 due to tariffs and a global trade war. Consumers expect inflation to rise as high as 6.5% by year-end, according to an April 2025 survey from the University of Michigan. Inflation badly damages the returns of traditional fixed-income investments like bonds. It can also be a drag on stock market returns. On the other hand, physical assets like real estate hold their value during inflationary periods. Market interest rates are still high by recent historical standards, despite Federal Reserve rate cuts at the end of 2024. The Fed may need to keep rates high or even increase them to battle ongoing inflation. That would reduce bond prices and squeeze profit margins for companies, hurting their stock prices. Certain private market assets have more room to navigate high interest rates. Private credit funds may issue floating-rate debt, which allows them to earn more when rates go up, versus fixed-rate bonds that are locked in. Market volatility and uncertainty remain high as investors don’t know what to expect under new government policies. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, is around its highest level since 2022. Diversification across assets and markets remains the best protection against severe losses as it limits exposure to one area. Private market assets have a low correlation to traditional markets and can smooth out performance. For example, a hedge fund following a long-short strategy could still earn money during market declines, balancing out stock losses. Investors are adjusting their behaviors, portfolios and retirement plans in the face of economic changes. Preqin, a financial data analytics company recently acquired by BlackRock, forecasts that the global private asset market will nearly double over the next few years, going from $16.8 trillion in 2023 to $29.2 trillion in 2029. Financial research sheds light on the value of using a different approach. A KKR study at the end of 2022 compared risk and returns from 1927 to 2021 for a portfolio of 40/30/30 stocks, bonds and private market assets, versus a standard 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds. The portfolio with private market assets had higher average annual returns with less volatility, especially during periods of high inflation. Historically, inflation and market uncertainty create fear, pushing investors to more stable physical assets. While gold is a popular choice when investors are scared, other alternatives such as infrastructure and real estate offer similar protection. More importantly, they can generate income, whereas precious metals do not. Investors concerned about the 2025 economic trends could benefit in several ways by opening a self-directed IRA (SDIRA) for their retirement savings. • Tax Advantages: An SDIRA offers the same tax benefits as a traditional IRA: tax-deferred growth and an upfront tax deduction on contributions. Investors can tap into alternative markets while saving on taxes. • Diversification: Investors reduce risk and the chance of significant losses by adding uncorrelated assets to a portfolio. A self-directed IRA with alternative assets does so by not having all eggs in the traditional market basket. • Long-Term Growth: Many alternative investments offer higher growth potential. While these investments require a long-term focus, they can outperform the stock market over time. • Inflation Protection: Alternative assets perform especially well when inflation is high. An SDIRA provides this protection for retirement investors. At Alto, we strive to make investment options easy and cost-effective. For example, investors can now open an SDIRA in minutes thanks to online platforms like AltoIRA. The coming months will force investors to manage inflation, uncertainty and interest rate risk, a painful combination. Fortunately, modern investment strategies and capabilities are up to the task. Through an SDIRA, investors can tap into alternative markets previously only available to high-net-worth individuals. These other assets provide further diversification and are another hedge against economic risks. Investors should consult with their financial professionals to see how to optimize their portfolio for current market conditions and determine what role an SDIRA could play in expanding their retirement plan.

Title: Why the Government is banking on household batteries

Latest Topics The Nightly Topics Households will increasingly be doing the heavy lifting to manage Australia’s energy transition as the cost of building new poles and wires soars. On Friday, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) revealed that for the first time household solar and batteries will play a much more important role in the nation’s energy roadmap. According to AEMO, ‘consumer energy resources’ (CER) will transition from being an input to the grid, i.e., via exported solar in the middle of the day, to becoming an important component of demand management via the networking of household batteries. Sign up to The Nightly's newsletters. Get the first look at the digital newspaper, curated daily stories and breaking headlines delivered to your inbox. Australia is increasingly reliant on intermittent renewable resources for its energy mix, with as much as 40 per cent of power contributed from wind and solar, both rooftop and utility scale. 1 in 3 Australian households have rooftop solar, and when added to commercial rooftop solar arrays provide 25 gigawatts of energy. By comparison, Australia’s largest coal fired power plant, Eraring, contributes 2.9gW. But the excess of power created in the middle of the day has meant the economics of power generation has fundamentally changed, sending prices negative for hours and placing a potentially destabilising amount of load on the grid. As part of the Government’s net zero ambitions to get to 82 per cent renewable generation, an additional 11gw of energy will be added to the grid, much of which will also be delivered into the system during the middle of the day. According to Tim Buckley, a director at Climate Energy Finance and a former director at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, too much production could trigger the kind of blackout that shut down Spain’s and Portugal’s grid for a day. “Probably the biggest lesson out of Spain, was they’ve got one of the highest renewable energy penetrations in the developed world, but one of the lowest battery capacities in the world,” Mr Buckley said “We need batteries to time shift demand from when solar is generating to when consumers are demanding it, and that is invaluable for grid stability.” Labor has committed $2.3 billion to subsidise the take-up of 1 million household batteries by 2030, providing up to 30 per cent off the upfront cost of installing eligible small-scale battery systems. While Mr Buckley worried that adding 1 million batteries in such a short time frame could create the kind of scramble for unskilled operators that were the worst part of the Rudd government’s Pink Batts scheme, he said the speed with which batteries could be added to the network made them a far more efficient model than other large scale generation investments. “Building transmission takes 10 years. Building nuclear takes 20 years. Building a utility battery takes 18 months to two and a half years, if you have to include connection. But an electrician can install a solar and battery combo behind the meter in one week,” he said. That could mean the shift to renewable energy could occur at a much faster rate and for less money than originally envisaged. The Government’s Rewiring the Nation project allocates $19b to help build 4,581 km of new transmission lines to connect so called Renewable Energy Zones (REZ) to major capitals. But AEMO’s s Draft 2025 Electricity Network Options Report revealed construction costs on some projects had jumped as much as 55 per cent in the past two years driven by supply chain constraints, workforce shortages, and the sheer scale and complexity of new projects. Sustained community pushback had also meant many projects faced longer delays, and more community consultation before being approved. Mr Buckley said things had changed drastically since Chris Bowen’s clarion call that there was “no transition without transmission,” in Labor’ first term. “AEMO is acknowledging that they have massively underestimated batteries. It is a quantum leap forward in AEMO thinking. The integrated system plan was a brilliant roadmap at a time Australia did not have a roadmap for renewable generation. “What they’ve effectively done this week is said ‘technologies are moving massively, capital costs are moving massively, battery costs have halved, grid transmission costs have doubled, and we need to evaluate the priority,” Mr Buckley said. The push to integrate households into the wider grid may help ease a growing logjam across the network. With rollout of transmission lines delayed by construction restraints and consumer pushback, project developers were increasingly struggling to ensure access to the grid. That was creating economic challenges for financing development, putting some generation projects at jeopardy. Compounding the problem was a hodge-podge of various government agencies that resulted in a complicated approval process. “We’ve now got a situation where we’ve got an alphabet soup of Australian government and state level organisations, and to some degree, rather than having too little resources, we’ve now got the situation where no one’s accountable,” Mr Buckley said. NSW’s 1680 megawatt Waratah battery was a case in point, Mr Buckley said. Funded by global investment giant BlackRock, the battery project was to act as a shock absorber in the system. It’s construction was completed on time, but delayed approvals meant it was missing its revenue targets. “This is the biggest battery in NSW, if even BlackRock can’t get this done, are they going to do it again?” Mr Buckley asked. It is possible the construction of new transmission may not need to be as comprehensive as first envisaged. Increasingly, the providers of household poles and wires, such as Ausgrid, believe they can play a role in connecting renewable projects more efficiently. Ausgrid won the tender to connect Newcastle’s renewable energy zone, meaning wires could be added to existing infrastructure. Distribution networks, such as Ausgrid, are designed for maximum loads, meaning they are underutilised as much as 70 per cent of the time. That could allow them to carry the newly installed capacity rather than it be connected to new, expensive transmission networks. Mr Buckley said poles and wires were already Australia’s largest asset at a value of $105b. “I would rather reassess and actually optimise the grid, rather than spending $20b that will become $40b on new transmission,” he said.

Title: Nvidia's $43 billion question: Can Jensen Huang keep the AI hype train on track?
URL: https://qz.com/nvidia-q1-2025-earnings-stock-jensen-huang-ai-chips-1851782018
Time Published: 2025-05-27T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
Nvidia (NVDA) has become the almost undisputed poster child of the AI boom — and now it’s time to show the receipts. The $3.3 trillion chipmaker will report its fiscal first-quarter earnings for 2026 on Wednesday, and expectations are enormous. Analysts forecast a revenue surge to $43.26 billion, nearly 66% higher than the same quarter a year ago, with adjusted earnings per share jumping to $0.88 from $0.61, a growth of about 44%. Still, those forecasts might be selling the semiconductor giant short. The company has a habit of surpassing earnings expectations — topping earnings estimates by an average of about 7% in the last two quarters. Nvidia, whose chips have become the backbone of modern artificial intelligence, has been on a staggering run. But with stakes this high, investors are laser-focused on whether Nvidia’s latest bets — such as its next-gen Blackwell platform, deepening cloud partnerships, and response to U.S.-China chip tensions — will deliver the kind of blockbuster quarter the markets have come to expect. At the heart of Nvidia’s revenue machine is its Data Center business, which has grown into its largest and most profitable segment thanks to insatiable demand from cloud providers, AI startups, and enterprise customers building foundation models. Analysts expect this division alone to generate $21.27 billion in Q1 revenue. CEO Jensen Huang has positioned Nvidia not just as a chipmaker but as the infrastructure layer powering the AI revolution. The company is hoping that narrative continues with Blackwell, the GPU architecture introduced in March that Huang says will unlock the training and deployment of models that are orders of magnitude more powerful than current systems. The flagship GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip is already being integrated by hyperscalers such as Amazon Web Services (AMZN), Google Cloud (GOOGL), Microsoft Azure (MSFT), and Oracle (ORCL). Nvidia may be dominant, but it’s not operating in a vacuum. Rival chipmakers like AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) are racing to close the performance gap, while companies such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are doubling down on custom silicon to reduce reliance on third-party GPUs. At the same time, a wave of Chinese AI chipmakers is emerging as Nvidia contends with export restrictions, creating fresh competitive pressure in one of its most important markets. But Nvidia isn’t just about GPUs anymore. As investor expectations climb, the company is quietly broadening its AI stack — moving beyond silicon into networking, software, and cloud integration in a bid to become the full-stack backbone of AI infrastructure. Nvidia is deepening its economic moat and creating more stable, recurring revenue streams that could smooth earnings volatility over time. Through partnerships with major cloud providers, Nvidia is embedding itself into the very platforms AI developers rely on. Basically: Nvidia is trying to become more than just a supplier of AI tools. The company wants to become a critical platform for AI development itself. Investors will be watching closely for clear evidence that Nvidia’s expansion beyond GPUs is starting to pay off in revenue. Wall Street wants to see whether the company’s networking products are contributing to meaningful growth within the data center segment. Margins will also be a key focus. Networking and software typically deliver higher profitability than hardware, so any signs of margin expansion would support the narrative that Nvidia is transforming into a more durable, high-margin platform business. (Which could reassure investors that Nvidia’s growth is sustainable and not just tied to cyclical chip demand.) Finally, Wall Street will listen for signs that Nvidia’s AI software stack is gaining adoption among large enterprises outside the hyperscaler ecosystem — into sectors such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing — which would highlight the long-term potential of Nvidia’s platform strategy and reinforce the company’s role as the backbone of AI development. There is, of course, a major x-factor: China. Nvidia is ground zero in the U.S.-China tech rivalry — its GPUs might just be the most valuable components in the AI arms race, and its position is increasingly shaped by policy, not just engineering. Nvidia has long relied on the Chinese market for a sizable chunk of its revenue, but that has changed dramatically in the wake of tightening U.S. export controls and tariffs. Huang said recently that years of U.S. restrictions on AI chip exports were a strategic misfire that cost Nvidia billions and handed Chinese rivals a powerful incentive to innovate. Nvidia, which was once dominant in China with a market share approaching 95% at the start of the Biden administration, now holds just 50%, Huang has said. To defend — and expand — its foothold, Nvidia is looking to establish an R&D center in Shanghai and is reportedly preparing further downgraded chip models that comply with U.S. rules. Investors will be looking to see the impact of U.S. export controls: how much they’ve dented sales, whether downgraded chips can sustain demand in China, and more. Wall Street will also be watching for any supply chain stress; Nvidia relies heavily on TSMC (TSM) for manufacturing, and its capacity constraints remain a gating factor. While the company remains dominant in many global markets — and is expanding into the Middle East through Saudi Arabia, in what one analyst called a “watershed moment,” and the United Arab Emirates — Wall Street will be looking for updates on how Nvidia plans to navigate what could be its most challenging international landscape in years. Nvidia is the poster child of the AI trade, and its financial performance serves as a high-frequency indicator of how far the generative AI economy has progressed from hype to hard returns. A strong beat would signal that tech giants (see: Microsoft, Google, Amazon) are continuing to pour billions into AI infrastructure, reaffirming the AI investment thesis that has largely powered the Nasdaq’s rally. Nvidia’s valuation is rich, but so are many other AI-linked names. If Nvidia meets or beats expectations, it could justify the current risk appetite for high-growth names. But a miss, even a tiny one, could trigger a sentiment reset. If forward guidance is strong, it’ll show that enterprises are starting to spend on AI beyond experiments — e.g., in areas such as software integration, inference, and LLM deployment. Nvidia’s stock has been on quite a wild ride in 2025. After hitting a high earlier in the year, shares fell amid broader market turbulence and investor anxiety about whether the AI trade had gotten overheated. President Donald Trump’s April 2 “Liberation Day” announcement sent the stock into a sharp dip, but it has since rebounded. Now, this quarter’s results could be a clearing event that could reestablish momentum. One looming concern: supply chain capacity. Demand for Nvidia’s chips continues to exceed supply, and while the company has worked to scale production, it may still be leaving money on the table simply due to how long it takes to manufacture and deliver its most advanced products. Investors will also be watching closely for details on capital expenditures and supply chain resilience. Wall Street will want to see how aggressively Nvidia is investing to expand capacity, whether through additional foundry partnerships or securing more critical components. Any signs that supply constraints are easing — or worsening — could influence how sustainable current growth trajectories appear. But the big question now is whether Nvidia can not only meet but beat expectations — something it has done consistently. While Nvidia remains possibly the most important company in the world’s hottest tech sector, that also means the pressure is greater than ever.

Title: Tether invests $5 billion profit into US companies while holding $120 billion in US debt

Tether's $5 billion profit reinvestment fuels Bitcoin innovation, brain-interface breakthroughs, and decentralized media. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin USDT, has disclosed that it has reinvested around $5 billion of its profits into US-based companies and infrastructure over the past two years. In a May 26 post on X, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino disclosed that the company has made significant investments across American businesses and emerging technologies, reflecting what many described as a “pro-America” strategy. According to Ardoino, the investments cover a range of sectors, including decentralized media, neuroscience, and Bitcoin mining. Notable recipients include Rumble, a video-sharing platform; Blackrock Neurotech, a brain-computer interface (BCI) startup; and several Bitcoin mining firms such as Swan Bitcoin. In one of its most significant moves, Tether acquired over 100 million Class A shares of Rumble for $770 million in January to support decentralized content platforms. Since then, the USDT issuer has collaborated with Rumble to launch a non-custodial Bitcoin and stablecoin wallet. Another $200 million was funneled into Blackrock Neurotech in April 2024. The funding has reportedly supported medical breakthroughs, including efforts to restore patient communication abilities through brain-implanted devices. The company is also backing Bitcoin infrastructure. It has started allocating current and future hashrate to OCEAN, a mining pool operated by Mummolin Inc., a Wyoming-based firm. However, its relationship with Swan Bitcoin has become strained, with a legal dispute now underway. Beyond these equity investments, Tether has built a prominent position in US Treasuries. The company holds over $120 billion in total exposure through direct purchases, money market funds, and reverse repo agreements. This makes Tether the 19th-largest holder of US Treasury bills globally, surpassing Germany’s $111.4 billion exposure, based on US Treasury Department data. The assets serve as its stablecoin reserves and are critical in maintaining USDT’s dollar peg. Most are reportedly held at Cantor Fitzgerald, a leading US financial institution. Meanwhile, Tether’s aggressive investment strategy follows a record-breaking year. In January, the firm reported over $13 billion in net profits for 2024. These earnings have strengthened its balance sheet and allowed for further expansion in agriculture, sports, and media despite ongoing scrutiny from regulators. While USDT remains the largest stablecoin and the third-biggest crypto asset by market cap, regulatory uncertainty in the US has led Tether to consider issuing a separate stablecoin tailored to comply with forthcoming rules.

Title: Employees are sick and tired of 'engagement surveys' at work
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/employees-sick-tired-engagement-surveys-managers-happiness-hr-2025-5
Time Published: 2025-05-27T08:17:01Z
Full Content:
"Satisfaction surveys" promise to make offices happier. Do they work? Iwas in a particularly sour mood at an old job one afternoon when a notification popped up in Slack, reminding me to fill out my Peakon, the employee engagement survey our HR department used. In exchange for our candor, the HR team promised total anonymity and assured us that our concerns and comments would be heard by top brass. I liked my job, so I typically filled these surveys out with a perfunctory four-out-of-five-star acquiescence, never eager to rock the boat. I truly cannot recall now what had made my day so bad, but I decided to take it out on the survey. In response to extremely mundane questions about my daily motivation and whether my work goals were clearly defined, I said things like this organization absolutely stinks and our customers are marks. I was specific without revealing my identity, but I lurched roundhouse kicks like no sane person would work here if they had a better option. With the vitriol of an anonymous Yelp reviewer, I let 'er rip. It felt amazing — in the moment. The next morning, I found in my inbox a letter from the CEO. Sent via Peakon, it said something to the effect of, I can't tell who you are. But it seems you're unhappy. I have an offer for you. If I identified myself and then resigned, they'd give me a bit more than a standard severance. My resignation would be written as a layoff, so I could collect unemployment, and they'd even hook me up with the external recruiters they used to staff the company, to help me find a better role in some place where I would be happier. My employer was not doing layoffs or buyouts, and no one else, to my knowledge, had gotten this kind of offer. It seemed the object of my unhappiness at work had struck a nerve. While you may have a manager who genuinely loves you and wants you to be happy, the reality is that from an organizational perspective, your happiness at work has a literal, and hefty, price tag. Companies spend a fortune finding and hiring talent; it can cost 15% to 25% of a role's salary to source the right person to fill an opening. Maybe my old CEO (who through a representative declined to comment for this story) agreed strongly with the market firm MSW's survey that found that disengaged workers are 2.5 times as likely as an engaged worker to leave a company, and he just wanted me to get on with it. A Gallup survey found that about one-third of US workers were "actively engaged" at work in 2023, with the larger pool of less engaged and "actively disengaged" workers (who make mistakes at work more often and show up to work less often) accounting for an estimated $1.9 trillion in lost productivity. Our "engagement" — the quality by which work feels immediate and meaningful — was defined as recently as 1990 by the Boston University professor of organizational behavior William Kahn, whose studies around employee engagement transformed how corporations think about workforce productivity. Employees who are not able to engage with their jobs are rendered "emotionally, cognitively and psychologically unavailable," as Kahn has put it. Negative and positive engagement is now considered an indicator of both positive and negative lagging effects for businesses, including profitability, turnover, and employee absenteeism. So for the last 35 years, HR departments everywhere have created a culture of questionnaires determined to uncover, isolate, and nurture their company's engagement. There's a very good chance you've been pinged and asked sometime in the past few months to fill out your Deel engagement survey, or your ThriveSparrow, SurveyMonkey, Workleap, Paycom, Lattice, People Element, or Engagedly. Software companies generated almost a billion dollars in 2023 selling and administering third-party engagement surveys to corporations everywhere. Peakon sold to Workday in 2021 for $700 million. A 2021 fundraising round catapulted the Melbourne, Australia-founded engagement startup Culture Amp to unicorn status, with a $1.5 billion valuation. The action is picking up, as increasingly dispersed post-COVID workforces have exacerbated the need for more vibe checks. If you're in the business of soliciting opinions from employees, business is booming. Less satisfied with employee satisfaction surveys are many of the employees taking them. Some two-thirds of US employees believe their companies don't respond to engagement surveys in a meaningful way, according to a Quantum Workplace survey of more than a thousand workers. "Employee surveys mostly seem like a way for the executive suite to pat themselves on the back," Nick Gaudio, the creative director at the Austin-based chatbot startup Manychat, tells me. "They want to believe in the power of anonymity to induce honesty, but at the end of the day, the power dynamic is always there, hanging over the head of their employees." While I experienced a surprising assertion of this power dynamics firsthand — my bosses didn't like my answers, and tried to do something about it — in general, the people I spoke to for this story placed surveys in the taxonomic rank of workplace annoyances somewhere around "filling out timesheets." Surveys can be annoying because they're persistent, doubly so when you perceive that your employers won't do much with the results. This can lead to survey fatigue, where the response rate falls off a cliff after being asked to submit too many. When you're constantly filing your anonymous grievances into an anonymous digital suggestion box, you may begin to wonder not if the survey will help improve your workplace, but if you aren't perhaps participating in a kind of "snitchware." Are you voluntarily telling on yourself? If we survey the history of surveys, we find that they were once considered novel, exciting, and based in real utility, much as the kanban project management board was born out of a working system in a real factory. Before World War I, most bosses were primarily concerned with their employees' external lives and work outcomes — the inner toils and happiness quotients mattered very little, as the historian Sanford Jacoby wrote in a 2008 paper called "Employee Attitude Surveys in Historical Perspective." But strikes and wartime labor shortages gave the workforce some modicum of power. This gave the educational psychologist J. David Houser the perfect platform to take the "consumer attitude studies" he'd been doing on behalf of public utilities into an entirely new field of study: employee satisfaction and morale. By the early 1940s, satisfaction surveys found a champion in the armed forces. Because soldier morale began to be considered paramount to defense success, the military took the results of personnel surveys seriously. This led to some drastic changes, including introducing combat badges, requiring psychological evaluations for returned soldiers, and even helping along the eventual desegregation of the armed forces. (Today, the government's Office of Personnel Management notably conducts agency- and government-wide surveys as a resource for the public trust.) Decades later, Kahn, "the godfather of employee engagement," set up a brilliant framework for understanding employee satisfaction outside the binary of happy/sad. That same anonymity that Gaudio railed against can also promote a kind of equity. Jenna Eichberg, the chief people officer at AlertMedia, tells me that because surveys aggregate an entire organization's feedback, you don't have to overindex your worry about the loudest outliers. "You can't chase one person. You're here to serve a majority of your workforce," she says, and the beauty of the big dataset is that you can hear just as much from shy employees, or from "people who're different than the ones who mostly talk to you in person." Phil Wilburn, the VP of people analytics at Workday, agrees. A survey, he tells me over email, "gives people who might not feel comfortable speaking up in a meeting — whether they're introverted, more junior, or part of an underrepresented group — a safe space to share their thoughts. And it helps managers respond to those concerns thoughtfully, without putting anyone on the spot." Still, Eichberg says, if your employees don't feel heard, it's because you're not making them feel heard. "The biggest mistake organizations make is they do all these surveys and they collect all this data, but they don't actually do something with it," she says. "Or they do something with it, and they don't go back and tell their workforce what they did with it." The head of people at a small LA-based startup tells me that his organization similarly seems to freeze whenever a surprising result or answer pops out of the survey black box. "I tell my CEO that by the time a comment winds up in the survey, it's already tried to reach you some other way," he says. Surveys, he continues, are "only as good as the relationships between the people in the company and only as effective as the executives who have to do something about it." So while anonymity can lend itself to candor and equity, it might still sometimes fail in the way of promoting actual conversation and trust. Consider a 2021 survey from The Workforce Institute that found that only 37% of entry-level employees believe their colleagues are completely honest in their answers and assessments. If 43% of workers fear retaliation for speaking up at work, per a survey from the Institute of Business Ethics, anonymity can only help so much. In the same way remote employees have learned to keep their Slack icon "green," to avoid suspicion of blowing off work, some workers have self-taught to never be entirely honest with their HR surveys. Last year at Amazon, CEO Andy Jassy issued a memo requiring five-days-a-week RTO, touching on connection and communication as principal tenets for this decision. Enough workers were dissatisfied enough to launch their own internal survey about RTO, an ironic Uno reverse card usage of the employee questionnaire to critique how little they felt the self-declared "Earth's Best Employer" was listening. A former boss once lamented to me that surveys are, by design, akin to "interviewing for pain" — regardless of their intention, they tend to draw out complaints and gripes that aren't as serious as they seem. This may be true, but when you consider the total anonymity of the survey, how is a boss supposed to tell the genuine complaint from the Reddit-like bloviating? In a work world with increasingly labyrinthine and opaque hiring processes, the crisis of "ghost jobs," and built on the legacy of Michael Scott hating Toby, it's not surprising that we're mired in an ongoing HR credibility crisis, with so many workers rejecting the supposed efficacy and value of something as supposedly useful as surveys. When I ask William Kahn about this hierarchical arrangement and fear of self-reporting, he tells me that "ideally, there would be no need for surveys that are in the service of helping managers understand the experiences, thoughts, and insights of their workers." In an open, trusting workplace, he says, "communication would flow freely based on the idea that the work and healthy relationships matter more than the need of managers to be adored and obeyed." Even so, he adds, "surveys would still be useful to get quick checks on the results of interventions designed to enable workers to fully engage their work." I ended up not taking my CEO's stunning buyout offer. I was a diligent, productive, and engaged worker, and I believe the CEO was conflating and confusing this engagement with my happiness. Kahn tells me that "highly engaged members are satisfied with their roles and experiences," but "whether they are 'happy' or not — which has as much to do with the totality of their lives — is a different matter." More importantly, that CEO seemed to see the survey results as an end point, evidence of some unfixable condition, and not some part of a workforce to maintain, nurture, and encourage. They supposed that if only we could have more engaged workers, we'd be better off, without contending that the survey revealed opportunity, not a definitive answer. It was, ironically, the moment I thought of most often when I did make the decision to leave the following year. Matt Alston's writing has appeared in Wired, Rolling Stone, Playboy, and Believer.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: Google’s AI updates are portent of antitrust cases to come

Save 35% on an annual Digiday+ membership. This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Friday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → Alphabet’s AI advancements continue to wow Wall Street, but they’re raising eyebrows with regulators in Washington, D.C., and last week’s launches at Google Marketing Live should cause advertisers on Madison Avenue to reserve judgment. Despite several tussles with the Justice Department and hand-wringing over the fate of third-party cookies, the company’s stock price popped last week, as the markets gauged Alphabet’s revenue plans following the Google I/O and Google Marketing Live announcements. The Google Marketing Live updates include several AI-powered advertising products and capabilities across Search and YouTube (see below). The offerings focus on simplifying creative production, enhancing targeting precision, heralding predictive intelligence, with Google’s Vidya Srinivasan, vp and general manager, ads & commerce, Google, claiming they can “remove the guesswork and drive measurable impact.” Key product launches and capabilities include: These product updates reflect Google’s broader strategy to embed AI across the advertising lifecycle — from discovery and creative to delivery and performance — making ads more relevant, actionable, and efficient. When Google speaks, the entire advertising industry should listen, but as several disclosures in the antitrust trials of the last two years show, this should never be in an obsequious manner. Several Digiday sources attempted to read between the lines of Google’s product announcements last week, and concluded that it is trying to define measurement and control optimization as the AI wars with Big Tech continue. This is the playbook that led to its colossal success, and some fear history may repeat itself. Nathan Woodman, founder of Proof-in-Data, observed how the two key innovations, i.e., new AI formats enhancing user experience and measurement tools like AI Max, although he warned the tools may prioritize Google’s revenue growth over advertisers’ success. “There’s a lot of people who have a problem with handing the keys over to Google,” said Woodman. “In many cases, you get the people inside an organization doing the media buying, they look at the dashboard, they look at the screen… they can lose a critical eye as to what’s happening.” According to Woodman, who formerly held senior roles at several digital media agencies, this can lead to “a GPS-effect,” a phenomenon whereby “the GPS is telling you where to go, but you don’t really look around.” Several sources noted that while the potential for the latest announcements to help marketers is clear, but questioning the provenance of these news systems is critical, as “blindly following the GPS is detrimental.” Key questions to ask Google about its AI systems Digiday sources advised marketers to interrogate the below issues when considering the latest Google AI tools. This is because Google’s strategy involves integrating AI agents to control budgets, bids, planning, and creative decisions, and Google has a proven track record for favoring its own systems. Robert Webster, CEO of TAU Marketing Solutions, noted how Microsoft and Google are positioning their tools to control the web, with this competition likely to prove a concern at Google HQ as many doubt its ability to monetize search in the AI-era compared to its earlier fortunes. “What everyone is fighting to be is the orchestration layer… where you use their agents to do things,” he added. “Microsoft’s hook is that everyone has a license for Word and Excel, so you’ll use them to do it. Google’s hook is that you spend most of your money with Google, you’ll want to use their agents to connect to Google Ads and your data seamlessly.” Webster, formerly a senior executive at WPP’s media investment arm, notes that this AI arms race should cause concern among regulators — Bloomberg likewise reported such DOJ scrutiny last week — with the concerns raised about Google’s AI an echo of those documented in the most recent antitrust case. “From a DOJ point of view, isn’t that a control game… these agents will do things like decide budgets, decide bids, decide planning, and what creative to run,” observed Webster. “If they’re built on Google systems, will Google be able to tweak them to help Google?” “Everything is broken, because it’s designed to be that way… There’s a lot of people out there who are just afraid to ask the right questions, and AI is only going to intensify that.” – A veteran media agency exec discusses how history seems to be repeating itself at the recent Digiday Programmatic Marketing Summit, where agency execs grumbled over measurement and attribution. WTF just happened to the IAB Europe’s TCF — and what does it mean for targeted ads in the EU?

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: Google’s AI updates are portent of antitrust cases to come

More from the series → Alphabet’s AI advancements continue to wow Wall Street, but they’re raising eyebrows with regulators in Washington, D.C., and last week’s launches at Google Marketing Live should cause advertisers on Madison Avenue to reserve judgment. Despite several tussles with the Justice Department and hand-wringing over the fate of third-party cookies, the company’s stock price popped last week, as the markets gauged Alphabet’s revenue plans following the Google I/O and Google Marketing Live announcements. The Google Marketing Live updates include several AI-powered advertising products and capabilities across Search and YouTube (see below). The offerings focus on simplifying creative production, enhancing targeting precision, heralding predictive intelligence, with Google’s Vidya Srinivasan, vp and general manager, ads & commerce, Google, claiming they can “remove the guesswork and drive measurable impact.” Key product launches and capabilities include: These product updates reflect Google’s broader strategy to embed AI across the advertising lifecycle — from discovery and creative to delivery and performance — making ads more relevant, actionable, and efficient. When Google speaks, the entire advertising industry should listen, but as several disclosures in the antitrust trials of the last two years show, this should never be in an obsequious manner. Several Digiday sources attempted to read between the lines of Google’s product announcements last week, and concluded that it is trying to define measurement and control optimization as the AI wars with Big Tech continue. This is the playbook that led to its colossal success, and some fear history may repeat itself. Nathan Woodman, founder of Proof-in-Data, observed how the two key innovations, i.e., new AI formats enhancing user experience and measurement tools like AI Max, although he warned the tools may prioritize Google’s revenue growth over advertisers’ success. “There’s a lot of people who have a problem with handing the keys over to Google,” said Woodman. “In many cases, you get the people inside an organization doing the media buying, they look at the dashboard, they look at the screen… they can lose a critical eye as to what’s happening.” According to Woodman, who formerly held senior roles at several digital media agencies, this can lead to “a GPS-effect,” a phenomenon whereby “the GPS is telling you where to go, but you don’t really look around.” Several sources noted that while the potential for the latest announcements to help marketers is clear, but questioning the provenance of these news systems is critical, as “blindly following the GPS is detrimental.” Key questions to ask Google about its AI systems Digiday sources advised marketers to interrogate the below issues when considering the latest Google AI tools. This is because Google’s strategy involves integrating AI agents to control budgets, bids, planning, and creative decisions, and Google has a proven track record for favoring its own systems. Robert Webster, CEO of TAU Marketing Solutions, noted how Microsoft and Google are positioning their tools to control the web, with this competition likely to prove a concern at Google HQ as many doubt its ability to monetize search in the AI-era compared to its earlier fortunes. “What everyone is fighting to be is the orchestration layer… where you use their agents to do things,” he added. “Microsoft’s hook is that everyone has a license for Word and Excel, so you’ll use them to do it. Google’s hook is that you spend most of your money with Google, you’ll want to use their agents to connect to Google Ads and your data seamlessly.” Webster, formerly a senior executive at WPP’s media investment arm, notes that this AI arms race should cause concern among regulators — Bloomberg likewise reported such DOJ scrutiny last week — with the concerns raised about Google’s AI an echo of those documented in the most recent antitrust case. “From a DOJ point of view, isn’t that a control game… these agents will do things like decide budgets, decide bids, decide planning, and what creative to run,” observed Webster. “If they’re built on Google systems, will Google be able to tweak them to help Google?” “Everything is broken, because it’s designed to be that way… There’s a lot of people out there who are just afraid to ask the right questions, and AI is only going to intensify that.” – A veteran media agency exec discusses how history seems to be repeating itself at the recent Digiday Programmatic Marketing Summit, where agency execs grumbled over measurement and attribution. WTF just happened to the IAB Europe’s TCF — and what does it mean for targeted ads in the EU? Perplexity is burning through cash, quickly While the AI-powered search engine has been able to increase its subscription revenue and users in the past 12 months, that growth has come at a large cost. According to The Information, Perplexity generated $34 million in revenue in 2024, but burned through $65 million in cash, which was spent on cloud servers and AI models which power much of its answers.

May 26, 2025 21:54 ET | Source: Grabar Law Office Grabar Law Office PHILADELPHIA, May 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV): If you have held DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV) shares since prior to November 10, 2023, and would like to learn more about the investigation and your rights, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/doubleverify-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085. Grabar Law Office is investigating whether officers and directors of DoubleVerify breached their fiduciary duties owed to the company. Why? As alleged in an underlying securities fraud class action complaint, DoubleVerify, via certain of its officers, failed to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the above, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. What You Can Do Now: Current DoubleVerify shareholders who have held DoubleVerify shares since prior to November 10, 2023, can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to them whatsoever. If you would like to learn more about this matter, you are encouraged to visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/doubleverify-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. NAPCO Securities Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC) Shareholder Class Action Survives Motion to Dismiss: If you are a Current NAPCO Securities Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC) shareholder who has held NAPCO shares since prior to November 7, 2022, you can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. Click here to join or learn more: https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/Napco-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. Why? Key allegations in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint have survived a motion to dismiss. That complaint alleges that NAPCO Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC), through certain of its officers and directors, made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) NAPCO failed to address any material weaknesses with internal controls regarding cost of goods sold ("COGS") and inventory; (2) NAPCO downplayed the severity of material weaknesses regarding their internal controls; (3) NAPCO’s unaudited financial statements from September 30, 2022 to the present included “certain errors” such as overstating inventory and understanding net COGS, resulting in overstated gross profit, operating income and net income for each period; (4) as a result, NAPCO would need to restate its previously filed unaudited financial statements for certain periods; and (5) as a result, Defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. On April 11, 2025, the federal court determined that key allegations would survive Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint. “Plaintiffs have adequately stated Exchange Act claims by pleading scienter [knowledge of wrongdoing] through defendants’ unusual stock sales and by plausibly alleging loss causation between the corrective announcement and stock price drop. Plaintiffs have also stated Securities Act claims against NAPCO and the underwriter defendants.” “Taking the well-pleaded facts as true, there is no question that plaintiffs have adequately pled scienter. First, the stock sales were highly unusual in timing and amount. As to amount, the total proceeds of over $108 million from stock sales by the officer defendants weigh in favor of a motive. . . . And the officer defendants sold hefty percentages of their holdings – 48.5% for Soloway and 45.5% for Buchel.” What To Do Now: If you have held NAPCO shares since before November 7, 2022 and would like to learn more about this matter, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/Napco-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H.

Grabar Law Office is investigating whether certain officers and directors of Pacira breached their fiduciary duties owed to the company. Why: A recently filed securities fraud class action complaint alleges that Pacira, via certain of its officers, disseminated materially false and misleading statements and/or concealed material adverse facts concerning the validity and scope of the Company's patents. On August 9, 2024, Pacira announced that the New Jersey District Court had invalidated its ‘495 patent. This announcement surprised investors and analysts alike as they reacted immediately to the revelations, and the price of Pacira’s common stock declined dramatically. What You Can Do Now: Current Pacira shareholders who have held Pacira shares since prior to August 2, 2023, can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to them whatsoever.

Title: Avalanche Active Addresses Hit All-Time High, Will AXAX Price Retest $40?

Avalanche holders expect a bull window that could take assets to levels not reached in months. The network records skyrocketing new users alongside an uptick in trading volume. The surge follows a broader increase in decentralized finance (DeFi) activity and institutional inroads into crypto assets. Avalanche recorded significant gains last week, hitting a new all-time high in active users. According to a Dune report, network addresses soared to 1.95 million after consistently growing in May. This kicks off another bullish trend after the previous attempt in January due to a perceived broader altcoin rally. However, this wave is steered by institutional backing and frenzy in the blockchain gaming ecosystem. The launch of MapleStory Universe, the web3 version of Nexon’s RPG franchise, has boosted network demand, directly impacting sentiments. The game marked over 30 million transactions from 1 million wallets in its test phase, taking it above average in the gaming tier. The platform’s pivot to Avalanche is crucial for performance and scalability and will benefit AVAX holders on a broader scale. Recent activity spikes will drive up demand for staking and gas. While blockchain gaming suffered setbacks in Q1 2025 due to low DeFi activity, industry experts bid a smooth reversal this quarter. Similarly, on-chain data shows non-fungible token (NFT) transactions near the 2 million mark for the first time in two years. This DeFi resurgence has bolstered AVAX holders in the past weeks. When writing, AVAX price trades at $23.15, a 3.5% uptick in 24 hours, while money gains soared above 21%. Following recent network activity, bulls aim to retest the $40 price if it beats the current resistance. The short-term $27 resistance is a key breakout zone for the asset that could lead to a two-phase leap to $34 and $40. Some bulls pitched a parabolic rally to $50, which will rest on huge institutional adoption. Institutional asset manager BlackRock has contributed immensely to Avalanche’s bullish momentum. The $9 trillion asset manager has launched BUIDL, BlackRock’s tokenized US Dollar treasury fund on Avalanche. This allows users to lock up and trade SBUIDL tokens, expanding the ecosystem to wider users. AVA Labs President John Wu lauded the growth in tokenization and BlackRock’s institutional fund. “The financial landscape is undergoing a vast transformation. As more institutions move towards tokenization, we see significant leaps towards transformative digital financial services such as BUIDL that address investor demand and bring to bear blockchain-enabled capabilities and differentiators,” he added.

Title: BlackRock Issues Bitcoin Warning, Says BTC Source Code Could Be Rendered ‘Flawed or Ineffective’ by Quantum Computing

The biggest asset manager in the world has acknowledged the potential of a critical threat that could weigh on Bitcoin (BTC) in the future. In its updated prospectus for its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), BlackRock mentions quantum computing under its “risk factors” section. Quantum computers are considered by many to be a potential threat to Bitcoin due to their theoretical ability to, in the future, override the cryptographic schemes that secure blockchains. While quantum computers have not yet demonstrated an ability to come anywhere close to threatening Bitcoin, BlackRock says it, along with other technological advances, could render the flagship cryptocurrency “flawed and ineffective.” “…In the past, flaws in the source code for digital assets have been exposed and exploited, including flaws that disabled some functionality for users, exposed users’ personal information and/or resulted in the theft of users’ digital assets. The cryptography underlying Bitcoin could prove to be flawed or ineffective, or developments in mathematics and/or technology, including advances in digital computing, algebraic geometry and quantum computing, could result in such cryptography becoming ineffective. In any of these circumstances, a malicious actor may be able to compromise the security of the Bitcoin network or take the Trust’s Bitcoin, which would adversely affect the value of the Shares. Moreover, the functionality of the Bitcoin network may be negatively affected such that it is no longer attractive to users, thereby dampening demand for Bitcoin. Even if another digital asset other than bitcoin were affected by similar circumstances, any reduction in confidence in the source code or cryptography underlying digital assets generally could negatively affect the demand for digital assets and therefore adversely affect the value of the Shares. Moreover, because digital assets, including bitcoin, have been in existence for a short period of time and are continuing to develop, there may be additional risks in the future that are impossible to predict as of the date of this prospectus.” BlacRock’s IBIT – which is believed to be the most successful ETF of all time, currently has $70.1 billion worth of Bitcoin backing it. BTC is trading at $109,483 at time of writing.

Title: Indevin sells ex-Villa Maria buildings to BlackRock; wee problem blights rich-lister’s boatshed; garage-dwelling landlord - Property Insider

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Multitrillion-dollar American fund swoops on Māngere vineyard buildings; bladders blight rich-lister’s boatshed; garage-dwelling landlord seeks justice; Fletcher Living on next cladding steps: all in today’s Property Insider column. An entity associated with multitrillion-dollar United States-headquartered BlackRock has bought Auckland’s ex-Villa Maria Estate buildings, previously owned by Marlborough wine business Indevin. On Friday, it was revealed on Markets with Madison that Indevin no longer owned the former winery buildings. Grant Webster, Tourism Holdings’ CEO, talked about his company leasing the property but not from Indevin. He showed off how the premises had been re-purposed for campervan operations and said the tourism business spent $20 million on groundworks alone to create the new giant parking lot. A title search of THL’s new HQ address indicated the owner. Eden Villa Sub Limited Partnership owns 470 Oruarangi Rd, buying from Tomlinson Core Land, owned by Harrogate Trustee, whose directors include Indevin’s Greg Tomlinson. Last August, that limited partnership was formed and the title was transferred, with a mortgage to the Bank of China (New Zealand). When it registered the limited partnership, the email was groupFBGREAFV@blackrock.com. At the first filing in March, the email was changed to BlackRock-NZ@intertrustgroup.com. A BlackRock spokeswoman said from Sydney yesterday that the purchase was a joint venture between that business and Mayfair Group. “Secured off-market via City Logistics Co, the asset offers strategic airport proximity and a significantly underutilised site coverage of 33%. “Improvements were made to the site both before and post- acquisition. Tourism Holdings has consolidated its global headquarters on-site with the signing of a long-term lease – underscoring our confidence in New Zealand’s last-mile logistics sector.” Research from CBRE in March said the transaction was for $63.5m, making it the third largest non-residential New Zealand sale in last year’s second half. Next door on land where grapes once famously grew, Goodman Property Trust plans a $500m+ logistics and warehouse development on the ex-vineyard land. Auckland Council’s rating valuation on the ex-Villa Maria address of 7ha is $39.5m. The THL HQ is not the only BlackRock purchase lately. Last April, a partnership managed and advised by global business BlackRock won consent to buy Auckland land in a $110m deal. The name was not dissimilar to that on the THL HQ title. Eden Puaki Drive Sub Limited Partnership won consent to buy 5.81ha of non-sensitive land at 20 Puaki Dr, Wiri. That partnership is described as “funds managed and advised by entities associated with BlackRock, comprised of entities which are 90% overseas-owned”. Owning one of Auckland’s iconic, historic boatsheds is not without its challenges. Businessman Malcolm Dick wants to demolish one of the 17 all-in-a-row Ngāpipi sheds on the water in Ōrākei and rebuild. His application is up for public input till later next month. Last week, he talked to the Herald from Spain where he had walked part of the Camino with wife Jodie Dick. From there, he told how he paid about $800,000 for the smallest boatshed, which is set back from the water and the street. Due to that property having some land, it attracts those who need to relieve themselves, he said. People urinate around his shed, he complained. “People come along and pee in the corner beside the boatshed, unfortunately.” He wants the new shed to be higher up off the water so it’s not as affected by flooding or coastal inundation. He also wants to build a new boat ramp into the water. Taking up more of the site would perhaps deter those with full bladders, although that was not used to argue in favour of the new scheme. A landlord living in a garage went to the Tenancy Tribunal to get his home out of a fixed-term agreement with a tenant so he could return there. But the tribunal refused him. The unusual circumstances occurred when landlord Graham Mark Shieff tried to get possession of his place back from the tenant. Suppression orders apply to her name, the property address and location. Last August, Shieff told the tenant he needed to sell the property because he was moving to Australia. She has two children who live with her full time and other children who come at weekends. This was a stressful time for her because she then helped with open homes and presenting the property for sale. She felt this was hard on her mental health, the decision said. He got a conditional sale of the house, then suffered health problems resulting in two surgeries, so he had to withdraw the property from the market. He then tried to get back possession to live there. “The landlord cannot now move to Australia and now needs to move back into the premises, which were once his own residential premises. He claims that he is currently living in a garage and it is not suitable for his medical needs,” the April 8 decision said. The tenant has been looking for suitable accommodation elsewhere because she wants to cooperate with the landlord, but has not found anywhere yet. The usual legal position with a fixed-term contract is that the term of the contract will be applied strictly, and it is only in limited circumstances that a court or tribunal will interfere with it. The tribunal dismissed his application, saying the tenant had cooperated with the landlord. Both parties are suffering hardship, whether the fixed term was reduced or not. “They are equally balanced and as such, I am not satisfied that the landlord’s hardship outweighs that of the tenant.” Anne Gibson has been the Herald‘s property editor for 25 years, written books and covered property extensively here and overseas.

Title: Trump may have added 25% iPhone tariff specifically to punish Tim Cook

AAPL: 201.17 ( 0.96 ) Copyright © 2025 Quiller Media, Inc. All rights reserved. Tim Cook (left) with Donald Trump in a previous meeting -- image credit: CNBC The extra tariff added to all iPhones imported in the US may not have been about bringing manufacturing back to the US, but specifically to reprimand Tim Cook for skipping a Trump event. On May 23, 2025, Trump announced that Apple would have to pay a 25% tariff on every iPhone imported into the US. AppleInsider noted at the time that it was unusual for Trump to acknowledge that US business would have to pay the fee, instead of inaccurately claiming that foreign countries would. Now according to the New York Times, there appears to have been a reason for Apple being singled out. From May 13 to May 16, Trump was visiting the Middle East and bringing with him representatives of many US companies. Apple was not in attendance. Tump complains about AppleTwo unnamed sources say that Tim Cook declined Trump's invitation to join the trip, and this is said to have irritated the president. What is certain is that Trump repeatedly referred to to Cook's absence during the trip "I mean, Tim Cook isn't here, but you are," Trump commented to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. That was at a Trump event also attended by OpenAI's Sam Altman. Executives from AMD, BlackRock, and Citigroup were also in attendance. It was during the trip when he was in Qatar, that Trump said he "had a little problem with Tim Cook." Then it was following the trip that Trump announced the 25% tariff on iPhones, saying it was because Apple wasn't making the devices in the US. Trump's announcement of the new tariff on his Truth Social platform reportedly surprised his own administration as much as it did Apple. There were of course no details, but subsequently, Trump announced that the tariff would start in June. With the iPhone 17 launch happening in September, Apple will not be able to repeat its previously successful moves to beat tariff deadlines. Ahead of the "reciprocal" tariffs announced in April, Apple accelerated iPhone manufacture and airlifted extra devices into the US. Apple managed to get an exemption from the "reciprocal" tariffs, although Trump later revised that to be a temporary measure. There is also a spurious national security investigation into semiconductors, whose conclusion has been prejudged by the White House and will mean further tariffs. It's not remotely clear whether the new 25% tariff will come entirely on top of whatever other tariffs are introduced or reintroduced. Apple has previously said that it expects to pay out $900 million in tariffs in its current June quarter, but that presupposed there would be no further tariffs. Apple's deteriorating relationship with TrumpApple has not commented on either the tariffs or the New York Times report. Whether or not the tariff was introduced solely as a punishment for Tim Cook, it is part of a significant change in Trump's relationship with Apple. Cook has been both praised and criticized for how he has worked to keep that relationship going and gain Apple exemptions, including donating $1 million of his own money to Trump's inauguration. Recently, however, Cook also declined an invitation to attend a White House technology summit in person, although he did appear in video by satellite.

Title: Mitsotakis’ fury (with the Council of State), ND’s proposal regarding Karamanlis, OnlyFans girls beware of the AADE, National Bank’s deals, and Sorras’ coffee machine

Greetings, so the source is one of the best I have at M.M., so I don’t think they would mislead me when they told me the following yesterday: “The Prime Minister is furious about this case, where the Council of State suddenly turned people’s plots into fields (properties on the edges of settlements with less than 2,000 inhabitants), because as he himself says, it is not possible for us to have a huge demographic as well as housing problem – especially in the provinces but also generally throughout Greece – and for the state to…eat up people’s property overnight. Really, where did the judges remember this from, dating back to 1983 when the relevant legislation has been in effect until today?” the source concluded. They also told me that “Mitsotakis is not going to let this go under any circumstances and will exhaust all pressure and options in favor of the ownership of these plots.” The truth is we are talking about an absolute exaggeration and a major injustice. Mitsotakis’ Tours What with the generally good weather, and what with the improvement of the political climate in favor of ND, K.M. has decided to leave Maximos more and more often, touring Attica and beyond. On Saturday he was in Megara, where he spoke to citizens, while his schedule includes a tour in Evia this coming Thursday. According to the program, he will go to Aliveri and to the inauguration of the carbon capture and storage station at the AGET plant. The Proposal and Karamanlis Today or tomorrow, ND is expected to submit its proposal for the preliminary investigation concerning Kostas Karamanlis, on charges of breach of duty as a misdemeanor. I understand that on the same day there will also be some statement from the former minister. The legal document is being finalized, and there will be a reference to Christos Spirtzis, but no prosecution will be made due to the statute of limitations. OnlyFans – Girls and the AADE So, I hear from one of my sources in tax affairs that the OnlyFans business is booming in Greece too, with all social media – mainly TikTok but also Instagram – full of Greek or even foreign girls advertising the world’s oldest profession. And we’re talking about earnings in the range of 15–20 thousand euros per month, not bad at all especially when it’s tax-free. Now, for this to be circulating in the tax authorities, it doesn’t seem like good news for the girls. Audits are coming… The Banks Hit the Markets for Senior Bonds And now onto market news, starting with the banks which are ready this week and next to run senior bond issuances as part of the MREL framework. The time has come, and after all, all banks, systemic and non-systemic, have announced their intentions during the presentation of their quarterly results. The planning for the entire year is for issues totaling around 2.5 billion euros, which concern the replacement of older maturing bonds or refinancing of issues where such an option is foreseen. Banks are accelerating their moves because interest rates have dropped significantly, but mainly because markets are volatile and investors particularly cautious and selective. Moreover, in these issuances the competition is international, as according to the EBA, in 2025 across Europe the following issuances are expected: 262 billion in senior preferred, 107 billion in senior non-preferred, 18 billion in AT1, and 37 billion in Tier 2 bonds. Timing is always critical, so get ready for announcements from Greek banks entering the markets. The Swiss Franc Loan Arrangement is Delayed (but in the works) The Finance Ministry is not ready yet, but promoting a regulation for loans in Swiss francs is a matter of time. A political mandate has been given from M.M., which (rightly) believes that the Government must maintain continuity and that promises must be implemented, regardless of changes in personnel. The banks are under the (mistaken) impression that they roughly know what to expect, but since you can’t make an omelet without breaking eggs, in the end, they’ll be forced to shoulder part of the cost. More to follow soon. The Two Deals of National Bank and EFG Luxembourg The National Bank is going through a period of great activity and the signs indicate that there are already advanced talks for specific projects. However, that doesn’t mean moves will happen on a journalist’s timeline. My column’s information about EFG Luxembourg of Spyros Latsis, which has been circulating in the market lately, is that National did indeed consider the scenario of acquiring it, but decided not to proceed. It was judged that while it would be a major move with substance for National – as it significantly strengthens and shifts balances in the field of private wealth management – it is a deal worth 4.5 billion. Since markets are currently highly volatile and in general we don’t know what tomorrow will bring, a deal of such scale carries significant risks for National. I think it’s a safer bet to expect – soon – some kind of agreement in the insurance sector and another deal in a different direction – most likely abroad. Strong first quarter for OPAP Analysts expect OPAP to announce yet another strong quarter the day after tomorrow (28/5), supported by betting revenue and the steady growth of its online operations. At the same time, revenue from online casinos will continue the excellent performance of recent quarters, while Joker’s strong results—offering the highest jackpot in its history—will also play an important role. AXIA forecasts total gross gaming revenue (GGR) at €584.9 million, up 6.4% year-on-year, EBITDA at €201.1 million (+5.7%), while net profit after minority interests is estimated at €119.6 million (+5.6%). Attention, however, is turning to the upcoming quarters, and AXIA sees challenges on the horizon. Last year’s second half benefited from Euro 2024 and positive betting results, so comparisons in the upcoming quarters are expected to be more demanding. Furthermore, due to the significant rise in the stock (which analysts had not anticipated), surpassing price targets, AXIA states that OPAP’s recommendation and valuation are under review, with an update expected soon. Ungrateful people…Sorras’ coffee maker up for auction? Give us a break Ah, where are the days of Artemis Sorras, who promised to erase Greece’s debt with the… shares of the unforgettable Bank of the East and his $650 billion. Unfortunately, we let that… opportunity go to waste and lost both Sorras and his bizarre business dealings from the spotlight. Those days are so far gone that, as the column has learned, an auction is scheduled for May 30, with the debtor being the (also unforgettable) “non-profit civil company ‘E.SY. – Hellenic Assembly’,” legally represented, with last known headquarters in the municipality of Perama, Attica, at 1 Makedonias Street, now with unknown address. For those with poor memory, this was the party through which Sorras decided to save us—since we refused to save ourselves. Yet, this ungrateful people showed no gratitude at the ballot box, and “Hellenic Assembly” ended up in the dustbin of history. In the meantime, though, it seems they left behind some debts despite the… billions of their leader. So, a private individual is putting the following items up for auction on the 30th: 2 aluminum metal ladders, 8 boxes of brochures, 1 portable radiator, 3 halogen heaters, 1 INOX induction unit, dimensions approx. 1.5×1.0x1.0m, 1 professional INOX counter, approx. 1.5×1.0x1.0m with three drawers, 1 professional INOX counter with 3 sinks and 2 overlapping cupboard doors, approx. 2.0×1.0x0.8m, 1 EUROCAL wall shelf, 1 MORRIS mini fridge, 1 SILVERCREST coffee maker, 2 two-seater sofas, 1 wooden coffee table with wheels, 1 plastic table with metal base, 1 square melamine table with metal base, 1 white desk, 2 drawer units with 3 drawers each, 1 VERO desktop tower, 1 TURBOX monitor, 1 TURBOX keyboard, 1 REACT amplifier, 1 white melamine shelving unit approx. 3.0×1.5×0.5m, 12 chairs with wooden back and gray leather seat, 1 white melamine shelving unit approx. 1.6×1.0x0.5m, 1 shelving unit approx. 1.6×1.0x0.5m with a double-door cupboard, 1 BRΧΑΝΤ A/C unit, 1 whiteboard approx. 1.2×1.0m, 2 white desks with 2 drawers each, 120x80cm, 1 old HP photocopier out of service, 1 HP screen, 1 IBM keyboard, 1 water cooler “NERA KRITIS”, 1 TELEFUNKEN monitor, 1 LG monitor, 1 PACKARD BELL monitor, 17 metal chairs with wood and leather seats, 8 square tables approx. 80x80cm with metal legs, 1 HP computer out of service, 1 small SAMSUNG XPRESS M2675F multifunction printer, 1 bookshelf with 3 shelves and various binders approx. 200x80x50cm, 1 bookshelf with 2 shelves and various binders approx. 160x60x40cm, 1 air conditioner of unknown brand with mirrored grey surface, 1 LG TV remote control, 1 LG air conditioner remote control, 1 YOKOHAMA air conditioner. As noted in the seizure report, “the described movables are old, of average quality, and some of them in poor condition.” Thus, they were all valued together at €500 and will be offered with a starting price of €300. It is further clarified that all this… clutter has been placed “under the custody and safekeeping of the enforcing creditor I. P., due to the difficulty of transporting them,” and remains with him in limbo. What can I add? All… faithful (if any are left), come forth. The talented Mr. Milionis Vasilis Milionis, known from the Energa–Hellas Power case, had active involvement in the energy project of “Larisa Thermoelectric S.A.,” which includes the construction of a natural gas power plant in Larisa, announced with fanfare last week. The investment, worth around €600 million, is being carried out by a consortium including Israeli-owned Clavenia Ltd (38.5%), DEPA Commercial (35%), which joined six months ago, Sirec Energy—a private equity firm via its subsidiary EUSIF Larissa (16.5%)—and Volton (10%). The plant, with a net capacity of 792 MW, is expected, pending the final investment decision, to begin construction in early 2026 and be operational by 2028. In this project, the talented Mr. Milionis is said to have played a key role in its development, as chairman of the board until mid-2021 and later as advisor. I remind you that Vasilis Milionis, who was initially sentenced to 10 years in prison but was acquitted on appeal in 2019, shook the nation 15 years ago with the energy scandal in which he was a central figure. It was then revealed that two private electricity companies (Energa – Hellas Power) were collecting the “property tax” included in electricity bills (EETIDE – predecessor to ENFIA) from customers but were not passing it on to the State—a case for which they were accused of embezzling over €230 million. In May 2021, Milionis was replaced by an Israeli executive at “Larisa Thermoelectric S.A.,” and since then he had disappeared from the energy map. Only to reappear in the medical cannabis business again with the Israelis of Tikun Olam Hellas, reportedly also having a shareholder link to the new Larisa project. Some involved in the project said last week that the Israelis removed him from the ambitious Larisa plan when they realized he was an unacceptable figure in the market and that his name carried a negative connotation. Still, whether Milionis is or isn’t part of the company behind the grand plans for an energy hub in Thessaly (natural gas plant, data center, etc.), I hear that he now shows strong interest in the defense sector. From energy to medical cannabis and now to defense ventures—if nothing else, Milionis seems to have a natural talent for spotting where the money flows! Decisions for 26 projects worth €2.5 billion in Healthcare This afternoon, the Governmental Committee for Projects of National Strategic Importance will convene and—according to information—assign 26 significant projects with a total budget of €2.5 billion to the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP) and the Strategic Contracts Unit. The government is satisfied with the speed and quality of the projects implemented by the HCAP’s PPF unit in the health sector, which completed 92 renovated hospitals and 160 Health Centers within timelines and budgets. The stock exchange worries only because of its own success By just a tenth of a percentage point (0.10%), the General Index on the Athens Stock Exchange missed the chance to post its 6th consecutive positive week—thanks to Trump and his tariff announcements. Today, with both the London and New York markets closed, the Athens market will move guided solely by the short-term needs of institutional investors, who see the General Index up by +22.64% year-to-date, the Banking Index by +35.63%, and the FTSE25 by +25.57%. The major event of the week comes tomorrow with the annual MSCI review of stock market classifications, with the key question being whether the Greek market will be included in the watchlist for potential reclassification into the Developed Markets category. Inclusion of the Athens Stock Exchange in the watchlist is considered pivotal for fund managers and investment funds active in both Emerging and Developed Markets. News is also expected from Cyprus, not only regarding the large dividend (€0.48/share) from the Bank of Cyprus but also announcements about the future of its shareholder structure. The PotUS’s crafty moves The U.S. President carefully chose the day to announce his ideas about imposing a 50% tax on European products (starting June 1) and at least a 25% tariff on iPhones sold in the U.S. but manufactured abroad. As mentioned, Wall Street is closed today, Monday, for Memorial Day. This was the first time President Trump directly targeted specific companies with tariffs, later stating he would also impose 25% tariffs on Samsung products if not made in the U.S. Americans will have ample time to decide whether Trump is bluffing once again. Market speculators, however, had yet another opportunity to “play” with Trump’s statements. The Dow Jones dropped 256 points (-0.6%). The S&P 500 fell -0.7%. The Nasdaq -1%. All three indices recorded their worst week since April. It’s worth remembering that Apple CEO Tim Cook, like many others, made large donations to Trump’s Inaugural Fund and attended the Washington event, seated near Meta Platforms’ Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Chairman Jeff Bezos when the colossal $500 billion tech investment plan was unveiled at the end of February. Markets have largely stopped debating the truth of the PotUS’s claims or the real impact of his threats on the growth prospects of the world’s largest economy. What they cannot ignore, however, is the impact they are likely to have on corporate earnings—whether that’s Apple or the countless U.S. companies that rely on overseas sales to generate profits. They’re building nuclear batteries for the Moon and Mars Zeno Power Systems has just raised $50 million to build nuclear batteries that work where regular batteries can’t: in the depths of the oceans, the Arctic, in space, and even on the Moon. Zeno Power’s technology uses the decay of radioactive material to generate energy—no sunlight or power outlets required. The company has already signed major contracts with NASA and the U.S. military and secured fuel from the Department of Energy. They’ve added a former Navy chief to their board of directors. The future of energy might not be solar—it might be nuclear, silent, and built for the coldest, darkest places, not just on planet Earth. Explore related questions

Title: Aussie Senator Dismisses Bitcoin As A ‘Ponzi Scheme’, Sparks Fierce Community Backlash
URL: https://zycrypto.com/aussie-senator-dismisses-bitcoin-as-a-ponzi-scheme-sparks-fierce-community-backlash/
Time Published: 2025-05-26T13:02:46Z
Full Content:
Australian Senator Gerard Rennick has attracted the ire of the Bitcoin community following his remarks referring to Bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme driven by asset managers like BlackRock, and questioning the top cryptocurrency’s value because it can’t be eaten. Bitcoin (BTC) may be gaining momentum globally, but an Australian politician is still not sold on the asset. “You can’t eat Bitcoin,” Senator Gerard Rennick posited in a recent post, responding to an X user who sarcastically asked for his comments after Bitcoin set a new record high of around $111,800 on May 22. Rennick went on to lambast Bitcoin as a “Ponzi Scheme.” “Bitcoin will ultimately go to a $1 million dollars. Why? Because it’s a Ponzi scheme whereby BlackRock will pump more and more dollars into a supply-constrained product,” the Queensland Senator said. He also claimed that Bitcoin and its traders contribute “absolutely nothing” in terms of real-world utility, and that Australia “needs real engineers, not financial engineers.” Yes I do – Bitcoin will ultimately go to a $1 million dollars. Why because it’s a Ponzi scheme whereby Blackrock will pump more and more dollars into a supply constrained product. What exactly will this product produce? Absolutely nothing and nor will the thousands of people… Bitcoiners and industry commentators were quick to fire back at the Senator’s remarks. The Australian Bitcoin Industry Body (ABIB) noted that Rennick’s comments about Bitcoin “reveal a deep misunderstanding,” warning that misinformed takes from public officials could lead to “bad policy.” “This isn’t about whether Australians can use Bitcoin—we already do,” ABIB postulated. “This is about whether our government is capable of understanding how Bitcoin can enrich the nation… The door is open for ongoing education. The question is: are you willing to walk through it?” Unchained podcast host Laura Shin asked the Senator, “You also can’t eat the internet, so do you oppose that too?” As more X users commented, the Senator slammed critics, saying, “You’re disappointed about what a politician thinks about Bitcoin? Seriously? I thought you wanted less political interference. Why does it matter what I think? Invest as you will.” Bitcoiners often speak out when well-known people adopt an anti-Bitcoin stance. Just a couple of weeks ago, Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs was criticized by the Bitcoin community after vetoing a bill that would have allowed the state to hold Bitcoin as part of its official reserves.

The Singapore-based firm will allocate at least 5% of its global headcount to the new U.S. office as it attempts to nab itself a broker-dealer registration and potential FINRA membership. To lead the effort at its U.S. office, Caladan has hired a three-member team led by Gian-Paul Caccia, with experience across both crypto-native and traditional financial institutions, including crypto exchange Coinbase, asset manager BlackRock, investment bank Cowen Digital, and Bank of America. Their mandate includes building institutional partnerships, advancing compliance strategy, and deepening regulatory engagement, according to a statement shared exclusively with Decrypt. Caladan described its U.S. entry as part of a broader strategy to link Asia’s crypto market infrastructure with growing institutional momentum in the United States, seeking to serve as a conduit for liquidity, regulatory dialogue, and cross-border strategy. “It’s not just about operating in the U.S., we want to help shape the rules-based future of crypto markets with full transparency and accountability,” Julia Zhou, COO at Caladan, said in the statement. Caladan’s U.S. entry comes just as President Donald Trump’s administration tears up the rulebook that once kept firms like it at bay. Since taking office in January, Trump has appointed pro-crypto SEC Chair Paul Atkins, dropped multiple lawsuits against digital asset firms, and reversed enforcement-heavy policies upheld by the previous administration. Nexo, the crypto lender that exited the U.S. market in 2022, citing “regulatory dead ends,” also announced its return last month, crediting Trump’s pro-innovation stance for the renewed access. The administration has also hosted a White House crypto summit featuring top industry figures and backed the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin framework that cleared the Senate last week and now heads to the House. Even before his presidential inauguration, Trump launched a meme coin on Solana to tap into crypto culture. Last week’s private gala for top Official Trump (TRUMP) meme coin holders turned that gesture into a focal point for political controversy.

Title: Secretive Hedge Fund Run by Ex-JPMorgan Chase Trader Bringing In 51% Average Returns: Report

An ex-JPMorgan analyst has reportedly set up a mysterious hedge fund in Taiwan that has so far recorded massive return rates. Former JPM Asset Management analyst Andre Liu has quietly created a proprietary trading firm powerhouse in Taipei that has far outshone the rest of the industry, reports Bloomberg. According to the firm’s internal documents seen by Bloomberg, UC Capital has recorded an internal rate of return of 51% since it was launched in 2021. A report from research and insights firm PivotalPath found that in 2024, hedge funds scored an average return of 10.7%. Citing people familiar with the matter, Reuters reported that hedge fund giant Citadel’s flagship Wellington fund saw a 15.1% return that year while Millennium Management saw 15%. Bridgewater Associates, which is widely regarded as the largest hedge fund in the world, posted 11% in gains for its flagship Pure Alpha 18% volatility fund. Bloomberg’s data also shows that UC Capital has routinely beaten the local market in Taiwan (TAIEX), even recording significant gains in 2022 despite the Taiwan stock market index ending the year in the negative. UC Capital turned heads in Q4 of last year when it successfully purchased the ball that baseball star Shohei Ohtani hit his 50th home run on the same season he also stole 50 bases – a legendary feat in the MLB. According to Bloomberg, Liu started UC with a colleague in 2013, and by 2021, the firm’s assets exploded 27,000% before the trader decided to start his own company. Says Liu, “Ever since I was a kid, I believed that the heart of trading lies in the changes in moods and sentiment.” Consequently, UC’s engineers have built a model to measure public discourse by scraping and analyzing social media, online forums, news articles and comment sections, in what the firm describes as “sentiment thermometers” to track certain trending topics and behavior. Leveraging its sentiment-driven approach, UC capitalized on a decline in TSMC’s share price earlier this year after its models detected a surge in public discourse involving President Trump and the company’s future. At the time, the chipmaker announced a $100 billion investment in its US plants. UC also reportedly bought an earthquake detector on the eastern coast of Taiwan so that the firm would know about earthquakes before anyone else could in order to short markets in case of uncertainty. The trading firm currently has about $497 million in liquid assets before leverage.

On May 23, Senator Gerard Rennick dismissed Bitcoin as a “Ponzi scheme,” sparking immediate backlash from crypto industry groups and users alike. “Bitcoin will ultimately go to a $1 million dollars. Why? Because it’s a Ponzi scheme whereby BlackRock will pump more and more dollars into a supply-constrained product,” Rennick tweeted in response to a user who sarcastically asked for his “special comments” on the topic. “You can’t eat Bitcoin,” the Senator added. Yes I do - Bitcoin will ultimately go to a $1 million dollars. Why because it’s a Ponzi scheme whereby Blackrock will pump more and more dollars into a supply constrained product. What exactly will this product produce? Absolutely nothing and nor will the thousands of people… — Senator Gerard Rennick (@SenatorRennick) May 23, 2025 The Queensland senator, who now leads the populist People First Party after leaving the Liberal National Party in 2024, went on to argue that Bitcoin and its traders contribute "absolutely nothing" in terms of real-world utility. “Australia needs real engineers, not financial engineers,” he said. “We need infrastructure that’s [sic] delivers essential services particularly energy, water and transport.” Bitcoiners and industry advocates fired back immediately to the Senator’s comments. The Australian Bitcoin Industry Body (ABIB) dismissed Rennick’s remarks as “a deep misunderstanding,” warning that "misinformed" takes from public officials could lead to “bad policy.” “This isn’t about whether Australians can use Bitcoin—we already do,” ABIB said in its response. “This is about whether our government is capable of understanding how Bitcoin can enrich the nation… The door is open for ongoing education. The question is: are you willing to walk through it?” As the thread gained traction, the Senator brushed off criticism, saying “You’re disappointed about what a politician thinks about Bitcoin? Seriously? I thought you wanted less political interference. Why does it matter what I think? Invest as you will.” Rennick’s remarks followed Bitcoin’s recent surge to an all-time high above $111,000 and came just two weeks after Andrew Charlton was named Assistant Minister for Science, Technology, and the Digital Economy by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. Charlton is expected to lead Australia’s digital asset reform push, including a licensing regime that would bring major exchanges under the Australian Financial Services Licence (AFSL) framework with draft legislation due later this year. The government also plans to introduce safeguards against debanking and align the framework with global standards like the EU’s MiCA and Singapore’s Payment Services Act.

Title: Joker Geoeconomics and the Fight Over Global Ports
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/05/joker-geoeconomics-and-the-fight-over-global-ports.html
Time Published: 2025-05-26T10:00:49Z
Full Content:
On Wednesday at the company’s annual general meeting Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison reiterated its commitment to obtain multiple regulatory approvals before moving forward with the sale of its 43 global ports outside of mainland China and Hong Kong. Hutchison is facing heavy pressure in China and Panama over the proposed $23 billion deal with US investment firm BlackRock and the Italian tycoon-controlled Mediterranean Shipping Company, leading to questions over whether the deal will proceed at all and if so, in what form? The Trump administration worked closely with BlackRock during the lead up to the proposed sale and helped instigate it with its pressure on Hutchinson, showcasing that this is essentially a hostile takeover attempt spearheaded by Washington. China is now countering with pressure on Hutchison, but it remains unclear if Beijing will opt for the nuclear option that could damage Hong Kong’s financial center standing. More on that below, but first a quick recap of the proposed deal. CK Hutchison Holdings in March announced that it was selling all its overseas ports, including two at the Panama Canal, to a consortium led by BlackRock in a deal worth $23 billion. It might be a fair price for Hutchison and its founder Li Ka-shing, the ninety-six-year-old billionaire who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 2000, but as a recent paper from Global Capital Allocation highlights: A defining feature of the current global system is the willingness of the Great Powers to use their economic and financial strength to achieve geopolitical or economic goals. This rise of geoeconomics is a major departure from the last twenty years of policy making and has the potential to dramatically alter the landscape of the global economic and financial system. And so despite Hutchison’s aims to refocus the debate on legal due process and shareholder interests (it’s now offer roughly $3 per share as a bonus to shareholders if the deal goes through), there’s no escaping the fact that the proposed deal is right in the middle of the geoeconomic war between Washington and Beijing and will have major implications regardless of which way it goes. China in a Bind? Beijing’s alarmed reaction to the Hutchison deal is often depicted in Western media as heavy handed, and it does appear as though the government in China was caught off guard, but it’s important to note that BlackRock in this case is mostly synonymous with the US, and the proposed sale is part of the US effort to kneecap China’s economy through sanctions, bans, tariffs, and setting up roadblocks for Chinese investments and companies around the world. While Team Trump was holding meetings with BlackRock, it was also putting the squeeze on Hutchison. From the WSJ: In the days before finalizing the deal, Fink held calls with Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and national security adviser Michael Waltz, ultimately garnering the administration’s blessing, according to people close to the deal. Behind the scenes, Hutchinson executives had grown uneasy that a hostile Trump administration could make life hard on their sprawling global conglomerate… Hutchinson executives had weighted selling these and dozens more ports before, but the timing wasn’t right. With Trump applying pressure — and Hutchinson shares trading at a substantial discount to the company’s underlying assets — that changed. …executives were surprised by Trump’s decision to revoke special trade privileges for Hong Kong, and Panama authorities had just announced an audit of Hutchinson’s contract. Hutchison was also going to get hit hard by “Liberation Day.” Chief among China’s concerns with the Hutchinson deal is that the new ownership could, under pressure from Washington, raise prices on or refuse Chinese ships or allow the US to militarize the ports and use them to enact a maritime blockade of China. These fears are not unfounded. The US is already actively working towards some of those goals while having discussed the others. And we can see how global chokepoints and the ports in the proposed deal overlap: So criticism of the deal in China was swift. The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council of China issued a strongly worded comment on the matter yesterday, directly stating that the transaction is not an “ordinary commercial activity,” but rather a hegemonic act in which the United States employs state power—through coercion, pressure, and inducements—to seize the legitimate rights and interests of another country, all masked as “commercial behavior” and essentially representing power politics. Here are some of the legitimate concerns raised by Chinese officials in the commentary: Once the Panama Canal is “Americanized” and “politicized,” the United States will undoubtedly use it for political purposes to advance its own political agenda, and China’s shipping and trade will inevitably be controlled by the US. If the United States were to implement measures such as selective capacity restrictions or imposing “political surcharges,” Chinese companies’ logistics costs and supply chain stability would face great risks. Some netizens also noted that through this deal, BlackRock would control about 10.4% of the world’s container terminal throughput, joining the ranks of the world’s top three port operators, and it is entirely possible that it would work in concert with US policies to suppress China, raising costs for Chinese cargo and squeezing the market share of Chinese shipping companies. Moreover, this transaction creates a major gap in the port network that Chinese companies have built up over the years, thereby allowing American interests to erode their overseas development advantages. Other netizens even point out that the United States might use this transaction as a “template” to spark a wave of port mergers and acquisitions worldwide through political pressure, thereby controlling more critical ports globally and employing “long-arm jurisdiction” to suppress China, leaving Chinese vessels with “no reliable haven.” This is by no means mere fearmongering. According to a draft executive order from the US government, plans are already underway to charge Chinese vessels special docking fees, and the US will urge its allies to take similar measures, otherwise facing retaliation. If all of the United States’ calculated moves succeed, they will undoubtedly impact China’s shipbuilding, shipping, foreign trade, and even the Belt and Road Initiative, and will directly affect Hong Kong’s efforts to consolidate and elevate its position as an international shipping and trade center, while threatening and undermining the normal global order and safety of shipping and trade. Beijing responded by launching a regulatory review of the deal —although the company’s base is in Hong Kong and there aren’t direct Chinese assets involved in the sale — and said the deal shouldn’t be implemented without its approval. That was in response to a WSJ report earlier in the month that said there are discussions to exclude two Panama Canal ports as a way to appease Beijing. Can China Block the Sale? No according to Bloomberg, which claims that Beijing can pressure Hutchison but that “because the deal involves only overseas assets it is unlikely to need Beijing’s sign-off.” It also notes that CK Hutchison and sister company CK Asset Holdings Ltd. are registered in the Cayman Islands. There’s a little more to it than that, though, according to Reuters: The State Administrative Market Regulation Authority could have extra-territorial jurisdiction by applying the anti-monopoly law, if a deal outside mainland China has the effect of eliminating or restricting competition in China’s domestic market. Authorities could also use the Measures for Security Review or Foreign Investments, implemented in 2021, to examine foreign direct investments in important fields relating to national security, including infrastructure. Felix Ng, a partner at law firm Haldanes, said the measures removed the exclusion of acquisitions of interest held by foreign companies, “suggesting that PRC authorities may have the power to review foreign-to-foreign transactions if the target involves PRC-related entities”. There’s also the nuclear option: the 2020 National Security Law, which goes after “terrorism,” subversives, secessionists, and colluders with foreign forces.” Could that come into play? “Given the sensitivities, there would be room for further investigation under the broad sweep of the National Security Law, particularly over collusion or espionage,” said Simon Young, a professor at the University of Hong Kong law school. The offence of collusion would have to involve a person or company intending to disrupt the policies of the Chinese or Hong Kong governments to create serious consequences, Young said. But should China go this route to nix the deal, it would involve it taking a much more state-heavy approach in Hong Kong, which could hurt the financial center’s global standing. As of now, it is third in the Global Financial Centres Index behind New York City and London. One can imagine Washington is pleased. It’s like an economic Ukraine or Taiwan. If Beijing acts to block the sale, the US will no doubt hit the gas on more economic isolation efforts, painting China as unfriendly to outside business interests. That’s not to say the strategy makes much sense or will work, but that’s the way it looks. Why Could Panama Ports Be Excluded? In April, Panama’s controller general created another headache for the sale when he claimed that CK Hutchison had not properly renewed its contract to operate the ports in 2021 and owed the government $300 million in fees. The allegation could significantly delay the BlackRock deal and, according to the New York Times, could allow more time for Beijing to “meddle” in the proposed deal. In the meantime, the “main investor” of the group seeking to buy the global ports is considering excluding the Panama ports from the rest of the deal. Gianluigi Aponte and his son Diego Aponte, the Italian tycoons who control Mediterranean Shipping Co., are reportedly having discussions about moving ahead with the purchase of 41 ports on five continents, leaving BlackRock and Hutchison to figure out the disputes over the other two. Even at just 41 ports, such a deal could have enormous impact—unless we believe the Aponte family in a US satellite state is willing to stand up to Washington when Uncle Sam comes demanding a crackdown on Chinese ships. Joker Geoeconomics As BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink said in his recent annual letter to investors, ports ‘will define the future’ and are as critical to future infrastructure of the global economy as data centers and power grids. The world’s largest asset manager’s wager that despite the new era of geoeconomics, global trade will continue to rise enough to justify this port investment, might pan out. But it’s also a bet on the safe stewardship of the US empire, and that’s far more risky as the US embraces chaos. Michael Roberts points out in a recent post “Geonomics, nationalism and trade,” the US is attempting to muscle its way out of a profitability crisis: And there are few rules—if any—in pursuit of that goal. The Hutchison-BlackRock ports deal is just one piece of the larger strategy—if one can call it that. It’s more a mash up of kleptocratic short cuts masquerading as one. Here’s Roberts: This hegemonic crude power politics is now being made logical and even advantageous to all Americans by right-wing economists. In a new book called Industrial Policy for the United States, Marc Fasteau and Ian Fletcher, two economists beloved by the Maga crowd. …F&F’s apparently ‘neutral’ industrial strategy is no such thing when it comes to China because as they say, China is “the first combined military and economic threat America has faced in more than 200 years.” They put it bluntly: “An increasing number of Chinese industries are in acute rivalry with high-value American industries, and China’s gains are our losses. The US cannot remain a military superpower without being an industrial superpower.” This sums up the motivation for the switch from neoclassical laisser faire, free trade economics that has dominated the academic ivory towers of economic departments and international economic agencies up to now. America’s (and Europe’s) economic domination has been weakened to the point that there is a significant risk that China will rule globally within a generation. So the gloves are off. But there are at least a few issues. First off, industrial strategy isn’t helped by the destruction of government services, further unleashing parasitic finance, and simply going all in on military and homeland security budgets. Sure, all the ICE brutality might make for a more terrified and exploitable workforce at home that will help further decimate labor, but it doesn’t do much for rebuilding industry. Furthermore, Roberts points out the following: F&F’s industrial strategy will not work. In economies, productivity growth and lower costs depend on increased investment in productivity-enhancing sectors. But in capitalist economies that depends on the willingness of profit-driven companies to invest more. If profitability is low and/or falling, they will not do so. That’s the experience of the last two decades, in particular. F&F want a return to war-time policies and cold war strategy to build domestic industry, science and military forces. But that would only work if there was a massive switch to direct public investment through publicly owned companies with a national industrial plan. F&F don’t want that and neither does Trump. And so we’re left Washington engaging in more shakedowns like the Hutchison deal and tariff threats. As one of China’s most respected international relations scholars, Wang Jisi, said recently: “When the world’s most powerful country abandons its principles and loses any sense of morality, it becomes exceedingly dangerous and may inflict great harm upon the world.” I don’t know of states having a sense of “morality,” but the great harm part sounds spot on. That leads to the unenviable task of confronting an actor with little to no rules without plunging the world into even deeper chaos. I don’t think that the Chinese have a choice here really. They have to hit back and hit back hard like they did in Trump’s recently attempted trade war. If they do not but let it all go, then guaranteed there would be people in Trump’s Cabinet that will take that as a sign of Chinese weakness and then start pushing to introduce harsher measures against China – such as banning all Chinese ships going through the Panama Canal. With a Trump Cabinet, that would sound like a very reasonable thing to do. From what I have seen the past few months, they go for maximum pressure and only haul back when somebody pressures them. We saw that with Yemen and even China itself and I think that they are going to do the same with Russia. But when nations buckle, then for them that is a sign to wring more concessions from them. Another example is that ambush of the South African President with charges of white genocide. Now the Trump regime is demanding easier access for US corporations in South Africa and for them to sell the US their minerals with them to be processed in the US and not in SA. Honestly, I think China is too big for BlackRock to take on, but USA and EU it can already squeeze dry like a lemon. How’s this for a new multipolar world: China, Russia and BlackRock? Local opposition to creating a policy backdoor for Starlink to sneak through to enter the South African market is fierce. As usual, the local agents of Imperialism are in strong support of Starlink’s proposed entry, employing the tired “we need investors to create jobs” narrative to hoodwink the public. As you rightly point out, Trump and his band of anarchists see willingness to offer concessions as a signal to extract not just more concessions, but total capitulation. That fiasco of our president bending the knee in the Oval office last week was all people needed to see to confirm what many have quietly whispered ie that the ANC is estranged from its revolutionary mission and is now fervent ally global capital. I think your right. As for “Can China Block the Sale? No according to Bloomberg […],” ask Jack Ma about what China can and cannot do now that he is walking around now. China will certainly hit back. There will be an escalation around the world, with Chinese-controlled ports rejecting American ships, and American-controlled ports doing the same to Chinese ships. If that should happen, American consumers will be hit very hard. Though this post focuses on china i believe that control of the Panama canal might be used to exert pressure to anyone else. Hemispheric dominance and control of the Atlantic. Hardly squeezes China at all, but over 10% of Panama Canal throughput is Chinese. The Wings of the Eagle / Are Albion and Oz cargofromchina.com/shipping-routes/ ceicdata.com/en/indicator/china/container-port-throughput statista.com/topics/9943/shipping-ports-in-china/ Foreign Policy is supposed to be an uneasy dance between interests and moral considerations. The US thinks morals are orthogonal to its interests and thus ditches them entirely in its foreign policy stance (even as it lectures other nations about said morals). I doubt morals come into it at all for any country ever. Even the “Christianizing” missions of the 19th century empires were just thin cover for economics. “Any country ever” is a generalization that nicely illustrate the problem. We have a “televised live demonstration” of Judeo-Christian vs Orthodox Christian ways of war (and diplomacy, and foreign policy, and many other things), and some people still fail to see that “morals come into it at all”. Or, maybe, they don’t want to see. The logical end-point of these moves (see Baltic Sea / EU efforts to seize Russian shipping) is warships accompanying shipping flotillas and demanding port access. Given the disparity in shipbuilding capacity, the West will not win that war. This could rapidly descend into UAVs anonymously targeting shipping, which would isolate the Western Hemisphere from the products it cannot make to maintain its population and lifestyle. Operation Gladio shows the limits (or rather their lack). It also shows the prescience of developing the BRI (when competing with the new thallocratic power – China remembers the century of humiliation led by the UK). My guess is China will stall the sale long enough for US rare earth stockpiles to be depleted, and the US high-tech industry begins screaming as it is unable to fulfill its DOD contracts (and loses any competitiveness with the 17.7-million STEM engineering pool-powered Chinese technology juggernaut). I think I recall Yves writing about the Panama Canal area not having sufficient water to operate the canal at a formerly normal rate. I would be surprised to learn that alternatives are NOT being searched for. Here’s a current article discussing the water shortage. https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2025/05/13/panama-water-scarcity-amid-climate-change-canal-demands/ This part of the link “Geonomics, nationalism and trade”: “Now apparently, geonomics has surfaced to make this hegemonic power politics respectable and ‘realistic’. Liberal democracy and ‘internationalism’ along with liberal economics ie free trade and free markets, is no longer relevant for economists, trained before to promote an economic world of equilibrium, equality, competition and ‘comparative advantage’ for all. That’s out of the window: now economics is about power struggles conducted by states furthering their own national interests.” Mainstream economists could have fooled me that they were “trained” to do anything but focus on equilibrium – attempting to balance situations as neat equations. That said… Power dynamics in economic relations is not something new that needs its own name. The article handled this point of view more diplomatically by using historical context. Overall, there appears to be a batch of mainstream economists who finally notice that power is involved in economics, although it’s state power that is the focus as a manipulator of economic activity. How many decades before they account for the power relations among players all the way down to the relations with customers/clients? Power is a major component of economic relations and, when the powers involved in an economy refuse to be or can’t be held accountable, don’t expect any guiding economic principles that are accountable. In these conditions, politics is not used to produce economic benefits for the masses, but to place blame elsewhere for economic and political rot. Thanks for posting this! I feel like should somehow stick a flag right here with the motto on it of keep an eye on this space. There should be some telling maneuvering here. This feels like the opening play of America, the oligarchic corportocracy, deploying BlackRock to protect it’s vital interests. It will be interesting to see how this goes. But honestly, suddenly being all concerned about Panama, Greenland, and Canada feels like somebody looked in a mirror and finally saw that giant L stuck on their forehead. Dude, when you spend forty years wrecking your own country, the rest going plop and hitting the floor is sort of a forgone conclusion. But whatever. Why wouldn’t Cosco or some other Chinese company simply outbid Blackrock? This sort of behaviour has reliably led to wars ever since the emergence of the European maritime empires at least 500 years ago. Buckle up … Very interesting article. I have paid little attention to global shipping ownership/power plays, this article provides an update for me, for which I’m grateful. I have paid close attention to a lot of other Trump behavior and policy (if. there really is any sound foundational policy). It seems to me their strategy is brute force bludgeoning to achieve submission. I also think, left unchecked for an undetermined period of time, Trump will lead the US to ruin. People are not empowered by his means. Left unsaid in this article: China is pulling away in all areas of green energy AND high speed rail (to name just a couple). Trump wants to return iPhone manufacturing to our shores. And… what else exactly? One doesn’t need Harvard degree in economics to see how this is unfolding. The US needs smart policies of substance, not posturing. One doesn’t need Harvard degree in economics to see how this is unfolding. One needs Harvard degree in economics not to see how this is unfolding. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment * Name * Email *

Title: We asked 10 everyday Americans for the best investment of their lives

You don't have to be a Wall Street strategist or top fund manager to make your money work. Business Insider asked 10 everyday Americans for the best investments they've made. Some stumbled into gains by serendipitously buying Magnificent Seven stocks before they took off. Others leaned into real estate or alternative investments. And yes, some struck it big on Reddit's r/WallStreetBets finds. All of this goes to show that there's no single path to investing success. With their investments, these Americans have achieved various wealth-building milestones, including financial independence, early retirement, and an increased sense of security with their money. Business Insider has verified all investments. Here's how they did it. Vanscoy, a full-time dad who manages his family's portfolios, isn't one to invest in flashy tech stocks. He describes his strategy as "conservative and focused on dividend growth." Vanscoy's investment in Nvidia (NVDA) wasn't part of his usual portfolio management plan. Right before the pandemic, Vanscoy came across news articles and posts on forums about new video game developments. "I asked my kids what was going on, and they said these Nvidia graphics cards are really popular and everyone's trying to get them. I did a little research, and I thought that might be a fun pick-and-shovel play," Vanscoy told Business Insider. Vanscoy bought 80 shares of Nvidia in March 2020 for a total of $21,641.60. He's since taken profits twice, once in 2021 and again in 2023, which paid for his initial investment. Now, he holds 1,292 shares with a cost basis of $6.76 per share — a $151,000 position with an over 1,500% gain. Fischer, a former data analyst turned finance content creator, bought a house with her now-husband before they got married in 2020. It seemed a little risky at the time but has since paid off majorly. "At the time, interest rates were around 3%, and buying made just as much financial sense as renting after the initial down payment," Fischer said. "It also gave us the chance to test living together before marriage and see what an integrated life looks like. If worst comes to worst and things didn't work out, we would just sell and split the equity in half," Fischer added. The couple purchased their house for a little under half a million after the down payment. They refinanced their 3.3% mortgage rate down to 2.99% in 2021, right before mortgage rates shot up to 7%. Now, their monthly mortgage is $2,487 — which is comparable to local rent for a similar unit in the Seattle area. Buying a house and locking down a low mortgage rate means Fischer doesn't have to worry about rising rents. "We're just incredibly grateful we were able to purchase our home when we did," Fischer said. Brinkman grew up helping his grandfather manage his personal accounts, which imbued him with a strong sense of financial responsibility. "When I was in my 20s, I moved to LA and was very tight on money," Brinkman said. "I had very little to live off of at the time, but I still prioritized investing." Between 2012 and 2013, Brinkman bought $4,000 of Apple (AAPL) and $5,000 of Tesla (TSLA), which he's held ever since. His investments have grown to roughly $43,000 and $167,000 since the initial buy-in, respectively. Brinkman, who works at a production company that creates images of cars, got the idea to invest in Tesla when he began seeing more Tesla vehicles in the showroom at his job. Similarly, Brinkman liked Apple computers in the early 2000s and decided to invest in the company when he had enough disposable income. Nowadays, Brinkman has taken a less risky approach to investing and regularly buys index funds every two weeks. Jiang, a former Google employee who now runs the personal finance platform Peek, enjoys investing in tech because it's an industry she's well-versed in. Jiang bought into Tesla in 2015 after hearing her boss and many others bragging about owning one. She had seen a rise in electric vehicle popularity, but consumers' brand association with Tesla made it stand out to her. "I was like, 'this is a category-defining company and I want to buy in,'" Jiang said. She grew her investment by 1,200%. She recently exited her position in the company, as she had achieved a substantial return and didn't like the volatility associated with CEO Elon Musk. More recently, Jiang has bet big on Palantir (PLTR). She's been following the company since before it became public and believes the company has an edge thanks to its sticky government customers and innovations in AI. Jiang jumped in last year and snatched up the stock at just $23 a share. Since then, the stock has taken off, and Jiang's investment is up roughly 420%. Jiang has no plans to sell her Palantir stock anytime soon: "My conviction is that it'll be as big as an Nvidia," she said. For 10 years before becoming a software engineer, Nassif was a full-time online poker player. It was common to be paid in bitcoin, which Nassif would then convert into cash to pay for living expenses. Over the years, Nassif has inadvertently collected 0.8 bitcoin through this process — a hefty position as bitcoin hits an all-time high. Earlier in his poker career, up to 50% of his net worth was tied up in the cryptocurrency, but Nassif felt that was too high of a risk to be sustainable, so he started selling down to his current position. Another one of his big wins was starting to purchase Nvidia stock 15 years ago. He now holds 342 shares with an over 3,000% gain. Nassif was influenced by his heavy bitcoin exposure, as he realized Nvidia's GPUs were in high demand for crypto mining. Similar to bitcoin, Nassif has also been gradually taking profits in the wake of the AI hype, as he doesn't want to have a large portion of his portfolio tied up in a single stock. Nassif no longer makes any big bets on individual stocks. "In the last few years, I've been incredibly boring," Nassif said. "It's just been index funds." For the past eight years, White has divided his money between 60% index funds and 40% individual stocks. When picking individual stocks, White considers himself a value investor and looks for companies at cheap entry points. White is a particularly big fan of "convenience-oriented" stocks that make life easier for consumers, and Netflix (NFLX) was a bet that paid off big for him. In early 2022, Netflix stock plunged by two-thirds after the company reported losing subscribers and threatened to crack down on password sharing. White bought 45 shares in the company for a cost basis of $244 per share. Today, the stock is nearing $1,200, and White's investment has yielded around a 380% return. "It was a very sound investment, very well-managed, very mature leadership team. So when public sentiment pushed the stock down, I believed that was an irrational action, and I decided to jump in and start a position," White said. Waresmith has been investing in real estate for over 10 years. She bought her first house, a single-family home in Tampa, in 2013 from savings she accumulated working as an aerial acrobat on a cruise ship. Looking back, Waresmith's favorite real estate investment has been multi-family homes. She refinanced her property in Tampa and pulled out cash to buy a duplex in Massachusetts in 2020, securing a mortgage rate of 3.2%. Waresmith then house-hacked by living in one unit on the property and renting out the other. The mortgage at the time was around $2,300, and she rented out the other unit for $1,700, almost covering the monthly payment. "I think house hacking is one of the single smartest financial decisions anyone can make, as long as you choose the right property," Waresmith said. "I would not have felt comfortable affording the mortgage on that house alone at the time." Because her living expenses were so low from house hacking. Waresmith was able to invest and purchase another multi-family home in 2022. After moving out of the duplex, Waresmith now rents out both sides of the house, and her rental income is enough to easily cover the mortgage, as the rent on one side is now $2,500. Brennan Schlagbaum typically likes to invest in ETFs, but the one time he bought an individual stock, he struck it big. "I focus on index funds primarily, but there are some obvious opportunities from time to time, and one of those was Meta," Schlagbaum said. He owns 36 shares of the company, which is his only single-stock investment. In 2022, Meta Platforms (META) dropped from above $300 to under $90 after a series of weak earnings and a broader tech sell-off. Despite the negative sentiment, Schlagbaum, a CPA who runs the financial literacy company Budgetdog, felt like the company was in a good position according to its financial statements. "They have great free cash flow, hardly any debt, tons of reinvestment," Schlagbaum said. He bought the stock in October 2022 at $97. The stock is now at $628 as of May 23, yielding a gain of almost 550%. Last year, Mark and his husband were looking to move to Chicago from Salt Lake City. It just so happened that another couple they knew was also looking to move there — and so the four of them decided to team up and buy a house together. Mark and his husband sold their Salt Lake City house, which they had bought right before the pandemic housing boom, in June 2024. The two couples ended up purchasing a multi-family home last July for around $800,000. They decided to put down 40% for their down payment instead of the traditional 20%, as they wanted to minimize their monthly mortgage payments amid the current interest rate environment. For Mark, the proceeds from selling his Salt Lake City house covered the down payment. The house has four floors and is set up as two apartments stacked on top of each other, and comes with six bedrooms and four kitchens. Mark and his co-owners are very pleased with the living arrangement, as it's helped them get much more bang for their buck. "With what we are each paying, we never could have found something similar separately, even if each couple had something half the size of this house," Mark said. Forsythe was scrolling through r/WallStreetBets in 2022 when a ticker caught his eye: AST SpaceMobile (ASTS), a satellite communications company pioneering a space-based cellular broadband network. The stock has a niche cult following on X dubbed the "SpaceMob", which Forsythe has been monitoring along with company news and earnings reports over the last few years. Forsythe started with an initial holding of 2,500 shares at $10. From 2022 to 2024, the stock price plunged to under $2, and Forsythe actually sold his shares at a loss when the stock hit $2.15. But shortly after, in a classic WSB YOLO fashion, Forsythe bought back in with 35,000 shares at $2.88 per share. "My thinking was, considering the due diligence and following the stock for two years, I would feel terrible giving up on it now, especially if it rebounded," Forsythe said of buying back in. Forsythe's bet paid off — after buying back in, the company announced partnerships with AT&T and Verizon, sending the share price soaring. His investment sits at around $900,000 today. Even factoring in his initial loss on the first 2,500 shares, that's still a hefty 650% gain on his total invested capital. "I don't plan on selling anything," Forsythe said. "I've diamond-handed it all the way from the ups and downs."

You don't have to be a Wall Street strategist or top fund manager to make your money work. Business Insider asked 10 everyday Americans for the best investments they've made.

She had seen a rise in electric vehicle popularity, but consumers' brand association with Tesla made it stand out to her. "I was like, 'this is a category-defining company and I want to buy in,'" Jiang said. She grew her investment by 1,200%. She recently exited her position in the company, as she had achieved a substantial return and didn't like the volatility associated with CEO Elon Musk. More recently, Jiang has bet big on Palantir (PLTR). She's been following the company since before it became public and believes the company has an edge thanks to its sticky government customers and innovations in AI. Jiang jumped in last year and snatched up the stock at just $23 a share. Since then, the stock has taken off, and Jiang's investment is up roughly 420%. Jiang has no plans to sell her Palantir stock anytime soon: "My conviction is that it'll be as big as an Nvidia," she said. For 10 years before becoming a software engineer, Nassif was a full-time online poker player. It was common to be paid in bitcoin, which Nassif would then convert into cash to pay for living expenses. Over the years, Nassif has inadvertently collected 0.8 bitcoin through this process — a hefty position as bitcoin hits an all-time high. Earlier in his poker career, up to 50% of his net worth was tied up in the cryptocurrency, but Nassif felt that was too high of a risk to be sustainable, so he started selling down to his current position. Another one of his big wins was starting to purchase Nvidia stock 15 years ago. He now holds 342 shares with an over 3,000% gain. Nassif was influenced by his heavy bitcoin exposure, as he realized Nvidia's GPUs were in high demand for crypto mining. Similar to bitcoin, Nassif has also been gradually taking profits in the wake of the AI hype, as he doesn't want to have a large portion of his portfolio tied up in a single stock. Nassif no longer makes any big bets on individual stocks. "In the last few years, I've been incredibly boring," Nassif said. "It's just been index funds." For the past eight years, White has divided his money between 60% index funds and 40% individual stocks. When picking individual stocks, White considers himself a value investor and looks for companies at cheap entry points. White is a particularly big fan of "convenience-oriented" stocks that make life easier for consumers, and Netflix (NFLX) was a bet that paid off big for him. In early 2022, Netflix stock plunged by two-thirds after the company reported losing subscribers and threatened to crack down on password sharing. White bought 45 shares in the company for a cost basis of $244 per share. Today, the stock is nearing $1,200, and White's investment has yielded around a 380% return. "It was a very sound investment, very well-managed, very mature leadership team. So when public sentiment pushed the stock down, I believed that was an irrational action, and I decided to jump in and start a position," White said. Waresmith has been investing in real estate for over 10 years. She bought her first house, a single-family home in Tampa, in 2013 from savings she accumulated working as an aerial acrobat on a cruise ship. Looking back, Waresmith's favorite real estate investment has been multi-family homes. She refinanced her property in Tampa and pulled out cash to buy a duplex in Massachusetts in 2020, securing a mortgage rate of 3.2%. Waresmith then house-hacked by living in one unit on the property and renting out the other. The mortgage at the time was around $2,300, and she rented out the other unit for $1,700, almost covering the monthly payment. "I think house hacking is one of the single smartest financial decisions anyone can make, as long as you choose the right property," Waresmith said. "I would not have felt comfortable affording the mortgage on that house alone at the time." Because her living expenses were so low from house hacking. Waresmith was able to invest and purchase another multi-family home in 2022. After moving out of the duplex, Waresmith now rents out both sides of the house, and her rental income is enough to easily cover the mortgage, as the rent on one side is now $2,500. Brennan Schlagbaum typically likes to invest in ETFs, but the one time he bought an individual stock, he struck it big. "I focus on index funds primarily, but there are some obvious opportunities from time to time, and one of those was Meta," Schlagbaum said. He owns 36 shares of the company, which is his only single-stock investment. In 2022, Meta Platforms (META) dropped from above $300 to under $90 after a series of weak earnings and a broader tech sell-off. Despite the negative sentiment, Schlagbaum, a CPA who runs the financial literacy company Budgetdog, felt like the company was in a good position according to its financial statements. "They have great free cash flow, hardly any debt, tons of reinvestment," Schlagbaum said. He bought the stock in October 2022 at $97. The stock is now at $628 as of May 23, yielding a gain of almost 550%. Last year, Mark and his husband were looking to move to Chicago from Salt Lake City. It just so happened that another couple they knew was also looking to move there — and so the four of them decided to team up and buy a house together. Mark and his husband sold their Salt Lake City house, which they had bought right before the pandemic housing boom, in June 2024. The two couples ended up purchasing a multi-family home last July for around $800,000. They decided to put down 40% for their down payment instead of the traditional 20%, as they wanted to minimize their monthly mortgage payments amid the current interest rate environment. For Mark, the proceeds from selling his Salt Lake City house covered the down payment. The house has four floors and is set up as two apartments stacked on top of each other, and comes with six bedrooms and four kitchens. Mark and his co-owners are very pleased with the living arrangement, as it's helped them get much more bang for their buck. "With what we are each paying, we never could have found something similar separately, even if each couple had something half the size of this house," Mark said. Forsythe was scrolling through r/WallStreetBets in 2022 when a ticker caught his eye: AST SpaceMobile (ASTS), a satellite communications company pioneering a space-based cellular broadband network. The stock has a niche cult following on X dubbed the "SpaceMob", which Forsythe has been monitoring along with company news and earnings reports over the last few years. Forsythe started with an initial holding of 2,500 shares at $10. From 2022 to 2024, the stock price plunged to under $2, and Forsythe actually sold his shares at a loss when the stock hit $2.15. But shortly after, in a classic WSB YOLO fashion, Forsythe bought back in with 35,000 shares at $2.88 per share. "My thinking was, considering the due diligence and following the stock for two years, I would feel terrible giving up on it now, especially if it rebounded," Forsythe said of buying back in. Forsythe's bet paid off — after buying back in, the company announced partnerships with AT&T and Verizon, sending the share price soaring. His investment sits at around $900,000 today. Even factoring in his initial loss on the first 2,500 shares, that's still a hefty 650% gain on his total invested capital. "I don't plan on selling anything," Forsythe said. "I've diamond-handed it all the way from the ups and downs."

Title: We asked 10 everyday Americans for the best investment of their lives

You don't have to be a Wall Street strategist or top fund manager to make your money work. Business Insider asked 10 everyday Americans for the best investments they've made. Some stumbled into gains by serendipitously buying Magnificent Seven stocks before they took off. Others leaned into real estate or alternative investments. And yes, some struck it big on Reddit's r/WallStreetBets finds. All of this goes to show that there's no single path to investing success. With their investments, these Americans have achieved various wealth-building milestones, including financial independence, early retirement, and an increased sense of security with their money. Business Insider has verified all investments. Here's how they did it. Vanscoy, a full-time dad who manages his family's portfolios, isn't one to invest in flashy tech stocks. He describes his strategy as "conservative and focused on dividend growth." Vanscoy's investment in Nvidia (NVDA) wasn't part of his usual portfolio management plan. Right before the pandemic, Vanscoy came across news articles and posts on forums about new video game developments. "I asked my kids what was going on, and they said these Nvidia graphics cards are really popular and everyone's trying to get them. I did a little research, and I thought that might be a fun pick-and-shovel play," Vanscoy told Business Insider. Vanscoy bought 80 shares of Nvidia in March 2020 for a total of $21,641.60. He's since taken profits twice, once in 2021 and again in 2023, which paid for his initial investment. Now, he holds 1,292 shares with a cost basis of $6.76 per share — a $151,000 position with an over 1,500% gain. Fischer, a former data analyst turned finance content creator, bought a house with her now-husband before they got married in 2020. It seemed a little risky at the time but has since paid off majorly. "At the time, interest rates were around 3%, and buying made just as much financial sense as renting after the initial down payment," Fischer said. "It also gave us the chance to test living together before marriage and see what an integrated life looks like. If worst comes to worst and things didn't work out, we would just sell and split the equity in half," Fischer added. The couple purchased their house for a little under half a million after the down payment. They refinanced their 3.3% mortgage rate down to 2.99% in 2021, right before mortgage rates shot up to 7%. Now, their monthly mortgage is $2,487 — which is comparable to local rent for a similar unit in the Seattle area. Buying a house and locking down a low mortgage rate means Fischer doesn't have to worry about rising rents. "We're just incredibly grateful we were able to purchase our home when we did," Fischer said. Brinkman grew up helping his grandfather manage his personal accounts, which imbued him with a strong sense of financial responsibility. "When I was in my 20s, I moved to LA and was very tight on money," Brinkman said. "I had very little to live off of at the time, but I still prioritized investing." Between 2012 and 2013, Brinkman bought $4,000 of Apple (AAPL) and $5,000 of Tesla (TSLA), which he's held ever since. His investments have grown to roughly $43,000 and $167,000 since the initial buy-in, respectively. Brinkman, who works at a production company that creates images of cars, got the idea to invest in Tesla when he began seeing more Tesla vehicles in the showroom at his job. Similarly, Brinkman liked Apple computers in the early 2000s and decided to invest in the company when he had enough disposable income. Nowadays, Brinkman has taken a less risky approach to investing and regularly buys index funds every two weeks. Jiang, a former Google employee who now runs the personal finance platform Peek, enjoys investing in tech because it's an industry she's well-versed in. Jiang bought into Tesla in 2015 after hearing her boss and many others bragging about owning one. She had seen a rise in electric vehicle popularity, but consumers' brand association with Tesla made it stand out to her. "I was like, 'this is a category-defining company and I want to buy in,'" Jiang said. She grew her investment by 1,200%. She recently exited her position in the company, as she had achieved a substantial return and didn't like the volatility associated with CEO Elon Musk.

Jiang jumped in last year and snatched up the stock at just $23 a share. Since then, the stock has taken off, and Jiang's investment is up roughly 420%. Jiang has no plans to sell her Palantir stock anytime soon: "My conviction is that it'll be as big as an Nvidia," she said.

Title: What Analysts Think of Costco Stock Ahead of Earnings
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/what-analysts-think-of-costco-stock-ahead-of-earnings-11740169
Time Published: 2025-05-26T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
Costco Wholesale (COST) is set to report its results for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 after the closing bell on Thursday, with analysts generally bearing bullish ratings on the stock but not expecting substantial share-price gains. Ten analysts tracked by Visible Alpha rate the stock as a "buy," while the other six call the warehouse retail giant a "hold." The average price target is at $1,058.40, suggesting upside of about 4% from Wednesday's intraday level at $1,016.38, and just short of the stock's record close slightly under $1,077 on Feb. 13. Costco is expected to report an 8% increase in total revenue from the same time a year ago to $63.19 billion, while earnings per share are expected to rise 13% to $4.26. The retailer is expected to report 79.6 million paying members, up from 78.4 million last quarter. UBS analysts said last week that they see Costco as well-positioned to "navigate the uncertain macro backdrop better than the vast majority of retail," as it can quickly stop selling a product it may no longer be able to sell at an appealing price, and replace it with another. Executives have said Costco should be see the benefits of its membership fee increase, which took effect at the turn of its fiscal year in September, start to positively impact its profit in the second half of its fiscal 2025, and into fiscal 2026. The analysts said that high-margin membership revenue should give Costco more room to absorb the impact of tariffs without raising prices. "There’s probably not a lot that can come from this print that will change the market’s perception that [Costco] is a good place to be," UBS analysts wrote. "Though, its superior position, levers, and capabilities to manage the upcoming headwinds will probably be more evident as the impact of tariffs become translucent in the coming months." Costco shares, which have had an up-and-down year, have added about 11% in 2025 so far. UPDATE—May 28, 2025: This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent analyst estimates and share price values.

Title: Here are the 8 programming languages to know to land a tech job on Wall Street
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/top-programming-languages-work-wall-street-jobs
Time Published: 2025-05-26T08:48:01Z
Full Content:
Big Tech firms like Apple and Amazon have signaled a move away from the complicated coding language C++, but there's still a place for engineers who know it on Wall Street. Apple created Swift to replace its use of C++, the company's primary coding language for its devices. Amazon recently awarded a Stony Brook University professor an approximate $100,000 research grant to continue his work to automate converting existing C++ code to Rust, a coding language created in 2006. Even the White House has joined the conversation around C++, urging software developers to move away from the language due to cybersecurity concerns in a report last year. But the financial space is still "one of the heavy users of C++ that's really doing cutting-edge stuff," one industry executive told Business Insider. High-frequency trading firms and exchanges rely on C++, a notoriously complicated language that can offer more control over the underlying hardware. Citadel Securities, for one, hired a C++ expert Herb Sutter from Microsoft to lead training initiatives on the language and is already embracing a new version of C++ that has yet to be released. Looking at current open technology positions, trading firms Virtu Financial and Hudson River Trading are among the firms also seeking out C++ experience.When asked how prospective hires could demonstrate their C++ skills in a separate interview, Citadel's Sutter said they should talk about what they're looking forward to most in the newer version, C++26, to show their curiosity. "It's important to be able to demonstrate curiosity and knowledge about software advancements — and to show that you understand that there's more than one tool out there and that you know how to use them together," he said. In today's machine-to-machine world, having some experience with programming languages is a must. Coding languages, like Python and Java, are how humans can communicate with computers by providing a set of instructions for a system to execute. As it turns out, not all programming languages are made equal and some are more relevant to certain corners of Wall Street than others. Business Insider has compiled a list of the most-used coding languages through conversations with recruiters, Wall Street tech execs, and industry insiders. We also analyzed job postings to learn about in-demand skill sets. Areas of interest: Applicable across finance firms, job titles, and levels Firms using it: Banks, hedge funds, and investment firms As the fundamental language for engineering work across Wall Street, Python has long been at the top of the skills list for buy- and sell-side firms alike. It has been a favorite at Capital One and Man Group. From visualization to statistical analyses to modeling and machine-learning applications, Python has multiple use cases. It also lends itself to those who don't have deep coding backgrounds because it is flexible and applies to a wide range of users, Ori Ben-Akiva, director of portfolio management at Man Numeric, a quantitative-focused division of the publicly traded hedge fund Man Group, previously told BI. When it comes to data science and machine learning roles, "Python is king of the road," said Stabile, who runs his own recruiting shop called Stabile Search. Areas of interest: Anyone who works with databases, data Firms using it: Almost every financial firm As data becomes more centralized in financial firms' strategies — from marketing to identifying new deal opportunities and analyzing risk — it's helpful to know SQL, which is one of the most common and basic ways to query or pull information from a database. SQL is a relational database language, meaning it's designed to be able to tie different data tables together. For any tasks that have to do with analytics, you'll likely find SQL, Deepali Vyas, global head of fintech, payments, and crypto at Korn Ferry, told BI. Areas of interest: Low-latency applications Firms using it: High-frequency trading players and exchanges For applications and systems where speed (or a fast response time) is the name of the game, experience as a C++ developer is going to come in handy. That's especially true at high-frequency trading firms and exchanges, where companies edge each other out by being microseconds faster than the competition. The coding language has a reputation for being trickier to master than others, and its ability to interact more closely with technical hardware can lead to nasty coding bugs, but it also generally affords the user more control and speed.According to Matt Stabile, a tech recruiter who works with buy-side firms such as Two Sigma and Susquehanna International Group, it's also useful for roles in quantitative finance. Areas of interest: Data visualization, front-office analysts Firms using it: Wealth managers, banks When Wall Street tech execs talk about data, they often divide it into organizing it and finding insights within it. Korn Ferry's Vyas said the latter benefits from tools like Tableau and Power BI, which visualize and contextualize data. These types of graphics are especially useful if you work in wealth management or advisory, where dashboards and data tables are regularly used. Areas of interest: Big banks with more legacy technology Firms using it: Banks and some buy-side firms Like Python, Java is widely used on Wall Street. The coding language secured an early foothold in the world of banking because it was believed to have security features that restricted data access, while also offering portability, or the ability to be transferred between machines. As a result, many big banks are tethered to Java, but other firms like Two Sigma have also relied on the coding language. Areas of interest: App development Firms using it: Fintechs, banks Technically, many of the coding languages on this list — like Python, for example — are open source, or available for developers to use without a proprietary license. But several open-source languages have become more in-demand in recent years, including Go and Rust. When the banking fintech Stash built much of its core banking offering from the ground up in 2022, tech leaders at the company highlighted the use of Go — which they said was picked up quickly by engineers and cut the implementation time for "substantial" new pieces of code to roughly 3.5 days. Fintechs aren't the only financial firms embracing Go and other open source tools. At Blackrock, much of the firm's cloud work was built upon open-source software. Wells Fargo in recent years has embraced Rust and Go as languages the bank is becoming more comfortable with.

Title: Iris Recognition
URL: https://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Iris+recognition
Time Published: 2025-05-26T04:24:32Z
Full Content:
Iris recognition is an automated method of biometric identification that uses mathematical pattern-recognition techniques on video images of the irides of an individual's eyes, whose complex random patterns are unique and can be seen from some distance. Not to be confused with another, less prevalent, ocular-based technology, retina scanning, iris recognition uses camera technology with subtle infrared illumination to acquire images of the detail-rich, intricate structures of the iris. Digital templates encoded from these patterns by mathematical and statistical algorithms allow the identification of an individual or someone pretending to be that individual.[1] Databases of enrolled templates are searched by matcher engines at speeds measured in the millions of templates per second per (single-core) CPU, and with infinitesimally small false match rates. Many millions of persons in several countries around the world have been enrolled in iris recognition systems, for convenience purposes such as passport-free automated border-crossings, and some national ID systems based on this technology are being deployed. A key advantage of iris recognition, besides its speed of matching and its extreme resistance to false matches, is the stability of the iris as an internal, protected, yet externally visible organ of the eye. In 1987, two ophthalmology professors, Leonard Flom of New York University and Aran Safir of the University of Connecticut, were issued a first of its kind, broad patent # 4,641,349 entitled "Iris Recognition Technology".[2] Subsequently, John Daugman of Harvard University was then salaried by both ophthalmologists to write the algorithm for their concept based upon an extensive series of high resolution iris photos supplied to him by Flom from his volunteer private patients.[3] Several years later, Daugman received a method patent for the algorithm and a crudely constructed prototype proved the concept. The three individuals then founded "IriScan" (which later became "Iridian Technologies, Inc.") and assigned the Flom/Safir patent to that entity. "IriScan" then licensed several corporations to the exclusive Daugman algorithm under the protection of the Flom/Safir broad umbrella patent listed above; thus, preventing other algorithms from competing. Upon expiration of the Flom/Safir patent in 2008 other algorithms were patented and several were found to be superior to Daugman's and are now being funded by U.S. Government agencies.[4] Most iris recognition systems acquire images of the iris in the visible wavelength (400 - 700 nm) or near infrared range (700 - 900 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum. Each wavelength distinguishes different features of the iris with NIR and VW obtaining Information from the iris by its texture and pigmentation, respectively. The majority of iris recognition systems operate within the longer NIR spectrum which can penetrate dark-coloured irides, the dominant phenotype of the human population, revealing texture not easily observed in the VW spectrum. The NIR spectrum also reduces iris pattern contamination by blocking ambient corneal reflections. Although reducing reflections through NIR makes system recognitions robust, NIR imaging cannot distinguish the effects of melanin, the primary colouring component in irides. The melanin, also known as chromophore, mainly consists of two distinct heterogeneous macromolecules, called eumelanin (brown–black) and pheomelanin (yellow–reddish),[5][6] whose absorbance at longer wavelengths in the NIR spectrum is negligible. At shorter wavelengths within the VW spectrum, however, these chromophores are excited and provide rich sources of information mainly coded as shape patterns in iris. Hosseini, et al.[7] provide a comparison between these two imaging modalities and fused the results to boost the recognition rate. An alternative feature extraction method to encode VW iris images was also introduced, which is highly robust to reflectivity terms in iris. Such fusion results are seemed to be alternative approach for multi-modal biometric systems which intend to reach high accuracies of recognition in large databanks. An iris-recognition algorithm first has to localize the inner and outer boundaries of the iris (pupil and limbus) in an image of an eye. Further subroutines detect and exclude eyelids, eyelashes, and specular reflections that often occlude parts of the iris. The set of pixels containing only the iris, normalized by a rubber-sheet model to compensate for pupil dilation or constriction, is then analyzed to extract a bit pattern encoding the information needed to compare two iris images. In the case of Daugman's algorithms, a Gabor wavelet transform is used. The result is a set of complex numbers that carry local amplitude and phase information about the iris pattern. In Daugman's algorithms, most amplitude information is discarded, and the 2048 bits representing an iris pattern consist of phase information (complex sign bits of the Gabor wavelet projections). Discarding the amplitude information ensures that the template remains largely unaffected by changes in illumination or camera gain (contrast), and contributes to the long-term usability of the biometric template. For identification (one-to-many template matching) or verification (one-to-one template matching), a template created by imaging an iris is compared to stored template(s) in a database. If the Hamming distance is below the decision threshold, a positive identification has effectively been made because of the statistical extreme improbability that two different persons could agree by chance ("collide") in so many bits, given the high entropy of iris templates. The iris of the eye has been described as the ideal part of the human body for biometric identification for several reasons: It is an internal organ that is well protected against damage and wear by a highly transparent and sensitive membrane (the cornea). This distinguishes it from fingerprints, which can be difficult to recognize after years of certain types of manual labor. The iris is mostly flat, and its geometric configuration is only controlled by two complementary muscles (the sphincter pupillae and dilator pupillae) that control the diameter of the pupil. This makes the iris shape far more predictable than, for instance, that of the face. The iris has a fine texture that—like fingerprints—is determined randomly during embryonic gestation. Like the fingerprint, it is very hard (if not impossible) to prove that the iris is unique. However, there are so many factors that go into the formation of these textures (the iris and fingerprint) that the chance of false matches for either is extremely low. Even genetically identical individuals have completely independent iris textures. An iris scan is similar to taking a photograph and can be performed from about 10 cm to a few meters away. There is no need for the person being identified to touch any equipment that has recently been touched by a stranger, thereby eliminating an objection that has been raised in some cultures against fingerprint scanners, where a finger has to touch a surface, or retinal scanning, where the eye must be brought very close to an eyepiece (like looking into a microscope).[8] The commercially deployed iris-recognition algorithm, John Daugman's IrisCode, has an unprecedented false match rate (better than 10−11 if a Hamming distance threshold of 0.26 is used, meaning that up to 26% of the bits in two IrisCodes are allowed to disagree due to imaging noise, reflections, etc., while still declaring them to be a match).[9] While there are some medical and surgical procedures that can affect the colour and overall shape of the iris, the fine texture remains remarkably stable over many decades. Some iris identifications have succeeded over a period of about 30 years. Many commercial iris scanners can be easily fooled by a high quality image of an iris or face in place of the real thing. The scanners are often tough to adjust and can become bothersome for multiple people of different heights to use in succession. The accuracy of scanners can be affected by changes in lighting. Iris scanners are significantly more expensive than some other forms of biometrics, password or prox card security systems Iris scanning is a relatively new technology and is incompatible with the very substantial investment that the law enforcement and immigration authorities of some countries have already made into fingerprint recognition. Iris recognition is very difficult to perform at a distance larger than a few meters and if the person to be identified is not cooperating by holding the head still and looking into the camera. However, several academic institutions and biometric vendors are developing products that claim to be able to identify subjects at distances of up to 10 meters ("Standoff Iris" or "Iris at a Distance" as well as SRI International's "Iris on the Move" for persons walking at speeds up to 1 meter/sec).[8][10] As with other photographic biometric technologies, iris recognition is susceptible to poor image quality, with associated failure to enroll rates. As with other identification infrastructure (national residents databases, ID cards, etc.), civil rights activists have voiced concerns that iris-recognition technology might help governments to track individuals beyond their will. Researchers have tricked iris scanners using images generated from digital codes of stored irises. Criminals could exploit this flaw to steal the identities of others.[11] Alcohol consumption causes recognition degradation as the pupil dilates/constricts causing deformation in the iris pattern.[12] As with most other biometric identification technology, a still not satisfactorily solved problem with iris recognition is the problem of live-tissue verification. The reliability of any biometric identification depends on ensuring that the signal acquired and compared has actually been recorded from a live body part of the person to be identified and is not a manufactured template. Many commercially available iris-recognition systems are easily fooled by presenting a high-quality photograph of a face instead of a real face, which makes such devices unsuitable for unsupervised applications, such as door access-control systems. The problem of live-tissue verification is less of a concern in supervised applications (e.g., immigration control), where a human operator supervises the process of taking the picture. Methods that have been suggested to provide some defence against the use of fake eyes and irises include changing ambient lighting during the identification (switching on a bright lamp), such that the pupillary reflex can be verified and the iris image be recorded at several different pupil diameters; analysing the 2D spatial frequency spectrum of the iris image for the peaks caused by the printer dither patterns found on commercially available fake-iris contact lenses; analysing the temporal frequency spectrum of the image for the peaks caused by computer displays. Other methods include using spectral analysis instead of merely monochromatic cameras to distinguish iris tissue from other material; observing the characteristic natural movement of an eyeball (measuring nystagmus, tracking eye while text is read, etc.); testing for retinal retroreflection (red-eye effect) or for reflections from the eye's four optical surfaces (front and back of both cornea and lens) to verify their presence, position and shape. Another proposed method is to use 3D imaging (e.g., stereo cameras) to verify the position and shape of the iris relative to other eye features. A 2004 report by the German Federal Office for Information Security noted that none of the iris-recognition systems commercially available at the time implemented any live-tissue verification technology. Like any pattern-recognition technology, live-tissue verifiers will have their own false-reject probability and will therefore further reduce the overall probability that a legitimate user is accepted by the sensor.

Editor Podcasts Jeff Berwick, The Dollar Vigilante Happy Jewish Heritage Month! Brought to you by Jeff Berwickstein, the Mossad/CIA Global Connection Company, and NEOM: Trump & The Techno-rats’ new ‘self-regulated’ fantasy prison. NEOM… a 5-minute city spanning 106 miles, with no cars or streets, and housing 9 million people (because El Salvador will soon be full). It’s what happens when technocrats, Bond villains, and jewish/saudi/zionist billionaires join forces to build a utopia — for themselves — and a sandbox simulation for the rest of us. The acting players are, in no particular order: Elon Musk – visionary of surprise flamethrowers and self-drowning cars, now bringing Neuralink to your prefrontal cortex… whether you like it or not. Larry Fink – the BlackRock warlock who made sure your retirement fund now includes carbon credits and surveillance drones. Jeff Bezos – Amazon overlord who traded warehouse workers for humanoid robots with better bathroom privileges. Sam Altman – the guy who created ChatGPT and now wants to be your digital priest, philosopher, and parole officer. Donald Trump – making NEOM great again, one luxury neural re-education center at a time. Going around doing the same old globalist deals, setting up police states,smart cities, AI surveillance, digital tracking, lethal injections… and more desert Trump Towers. And, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, who might or might not be jewish. This makes total sense of course, seeing as The Zon has promised to cut ties with old pal Bibi and Israhell. The Rothschild-owned newsflash said so! Right? It seems right now nothing, not even the gaping chasm that swallowed the Epstein files, can derail maggat NPC loyalty. It’s all just a GIANT COINCIDENCE that this futuristic prison city is almost exactly the size and location of the promised land of “Greater Israel”. Nicely cohen-ciding with Bibi Nethanyahu’s plans for a massive free trade zone with rail service to NEOM. (Who said jews and muslims can’t work together for the greater good?) To the believers: Rest easy knowing the High Council of NEOM — Musk, Fink, Bezos, Altman, and Trump (holographic 2025 version) — meets monthly in a carbon-neutral bunker to discuss your happiness metrics and whether you should be allowed to dream in color. Because you’re free. The TV on your retina says so. The AI says so. Even your dreams are branded with the NEOM logo and soothing slogans like, “Progress is Obedience.” So buckle in, Citizen. NEOM isn’t just the future — it’s the prototype for the world they really want. Because when the elite says the planet needs saving, they mean from you.

With everyone from Wall Street giants like BlackRock to the U.S. government getting involved, the leading cryptocurrency is now more mainstream than ever. You can even buy burgers with it. So it begs the question: Why is it still so hard for some people to understand and accept? With traditional finance heavyweights like investor Warren Buffett and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon slamming the asset, it's appears that some people will never be open to Bitcoin. Speaking to Decrypt, Blockstream CEO and well-known early Bitcoiner Adam Back said that this is nothing new—and that even techies struggle to get their head around the cryptocurrency. Calling continued skepticism "confusing," Back used the example of cypherpunks back in the day who seemed uninterested in Bitcoin. He thought it was "crazy" that some of them didn’t get onboard. "You understood all about code, peer-to-peer networks, privacy, public key cryptography, and secure sockets layer," he added. "Like, you have a huge leg up in understanding this, and you're not interested. What gives?" Cypherpunk Back—who had an email exchange with the cryptocurrency's mysterious, pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008—said the fact that so-called digital gold isn't physical might be why some people remain suspicious of Bitcoin after all these years. "Some are skeptical about something that's not physical and yet has a scarcity," he commented, adding that the coin is still backed by physical resources like energy and mining equipment. Bitcoin is a digital payments system and virtual currency, and only 21 million digital coins will ever be minted into existence, thanks to the project's super-secure cryptographic engineering. Still, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon expressed cynicism over the leading crypto's code. In a 2023 interview, Dimon asked: "How do you know it's gonna stop at 21 million? Everyone says that," before adding, "Bitcoin itself is a hyped-up fraud." Of course, the billionaire banker also said his firm used the blockchain—a technology created by Satoshi. “Bitcoin itself is a hyped-up fraud,” says @jpmorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. “Crypto is a decentralized Ponzi scheme…It’s a pet rock.” pic.twitter.com/9KQfckty8f — Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) January 19, 2023 The biggest and oldest cryptocurrency was created with global banking failures in mind, with the original white paper released during the 2008 recession. A message referencing a newspaper article covering the situation was even inscribed on the network's genesis block. Now, Bitcoin advocates argue that the cryptocurrency can work as a true inflation hedge due to its scarcity. Back added that "for people who the establishment order is working," they may never understand the potential benefits of Bitcoin, nor may they trust something "more grassroots" in nature than fiat currency and traditional finance. "If they've got a high-paying job, they're working their way up the career ladder, things don't look too expensive for them, and they can afford mortgages," said Back, "then maybe they don't feel it."

Title: Trump's Middle East AI Deal: "Just Count the Server Racks"
URL: https://www.chinatalk.media/p/about-that-ai-middle-east-deal
Time Published: 2025-05-25T14:03:59Z
Full Content:
Zvi Mowshowitz of the Don't Worry About the Vase substack did an excellent job writing up the key dynamics of the deal. I’ll be running excerpts from his post with some comments of mine interspersed. Our government, having withdrawn the new diffusion rules, has now announced an agreement to sell massive numbers of highly advanced AI chips to UAE and Saudi Arabia (KSA). This post analyzes that deal and that decision. It is possible, given sufficiently strong agreement details (which are not yet public and may not be finalized) and private unvoiced considerations, that this deal contains sufficient safeguards and justifications that, absent ability to fix other American policy failures, this decision is superior to the available alternatives. Perhaps these are good deals, with sufficiently strong security arrangements that will actually stick. Perhaps UAE and KSA are more important markets and general partners than we realize, and the rest of the world really is unable to deploy capital and electrical power the way they can and there is nothing we can do to change this, and perhaps they have other points of strategic importance, so we have to deal with them. Perhaps they are reliable American allies going forward who wouldn’t use this as leverage, for reasons I do not understand. There are potential worlds where this makes sense. The fact remains that the case being made for this deal, in public, actively makes the situation seem worse. David Sacks in particular is doubling down and extending the rhetoric I pushed back against last week, when I targeted Obvious Nonsense in AI diffusion discourse. Even within the White House, the China hawks are questioning this deal, and Sacks responded by claiming to not even understand their objections and to all but accuse such people of being traitorous decels wearing trench coats. I stand by my statements last week that even if accept the premise that all we need care about are ‘America wins the AI race’ and how we must ‘beat China,’ our government’s policies, on diffusion and elsewhere, seem determined to lose an AI race against China. The point of the diffusion rules is to keep the AI chips secure and out of Chinese hands, both in terms of physical security and use of their compute via remote access. It is possible that the agreements we are making with UAE and KSA will replace and improve upon the functionality, in those countries in particular, of the diffusion rules. It’s not about a particular set of rules. It is about the effect of those rules. Give me a better way to get the same effect, and I’m happy to take it. When I say ‘something similar’ below, I mean in the sense of sufficient safeguards against the diversion of either the physical AI chips or the compute from the AI chips. Access to those chips is what matters most. Whereas market share in selling AI chips is not something I am inclined to worry about except in my role as Nvidia shareholder. I do not consider them reliable allies going forward, and there are various reasons that even the best version of these agreements would make me deeply uncomfortable, but it is possible to reach an agreement that physically locates many data centers in the Middle East and lets them reap the financial benefits of their investments and have compute available for local use, but does not in the most meaningful senses ‘hand them’ the compute in question. As in, no I do not trust them, but we could find a way that we do not have to, if they were fully open to whatever it took to make that happen. I also would highlight the implicit claim I made here, that the pool of American advanced AI chips is essentially fixed, and that we have sufficient funding available in Big Tech to buy all of them indefinitely. If that is not true, then the UAE/KSA money matters a lot more. Then there is the similar question of whether we were going to actually run out of available electrical power with no way to get around that. A lot of the question comes down to: What would have counterfactually happened to those chips? Would we have been unable to deploy them? [Jordan: See ChinaTalk’s recent coverage of an excellent IFP report that explored what a policy agenda to rapidly increase the energy available for AI deployment would look like] Despite leading the world in AI innovation, there’s no guarantee that America will rise to meet the challenge of AI infrastructure. Specifically, the key technological barrier for data center construction within the next 5 years is new power capacity With that in mind, here are the central points I highlighted last week: America is ahead of China in AI. Diffusion rules serve to protect America’s technological lead where it matters. UAE, Qatar and Saudi Arabia are not reliable American allies, nor are they important markets for our technology. We should not be handing them large shares of the world’s most valuable resource, compute. The exact diffusion rule is gone but something similar must take its place, to do otherwise would be how America ‘loses the AI race.’ Not having any meaningful regulations at all on AI, or ‘building machines that are smarter and more capable than humans,’ is not a good idea, nor would it mean America would ‘lose the AI race.’ AI is currently virtually unregulated as a distinct entity, so ‘repeal 10 regulations for every one you add’ is to not regulate at all building machines that are soon likely to be smarter and more capable than humans, or anything else either. ‘Winning the AI race’ is about racing to superintelligence. It is not about who gets to build the GPU. The reason to ‘win’ the ‘race’ is not market share in selling big tech solutions. It is especially not about who gets to sell others the AI chips. If we care about American dominance in global markets, including tech markets, stop talking about how what we need to do is not regulate AI, and start talking about the things that will actually help us, or at least stop doing the things that actively hurt us and could actually make us lose. Diffusion controls on AI chips we’ve enforced on China so far have had a huge impact. DeepSeek put out a highly impressive AI model, but by their own statements they were severely handicapped by lack of compute. Chinese adoption of AI is also greatly held back by lack of inference compute. China is competing in spite of this severe disadvantage. It is vital that we hold their feet to the fire on this. China has an acute chip shortage, because it physically cannot make more AI chips, so any chips it would ship to a place like UAE or KSA would each be one less chip available in China. Whenever you see arguments from David Sacks and others against AI diffusion rules, ask the question: Is an argument for a different set of export controls and a different chip regime that still protects against China getting large quantities of advanced AI chips? Or is it an argument, as it often is, that to preserve our edge in compute we should sell off our compute, that to preserve our edge in tech we should give away our edge in tech? As in, that what matters is our market share of AI chips, not who uses them? This is not a strawman, for example Ben Thompson argues exactly this very explicitly and repeatedly. Ben Thompson’s recent interview with Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, made it clear both of them have this exact position. That to maintain America’s edge in AI, we need to sell our AI chips to whoever wants them, including China, because ‘China will not be held back’ as if having a lot more chips wouldn’t have helped them. And essentially saying that all Nvidia chips everywhere support the ‘American tech stack’ rather than China rather obviously turning around and using them for their own tech. He explicitly is yelling we need to ‘compete in China’ or else. Complete Obvious Nonsense talking of his own book, which one must remind oneself is indeed his job, what were you really expecting him to say? Well, what he is saying is that the way we ‘lose the AI race’ is someone builds a CUDA alternative or steals Nvidia market share. That his market is what matters. It’s full text. Not remotely a strawman. I would disagree with arguments of form #2 in the strongest possible terms. If it’s arguments of form #1, we can talk about it. We should keep these facts in mind as we analyze the fact that the United States has signed a preliminary chip deal with the UAE. There is a 5GW AUE-US AI campus planned, and is taking similar action in Saudi Arabia. The deals were negotiated by a team led by David Sacks and Sriram Krishnan. Lennart Heim: To put the new 5GW AI campus in Abu Dhabi (UAE) into perspective. It would support up to 2.5 million NVIDIA B200s. That's bigger than all other major AI infrastructure announcements we've seen so far. In exchange for access to our chips, we get what are claimed to be strong protections against chip diversion, and promises of what I understand to be a total of $200 billion in investments by the UAE. That dollar figure is counting things like aluminum, petroleum, airplanes, Qualcomm and so on. It is unclear how much of that is new. The part of the deal that matters is that a majority of the UAE investment in data centers has to happen here in America. I notice that I am skeptical that all the huge numbers cited in the various investment ‘deals’ we keep making will end up as actual on-the-ground investments. As in: Walter Bloomberg: UAE PRESIDENT SAYS UAE TO INVEST $1.4T IN U.S OVER NEXT 10 YEARS At best there presumably is some creative accounting and political symbolism involved in such statements. Current UAE foreign-direct-investment stock in the USA is only $38 billion, their combined wealth funds only have $1.9 trillion total. We can at best treat $1.4 trillion as an aspiration, an upper bound scenario. If we get the $200 billion we should consider that a win, although if the deal is effectively ‘all your investments broadly are in the West and not in China’ then that would indeed be a substantial amount of funds. Nor is this an isolated incident. The Administration is constantly harping huge numbers, claiming to have brought in $14 trillion in new investment, including $4 trillion from the recent trip to Arabia, or roughly half of America’s GDP. Jason Furman (top economic advisor, Obama White House): That’s nuts and baseless. I doubt the press releases even add up to that. But, regardless, press releases are a terrible way to determine the investment or the impact of his policies on it. Justin Wolfers: Trump has claimed a $1.2 trillion investment deal from Qatar. Qatar’s annual GDP is a bit less than $250 billion per year. So he’s claiming an investment that would require every dollar every Qatari earned over the next five years. UAE’s MGX will also be opening Europe’s largest data center in France, together with Nvidia, an 8.5 billion Euro investment, first phase to be operational in 2028. This has been in the works for a while. Not that the numbers ultimately matter all that much. What does matter is: How will we ensure the chips don’t fall literally or functionally into Chinese hands? It comes down to the security provisions and who is going to effectively have access to and run all this compute. I don’t see here any laying out of the supposed tough security provisions. Without going into details, if the agreements on both physical and digital security are indeed implemented in a way that is sufficiently tough and robust, if we are the ones who both physically and digitally control and monitor things on a level at least as high as domestically, and can actually have confidence none of this will get diverted, then that goes a long way. We don’t yet have enough of that information to say. The public explanations for the deal, and the public statements about what safety precautions are considered necessary, do not bring comfort. I very much do not like comments like this, made in response to the Bloomberg piece above. David Sacks (US AI Czar): If the concern [about the deal] is about diversion of advanced semiconductors to China, that’s an important policy objective but one that is easily addressed with a security agreement and a “trust but verify” approach. Modern AI supercomputers are 8 feet tall and weigh two tons; these are not like diamonds smuggled in a briefcase. To verify that chips are where they’re supposed to be, an auditor can just visit the data center and count server racks. Semianalysis: As such, physical inspections are key to ensuring the GPUs are where they are supposed to be. The White House is aware of the risks and is prepared to ensure the chips are where they are supposed to be. As Bloomberg reported (quotes David Sacks’s statement above). I’m sorry, what? You can ‘just visit the data center and count server racks’? It terrifies me to see so many people arguing for the deal explicitly saying that this is a good statement, rather than a terrifying statement that we are hoping no one involved in the actual work believes to be true. [Jordan: In 2022 I did a show with Kevin Wolf, the former head of BIS, who mentioned off-hand that there were literally only two people Commerce had in China to do site inspections. Since then BIS’ budget has barely budged and faced DOGE cuts in the early days of this administration. There is not the capacity to do datacenter inspections in a serious way today.] Jordan Schneider: Let's start with the last thing first. This 60-day unverified list: is there a potential that the impact of this could actually be a lot bigger than what we currently see, if some of these big names on the unverified entity list end up graduating to full entity-list status? Kevin Wolf: It's really up to the Chinese government. If they allow access, give the information that the Commerce Department is seeking, and allow the two people in China that do inspections and site visits to do their jobs… Jordan Schneider: Whoa, wait, two? There are, like, 30 firms on there! Kevin Wolf: Yeah, I know, but no other country has any, and the Commerce Department is the only export control organization on the planet with its own enforcement agents who are subject matter experts in export controls. I think diversion via remote access is far more likely than physical diversion, and this response does not address the remote access issue at all, but even simply treating this as a physical diversion issue, o3, is the quoted statement accurate? o3 (full one shot, full response quoted, in response to literally quoting Sacks without attribution and asking ‘is this accurate?’): Short version: Mostly wrong. Chips are tiny and high-value, so diversion is hard to stop with “count the racks.” Physical audits help but they are far from sufficient. High value-to-weight ratio.At ~$30 k per H100, a single 20 kg carry-on full of GPUs is > $1 m. That’s an attractive target. Racks are heavy; the payload isn’t. Modularity.GPUs slide out in minutes. An auditor sees the enclosure; they cannot tell if the trays were swapped yesterday or will be tomorrow. Dummy blanks cost <$10. Front companies & trans-shipping.Chips often leave the compliant data-center before any inspection window. Paperwork shows them installed; reality changes after the auditor flies home. Remote lease risk.Even if the hardware stays in the U.S., Chinese entities can simply rent time on it. Export-control rules treat “deemed exports” (remote access by restricted users) as violations. Limited audit frequency & competence.Meaningful verification requires random, intrusive, technically savvy inspections plus cryptographic attestation of firmware. Counting racks is neither. My best estimate: ≤ 30 % that “security agreement + occasional rack counting” alone keeps advanced GPUs out of China for > 3 years. ≥ 70 % that significant leakage continues absent tighter controls (HW tracking, cryptographic attestation, and supply-chain tagging). So the quoted claim is misleading: rack-level audits are helpful but nowhere near “easily addresses” the diversion problem. When I asked how many chips would likely be diverted from a G42 data center if this was the security regime, o3’s 90% confidence interval was 5%-50%. Note that the G42 data center is 20% of the total compute here, so if we generously assume no physical diversion risk in the other 80%, that’s 1%-10% of all compute we deploy in the UAE. Is that acceptable? The optimal amount of chip diversion is not zero. But I think this level of diversion would be a big deal, and the bigger concern is remote access. I want to presume, for overdetermined reasons, that Sacks’s statement was written without due consideration or it does not reflect his actual views, and we would not actually make this level of dumb mistake where they could literally just swap the chips out for dummy chips. I presume we are planning to use vastly superior and more effective precautions against chip diversion and also have a plan for robust monitoring of compute use to prevent remote access diversion. But how can we trust an administration to take such issues seriously, if their AI Czar is not taking this even a little bit seriously? This is not a one time incident. Similar statements keep coming. That’s why I spent a whole post responding to them. David Sacks is also quoted extensively directly in the Bloomberg piece, and is repeatedly very dismissive of worried about diversion of chips or of compute, saying it is a fake argument and an easy problem to solve, and he talks about these as if they were reliable American allies in ways I do not believe are accurate. Sacks also continues to appear to view winning AI to be largely about selling AI chips. As in, if G42, an Abu Dhabi-based AI firm, is using American AI chips, then it essentially ‘counts as American’ for purposes of ‘winning,’ or similar. I don’t think that is how this works, or that this is a good use of a million H100s. Bloomberg reports 80% of chips headed to the UAE would go to US companies, 20% to G42. I very much want us to think about the actual physical consequences of various actions, not what those actions symbolize or look like. I do think, despite everything else, it is a very good sign that David Sacks is ‘urging people to read the fine print.’ This is moderated by the fact that we do not have the fine print, so we can’t read it. The true good news there requires one to read all that fine print, and one also should not assume that the fine print will get implemented. Nor do we yet have access to what the actual fine print says, so we cannot read it. Dylan Patel and others at Semianalysis offer a robust defense of the deal, saying clearly that ‘America wins’ and that this benefits American AI infrastructure suppliers on all levels, including AI labs and cloud providers. They focus on three benefits: money, tying KSA/UAE to our tech stack, and electrical power, and warn of the need for proper security, including model weight security, a point I appreciated them highlighting. Those seem like the right places to focus, and the right questions to ask. How much of their money is really up for grabs and how much does it matter? To what extent does this meaningfully tie UAE/KSA to America and how much does that matter? How much do we need their ability to provide electrical power? How will the security arrangements work, will they be effective, and who will effectively be in charge and have what leverage? Specifically, on their three central points: They call this macro, but a better term would be money. UAE and KSA (Saudi Arabia) can make it rain, a ‘trillion-dollar floodgate.’ This raises two questions. Question one: Was American AI ‘funding constrained’? The big tech companies were already putting in a combined hundreds of billions a year. Companies like xAI can easily raise funds to build giant data centers. If Google, Amazon, Apple, Meta or Microsoft wanted to invest more, are they really about to run out of available funding? Are there enough more chips available to be bought to run us out of cash? Semianalysis seems to think we should be worried about willingness of American companies to invest here and thinks we will have trouble with the financing. I am not convinced of this. Have you seen what these companies (don’t have to) pay on corporate bonds? Did we need to bring in outside investors? Should we even want to, given these investments look likely to pay off? This is a major crux. If indeed American big tech companies are funding constrained in their AI investments, then the money matters a lot more. Whereas if we were already capable of buying up all the chips, that very much cuts the other way. Question two: As we discussed earlier, is the trillion-dollar number real? We keep seeing these eye-popping headline investment numbers, but they don’t seem that anchored to reality, and seem to include all forms of investment including not AI, although of course other foreign direct investment is welcome. Do their investments in US datacenters mean anything, and are they even something we want, given that the limiting factor driving all this is either constraints on chip availability or on electrical power? Will this be crowding out other providers? If these deals are so positive for American tech companies, why didn’t the stock market moves reflect this? No, I will not accept ‘priced in.’ They call this geopolitical, that UAE and KSA are now tied to American technology stacks. As they say, ‘if Washington enforces tight security protocols.’ We will see. David Sacks is explicitly dismissing the need for tight security protocols. Classically, as Trump knows well, when the bank loans you a large enough amount and you don’t pay it back, it is the bank that has the problem. Who is being tied to whose stack? They will be able to at least cut the power any time. It is not clear from public info what other security will be present and what happens if they decide to turn on us, or use that threat as leverage. Can they take our chips and their talents elsewhere? This can almost be looked at as a deal with one corporation. G42 seems like it’s going to effectively be on the UAE side of the deal, and it is going to have a lot of chips in a lot of places. A key question is, to what extent do we have the leverage on and control over G42, and to what extent does this mean they will act as a de facto American tech company and ally? How much can we trust that our interests will continue to align? Who will be dependent on who? Will our security protocols extend to their African and European outposts? Why does buying a bunch of our chips tie them into the rest of our stack? My technical understand is that it doesn’t. They’re only tied to the extent that they agreed to be tied as part of the deal (again, details unknown), and they could swap out that part at any time. In my experience you can change which AI your program uses by changing a few lines of code, and people often do. It is not obvious why KSA and UAE using our software or tech stack is important to us other than because they are about to have all these chips. These aren’t exactly huge markets. If the argument is they have oversized effect on lots of other markets, we need to hear this case made out loud. Seminanalysis points out China doesn’t even have the capacity to sell its own AI chips yet. And I am confused about the perspectives here on ‘market share’ and the implied expectations about customer lock-in. They call this infrastructure, I’d simply call it (electrical) power. This is the clearly valuable thing we are getting. It’s rather crazy that ‘put our most strategic asset except maybe nukes into the UAE and KSA’ was chosen over ‘overrule permitting rules and build some power plants or convince one of our closer allies to do it’ but here we are. So the question here is, what are the alternatives? How acute is the shortage going to be and was there no one else capable of addressing it? Also, even if we do have to make this deal now, this is screaming from the rooftops, we need to build up more electrical power everywhere else now, so we don’t have this constraint again in the future. Semianalysis also raises the concern about model weight security, but essentially think this is solvable via funding work to develop countermeasures and use of red teaming, plus defense in depth. It’s great to see this concern raised explicitly, as it is another real worry. Yes, we could do work to mitigate it and impose good security protocols, and keep the models from running in places and ways that create this danger, but will we? I don’t know. Failure here would be catastrophic. There are also other concerns even if we successfully retain physical and digital control over the chips. The more we place AI chips and other strategic AI assets there, the more we are turning UAE, Saudi Arabia and potentially Qatar into major AI players, granting them leverage I believe they can and will use for various purposes. David Sacks continues to claim to not understand that others think that ‘winning AI’ is mostly not about who gets to sell chips, who uses our models and picks up market share, or about superficially ‘winning’ ‘deals.’ He not only thinks it is about market penetration, he can’t imagine an alternative. He doesn’t understand that many, including myself, this is about who has compute and who gets superintelligence, and about the need for proper security. David Sacks: I’m genuinely perplexed how any self-proclaimed “China Hawk” can claim that President Trump’s AI deals with UAE and Saudi Arabia aren’t hugely beneficial for the United States. As leading semiconductor analyst Dylan Patel observed, these deals “will noticeably shift the balance of power” in America’s favor. The only question you need to ask is: does China wish it had made these deals? Yes of course it does. But President Trump got there first and beat them to the punch. Sam Altman: this was an extremely smart thing for you all to do and i’m sorry naive people are giving you grief. Tripp Mickle and Ana Swanson (NYT): One Trump administration official, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly, said that with the G42 deal, American policymakers were making a choice that could mean the most powerful A.I. training facility in 2029 would be in the United Arab Emirates, rather than the United States. [Jordan: this is a wild line to be giving to the NY Times—I thought all the China hawks already got purged!] But Trump officials worried that if the United States continued to limit the Emirates’ access to American technology, the Persian Gulf nation would try Chinese alternatives. The hawks are concerned, because the hawks largely do not think that the key question is who will get to sell chips, but rather who gets to buy them and use them. This is especially true given that both America and China are producing as many top AI chips as they can, us far more successfully, and there is more than enough demand for both of them. One must think on the margin. Given that so many China hawks are indeed on record doubting this deal, if you are perplexed by this I suggest reading their explanations. Here is one example. Tripp Mickle and Ana Swanson (NYT): Mr. Goodrich said the United States still had the best A.I. engineers, companies and chips and should look for ways to speed up permitting and improve its energy grid to hold on to that expertise. Setting up some of the world’s largest data centers in the Middle East risks turning the Gulf States, or even China, into A.I. rivals, he said. “We’ve seen this movie before and we should not repeat it,” Mr. Goodrich said. Sam Winter-Levy, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the huge chip sales did “not feel consistent with an America First approach to A.I. policy or industrial policy.” “Why would we want to offshore the infrastructure that will underpin the key industrial technology of the coming years?” he asked. This does not seem like a difficult position to understand? There are of course also other reasons to oppose such deals. Here is Jordan Schneider of China Talk’s response, in which he is having absolutely none of it, explicitly rejecting that either America or China has chips to spare for this. rejecting that UAE and KSA are actual allies, not expecting us to follow through with reasonable security precautions, and saying if we wanted to do this anyway we could have held out for a better deal with more control than this, I don’t know why you would be confused how someone could have this reaction based on the publicly available information: Jordan Schneider: It’s going to cannibalize US build-out and leave the world with three independent power-centers of AI hardware where we could’ve stuck to our guns, done more power generation at home, and only had China to deal with not these wild-card countries that are not actual allies. If this really is as important as we believe, why are we letting these countries and companies we deeply distrust get access to it? The Gulf’s BATNA wasn’t Huawei chips, it was no chips. Whatever we’re trying to negotiate for, we can play harder to get. BIS can just say they can’t buy Ascends and it’s not like there’s enough capacity domestically in China to service global demand absent the TSMC loophole they charged through. Plus, we’re offering to sell them 10× the chips that Huawei could conceivably sell them anytime soon even if they use the TSMC-fabbed wafers. Where’s the art-of-the-deal energy here? Right now I only see AMD and NVDA shareholders as well as Sama benefiting from all of this. I thought we wanted to raise revenue from tariffs? Why not charge 3× the market rate and put the premium into the US Treasury, some “Make America Great Again” industrial-development fund, use it to triple BIS’ budget so they can actually enforce the security side, put them on the hook for Gaza…I don't know literally anything you care about. How about a commitment not to invest in Chinese tech firms? Do we still care about advanced logic made in America? How about we only let them buy chips fabbed in the US, fixing the demand-side problem and forcing NVDA to teach Intel how to not suck. Speaking of charging through loopholes, all of the security issues Dylan raises in his article I have, generously, 15 % confidence in USG being able to resolve/resist industry and politicians when they push back. If it’s so simple to just count the servers, why hasn’t BIS already done it / been able to fight upstream industry lobbying to update the chips-and-SME regs to stop Chinese build-outs and chip acquisition? What happens when the Trump gets a call from the King when some bureaucrat is trying to stop shipments because they see diversion if they ever catch it in the first place? Why are we doing anything with G42 again? Fine, if you really decide you want to sell chips to the UAE, at the very least give American hyperscalers the off-switch. It’s not like they would’ve walked away from that offer! America has a ton to lose in the medium term from creating another cloud provider that can service at scale, saying nothing of one that has some deeply-discomforting China ties pretty obvious even to me sitting here having never gotten classified briefings on the topic. Do the deal’s details and various private or unvoiced considerations make this deal better than it looks and answer many of these concerns? Could this be sufficient that, if looked at purely through the lens of American strategic interests, this deal was a win versus the salient alternatives? Again: That is all certainly possible! Our negotiating position could have been worse than Jordan believes. We could have gotten important things for America we aren’t mentioning yet. The administration could have limited room to maneuver including by being divided against itself or against Congress on this. On the flip side, there are some potentially uncharitable explanations for all of this, that would be reasonable to consider. Instead of understanding and engaging with such concerns and working to allay them, Sacks has repeatedly decided to make this a mask off moment, and engage in a response that I would expect on something like the All-In Podcast or in a Twitter beef, but which is unbecoming of his office and responsibilities, with multiple baseless vibe and ad hominem attacks at once that reflect that he either is willfully ignorant of the views, goals and beliefs of those he is attacking and even who they actually are, or he is lying and does not care, or both, and a failure to take seriously the concerns and objections being raised. Here is another illustration of this: David Sacks (May 17): After the Sam Bankrun-Fraud fiasco, it was necessary for the Effective Altruists to rebrand. So they are trying to position themselves as “China Hawks.” But their tech deceleration agenda is the same, and it would cost America the AI race with China. There are multiple other people I often disagree with on important questions but whom I greatly respect who are working on in administration on AI policy. There are good arguments you can make in defense of this deal. Instead of making those arguments in public, we repeatedly get this. Everything Sacks says seems to be about vibes and implications first and actual factual claims a distant second at best. He doesn’t logically say ‘all so-called China hawks who don’t agree with me are secret effective altruists in trench coats and also decels who hate all technology and all of humanity and also America,’ but you better believe that’s the impression he’s going for here. Would China have preferred to ‘do this deal’ instead? That at best assumes facts, and arguments, not in evidence. It depends what they would get out of such a deal, and what we’re getting out of ours, and also the security arrangements and whether we’ve formed a long lasting relationship in which we hold the cards. I’m also not even sure what it would mean for China to have ‘done this deal,’ it does not have what we are offering. Semianalysis says they don’t have similar quantities of chips to sell, and might not have any, nor are their chips of similar quality. I do agree China would have liked to ‘do a deal’ in some general sense, where they bring UAE/KSA into their orbit, on AI and otherwise, although they don’t need access to electrical power. More capital and friends are always helpful. It’s not clear what that deal would have looked like. [Jordan: the fact that the administration is citing some old news of Huawei promising to gift just $75m in chips to the Malaysian government (and not even today! Over two years!) is policy malpractice. Plus, this administration just made clear that using Huawei Ascend chips violates US export controls, giving America an enormously powerful lever to dissuade fence-sitting countries not to buy into what is already an inferior tech offering.] Here’s Tyler Cowen being clear eyed about some of what we are selling so cheap. The most powerful AI training facility could be in the UAE, and you’re laughing? Tyler Cowen: Of course Saudi and the UAE have plenty of energy, including oil, solar, and the ability to put up nuclear quickly. We can all agree that it might be better to put these data centers on US territory, but of course the NIMBYs will not let us build at the required speeds. Not doing these deals could mean ceding superintelligence capabilities to China first. Or letting other parties move in and take advantage of the abilities of the Gulf states to build out energy supplies quickly. Energy and ability to overcome NIMBYs is only that which is scarce because America is refusing to rise to this challenge and actually enable more power generation. Seriously, is there nowhere in America we can make this happen at scale? If we wanted to, we could do this ourselves easily. We have the natural gas, even if nuclear would be too slow to come online. It is a policy choice not to clear the way. And no, I see zero evidence that we are pulling out the stops here and coming up short. I think this frame is exactly correct - that this deal makes sense if and only if all of: The security deal is robust and we retain functional control over where the compute goes. We trust our friends here to remain our friends at a reasonable price. We counterfactually would not have been able to buy these chips and build data centers to power these chips. As far as I can tell China already has all the power it needs to power any AI chips it can produce, it is using them all, and its chip efforts are not funding constrained. So for want of electrical power, and for a few dollars, we are handing over a large amount of influence over the future to authoritarian powers with very different priorities and values? Tyler Cowen: In any case, imagine that soon the world’s smartest and wisest philosopher will soon again be in Arabic lands. We seem to be moving to a world where there will be four major AI powers — adding Saudi and UAE — rather than just two, namely the US and China. But if energy is what is scarce here, perhaps we were headed for additional AI powers anyway, and best for the US to be in on the deal? Who really will have de facto final rights of control in these deals? Plug pulling abilities? What will the actual balance of power and influence look like? Exactly what role will the US private sector play? Will Saudi and the UAE then have to procure nuclear weapons to guard the highly valuable data centers? Will Saudi and the UAE simply become the most powerful and influential nations in the Middle East and perhaps somewhat beyond? Yes. Those are indeed many of the right questions, once you think security is solid. Who is in charge of these data centers in the ways that matter? Won’t they at minimum have the ability to cut the power at any time? Who gets to decide where the compute goes? What are they going to do with all this leverage we are handing them? Is this what it means to have the future be based on American or Democratic values? Do you like ‘the values’ of the UAE and Saudi Arabian authorities? Tyler Cowen: I don’t have the answers to those questions. If I were president I suppose I would be doing these deals, but it is very difficult to analyze all of the relevant factors. The variance of outcomes is large, and I have very little confidence in anyone’s judgments here, my own included. Few people are shrieking about this, either positively or negatively, but it could be the series of decisions that settles our final opinion of the second Trump presidency. The administration thinks that the compute in question will remain under the indefinitely control of American tech companies, to be directed as we wish. Sriram Krishnan: Reflecting on what has been an amazing week and a key step in global American AI dominance under President Trump. These Middle East AI partnerships are historic and this “AI diplomacy” will help lock in the American tech stack in the region, help American companies expand there while also building infrastructure back in the U.S to continue expanding our compute capacity. This happens on top of rigorous security guarantees to stop diversion or unauthorized access of our technology. More broadly this helps pull the region closer to the U.S and aligns our technological interests in a very key moment for AI. It’s a very exciting moment and a key milestone. I hope that they are right about this, but I notice that I share Tyler’s worry that they are wrong. Similarly, Saudi Arabia’s Humain is going to get ‘several hundred thousand’ of Nvidia’s most advanced processors, starting with 18k GB300 Grace Blackwells. The justification given for rescinding the Biden diffusion rules is primarily that failure to do this would have ‘weakened diplomatic relations with dozens of countries by downgrading them to second-tier status.’ But, well, not to reiterate everything I said last week, but on that note I have news. One, we’re weakening diplomatic relations with essentially all countries in a series of unforced errors elsewhere, and we could stop. [Jordan: that feeling when you treat Dubai better than Canada] Two, most of the listed tier two countries have always had second-tier status. There’s a reason Saudi Arabia isn’t in Five Eyes or NATO. We can talk price about which countries should have which status, but no our relations are not all created equal, not when it comes to strategically vital national interests and to deep trust. I don’t share Sacks’s stated view that these are some of our closest and most trustworthy allies. Why does this administration seem to always want to make its deals mostly with authoritarian regimes, usually in places where Trump has financial ties? Tripp Mickle and Ana Swanson (NY Times): The announcements of the two deals follow reports that $2 billion has flowed to Trump companies over the last month from the Middle East, including a Saudi-backed investment in Trump’s cryptocurrency and plans for a new presidential airplane from Qatar. There’s always Trust But Verify. The best solution, if you can’t trust, is often to set up things so that you don’t have to. This can largely be done. Will we do it? And what will we get in return? What is announced mostly seems to be investments and purchases, that what we are getting are dollars, and Bloomberg is skeptical of the stated dollar amounts. This deal is very much not a first best solution. It is, at best, a move that we are forced into on the margin due to our massive unforced errors in a variety of other realms. Even if it makes sense to do this, it makes even more sense to be addressing and fixing those other critical mistakes. Electrical power is the most glaring in the context of this particular. There needs to be national emergency level focus on America’s inability to build electrical power capacity. Where are the special compute zones? Where are the categorical exemptions? Where is DOGE with regard to the NRC? Where is the push for real reform on any of these fronts? Instead, we see story after story of Congress actively moving to withdraw even the supports that are already there, including plans to outright abrogate contracts on existing projects. The other very glaring issue is trade policy. If we think it is this vital to maintain trade alliances and open up markets, and maintaining market share, why are we otherwise going in the opposite direction? Why are we alienating most of our allies? And so on. The argument for this deal is, essentially, that it must be considered in isolation. That other stuff is someone else’s department, and we can only work with what we have. But this is a very bitter pill to be asked to swallow, especially as Sacks himself has spoken out quite loudly in favor of many of those same anti-helpful policies, and the others he seems to be sitting out. You can argue that he needs to maintain his political position, but if that also rules out advocating for electrical power generation and permitting reform, what are we even doing? If we swallow the entire pill, and consider these deals only on the margin, without any ability to impact any of our other decisions, and only with respect to ‘beating China’ and ability to ‘win the AI race,’ and assume fully good faith and set aside all the poor arguments and consider only the steelman case, we can ask: Do these deals help us? I believe that such a deal is justifiable, again on the margin and regarding our position with respect to China, if and only if ALL of the following are true: Security arrangements are robust, the chips actually do remain under our physical control and we actually do determine what happens with the compute. And things are set up such that America retains the leverage, and we can count on UAE/KSA to remain our friends going forward. This was essentially the best deal we could have gotten. This represents a major shift in our or China’s ability to stand up advanced AI chips, because for the bulk of these chips either Big Tech would have run out of money, or we would have been unable to source the necessary electrical power, or China has surplus advanced AI chips I was not previously aware of and no way to deploy them. Entering into these partnerships is more diplomatically impactful, and these friendships are more valuable, than they appear to me based on public info. ChinaTalk is a reader-supported publication.

I spent two years in a China Studies master’s program. It was fun reading Dream of the Red Chamber and Xi speeches — but I really wish I had come out of it with some hard skills, too. Had I only known about the University of San Francisco’s new Master of Science in Applied Economics Excellent commentary. I'm increasingly baffled by the inconsistencies in how the administration views AI. On one hand, it's the most important technology of the century, and will definitively decide the outcome of the U.S.-China competition. Yet we're willing to outsource and offshore data center development. I realize the analogy is flawed, but it has the same feeling as saying we want to outsource production of the B-21 because we have too many regulations, it will take too long to get permits and build, we can't afford it, and BTW we'll be able to provide oversight and monitoring of the manufacturing plant. Not something we would do in a million years. So if AI is that critical, why would we ever agree to this chip sales/data center deal--purported to result in what will become the largest cluster in the world? (While cutting BIS resources.) Rather than being about national self-interests, this has all the earmarks of a pure transactional agreement, centered on money and power. And while it's easy to be skeptical of the claims about AGI and ASI, if the assertion is that AI is going to be the most powerful, game-changing tech of the century, why should we ever stop states from trying to implement reasonable oversight and regulations? The states are doing it because there's a major gap at the federal level. The hyperbolic claims about over-regulation of AI during the previous administration are belied by the facts on the ground. In reality, the previous EOs directed very little regulation, outside mandating a number of actions within the government itself. I'm all for smart, tailored, less intrusive regulations. But it's really hard to justify scant or no regulatory actions, at the same time the administration is arguing that this technology will forever change the world. We're trying to create another Taiwan we have to protect lol No posts Ready for more?

Full Content:
Zvi Mowshowitz of the Don't Worry About the Vase substack did an excellent job writing up the key dynamics of the deal. I’ll be running excerpts from his post with some comments of mine interspersed. Our government, having withdrawn the new diffusion rules, has now announced an agreement to sell massive numbers of highly advanced AI chips to UAE and Saudi Arabia (KSA). This post analyzes that deal and that decision. It is possible, given sufficiently strong agreement details (which are not yet public and may not be finalized) and private unvoiced considerations, that this deal contains sufficient safeguards and justifications that, absent ability to fix other American policy failures, this decision is superior to the available alternatives. Perhaps these are good deals, with sufficiently strong security arrangements that will actually stick. Perhaps UAE and KSA are more important markets and general partners than we realize, and the rest of the world really is unable to deploy capital and electrical power the way they can and there is nothing we can do to change this, and perhaps they have other points of strategic importance, so we have to deal with them. Perhaps they are reliable American allies going forward who wouldn’t use this as leverage, for reasons I do not understand. There are potential worlds where this makes sense. The fact remains that the case being made for this deal, in public, actively makes the situation seem worse. David Sacks in particular is doubling down and extending the rhetoric I pushed back against last week, when I targeted Obvious Nonsense in AI diffusion discourse. Even within the White House, the China hawks are questioning this deal, and Sacks responded by claiming to not even understand their objections and to all but accuse such people of being traitorous decels wearing trench coats. I stand by my statements last week that even if accept the premise that all we need care about are ‘America wins the AI race’ and how we must ‘beat China,’ our government’s policies, on diffusion and elsewhere, seem determined to lose an AI race against China. The point of the diffusion rules is to keep the AI chips secure and out of Chinese hands, both in terms of physical security and use of their compute via remote access. It is possible that the agreements we are making with UAE and KSA will replace and improve upon the functionality, in those countries in particular, of the diffusion rules. It’s not about a particular set of rules. It is about the effect of those rules. Give me a better way to get the same effect, and I’m happy to take it. When I say ‘something similar’ below, I mean in the sense of sufficient safeguards against the diversion of either the physical AI chips or the compute from the AI chips. Access to those chips is what matters most. Whereas market share in selling AI chips is not something I am inclined to worry about except in my role as Nvidia shareholder. I do not consider them reliable allies going forward, and there are various reasons that even the best version of these agreements would make me deeply uncomfortable, but it is possible to reach an agreement that physically locates many data centers in the Middle East and lets them reap the financial benefits of their investments and have compute available for local use, but does not in the most meaningful senses ‘hand them’ the compute in question. As in, no I do not trust them, but we could find a way that we do not have to, if they were fully open to whatever it took to make that happen. I also would highlight the implicit claim I made here, that the pool of American advanced AI chips is essentially fixed, and that we have sufficient funding available in Big Tech to buy all of them indefinitely. If that is not true, then the UAE/KSA money matters a lot more. Then there is the similar question of whether we were going to actually run out of available electrical power with no way to get around that. A lot of the question comes down to: What would have counterfactually happened to those chips? Would we have been unable to deploy them? [Jordan: See ChinaTalk’s recent coverage of an excellent IFP report that explored what a policy agenda to rapidly increase the energy available for AI deployment would look like] Despite leading the world in AI innovation, there’s no guarantee that America will rise to meet the challenge of AI infrastructure. Specifically, the key technological barrier for data center construction within the next 5 years is new power capacity With that in mind, here are the central points I highlighted last week: America is ahead of China in AI. Diffusion rules serve to protect America’s technological lead where it matters. UAE, Qatar and Saudi Arabia are not reliable American allies, nor are they important markets for our technology. We should not be handing them large shares of the world’s most valuable resource, compute. The exact diffusion rule is gone but something similar must take its place, to do otherwise would be how America ‘loses the AI race.’ Not having any meaningful regulations at all on AI, or ‘building machines that are smarter and more capable than humans,’ is not a good idea, nor would it mean America would ‘lose the AI race.’ AI is currently virtually unregulated as a distinct entity, so ‘repeal 10 regulations for every one you add’ is to not regulate at all building machines that are soon likely to be smarter and more capable than humans, or anything else either. ‘Winning the AI race’ is about racing to superintelligence. It is not about who gets to build the GPU. The reason to ‘win’ the ‘race’ is not market share in selling big tech solutions. It is especially not about who gets to sell others the AI chips. If we care about American dominance in global markets, including tech markets, stop talking about how what we need to do is not regulate AI, and start talking about the things that will actually help us, or at least stop doing the things that actively hurt us and could actually make us lose. Diffusion controls on AI chips we’ve enforced on China so far have had a huge impact. DeepSeek put out a highly impressive AI model, but by their own statements they were severely handicapped by lack of compute. Chinese adoption of AI is also greatly held back by lack of inference compute. China is competing in spite of this severe disadvantage. It is vital that we hold their feet to the fire on this. China has an acute chip shortage, because it physically cannot make more AI chips, so any chips it would ship to a place like UAE or KSA would each be one less chip available in China. Whenever you see arguments from David Sacks and others against AI diffusion rules, ask the question: Is an argument for a different set of export controls and a different chip regime that still protects against China getting large quantities of advanced AI chips? Or is it an argument, as it often is, that to preserve our edge in compute we should sell off our compute, that to preserve our edge in tech we should give away our edge in tech? As in, that what matters is our market share of AI chips, not who uses them? This is not a strawman, for example Ben Thompson argues exactly this very explicitly and repeatedly. Ben Thompson’s recent interview with Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, made it clear both of them have this exact position. That to maintain America’s edge in AI, we need to sell our AI chips to whoever wants them, including China, because ‘China will not be held back’ as if having a lot more chips wouldn’t have helped them. And essentially saying that all Nvidia chips everywhere support the ‘American tech stack’ rather than China rather obviously turning around and using them for their own tech. He explicitly is yelling we need to ‘compete in China’ or else. Complete Obvious Nonsense talking of his own book, which one must remind oneself is indeed his job, what were you really expecting him to say? Well, what he is saying is that the way we ‘lose the AI race’ is someone builds a CUDA alternative or steals Nvidia market share. That his market is what matters. It’s full text. Not remotely a strawman. I would disagree with arguments of form #2 in the strongest possible terms. If it’s arguments of form #1, we can talk about it. We should keep these facts in mind as we analyze the fact that the United States has signed a preliminary chip deal with the UAE. There is a 5GW AUE-US AI campus planned, and is taking similar action in Saudi Arabia. The deals were negotiated by a team led by David Sacks and Sriram Krishnan. Lennart Heim: To put the new 5GW AI campus in Abu Dhabi (UAE) into perspective. It would support up to 2.5 million NVIDIA B200s. That's bigger than all other major AI infrastructure announcements we've seen so far. In exchange for access to our chips, we get what are claimed to be strong protections against chip diversion, and promises of what I understand to be a total of $200 billion in investments by the UAE. That dollar figure is counting things like aluminum, petroleum, airplanes, Qualcomm and so on. It is unclear how much of that is new. The part of the deal that matters is that a majority of the UAE investment in data centers has to happen here in America. I notice that I am skeptical that all the huge numbers cited in the various investment ‘deals’ we keep making will end up as actual on-the-ground investments. As in: Walter Bloomberg: UAE PRESIDENT SAYS UAE TO INVEST $1.4T IN U.S OVER NEXT 10 YEARS At best there presumably is some creative accounting and political symbolism involved in such statements. Current UAE foreign-direct-investment stock in the USA is only $38 billion, their combined wealth funds only have $1.9 trillion total. We can at best treat $1.4 trillion as an aspiration, an upper bound scenario. If we get the $200 billion we should consider that a win, although if the deal is effectively ‘all your investments broadly are in the West and not in China’ then that would indeed be a substantial amount of funds. Nor is this an isolated incident. The Administration is constantly harping huge numbers, claiming to have brought in $14 trillion in new investment, including $4 trillion from the recent trip to Arabia, or roughly half of America’s GDP. Jason Furman (top economic advisor, Obama White House): That’s nuts and baseless. I doubt the press releases even add up to that. But, regardless, press releases are a terrible way to determine the investment or the impact of his policies on it. Justin Wolfers: Trump has claimed a $1.2 trillion investment deal from Qatar. Qatar’s annual GDP is a bit less than $250 billion per year. So he’s claiming an investment that would require every dollar every Qatari earned over the next five years. UAE’s MGX will also be opening Europe’s largest data center in France, together with Nvidia, an 8.5 billion Euro investment, first phase to be operational in 2028. This has been in the works for a while. Not that the numbers ultimately matter all that much. What does matter is: How will we ensure the chips don’t fall literally or functionally into Chinese hands? It comes down to the security provisions and who is going to effectively have access to and run all this compute. I don’t see here any laying out of the supposed tough security provisions. Without going into details, if the agreements on both physical and digital security are indeed implemented in a way that is sufficiently tough and robust, if we are the ones who both physically and digitally control and monitor things on a level at least as high as domestically, and can actually have confidence none of this will get diverted, then that goes a long way. We don’t yet have enough of that information to say. The public explanations for the deal, and the public statements about what safety precautions are considered necessary, do not bring comfort. I very much do not like comments like this, made in response to the Bloomberg piece above. David Sacks (US AI Czar): If the concern [about the deal] is about diversion of advanced semiconductors to China, that’s an important policy objective but one that is easily addressed with a security agreement and a “trust but verify” approach. Modern AI supercomputers are 8 feet tall and weigh two tons; these are not like diamonds smuggled in a briefcase. To verify that chips are where they’re supposed to be, an auditor can just visit the data center and count server racks. Semianalysis: As such, physical inspections are key to ensuring the GPUs are where they are supposed to be. The White House is aware of the risks and is prepared to ensure the chips are where they are supposed to be. As Bloomberg reported (quotes David Sacks’s statement above). I’m sorry, what? You can ‘just visit the data center and count server racks’? It terrifies me to see so many people arguing for the deal explicitly saying that this is a good statement, rather than a terrifying statement that we are hoping no one involved in the actual work believes to be true. [Jordan: In 2022 I did a show with Kevin Wolf, the former head of BIS, who mentioned off-hand that there were literally only two people Commerce had in China to do site inspections. Since then BIS’ budget has barely budged and faced DOGE cuts in the early days of this administration. There is not the capacity to do datacenter inspections in a serious way today.] Jordan Schneider: Let's start with the last thing first. This 60-day unverified list: is there a potential that the impact of this could actually be a lot bigger than what we currently see, if some of these big names on the unverified entity list end up graduating to full entity-list status? Kevin Wolf: It's really up to the Chinese government. If they allow access, give the information that the Commerce Department is seeking, and allow the two people in China that do inspections and site visits to do their jobs… Jordan Schneider: Whoa, wait, two? There are, like, 30 firms on there! Kevin Wolf: Yeah, I know, but no other country has any, and the Commerce Department is the only export control organization on the planet with its own enforcement agents who are subject matter experts in export controls. I think diversion via remote access is far more likely than physical diversion, and this response does not address the remote access issue at all, but even simply treating this as a physical diversion issue, o3, is the quoted statement accurate? o3 (full one shot, full response quoted, in response to literally quoting Sacks without attribution and asking ‘is this accurate?’): Short version: Mostly wrong. Chips are tiny and high-value, so diversion is hard to stop with “count the racks.” Physical audits help but they are far from sufficient. High value-to-weight ratio.At ~$30 k per H100, a single 20 kg carry-on full of GPUs is > $1 m. That’s an attractive target. Racks are heavy; the payload isn’t. Modularity.GPUs slide out in minutes. An auditor sees the enclosure; they cannot tell if the trays were swapped yesterday or will be tomorrow. Dummy blanks cost <$10. Front companies & trans-shipping.Chips often leave the compliant data-center before any inspection window. Paperwork shows them installed; reality changes after the auditor flies home. Remote lease risk.Even if the hardware stays in the U.S., Chinese entities can simply rent time on it. Export-control rules treat “deemed exports” (remote access by restricted users) as violations. Limited audit frequency & competence.Meaningful verification requires random, intrusive, technically savvy inspections plus cryptographic attestation of firmware. Counting racks is neither. My best estimate: ≤ 30 % that “security agreement + occasional rack counting” alone keeps advanced GPUs out of China for > 3 years. ≥ 70 % that significant leakage continues absent tighter controls (HW tracking, cryptographic attestation, and supply-chain tagging). So the quoted claim is misleading: rack-level audits are helpful but nowhere near “easily addresses” the diversion problem. When I asked how many chips would likely be diverted from a G42 data center if this was the security regime, o3’s 90% confidence interval was 5%-50%. Note that the G42 data center is 20% of the total compute here, so if we generously assume no physical diversion risk in the other 80%, that’s 1%-10% of all compute we deploy in the UAE. Is that acceptable? The optimal amount of chip diversion is not zero. But I think this level of diversion would be a big deal, and the bigger concern is remote access. I want to presume, for overdetermined reasons, that Sacks’s statement was written without due consideration or it does not reflect his actual views, and we would not actually make this level of dumb mistake where they could literally just swap the chips out for dummy chips. I presume we are planning to use vastly superior and more effective precautions against chip diversion and also have a plan for robust monitoring of compute use to prevent remote access diversion. But how can we trust an administration to take such issues seriously, if their AI Czar is not taking this even a little bit seriously? This is not a one time incident. Similar statements keep coming. That’s why I spent a whole post responding to them. David Sacks is also quoted extensively directly in the Bloomberg piece, and is repeatedly very dismissive of worried about diversion of chips or of compute, saying it is a fake argument and an easy problem to solve, and he talks about these as if they were reliable American allies in ways I do not believe are accurate. Sacks also continues to appear to view winning AI to be largely about selling AI chips. As in, if G42, an Abu Dhabi-based AI firm, is using American AI chips, then it essentially ‘counts as American’ for purposes of ‘winning,’ or similar. I don’t think that is how this works, or that this is a good use of a million H100s. Bloomberg reports 80% of chips headed to the UAE would go to US companies, 20% to G42. I very much want us to think about the actual physical consequences of various actions, not what those actions symbolize or look like. I do think, despite everything else, it is a very good sign that David Sacks is ‘urging people to read the fine print.’ This is moderated by the fact that we do not have the fine print, so we can’t read it. The true good news there requires one to read all that fine print, and one also should not assume that the fine print will get implemented. Nor do we yet have access to what the actual fine print says, so we cannot read it. Dylan Patel and others at Semianalysis offer a robust defense of the deal, saying clearly that ‘America wins’ and that this benefits American AI infrastructure suppliers on all levels, including AI labs and cloud providers. They focus on three benefits: money, tying KSA/UAE to our tech stack, and electrical power, and warn of the need for proper security, including model weight security, a point I appreciated them highlighting. Those seem like the right places to focus, and the right questions to ask. How much of their money is really up for grabs and how much does it matter? To what extent does this meaningfully tie UAE/KSA to America and how much does that matter? How much do we need their ability to provide electrical power? How will the security arrangements work, will they be effective, and who will effectively be in charge and have what leverage? Specifically, on their three central points: They call this macro, but a better term would be money. UAE and KSA (Saudi Arabia) can make it rain, a ‘trillion-dollar floodgate.’ This raises two questions. Question one: Was American AI ‘funding constrained’? The big tech companies were already putting in a combined hundreds of billions a year. Companies like xAI can easily raise funds to build giant data centers. If Google, Amazon, Apple, Meta or Microsoft wanted to invest more, are they really about to run out of available funding? Are there enough more chips available to be bought to run us out of cash? Semianalysis seems to think we should be worried about willingness of American companies to invest here and thinks we will have trouble with the financing. I am not convinced of this. Have you seen what these companies (don’t have to) pay on corporate bonds? Did we need to bring in outside investors? Should we even want to, given these investments look likely to pay off? This is a major crux. If indeed American big tech companies are funding constrained in their AI investments, then the money matters a lot more. Whereas if we were already capable of buying up all the chips, that very much cuts the other way. Question two: As we discussed earlier, is the trillion-dollar number real? We keep seeing these eye-popping headline investment numbers, but they don’t seem that anchored to reality, and seem to include all forms of investment including not AI, although of course other foreign direct investment is welcome. Do their investments in US datacenters mean anything, and are they even something we want, given that the limiting factor driving all this is either constraints on chip availability or on electrical power? Will this be crowding out other providers? If these deals are so positive for American tech companies, why didn’t the stock market moves reflect this? No, I will not accept ‘priced in.’ They call this geopolitical, that UAE and KSA are now tied to American technology stacks. As they say, ‘if Washington enforces tight security protocols.’ We will see. David Sacks is explicitly dismissing the need for tight security protocols. Classically, as Trump knows well, when the bank loans you a large enough amount and you don’t pay it back, it is the bank that has the problem. Who is being tied to whose stack? They will be able to at least cut the power any time. It is not clear from public info what other security will be present and what happens if they decide to turn on us, or use that threat as leverage. Can they take our chips and their talents elsewhere? This can almost be looked at as a deal with one corporation. G42 seems like it’s going to effectively be on the UAE side of the deal, and it is going to have a lot of chips in a lot of places. A key question is, to what extent do we have the leverage on and control over G42, and to what extent does this mean they will act as a de facto American tech company and ally? How much can we trust that our interests will continue to align? Who will be dependent on who? Will our security protocols extend to their African and European outposts? Why does buying a bunch of our chips tie them into the rest of our stack? My technical understand is that it doesn’t. They’re only tied to the extent that they agreed to be tied as part of the deal (again, details unknown), and they could swap out that part at any time. In my experience you can change which AI your program uses by changing a few lines of code, and people often do. It is not obvious why KSA and UAE using our software or tech stack is important to us other than because they are about to have all these chips. These aren’t exactly huge markets. If the argument is they have oversized effect on lots of other markets, we need to hear this case made out loud. Seminanalysis points out China doesn’t even have the capacity to sell its own AI chips yet. And I am confused about the perspectives here on ‘market share’ and the implied expectations about customer lock-in. They call this infrastructure, I’d simply call it (electrical) power. This is the clearly valuable thing we are getting. It’s rather crazy that ‘put our most strategic asset except maybe nukes into the UAE and KSA’ was chosen over ‘overrule permitting rules and build some power plants or convince one of our closer allies to do it’ but here we are. So the question here is, what are the alternatives? How acute is the shortage going to be and was there no one else capable of addressing it? Also, even if we do have to make this deal now, this is screaming from the rooftops, we need to build up more electrical power everywhere else now, so we don’t have this constraint again in the future. Semianalysis also raises the concern about model weight security, but essentially think this is solvable via funding work to develop countermeasures and use of red teaming, plus defense in depth. It’s great to see this concern raised explicitly, as it is another real worry. Yes, we could do work to mitigate it and impose good security protocols, and keep the models from running in places and ways that create this danger, but will we? I don’t know. Failure here would be catastrophic. There are also other concerns even if we successfully retain physical and digital control over the chips. The more we place AI chips and other strategic AI assets there, the more we are turning UAE, Saudi Arabia and potentially Qatar into major AI players, granting them leverage I believe they can and will use for various purposes. David Sacks continues to claim to not understand that others think that ‘winning AI’ is mostly not about who gets to sell chips, who uses our models and picks up market share, or about superficially ‘winning’ ‘deals.’ He not only thinks it is about market penetration, he can’t imagine an alternative. He doesn’t understand that many, including myself, this is about who has compute and who gets superintelligence, and about the need for proper security. David Sacks: I’m genuinely perplexed how any self-proclaimed “China Hawk” can claim that President Trump’s AI deals with UAE and Saudi Arabia aren’t hugely beneficial for the United States. As leading semiconductor analyst Dylan Patel observed, these deals “will noticeably shift the balance of power” in America’s favor. The only question you need to ask is: does China wish it had made these deals? Yes of course it does. But President Trump got there first and beat them to the punch. Sam Altman: this was an extremely smart thing for you all to do and i’m sorry naive people are giving you grief. Tripp Mickle and Ana Swanson (NYT): One Trump administration official, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly, said that with the G42 deal, American policymakers were making a choice that could mean the most powerful A.I. training facility in 2029 would be in the United Arab Emirates, rather than the United States. [Jordan: this is a wild line to be giving to the NY Times—I thought all the China hawks already got purged!] But Trump officials worried that if the United States continued to limit the Emirates’ access to American technology, the Persian Gulf nation would try Chinese alternatives. The hawks are concerned, because the hawks largely do not think that the key question is who will get to sell chips, but rather who gets to buy them and use them. This is especially true given that both America and China are producing as many top AI chips as they can, us far more successfully, and there is more than enough demand for both of them. One must think on the margin. Given that so many China hawks are indeed on record doubting this deal, if you are perplexed by this I suggest reading their explanations. Here is one example. Tripp Mickle and Ana Swanson (NYT): Mr. Goodrich said the United States still had the best A.I. engineers, companies and chips and should look for ways to speed up permitting and improve its energy grid to hold on to that expertise. Setting up some of the world’s largest data centers in the Middle East risks turning the Gulf States, or even China, into A.I. rivals, he said. “We’ve seen this movie before and we should not repeat it,” Mr. Goodrich said. Sam Winter-Levy, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the huge chip sales did “not feel consistent with an America First approach to A.I. policy or industrial policy.” “Why would we want to offshore the infrastructure that will underpin the key industrial technology of the coming years?” he asked. This does not seem like a difficult position to understand? There are of course also other reasons to oppose such deals. Here is Jordan Schneider of China Talk’s response, in which he is having absolutely none of it, explicitly rejecting that either America or China has chips to spare for this. rejecting that UAE and KSA are actual allies, not expecting us to follow through with reasonable security precautions, and saying if we wanted to do this anyway we could have held out for a better deal with more control than this, I don’t know why you would be confused how someone could have this reaction based on the publicly available information: Jordan Schneider: It’s going to cannibalize US build-out and leave the world with three independent power-centers of AI hardware where we could’ve stuck to our guns, done more power generation at home, and only had China to deal with not these wild-card countries that are not actual allies. If this really is as important as we believe, why are we letting these countries and companies we deeply distrust get access to it? The Gulf’s BATNA wasn’t Huawei chips, it was no chips. Whatever we’re trying to negotiate for, we can play harder to get. BIS can just say they can’t buy Ascends and it’s not like there’s enough capacity domestically in China to service global demand absent the TSMC loophole they charged through. Plus, we’re offering to sell them 10× the chips that Huawei could conceivably sell them anytime soon even if they use the TSMC-fabbed wafers. Where’s the art-of-the-deal energy here? Right now I only see AMD and NVDA shareholders as well as Sama benefiting from all of this. I thought we wanted to raise revenue from tariffs? Why not charge 3× the market rate and put the premium into the US Treasury, some “Make America Great Again” industrial-development fund, use it to triple BIS’ budget so they can actually enforce the security side, put them on the hook for Gaza…I don't know literally anything you care about. How about a commitment not to invest in Chinese tech firms? Do we still care about advanced logic made in America? How about we only let them buy chips fabbed in the US, fixing the demand-side problem and forcing NVDA to teach Intel how to not suck. Speaking of charging through loopholes, all of the security issues Dylan raises in his article I have, generously, 15 % confidence in USG being able to resolve/resist industry and politicians when they push back. If it’s so simple to just count the servers, why hasn’t BIS already done it / been able to fight upstream industry lobbying to update the chips-and-SME regs to stop Chinese build-outs and chip acquisition? What happens when the Trump gets a call from the King when some bureaucrat is trying to stop shipments because they see diversion if they ever catch it in the first place? Why are we doing anything with G42 again? Fine, if you really decide you want to sell chips to the UAE, at the very least give American hyperscalers the off-switch. It’s not like they would’ve walked away from that offer! America has a ton to lose in the medium term from creating another cloud provider that can service at scale, saying nothing of one that has some deeply-discomforting China ties pretty obvious even to me sitting here having never gotten classified briefings on the topic. Do the deal’s details and various private or unvoiced considerations make this deal better than it looks and answer many of these concerns? Could this be sufficient that, if looked at purely through the lens of American strategic interests, this deal was a win versus the salient alternatives? Again: That is all certainly possible! Our negotiating position could have been worse than Jordan believes. We could have gotten important things for America we aren’t mentioning yet. The administration could have limited room to maneuver including by being divided against itself or against Congress on this. On the flip side, there are some potentially uncharitable explanations for all of this, that would be reasonable to consider. Instead of understanding and engaging with such concerns and working to allay them, Sacks has repeatedly decided to make this a mask off moment, and engage in a response that I would expect on something like the All-In Podcast or in a Twitter beef, but which is unbecoming of his office and responsibilities, with multiple baseless vibe and ad hominem attacks at once that reflect that he either is willfully ignorant of the views, goals and beliefs of those he is attacking and even who they actually are, or he is lying and does not care, or both, and a failure to take seriously the concerns and objections being raised. Here is another illustration of this: David Sacks (May 17): After the Sam Bankrun-Fraud fiasco, it was necessary for the Effective Altruists to rebrand. So they are trying to position themselves as “China Hawks.” But their tech deceleration agenda is the same, and it would cost America the AI race with China. There are multiple other people I often disagree with on important questions but whom I greatly respect who are working on in administration on AI policy. There are good arguments you can make in defense of this deal. Instead of making those arguments in public, we repeatedly get this. Everything Sacks says seems to be about vibes and implications first and actual factual claims a distant second at best. He doesn’t logically say ‘all so-called China hawks who don’t agree with me are secret effective altruists in trench coats and also decels who hate all technology and all of humanity and also America,’ but you better believe that’s the impression he’s going for here. Would China have preferred to ‘do this deal’ instead? That at best assumes facts, and arguments, not in evidence. It depends what they would get out of such a deal, and what we’re getting out of ours, and also the security arrangements and whether we’ve formed a long lasting relationship in which we hold the cards. I’m also not even sure what it would mean for China to have ‘done this deal,’ it does not have what we are offering. Semianalysis says they don’t have similar quantities of chips to sell, and might not have any, nor are their chips of similar quality. I do agree China would have liked to ‘do a deal’ in some general sense, where they bring UAE/KSA into their orbit, on AI and otherwise, although they don’t need access to electrical power. More capital and friends are always helpful. It’s not clear what that deal would have looked like. [Jordan: the fact that the administration is citing some old news of Huawei promising to gift just $75m in chips to the Malaysian government (and not even today! Over two years!) is policy malpractice. Plus, this administration just made clear that using Huawei Ascend chips violates US export controls, giving America an enormously powerful lever to dissuade fence-sitting countries not to buy into what is already an inferior tech offering.] Here’s Tyler Cowen being clear eyed about some of what we are selling so cheap. The most powerful AI training facility could be in the UAE, and you’re laughing? Tyler Cowen: Of course Saudi and the UAE have plenty of energy, including oil, solar, and the ability to put up nuclear quickly. We can all agree that it might be better to put these data centers on US territory, but of course the NIMBYs will not let us build at the required speeds. Not doing these deals could mean ceding superintelligence capabilities to China first. Or letting other parties move in and take advantage of the abilities of the Gulf states to build out energy supplies quickly. Energy and ability to overcome NIMBYs is only that which is scarce because America is refusing to rise to this challenge and actually enable more power generation. Seriously, is there nowhere in America we can make this happen at scale? If we wanted to, we could do this ourselves easily. We have the natural gas, even if nuclear would be too slow to come online. It is a policy choice not to clear the way. And no, I see zero evidence that we are pulling out the stops here and coming up short. I think this frame is exactly correct - that this deal makes sense if and only if all of: The security deal is robust and we retain functional control over where the compute goes. We trust our friends here to remain our friends at a reasonable price. We counterfactually would not have been able to buy these chips and build data centers to power these chips. As far as I can tell China already has all the power it needs to power any AI chips it can produce, it is using them all, and its chip efforts are not funding constrained. So for want of electrical power, and for a few dollars, we are handing over a large amount of influence over the future to authoritarian powers with very different priorities and values? Tyler Cowen: In any case, imagine that soon the world’s smartest and wisest philosopher will soon again be in Arabic lands. We seem to be moving to a world where there will be four major AI powers — adding Saudi and UAE — rather than just two, namely the US and China. But if energy is what is scarce here, perhaps we were headed for additional AI powers anyway, and best for the US to be in on the deal? Who really will have de facto final rights of control in these deals? Plug pulling abilities? What will the actual balance of power and influence look like? Exactly what role will the US private sector play? Will Saudi and the UAE then have to procure nuclear weapons to guard the highly valuable data centers? Will Saudi and the UAE simply become the most powerful and influential nations in the Middle East and perhaps somewhat beyond? Yes. Those are indeed many of the right questions, once you think security is solid. Who is in charge of these data centers in the ways that matter? Won’t they at minimum have the ability to cut the power at any time? Who gets to decide where the compute goes? What are they going to do with all this leverage we are handing them? Is this what it means to have the future be based on American or Democratic values? Do you like ‘the values’ of the UAE and Saudi Arabian authorities? Tyler Cowen: I don’t have the answers to those questions. If I were president I suppose I would be doing these deals, but it is very difficult to analyze all of the relevant factors. The variance of outcomes is large, and I have very little confidence in anyone’s judgments here, my own included. Few people are shrieking about this, either positively or negatively, but it could be the series of decisions that settles our final opinion of the second Trump presidency. The administration thinks that the compute in question will remain under the indefinitely control of American tech companies, to be directed as we wish. Sriram Krishnan: Reflecting on what has been an amazing week and a key step in global American AI dominance under President Trump. These Middle East AI partnerships are historic and this “AI diplomacy” will help lock in the American tech stack in the region, help American companies expand there while also building infrastructure back in the U.S to continue expanding our compute capacity. This happens on top of rigorous security guarantees to stop diversion or unauthorized access of our technology. More broadly this helps pull the region closer to the U.S and aligns our technological interests in a very key moment for AI. It’s a very exciting moment and a key milestone. I hope that they are right about this, but I notice that I share Tyler’s worry that they are wrong. Similarly, Saudi Arabia’s Humain is going to get ‘several hundred thousand’ of Nvidia’s most advanced processors, starting with 18k GB300 Grace Blackwells. The justification given for rescinding the Biden diffusion rules is primarily that failure to do this would have ‘weakened diplomatic relations with dozens of countries by downgrading them to second-tier status.’ But, well, not to reiterate everything I said last week, but on that note I have news. One, we’re weakening diplomatic relations with essentially all countries in a series of unforced errors elsewhere, and we could stop. [Jordan: that feeling when you treat Dubai better than Canada] Two, most of the listed tier two countries have always had second-tier status. There’s a reason Saudi Arabia isn’t in Five Eyes or NATO. We can talk price about which countries should have which status, but no our relations are not all created equal, not when it comes to strategically vital national interests and to deep trust. I don’t share Sacks’s stated view that these are some of our closest and most trustworthy allies. Why does this administration seem to always want to make its deals mostly with authoritarian regimes, usually in places where Trump has financial ties? Tripp Mickle and Ana Swanson (NY Times): The announcements of the two deals follow reports that $2 billion has flowed to Trump companies over the last month from the Middle East, including a Saudi-backed investment in Trump’s cryptocurrency and plans for a new presidential airplane from Qatar. There’s always Trust But Verify. The best solution, if you can’t trust, is often to set up things so that you don’t have to. This can largely be done. Will we do it? And what will we get in return? What is announced mostly seems to be investments and purchases, that what we are getting are dollars, and Bloomberg is skeptical of the stated dollar amounts. This deal is very much not a first best solution. It is, at best, a move that we are forced into on the margin due to our massive unforced errors in a variety of other realms. Even if it makes sense to do this, it makes even more sense to be addressing and fixing those other critical mistakes. Electrical power is the most glaring in the context of this particular. There needs to be national emergency level focus on America’s inability to build electrical power capacity. Where are the special compute zones? Where are the categorical exemptions? Where is DOGE with regard to the NRC? Where is the push for real reform on any of these fronts? Instead, we see story after story of Congress actively moving to withdraw even the supports that are already there, including plans to outright abrogate contracts on existing projects. The other very glaring issue is trade policy. If we think it is this vital to maintain trade alliances and open up markets, and maintaining market share, why are we otherwise going in the opposite direction? Why are we alienating most of our allies? And so on. The argument for this deal is, essentially, that it must be considered in isolation. That other stuff is someone else’s department, and we can only work with what we have. But this is a very bitter pill to be asked to swallow, especially as Sacks himself has spoken out quite loudly in favor of many of those same anti-helpful policies, and the others he seems to be sitting out. You can argue that he needs to maintain his political position, but if that also rules out advocating for electrical power generation and permitting reform, what are we even doing? If we swallow the entire pill, and consider these deals only on the margin, without any ability to impact any of our other decisions, and only with respect to ‘beating China’ and ability to ‘win the AI race,’ and assume fully good faith and set aside all the poor arguments and consider only the steelman case, we can ask: Do these deals help us? I believe that such a deal is justifiable, again on the margin and regarding our position with respect to China, if and only if ALL of the following are true: Security arrangements are robust, the chips actually do remain under our physical control and we actually do determine what happens with the compute. And things are set up such that America retains the leverage, and we can count on UAE/KSA to remain our friends going forward. This was essentially the best deal we could have gotten. This represents a major shift in our or China’s ability to stand up advanced AI chips, because for the bulk of these chips either Big Tech would have run out of money, or we would have been unable to source the necessary electrical power, or China has surplus advanced AI chips I was not previously aware of and no way to deploy them. Entering into these partnerships is more diplomatically impactful, and these friendships are more valuable, than they appear to me based on public info. ChinaTalk is a reader-supported publication.

I spent two years in a China Studies master’s program. It was fun reading Dream of the Red Chamber and Xi speeches — but I really wish I had come out of it with some hard skills, too. Had I only known about the University of San Francisco’s new Master of Science in Applied Economics Excellent commentary. I'm increasingly baffled by the inconsistencies in how the administration views AI. On one hand, it's the most important technology of the century, and will definitively decide the outcome of the U.S.-China competition. Yet we're willing to outsource and offshore data center development. I realize the analogy is flawed, but it has the same feeling as saying we want to outsource production of the B-21 because we have too many regulations, it will take too long to get permits and build, we can't afford it, and BTW we'll be able to provide oversight and monitoring of the manufacturing plant. Not something we would do in a million years. So if AI is that critical, why would we ever agree to this chip sales/data center deal--purported to result in what will become the largest cluster in the world? (While cutting BIS resources.) Rather than being about national self-interests, this has all the earmarks of a pure transactional agreement, centered on money and power. And while it's easy to be skeptical of the claims about AGI and ASI, if the assertion is that AI is going to be the most powerful, game-changing tech of the century, why should we ever stop states from trying to implement reasonable oversight and regulations? The states are doing it because there's a major gap at the federal level. The hyperbolic claims about over-regulation of AI during the previous administration are belied by the facts on the ground. In reality, the previous EOs directed very little regulation, outside mandating a number of actions within the government itself. I'm all for smart, tailored, less intrusive regulations. But it's really hard to justify scant or no regulatory actions, at the same time the administration is arguing that this technology will forever change the world. We're trying to create another Taiwan we have to protect lol No posts Ready for more?

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. The recent sharp rise in US Treasury bond yields has raised questions about whether the move is ... More connected to US fiscal policy or the end of American exceptionalism. The evidence for alternate explanations is examined. Despite some pundits being quite convinced that U.S. fiscal policy or the end of American exceptionalism is the reason for the recent rise in U.S. Treasury yields, Buffalo Springfield was closer to reality when they sang, “Something’s happening here, What it is ain’t exactly clear.” It is not disputed that 10-year U.S. Treasury yields are 52 basis points (0.52%) higher since the 2025 low of 3.99% on April 4. Using U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities data, expected higher inflation accounted for 15 basis points, while the remaining 37 are from a higher real (after-inflation) return. 10-Year US Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition Notably, yields were at their nadir when the betting odds of recession were at their highest. As one should expect, yields have risen as the odds of a recession have declined. Directionally, the move in yields is logical, though some might still argue that yields have increased more than is warranted. Yields & Recession Odds Government bond yields in the U.S. have risen more than many other developed countries since April 4. Interestingly, our neighbor to the north has experienced a similar increase. 10-Year Government Bond Yield Change Since US Low Notably, global government bond yields hit their low during the pandemic and have trended higher since then. Global Yields If one looks at government yields since the end of last year, a different picture emerges. While higher government bond yields have been a global phenomenon, the U.S. has seen slightly lower yields. 10-Year Government Bond Year-To-Date Yield Change The other proof point for those arguing for the danger of U.S. fiscal policy or the end of American exceptionalism is the recent weakness in the U.S. currency relative to other currencies. While there is no doubt that the U.S. dollar has been weaker year-to-date, it follows a period of exceptional relative strength. The U.S. dollar remains stronger than it has been most of the time since 1999. Further, as shown in the historical data, periods of a weaker U.S. dollar do not uniformly lead to higher U.S. Treasury bond yields. US Dollar Without exception, the fiscal position of large countries, as measured by government debt relative to GDP, deteriorated with the impact of spending during the pandemic. Most countries were already piling on more debt relative to economic activity, but the pandemic accelerated the trend. Government Debt-To-GDP There is no magic level of debt-to-GDP that signals disaster since countries with a more resilient economy can service more debt. Furthermore, countries like the US, which has a high per capita GDP, control of the global reserve currency, and only issues debt in that currency, can handle significantly more debt levels than most other countries. German government debt levels are understated relative to reality. While Germany isn’t legally liable for the debts of its profligately spending neighbors, it shares a common currency and its share of European Union issued debt. Historically, Germany has been forced to contribute the most to bailout funds when other EU countries have encountered problems. Recent Government Debt-To-GDP Ratios The U.S. House of Representatives passed its tax legislation, which, despite reports to the contrary, does not make the U.S. fiscal situation any worse, according to Strategas. Tariffs should produce about $200 billion in revenue annually and are not included in the legislation’s official scoring, leading to much confusion. The U.S. Senate will almost certainly make some changes. So, the House bill is unlikely to be the final version implemented. The S&P 500 sits only 5.6% below its mid-February high in a robust rebound from the 19% decline from the peak reached on April 8. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has fared worse, and the group is 12% below its mid-December summit. Market Returns The proximate cause of the decline in stocks last week was the reheating of the tariff war, which increased the headwinds for the U.S. and global economy. President Donald Trump threatened the European Union with a 50% tariff and smartphone makers, notably Apple (AAPL), with a 25% tariff rate. The betting odds of recession rose to 41%, sending stocks 2.6% lower last week. Betting Odds of 2025 US Recession Despite the likely economic drag from the tariffs, only two expected rate cuts for 2025 are expected. There is little chance of a rate cut at the mid-June Federal Reserve meeting. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected The primary focus will likely remain on the fallout from the tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in U.S. policy and retaliation or concessions from other countries. Friday’s April inflation reading will likely be friendly. The Core PCE Price Index is the Federal Reserve’s favorite measure of inflation and should moderate to 2.5% year-over-year from the 2.6% pace in March. The last Magnificent 7 stock to report earnings is Nvidia (NVDA) on Wednesday after the close. As the leader in artificial intelligence chips, its results and forecasts will be closely watched to judge the health of technology spending. The rise in U.S. Treasury yields does not point to a U.S.-specific problem; instead, it is a function of the lower probability of an economic downturn and perhaps a shift in the global appetite for government bonds. Yields are not high enough yet to significantly negatively impact stock valuation since the higher yields are accompanied by less risk of an earnings decline from a recession. Like many other countries, the current fiscal trajectory in the U.S. is unsustainable, but the recent tax bill wouldn’t worsen things. Investors can be forgiven for wishing it improved the path, but the Senate will have their say next, and bond market participants will be watching closely. Government bond investors are demanding higher yields from most countries, so there might be a shift in the willingness of markets to fund large deficits, but it is too early to know for sure.

Government Debt-To-GDP There is no magic level of debt-to-GDP that signals disaster since countries with a more resilient economy can service more debt. Furthermore, countries like the US, which has a high per capita GDP, control of the global reserve currency, and only issues debt in that currency, can handle significantly more debt levels than most other countries. German government debt levels are understated relative to reality. While Germany isn’t legally liable for the debts of its profligately spending neighbors, it shares a common currency and its share of European Union issued debt. Historically, Germany has been forced to contribute the most to bailout funds when other EU countries have encountered problems. Recent Government Debt-To-GDP Ratios The U.S. House of Representatives passed its tax legislation, which, despite reports to the contrary, does not make the U.S. fiscal situation any worse, according to Strategas. Tariffs should produce about $200 billion in revenue annually and are not included in the legislation’s official scoring, leading to much confusion. The U.S. Senate will almost certainly make some changes. So, the House bill is unlikely to be the final version implemented. The S&P 500 sits only 5.6% below its mid-February high in a robust rebound from the 19% decline from the peak reached on April 8. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has fared worse, and the group is 12% below its mid-December summit. Market Returns The proximate cause of the decline in stocks last week was the reheating of the tariff war, which increased the headwinds for the U.S. and global economy. President Donald Trump threatened the European Union with a 50% tariff and smartphone makers, notably Apple (AAPL), with a 25% tariff rate. The betting odds of recession rose to 41%, sending stocks 2.6% lower last week. Betting Odds of 2025 US Recession Despite the likely economic drag from the tariffs, only two expected rate cuts for 2025 are expected. There is little chance of a rate cut at the mid-June Federal Reserve meeting. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected The primary focus will likely remain on the fallout from the tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in U.S. policy and retaliation or concessions from other countries. Friday’s April inflation reading will likely be friendly. The Core PCE Price Index is the Federal Reserve’s favorite measure of inflation and should moderate to 2.5% year-over-year from the 2.6% pace in March. The last Magnificent 7 stock to report earnings is Nvidia (NVDA) on Wednesday after the close. As the leader in artificial intelligence chips, its results and forecasts will be closely watched to judge the health of technology spending. The rise in U.S. Treasury yields does not point to a U.S.-specific problem; instead, it is a function of the lower probability of an economic downturn and perhaps a shift in the global appetite for government bonds. Yields are not high enough yet to significantly negatively impact stock valuation since the higher yields are accompanied by less risk of an earnings decline from a recession. Like many other countries, the current fiscal trajectory in the U.S. is unsustainable, but the recent tax bill wouldn’t worsen things. Investors can be forgiven for wishing it improved the path, but the Senate will have their say next, and bond market participants will be watching closely. Government bond investors are demanding higher yields from most countries, so there might be a shift in the willingness of markets to fund large deficits, but it is too early to know for sure.

Title: ELV FRAUD: Suffer Losses on Elevance Health, Inc.? You may have been Affected by Fraud and are Urged to Contact BFA Law (NYSE:ELV)

May 25, 2025 07:42 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, May 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: VanEck Exec Slams SEC For Delay On Bitcoin ETF Options – Details
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/vaneck-slams-sec-for-delay-on-bitcoin-etf-options/
Time Published: 2025-05-25T10:00:45Z
Full Content:
Matthew Sigel, the head of digital assets research at VanEck, has criticized the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over a delayed response on a proposal to list options trading on the firm’s Bitcoin Spot ETF. Notably, the Commission has continued to issue delayed responses to all recent digital asset-related ETF proposals/amendments despite a crypto-friendly policy of the Donald Trump Administration. On April 3, 2025, the Chicago Board of Exchange (Cboe) filed a proposed rule change to list options trading on the VanEck Bitcoin ETF (HODL). For context, options trading grants investors the right to buy and sell an asset at a specific price before a certain date. Following the resounding success of the US Bitcoin Spot ETFs, options trading became a potential mode of market expansion, with several asset managers submitting applications to offer options to their respective ETFs. Notably, the SEC has granted approval for this request for multiple Bitcoin ETFs, including the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC), and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), among others. However, following the initial 45-day review, the Commission has delayed a response on Cboe’s proposal to list trading options on the VanEck Bitcoin ETF (HODL). In an X post on May 23, Matthew Sigel strongly criticized this decision, which he described as “frustrating” and offered no transparency to investors. While tagging Hester Pierce, the Head of the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, Sigel complained that the Commission had issued a delayed response while offering no comments or feedback along with this decision. The VanEck Exec explained the asset manager’s objection to this development while responding to a user comment. He said. This was the first decision date, so it has not been rejected, just delayed, even though the SEC’s initial comments were addressed. It’s the lack of any feedback that is particularly irksome… It is highly worth noting that delayed responses by the SEC have been quite a common response for digital assets ETF-related proposals. The Commission can choose to wait till the final decision deadline, i.e., 240 days after the application, as seen with the Bitcoin Spot ETFs in 2024. However, Sigel’s concerns stem from an absence of an explanation on this delayed ruling, especially considering that options trading has been approved for certain other Bitcoin Spot ETFs. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $108,349, reflecting gains of 5.23% and 17.71% in the past seven and 30 days, respectively. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Walmart layoffs: Who is Suresh Kumar, Indian-origin CTO called out by social media users amid recent job cuts?

Suresh Kumar, the Indian origin chief technology officer of Walmart in California, has hit the headlines amid reports of the retail giant cutting 1,500 tech jobs. Walmart is cutting jobs at its headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, along with its global technology team. In a memo reviewed by Bloomberg, Walmart CTO Suresh Kumar and US CEO John Furner indicated that the decision to reduce the workforce by nearly 1,500 employees is intended to speed up decision-making and lessen complexities. After reports on layoffs emerged, several social media users blamed CTO Suresh Kumar for the recent layoffs. Suresh Kumar is the executive vice president, global chief technology officer (CTO), and chief development officer (CDO) of Walmart. With more than three decades of experience in the tech industry, he has worked with Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. Suresh Kumar currently lives in Sunnyvale, California. Speaking to the Times of India earlier, Kumar shared that he was born in Basavanagudi, Bengaluru and spent his childhood there. Kumar pursued his Bachelor of Technology (BTech) degree in Aerospace, Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras. He secured a PhD in control systems from Princeton University. The Walmart CTO recently shared his experience of studying at IIT. In a post on LinkedIn, he wrote, “I completed my undergrad time in the late ‘80s, and one truth still stands out: learning never stops.” He also offered guidance for recent graduates, encouraging them to stay curious, connect with inspiring individuals, and take pride in their work. Kumar's post read, “Stay curious. Don’t just master your role - learn how your work connects to the bigger picture. Curiosity is a career superpower. Seek out people who inspire you. Ask questions. Listen deeply. Mentorship can come from unexpected places—look for those who challenge your thinking.” He further added, “Take pride in your work. Excellence starts with the mindset you bring every day. The habits you build early on will shape your path.” Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

With the bond-market selloff spooking investors across the board, stocks finished last week in the red. The Dow, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 all fell. Disappointing retail data kept piling up, too, with Target’s earnings portraying a sharp drop in confidence among middle and high-income households, while Home Depot and Lowe’s showed a slowdown in home renovations. New data released by the National Association of Realtors added to the drama, as existing-home sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 million in April — down 0.5% from March and 2.4% from a year ago. Now investors are set to return from Memorial Day barbecues to a shorter yet still jam-packed week. Here’s what to watch: U.S. markets will be closed in observance of Memorial Day. Tuesday kicks off the shortened trading week with a batch of earnings that should offer fresh data into how American consumers are faring — and feeling. BJ’s Wholesale Club (BJ) and Williams-Sonoma (WSM) both report before the bell. Analysts will be watching BJ’s for any signs of trading-down behavior or shrinking basket sizes, both windows into customers’ confidence levels. Okta (OKTA) also reports Tuesday, with analysts expecting positive earnings vs. a quarterly loss this time last year. Wednesday is the marquee day of the week, with heavyweight earnings from Nvidia (NVDA), the third-largest company in America by market cap, as well as Salesforce (CRM) and Veeva Systems (VEEV), plus the Federal Reserve’s meeting minutes. Nvidia’s report after the bell will surely be the most closely watched: The chipmaker has become a virtual stand-in for the AI wave and global chip war, and analysts are predicting as much as a 7% move in the price. Also after market close, Salesforce will offer updates on enterprise software spending amid growing economic uncertainty. Veeva will shed light on cloud-based trends in pharma and biotech. Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS) is also set to report. The biggest macro flashpoint comes at 2:00 p.m. ET, when the Federal Reserve releases minutes from its May 6-7 meeting. No surprises are expected, but with investors speculating whether rate cuts might come in the second half of 2025, you can expect articles analyzing the log for any insight into inflation, the labor market, or internal dissent. Costco (COST), Dell, Zscaler (ZS), and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) all report Thursday. Investors will be watching Costco for traffic trends, membership retention, and its food versus discretionary sales mix, especially given Walmart’s (WMT) recent gains in grocery. Ulta Beauty’s report will portray the health of mascara and shampoo spending — areas that often remain surprisingly strong even when consumers pull back in other categories. Gotta keep those highlights looking fresh, no matter the macro outlook. Dell Technologies (DELL) and Zscaler round out the day’s marquee tech names. Dell’s outlook will be read for enterprise PC refresh cycles and demand for AI-capable hardware, while Zscaler’s earnings will offer a look at corporate cybersecurity priorities in an atmosphere of belt-tightening. With no major economic releases or U.S.-listed heavyweights reporting, Friday may make for a quieter session — a nice little reprieve after the flurry of earnings and macro headlines. Only Up Fintech (TIGR), a large China-based brokerage firm, is scheduled to report. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: ‘Menstrual health affects everything - our work, our relationships, our mental health. Yet it’s still whispered about’

Hazel Wallace is just home after a celebratory brunch in London, a warm and glittering event to mark the publication of her fourth book, Not Just a Period. She has shared glimpses of the picturesque gathering on her Instagram feed, the pictures nestled alongside her signature posts: beautifully plated blueberry oats recipes for the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, yoga flows for cramps, and finish-line shots from the London and Paris marathons. Her grid is a blend of evidence-based wellness and digital elegance – but behind the polish is a deeper mission. The 34-year-old is originally from Blackrock, Co Louth, but now lives in London where she has become one of the UK‘s most prominent voices in women’s health, a medical doctor, registered associate nutritionist, personal trainer and bestselling author. But she wasn’t always on this path. In fact, her early career was shaped not by ambition, but by loss. “When I was 14, I lost my dad to a stroke,” she says. “It was really shocking. He had a mini-stroke while we were having dinner. He was in hospital for a few days, and then he passed. It was the first time someone in my family had been seriously unwell, and it changed everything.” The grief, she says, didn’t arrive all at once. “I didn’t fully understand it at the time. I missed a lot of school. I became socially withdrawn. I didn’t take care of myself.” In the aftermath, her interest in medicine grew – slowly at first. “His death was partly preventable, and I think that stuck with me. I became really focused on health in a broader sense – nutrition, stress, movement – things we hardly touched on in medical school.” Wallace didn’t get the points she needed to study medicine in Ireland, but she was determined to pursue her passion so she headed to Wales to do medical sciences, followed by medicine at Cardiff Medical School. In 2012, as a first-year med student, she started a blog called The Food Medic. “Honestly, I started it for myself,” she says. “I wanted to learn more about nutrition, about how lifestyle affects health. It was a way of figuring it out in public.” The blog and her Instagram following rapidly grew as she moved to London in 2016. Her ascent coincided with the rising popularity of wellness influencers, some of whom spread dangerous misinformation. Wallace‘s platform stood out because it was grounded in science. “There was this moment when people started demanding more credible advice,” she says. “And I was one of the first few with both a medical and nutrition background.” A post shared by Dr Hazel Wallace BSc MSc MBBCh (@drhazelwallace) The blog blossomed into several books, media appearances and, now, an online community of more than 1.1 million followers. But that success came at a cost. “For a long time, I had an unhealthy relationship with productivity,” she admits. “I tied my self-worth to academic success and professional output. I think I was also using it as a distraction – if I was busy, I didn’t have to stop and feel.” The pandemic, she says, made the limits of that model painfully clear. “By the second year of Covid, I was working in one of the only long-Covid clinics in the [UK]. There were just four of us. On weekends, I was covering intensive care shifts. I was exhausted and completely burnt out.” She took a step back from work, intending it to be temporary. “But I didn’t go back. It was hard to let go of that identity – I always thought of myself as a doctor in scrubs. But I wasn’t well. And I knew I couldn’t keep going like that.” This shift had come after a health crisis had already given Wallace a reason to slow down. In 2016, she began experiencing symptoms that didn’t quite add up. After two years of pushing for tests and consultations, she was finally diagnosed with PCOS – polycystic ovary syndrome, a hormone condition affecting one in 10 women which can lead to irregular or absent periods, difficulty conceiving, acne, anxiety, weight gain and excess hair. “I was already a qualified doctor, and it still took years and a lot of self-advocacy to get a diagnosis,” she says. “Even then, the advice was basically, ‘Come back when you want to get pregnant.’ That was it.” The experience left her feeling adrift. “I still felt in the dark about what to do. And if I felt that way with a medical background, how must everyone else be feeling?” [ Polycystic ovarian syndrome: ‘There’s more information on outer space than there is on the reproductive system of a female’Opens in new window ] This experience was part of what drove her to write her third book, The Female Factor, which explored how the male body has always been the default body in clinical medicine and research, leaving so much of women’s health unexplored, unacknowledged and unsupported. The Female Factor aimed to be a comprehensive guide to women’s health and included facts and tips on hormones, nutrition, mood, sleep and recipes. Her PCOS diagnosis had also prompted Wallace to think about fertility. She wanted children, but didn’t feel ready for them yet, and decided in 2023 to freeze her eggs – an experience she eventually shared with her followers. “I documented the process but waited until I was through it to decide whether or not to post. Even with all my training, it was intense – emotionally and physically. The daily injections, the hormone swings. It caught me off guard.” What struck her most was how little practical information there was. “It made me realise just how many gaps exist – not just in care, but in what women know about their own bodies. That’s what compelled me to share my experience. I knew if I was surprised by the process, others would be too.” During the pandemic, Wallace had noticed a disturbing trend whereby some women were attributing a disruption in their menstrual cycle – most likely caused by the stress of the pandemic – to the Covid vaccine, reinforcing anti-vax conspiracy theories. Without basic information about how periods can be affected by stress, misinformation and fearmongering grew. “People were convinced the vaccine was disrupting their periods, but the research showed it was temporary and likely stress-related,” she explains. “It really highlighted how little we understand about menstruation – even among people who menstruate.” We‘re taught to ignore hunger, to keep ourselves small. But your metabolic rate increases before your period - that’s why you’re hungrier. That’s not weakness. That’s biology That gap in understanding was one of the catalysts for Not Just a Period, which aims to be a comprehensive, empowering guide to the menstrual cycle. She‘s particularly critical of the way women’s pain and mood are pathologised. The book highlights that women are statistically twice as likely to experience depression, especially around hormonal shifts like puberty, the premenstrual phase, post-partum and menopause – but instead of receiving support, women are dismissed, patronised and laughed at. “Instead of support, we‘re often dismissed. We‘re told we‘re being ‘moody’ or ‘emotional‘. But those mood changes often have physiological roots – and they deserve proper care.” She points to PMDD – premenstrual dysphoric disorder – as a prime example. “People with PMDD can lose years of their life to disability. But they’re frequently misdiagnosed or not taken seriously. It’s not just frustrating – it’s harmful.” In the book Wallace highlights the medical gaslighting that women often experience, and the shame that prevents women from taking paid sick leave off for periods of PMDD, instead suffering in silence and losing money to a health issue that should be treated as such. Wallace‘s book doesn’t shy away from these hard truths. But it also offers practical tools – how to work with your cycle instead of against it, how to recognise shifts in mood or energy, how to support your body nutritionally through each phase. She also encourages cycle tracking, which she sees as a vital tool for body literacy. “It’s not just for fertility,” she says. “It’s about understanding yourself. Noticing patterns. Feeling more in control.” Still, she recognises the complexities around menstrual data and privacy. When I ask about how some American women have stopped using tracking apps due to political changes in reproductive rights, she‘s sympathetic. “I completely understand that concern. In the UK, we’re not facing the same kind of threats, but it’s a reminder that we need to be informed about where our data goes. Transparency matters.” [ What is causing girls to get their period at an earlier age?Opens in new window ] Another key theme in the book is how diet culture intersects with menstruation, noting that many women see an increase in appetite around their period but don’t feel able to fuel themselves because we‘ve been taught to value thinness over our bodies’ needs. “We‘re taught to ignore hunger, to keep ourselves small. But your metabolic rate increases before your period – that’s why you’re hungrier. That’s not weakness. That’s biology.” Wallace sees the consequences of this first hand in her practice. “Women restrict, then binge. Then feel guilty. It’s a cycle that can be avoided if we just listened to our bodies more and judged them less.” Body image also takes a hit premenstrually, she notes. “Even if nothing physically changes, many women feel bigger, bloated, uncomfortable. The way we speak to ourselves becomes harsher. Understanding that it’s hormonal can really help shift the narrative.” Social media complicates the issue of body image further. Wallace recognises the tension between trying to educate women about body image, health difficulties and natural struggles on a platform known for perpetuating rigid beauty standards and toxic comparisons. A post shared by Dr Hazel Wallace BSc MSc MBBCh (@drhazelwallace) Wallace’s own social media matches a lot of the aesthetic standards that can make health education feel alienating to some: she is slim and attractive, her recipes are colourful and prettily presented, and even while training for marathons she manages to look pulled together while jogging and balancing a camera to capture her journey. She‘s aware of the danger of “the highlight reel” vision of life that Instagram can create, and is wary of pages that promote a certain body type rather than education about health and lifestyle choices. “Instagram has been incredible for sharing information, but it also promotes a narrow beauty standard. Even when posts are well intentioned, they often still centre bodies that meet narrow beauty standards,” she says. “I try hard not to put my body at the centre of my content. It’s about the message, not the mirror. It’s not about how I look. But a lot of health influencers still lead with abs, with before-and-after shots. It’s toxic – and it’s confusing. People assume that if they follow the advice, they’ll look like the person giving it. That’s not health – that’s marketing.” [ Endometriosis and me: I hope young women today know they should shout louder than I didOpens in new window ] Still, she admits the pressure to create content that reaches audiences can be exhausting. “There‘s this constant push to make content prettier, punchier, faster,” she says. “And educational content – especially about periods – is not favoured by the algorithm. You have to work extra hard to be seen.” Wallace’s marathon training videos and recipes for the luteal phase might look effortless, but she schedules shoots like shifts. “It’s my job,” she says. “But I’ve also had to protect myself.” She‘s developed rules: no scrolling before 8am or after 6pm. “Even I get caught in the comparison trap. I’d look at other creators and think, ‘I should be doing more.’ And that’s not sustainable.” As she looks ahead, Wallace is preparing for her wedding this autumn in Greece to online fitness coach and Too Hot To Handle star David Birtwistle. But for now, she‘s trying to slow down and give this book the space it deserves. “I’ve been guilty of rushing into the next thing. Not this time. I want Not Just a Period to land, to start conversations, to help people. Menstrual health affects everything – our ability to work, our relationships, our mental health. And yet it’s still whispered about,” she says. “I want Not Just a Period to change that.” Because to Wallace, the menstrual cycle isn’t just a health issue. It’s a lens through which we understand how the world treats women – and how women are taught to treat themselves. Not Just a Period is published by Bluebird, an imprint of Pan Macmillan. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Murder of Irish-American woman shocks wealthy Brussels suburb
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/2025/05/25/murder-of-irish-american-woman-shocks-wealthy-brussels-suburb/
Time Published: 2025-05-25T04:30:00Z

The killing initially looked like a burglary gone wrong. Carmel Delaney, an Irish-American woman in her early 60s, had been stabbed to death in her home, in a wealthy Brussels neighbourhood popular with diplomats and business executives. The suspected murder – and the details that would later emerge – have gripped the Belgian public for weeks. Ms Delaney was born in New York, but her mother was originally from Ballyclerihan, Co Tipperary and her father from Dublin, so growing up she spent many childhood summers back visiting Ireland. A mother of four adult children, with two young grandchildren, Ms Delaney was someone who made friends easily. There were hiking and travel companions, and tennis and bridge playing partners, in Brussels and the many other cities she had lived in throughout her life. “She was so social,” an Irish relative of Ms Delaney said. Her husband, Chris Delaney, was a senior executive at US tyre giant Goodyear, overseeing its business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, from Brussels, where the couple had lived for the last seven years. At a little past 8pm on March 17th, St Patrick’s Day, Belgian police received an emergency call. Mr Delaney had opened the door of their apartment in the leafy Brussels suburb of Woluwe-Saint-Pierre, to find his wife dead inside the home. An autopsy later revealed she had been stabbed about four times in the neck and chest, with some type of sharp object. Police investigating the crime scene suspected a possible burglary gone wrong. “The victim’s husband had discovered her body in their home and found that three luxury watches had been stolen,” the Brussels public prosecutor said in a statement. However, there was no obvious signs of someone forcing their way into the apartment. Then three weeks later came an arrest. A female colleague of Mr Delaney was taken in for questioning. The next day she was charged with murder. In a statement, the prosecutor confirmed a suspect who worked with Mr Delaney had been charged with murder and possession of a weapon. One line of investigation Belgian police had pursued was the possibility Mr Delaney and his coworker were involved in a romantic relationship, according to reports in local media. The prosecutor said they could not disclose further details. Some early hearings in the criminal case took place in front of a French-speaking judge, but it has since been transferred to a Flemish judge. A lawyer representing the accused did not respond to requests for comment. In the upmarket suburb where the Delaney couple lived, the killing has shocked locals. “The whole area is one of the best in Brussels,” said a retired EU official who lives nearby. “You would compare it with Blackrock in Dublin.” “We say in French, it’s something that can happen anywhere in the world”, he said of Ms Delaney’s killing. The area is popular with wealthy diplomats and officials who work in the nearby European Union institutions. Luxembourg’s ambassador to the EU lives across the road from the Delaney’s home, and the embassy of Kosovo is only a few buildings down from their apartment block. A team of four gardeners from a private firm were tending to rows of well-kept hedges that run along both sides of the whole street on Thursday afternoon. It’s the sort of place you might expect to see a Porsche drive by – and, while The Irish Times was there, two did so within 20 minutes of each other. The owner of a small local business said she only learned of the tragedy when journalists from the Belgian media began to descend on the leafy street. Another woman on her way to work said Woluwe-Saint-Pierre was a very quiet area. “It’s not that kind of neighbourhood where you would expect ...” she said, before trailing off and stopping. Ms Delaney and her husband had been due to retire to the United States and return to New York, after careers that had seen them both work across the world. She grew up in Horseheads, a small village in upstate New York, before moving to Bardonia, which is closer to the city. Those who knew her said she had fond memories of summer trips back to Ireland as a child. Her parents had met on a blind date. Her mother, Maureen O’Dwyer, was the second eldest of 11 siblings, in a family that had a farm and stables in Ballyclerihan, keeping and breeding racehorses. Her father, Jim Gallagher, was from Dublin. After graduating from Cornell University in 1985, Ms Delaney got a job with consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble (P&G), where she worked for 15 years, across the US, Saudi Arabia, Poland and Ukraine. It was in P&G that she met Mr Delaney. The couple later moved to Sydney, Australia, where they lived for several years. Around that time Ms Delaney set up her own company, International Education Resources, which provided assistance to international students applying to study in the US. They had a holiday home in the Catskills, a mountainous part of New York state, where they spent summers hiking and winters skiing. “They were a force,” one person who knew the couple said. Then in 2017 the pair moved to Brussels, as Mr Delaney was promoted to run Goodyear tyre and rubber company’s Europe, Middle East and Africa office. The company has spent recent weeks firefighting the fallout of media coverage of Ms Delaney’s killing, which often prominently mentions Goodyear. It is understood a team of “crisis communications” consultants have been drafted in to help the firm. Mr Delaney is no longer employed by the US company and has since retired. During her time in the Belgian capital Ms Delaney became heavily involved in a women’s social club, organising hikes and running its website. There she was known for her “unwavering positivity”, the Brussels Women’s Club committee said in a message of condolence posted online after her death. “Her life motto, ‘bloom where you are planted,’ embodied her ability to adapt, grow and thrive wherever life took her,” the group wrote. She made an effort to travel to Ireland at least once a year most of her adult life, one of her Irish relatives said. “Carmel was a wonderful girl ... We loved her”.

Title: Altcoins Lag As Bitcoin Price Breaks $111,000: Why This Bull Market Is Different From 2021

Time Published: 2025-05-25T00:30:04Z

Crypto firm Matrixport has delivered insights into why this bull market is different from the 2021 bull run. Their analysis sheds more light on why altcoins are lagging despite the Bitcoin price rally to a new all-time high (ATH) at $111,900. In an X post, Matrixport stated that many traders are missing out on the current Bitcoin price rally as traditional retail engagement indicators remain low despite the rally to a new ATH. The firm explained that this rally is happening thanks to institutional investors, with retail investors on the sidelines in this bull market. Matrixport noted that this explains why funding rates remain subdued, retail activity is low, and many altcoins continue to lag as the Bitcoin price rallies in this bull market. The firm also revealed that retail traders make the fundamental mistake of not anticipating market corrections, leading to them occasionally closing their positions during sharp drawdowns. This bull market also differs from 2021 in that retail’s share of Bitcoin ownership is no longer expanding. Crypto whales have stepped in and are absorbing most of the flagship crypto’s supply, kicking retail investors to the curb. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas once noted that this could explain why the Bitcoin price has held up well during major corrections. According to Matrixport, understanding how corporate demand influences the Bitcoin price behavior and how long this trend is likely to last is critical as the shift in this bull market progresses. Meanwhile, the absence of retail traders in this cycle explains why funding rates and trading volumes are relatively low, with altcoins lagging. The firm noted that market participants are witnessing a quiet transfer of Bitcoin from early adopters and investors, miners, and exchanges to corporations like Strategy and institutional investors like BlackRock. Matrixport again asserted that the current Bitcoin price rally is driven by spot market accumulation and not derivatives activity, which could explain why altcoins are lagging behind BTC. In an X post, crypto analyst Kevin Capital stated that the next important step is for the Bitcoin price to record a weekly close above $106,800 and then follow through or consolidate next week. He remarked that BTC is really the only thing that matters and urged market participants to take their eyes off altcoins. If the Bitcoin price fails to accomplish that goal, the analyst stated that market participants can then turn their attention to the reverse psychology 2021 fractals. It is worth mentioning that the analyst once predicted that altcoins led by Dogecoin will still have their run once BTC’s dominance cools off in the summer.

Title: Ex-Apple Engineers Behind $200M Xnor Deal Launch ElastixAI, Secure $16M To Revolutionize AI Inference Across Devices

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Seattle-based ElastixAI, founded just months ago by veteran engineers behind Apple's AAPL $200 million acquisition of Xnor, has raised $16 million from top-tier investors, including Bellevue-based capital venture company FUSE. The stealth-mode startup with elite Apple pedigree is quietly tackling one of the most expensive pain points in artificial intelligence deployment: inference, GeekWire reports. Don't Miss: Mode Mobile developed a smartphone called EarnPhone, which allows users to earn and save money by playing video games, listening to music and reading the news. With the phone priced at an affordable $99, the barriers to adoption are low. Earning Opportunity for All Smartphone Users Mode EarnPhone State-of-the-art smartphone device includes built-in earning features. EarnOS Proprietary earning software turns smartphones into EarnPhones. The founding team behind ElastixAI is no stranger to cutting-edge AI. According to GeekWire, CEO Mohammad Rastegari was co-founder and chief technology officer of Xnor, which was acquired by Apple in 2020 for its groundbreaking edge-based AI tools. He spent four years at Apple following the acquisition and most recently served as a distinguished scientist at Meta META. Rastegari is also an affiliate assistant professor at the University of Washington and spent five years at the Allen Institute for AI, co-founded by the late Microsoft MSFT visionary Paul Allen, GeekWire says. Chief technology officer Saman Naderiparizi, who led hardware engineering at Xnor, was also a senior engineering manager at Apple. He's joined by third co-founder Mahyar Najibi, a former Apple engineer who also spent time at Waymo, Google's self-driving car project, GeekWire reports. Trending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — this is your last chance to become an investor for $0.80 per share. While training AI models gets most of the headlines, inference is where the real-world costs pile up. According to TechTarget, every time a chatbot generates or replies to a question, a recommendation system suggests a new item or a smart device reacts to a real-world prompt, the model is performing inference. These post-deployment processes happen at scale and in real time, often thousands or millions of times a day. That volume drives up compute costs, latency concerns, and energy consumption. GeekWire says that ElastixAI is focused on flexibility and configurability, giving enterprises and hyperscalers the ability to tune their inference infrastructure to specific needs. Whether running on edge devices or large cloud environments, the company's software-centric platform is designed to reduce both compute load and operational cost. “We saw a gap when it comes to delivering AI inference at scale and at low cost,” Rastegari told GeekWire. The startup remains in stealth, but its positioning puts it in conversation with major players like Nvidia NVDA, Coreweave CRWV, and inference-focused startups such as Fireworks.ai and Together.ai, GeekWire says. See Also: Be part of the next med-tech breakthrough for only $350 — 500+ surgeries already done with nView's AI system. The $16 million round includes participation from Catapult, Tyche Partners, Liquid 2 Ventures, and DNX Ventures, according to GeekWire. Cameron Borumand, general partner at FUSE, told GeekWire the firm was "thrilled to back the elite technical founders at Elastix to solve the hardest problems around scaling compute and infrastructure in the fast-growing AI inference market." The company is also well-placed within Seattle's booming AI scene. With Apple's growing presence in the region and continued investment in foundational technologies, ElastixAI has access to both talent and infrastructure, according to GeekWire. As AI demand continues to surge, inference platforms are becoming critical infrastructure. ElastixAI's unique combination of flexibility, leadership, and investor confidence may position it as one of the most closely watched stealth startups of the future.

For Ethereum’s proponents, drawing comparisons has been useful—but even then, the analogy is far from perfect. When Vivek Raman introduced Etheralize in January, the former banker and business development firm’s co-founder formalized efforts to onboard Wall Street. Part of that initiative, he recently told Decrypt, has involved “evangelization and education and marketing.” “I always call it digital oil,” Raman said. “We think that as the crypto ecosystem evolves, people not only will want to—but will have to—hold this asset in reserves.” Bitcoin’s proponents often portray the asset as a form of digital gold because of pre-programmed scarcity, with a maximum supply of 21 million. ETH, whether it’s being consumed to send transactions or power smart contracts, fuels Ethereum’s network. The analogy, in that sense, is among the most palatable for today’s crypto newbies. As Raman and 19 others at Etheralize encourage financial institutions to build products on Ethereum, the ways in which the “digital oil” analogy falls short could illustrate challenges Ethereum’s community will face in cementing the network’s dominance on Wall Street, in capturing the asset’s qualities in a snappy, memorable way. “I think it is hard to come up with the right metaphor,” Grayscale Head of Research Zach Pandl told Decrypt. “It will be interesting to see whether investors begin to appreciate the scarcity of ETH, even if they're not yet kind of using the chain from a transactional standpoint.” One key difference: If demand for oil increases, then more is often pumped in response, and its supply is elastic. Ethereum, on the other hand, has a maximum issuance of 1.5% a year, meaning that its supply can only grow a certain amount over a period. On top of that, transaction fees on Ethereum are burned, which can offset that growth in supply. “Rather than having some sort of fixed cap of total supply, there's a fixed cap of issuance per year,” Etheralize co-founder Danny Ryan, a former Ethereum Foundation researcher, told Decrypt. “There's very much predictability.” Another major difference between Ethereum and oil is that the latter commodity does not offer yield. Staked Ethereum, which is devoted to the network for the ability to help process transactions, currently has an estimated yield of 3% annually, according to a dashboard published on the crypto analytics platform Dune. Within the coming years, financial institutions are expected to grow more comfortable with the practice of tokenization, in which real-world assets, such as stocks and bonds, are represented on-chain. Regulatory shifts under U.S. President Donald Trump could be a key driver. Some firms, such as crypto exchange Kraken, are tapping Ethereum competitors like Solana for such offerings. However, several funds have been tokenized on Ethereum by staid financial firms, including BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. As more assets come on-chain, one aspect of Ethereum’s “digital oil” analogy could become more valid. Much like oil is a neutral asset connecting myriad industries to each other, Ethereum could be seen as a non-sovereign asset for the modern financial system, Raman argued. “In this ecosystem where the world's assets are all tokenized by different counterparties, [...] the only neutral asset that's global, that connects all of these, is ETH,” he said. “It becomes more and more important as a global trading pair, as a strategic asset to hold if you want to stay in neutrality between all of these different tokenized assets.” Edited by James Rubin Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Billionaire Bill Ackman’s hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital, has reportedly exited a position that previously accounted for 8.7% of the firm’s holdings. Pershing Square has sold $1.039 billion worth of shares in the railway company Canadian Pacific (CP.TO), reports Reuters. Ackman says he sold the Canadian Pacific position “with regret,” after rebuying the stock in 2022. He also says he has a “a very strong belief in the long-term future of the business.” But Ackman made the portfolio change to free up cash to pour into online retail giant Amazon (AMZN). Says Ryan Israel, Pershing Square’s chief investment officer, in an investor conference call, “We felt that the company would be able to work through any slowdown in the cloud computing division Amazon Web Services and we did not judge that tariffs would have a material impact on the earnings in the retail business.” Ackman and his team say Amazon CEO Andrew Jassy has the business acumen to put the retail giant in a position to witness “more profit margin expansion at a high rate of revenue growth.” Pershing Square also gobbled up shares in car rental company Hertz (HTZ.O) and transport giant Uber (UBER.N). AMZN stock closed Friday’s trading session at $200.99, down more than 1% on the day.

Title: 5 Top Cryptocurrency Trends Shaping The Second Half Of 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/article/top-cryptocurreny-trends-second-half-2025/

ByBecca Bratcher ByBecca Bratcher, Contributor. The crypto landscape is becoming more dynamic and accessible. Crypto is in for another wild ride in the second half of 2025. From DeFi projects and stablecoin acceleration to the growing overlap of AI and crypto, there is a lot to watch. This article breaks down the biggest trends set to shape the space and how these developments could transform digital assets. The crypto landscape has transformed dramatically in 2025, driven by regulatory developments, technological advancements, and shifting market dynamics. Donald Trump’s return to office has brought a pro-crypto agenda to the forefront, with the U.S. government establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and signaling plans for clear, industry-friendly regulations. This shift has sparked renewed interest in digital assets, with institutional investors re-entering the market and major financial players expanding their crypto services. Looking ahead, 2025 is about making crypto more useful and easier to understand. Innovations in stablecoins, decentralized finance and tokenization give investors new ways to use digital assets. These changes could make payments faster, give more people access to investment opportunities and simplify transactions. It all points to crypto becoming a bigger part of everyday finance. As digital assets continue to mature, several key trends are gaining momentum. Stablecoins are becoming more mainstream, while new AI-powered crypto applications are pushing the boundaries of automation and data analysis. DeFi is diversifying with more sophisticated protocols, and bitcoin secondary investments, such as ETFs and derivatives, are drawing institutional interest. Meanwhile, tokenizing real-world assets is becoming a game-changer, bringing physical assets like real estate, commodities and fine art onto the blockchain. These developments could reshape how digital assets are used, traded and regulated. This section will explore each trend, offering insights into its potential impact and what it means for investors. Stablecoins have become a critical part of the crypto ecosystem, and their influence will only continue to grow in the second half of 2025. These digital currencies, which are pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar, offer the benefits of blockchain technology without the volatility of other cryptocurrencies. Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer, is leading the charge, preparing to launch a U.S.-based stablecoin while working closely with U.S. lawmakers to shape crypto regulations. The broader stablecoin market is also evolving. With the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency reaffirming that banks can engage in stablecoin activities and new players entering the space, competition is heating up. Stablecoins are no longer just a tool for crypto traders. They are becoming a bridge between traditional finance and the digital economy, offering instant settlement, reduced transaction costs and a stable gateway to the world of digital assets. The intersection of cryptocurrency and AI is quickly becoming a major trend in 2025, with decentralized AI networks gaining attention. One notable example is Bittensor, a blockchain-based platform that enables users to create, share and monetize AI tools without relying on centralized tech giants. Bittensor’s model is built around subnets, independent communities focusing on specific AI tasks. This approach allows developers to collaborate and compete while maintaining transparency. This system ensures that high-quality work is recognized, while underperformers are removed. For developers and investors, this creates a more merit-based and sustainable ecosystem. Other projects, like Ambient, are pushing even further by creating blockchain networks that integrate AI directly into their core operations. Ambient, backed by top venture firms like a16z and Delphi Digital, aims to be a decentralized competitor to centralized AI giants like OpenAI. As these crypto-AI hybrids grow, they promise a future where AI tools are open, decentralized and more secure, making this a trend worth watching for the rest of 2025. DeFi has long been one of the most dynamic sectors in the crypto industry, but 2025 is shaping up to be a turning point. For years, DeFi thrived in a largely unregulated space, offering users decentralized lending, borrowing and trading without traditional banks. However, this freedom led to fraud, exploitation and regulatory scrutiny. In 2025, the regulatory landscape for DeFi experienced a seismic shift. The Trump administration adopted a crypto-friendly stance, repealing the IRS's controversial DeFi broker rule and signaling a more supportive approach to digital assets. This decision has created a more favorable environment for DeFi in the U.S., allowing protocols to operate without being treated like traditional brokerages. Because of the newly implemented regulatory clarity, investor interest in DeFi is soaring. EY reported that the number of investors engaging with DeFi is expected to triple over the next two years, rising from 24% to 75%. This growth reflects the sector's appeal as a way to access financial services without traditional intermediaries. As 2025 continues, the real test for DeFi will be how it balances innovation with compliance, ensuring both user protection and continued growth. Secondary bitcoin investments are gaining momentum in 2025 as companies and institutional investors seek new ways to gain indirect exposure to bitcoin. These secondary investments include bitcoin exchange-traded funds, futures and even bitcoin-backed bonds. With regulatory clarity improving, these products offer a more accessible way for investors to tap into Bitcoin’s potential without dealing with self-custody complexities. The trend is fueled by growing interest from corporate treasurers who view bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Companies like Strategy, Block, and Semler Scientific have added bitcoin to their balance sheets, using it as a hedge against inflation and a tool for long-term value preservation. The Financial Accounting Standards Board also updated its guidelines in December 2023, allowing companies to report bitcoin using fair value accounting, making it easier to show bitcoin’s actual value on financial statements. The appeal of secondary bitcoin investments is clear. These products offer exposure to bitcoin’s price growth without the risks of direct ownership. Public companies have already purchased 3.3 times more bitcoin in 2025 than the total new supply mined this year, highlighting the demand. As more firms explore bitcoin as a strategic asset, the market for bitcoin secondary investments is expected to grow rapidly, providing new opportunities for both corporate and retail investors. Tokenization of real world assets (RWA) is already trending in 2025, transforming how traditional assets like real estate, commodities, stocks and bonds are managed and traded. By representing these assets as digital tokens on blockchain networks, tokenization eliminates the need for paperwork, reduces transaction costs and increases accessibility for investors. Assets that were once illiquid, like private real estate, can now be easily bought, sold or fractionally owned by a global audience. This trend is gaining momentum as major financial institutions like BlackRock, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan embrace RWA tokenization. Analysts at VanEck project that the RWA market could exceed $50 billion by the end of 2025, with potential growth to $10 trillion by 2030. As regulatory clarity improves and more investors seek efficient, blockchain-powered ways to access traditional assets, RWA tokenization is set to become a foundational part of the digital economy. Bottom Line The second half of 2025 is set to reshape the crypto industry with key trends like stablecoins, DeFi, secondary Bitcoin investments, AI-powered blockchain and RWA tokenization. As regulatory clarity improves and major players enter the space, these developments transform how digital assets are used, traded and integrated into the financial system. Investors should watch for growing institutional interest, expanding use cases, and evolving regulations that could drive market growth. Whether decentralized finance is adapting to new rules, bitcoin is gaining traction as a treasury asset or tokenized real-world assets are creating new investment opportunities, the crypto landscape is becoming more dynamic and accessible. The biggest trend in crypto for the second half of 2025 is the continued evolution of blockchain technology, with growing adoption in areas like decentralized finance (DeFi), stablecoins and the tokenization of traditional assets. Yes, AI is already impacting crypto trading by providing advanced data analysis, automated trading strategies and predictive market insights. As AI technology improves, it is expected to make trading faster, more accurate and accessible to a wider range of investors. Investors should watch for regulatory changes, the continued rise of RWA tokenization and the impact of AI on blockchain and crypto trading. Keeping an eye on institutional adoption and new Bitcoin investment products will also be crucial. Meme coins are still relevant, but their popularity has shifted toward niche communities and short-term speculation. Most meme coins lack real utility and often do not retain long-term value.

Title: TikTok enters its efficiency era
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-tiktok-new-efficiency-era-layoffs-cost-saving-measures-2025-5
Time Published: 2025-05-24T08:17:01Z
Full Content:
Belt-tightening is underway at TikTok. After spending big over the last two years to get its e-commerce business off the ground, TikTok is taking new steps to squeeze out a return. Since February, TikTok Shop has pushed out staffers based on performance, added stricter return-to-office rules, and had two rounds of layoffs, all while tacking on new measures to keep costs at bay, seven staffers told Business Insider. TikTok has also introduced cost-cutting measures to the broader company, including new budget caps for travel. On Wednesday, the company began its latest layoffs, targeting e-commerce operations staff and some employees who work with global brands. In emails this week to laid-off workers, the company said it was reducing complexity "to create a more efficient operating model for the team's long-term growth." TikTok's CEO Shou Chew hinted at a spending crackdown in the pursuit of efficiency in February. He told staff he wanted to review each of the company's teams and remove unnecessary layers, The Information reported. Chew's directive mirrors similar efforts by executives at Meta, Microsoft, and Google, which have recently stripped away employee perks, trimmed head count, and shifted performance standards in pursuit of cost savings. TikTok's cost cuts come at a tenuous moment for the company, which could face a US ban if it fails to reach an agreement with the Trump administration over a 2024 divestment law. The company has made broad changes to its US team in recent months, including consolidating control under Chinese leadership, employees previously told BI. And while TikTok videos are as popular as ever, the Shop business has failed to meet expectations. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. The workplace changes and broader uncertainty have weighed on some. "For the past six months, it's been very up and down as far as morale and people's sense of security at work," a laid off staffer said. In addition to cutting costs through layoffs, some teams have refocused performance goals this quarter around costs, profit, and revenue metrics like gross merchandise value, two staffers said. The company also plans to stop subsidizing free shipping for TikTok Shop sellers later this month after previous reductions. The move would bring TikTok's free shipping subsidies more in line with competitors like Amazon, but could irk some seller partners, one staffer said. There have been signs of broader cost cutting, too. Last week, TikTok told staffers across the company it was instituting a stricter approval process for work travel. The company is asking for more information about travel arrangements to better understand the impact on the budget, and setting spend limits for hotels and airfare. TikTok's e-commerce division was an easy target for cost cutting. The company spent hundreds of millions of dollars getting the business off the ground. The shopping platform is a big focus for owner ByteDance, which is trying to replicate the e-commerce success of its Chinese sister app, Douyin. ByteDance's leadership has been disappointed with the progress of its US business, which failed to hit many of its goals in 2024. US sales on the platform have taken a hit this year, due partly to global tariffs. Weekly US order volume on TikTok Shop dropped by around 20% in mid-May compared to mid-April after tariffs went into effect, for example, according to internal data viewed by BI. In an effort to turn things around, the company has shaken up its e-commerce leadership. The changes gave greater power to executives who have experience working on Douyin. After several layoff rounds, a string of performance-related cuts and team reorgs, and other unrelated worker attrition, the US TikTok Shop is looking trimmer. BI was unable to determine the extent of the recent cuts, but the impacted teams were consolidated, per a memo sent on Wednesday evening and viewed by BI. In the wake of organizational changes, the teams would "move faster, operate leaner, and be more efficient," e-commerce leader Mu Qing wrote. Have a tip?

Title: AI Investing in Canada: AI Stocks vs Tools
URL: https://milliondollarjourney.com/ai-investing-canada.htm
Time Published: 2025-05-24T02:01:22Z
Full Content:
Written by: Kyle Prevost Canadian investors are increasingly faced with two related trends: investing in AI stocks (buying shares of companies benefitting from artificial intelligence boom) versus using AI to invest (leveraging AI-driven tools to make investment decisions).Â Personally, Iâm instinctually suspicious of anything that gets this much press coverage and hype behind it. I should be clear – I use language learning models (LLMs) daily these days. I get how they can greatly improve productivity. Iâm just not sure I see quite the boom or world-changing use-case that real AI-bulls out there seem to be putting forward. But it probably doesnât surprise anyone that a fan of Canadian all in one ETFs and Canadian dividend stocks isnât a huge proponent of âthe latest thing.â Best 2025 Broker Promo Up to $150 Sign Up Bonus!

To be clear, when I talk about âInvesting in AIâ Iâm referring to buying into companies or sectors that stand to benefit from AIâs growth â for example, purchasing stock in a tech company developing AI products. Iâm not talking about small- and medium-sized businesses using cash flow to pay for AI capability that will increase their corporationâs efficiency. In other words, Iâm talking about individual portfolio investments, not corporate balance sheet investments. When I talk about âusing AI to investâ, Iâm referringÂ to employing artificial intelligence tools in your own investing process (such as AI-powered stock screeners).Â Investing in AI relies on traditional equity analysis (are these companies good investments, or overhyped?), whereas using AI tools involves trusting algorithms to augment or automate your decisions. A prudent investor should be cautious of hype in both cases. AI companiesâ stocks can soar on optimism long before profits materialize, and AI investing tools seem to be promising market-beating results that donât always pan out in reality. When it comes to investing in AI through equities, Canadian investors have a few domestic tech names with AI exposure. The companies below are among Canadaâs top tech stocks, each connected to AI in different ways. I also want to point out that it isnât only tech companies that benefit from AI efficiencies. It may turn out for example that railway stocks and utility stocks actually decrease their costs and improve productivity in a manner that leaves them as bigger winners than the market has currently priced in. Itâs difficult to project these things, but I wanted to emphasize that making use of artificial intelligence isnât solely reserved for a handful of tech companies (although they’re obviously the most direct beneficiaries). What it does: Shopify is an Ottawa-based e-commerce platform provider enabling merchants worldwide to set up online stores. Itâs one of Canadaâs largest tech companies, with a market capitalization around $140+ billion USD (approximately C$200 billion). AI connection: Shopify is not an âAI companyâ per se, but it has been integrating AI into its services to help merchants. For instance, Shopify recently launched Shopify Magic â an AI tool to automatically generate product descriptions and other copy â and Shopify Sidekick, an AI assistant to help merchants analyze business questions and perform tasks. These generative AI features (powered by large language models) aim to make life easier for online store owners, and could improve Shopifyâs value proposition to businesses. In short, Shopify is using AI to enhance its commerce platform (e.g. AI-written product content and AI-driven storefront tools) rather than selling AI software directly.Â Is AI growth priced in? Shopifyâs stock has already rebounded strongly, suggesting that investors are optimistic. In fact, Shopify shares have nearly doubled (up ~88% year-over-year) and the stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio around 70 on a trailing basis. Such a high P/E implies that significant growth (including AI-driven growth) may already be baked into the price. Investors are paying a premium for Shopify â its P/E was over 68 at the end of 2024, coming down from an even loftier level in 2023. This rich valuation means that if AI integrations donât materially boost Shopifyâs earnings in coming years, the stock could be vulnerable. Analyst sentiment on Shopify is positive but cautious â the consensus rating is a Moderate Buy, with the vast majority of analysts rating it âBuyâ or âOutperformâ (roughly 25 buys, 12 holds, 0 sells in one survey).Â Overall, Shopify is seen as a Canadian tech champion poised to benefit from AI adoption in e-commerce, but investors should be mindful that its valuation is high and assumes a lot of future success. What it does: Open Text is a long-established Canadian enterprise software company (headquartered in Waterloo) specializing in information management, content services, and business process tools. With a market cap near C$8 billion, Open Text is a major tech player in Canada. It sells software to large organizations for managing documents, data, and workflows â and increasingly, these offerings include AI features. AI connection: Open Text has been incorporating AI and machine learning into its products to help enterprise customers make sense of large amounts of unstructured data. The company recently launched OpenText Aviator, an AI platform that adds predictive analytics, AI-powered search, and generative AI capabilities across Open Textâs software suite. For example, OpenTextâs content management solutions now use AI-driven insights to automate workflows and improve decision-making. The firm is also applying AI in cybersecurity and other areas (through acquisitions and R&D).Â In short, Open Text is leveraging AI to enhance its existing software products (making it an âAI enhancerâ in its industry), rather than being a pure AI developer from scratch. Is AI growth priced in? Unlike some flashy AI startups, Open Textâs stock has modest expectations built in. The shares trade at a trailing P/E of about 11.5 (based on the last 12 months earnings), which is far lower than many AI-themed companies. In fact, its forward P/E is around 6â7, reflecting that earnings are expected to jump (likely due to recent acquisitions and cost efficiencies). This relatively low valuation suggests the market is not aggressively pricing in an AI revenue explosion for Open Text â if anything, investors are a bit skeptical or simply valuing it as a steady enterprise software business. The stock pays a dividend (yield ~3.7%), signaling a stable, mature company rather than a high-flying AI growth story. Analyst sentiment on Open Text is mixed to mildly positive.Â Overall, Open Text provides a cautionary contrast to AI hype â itâs using AI under the hood to make its products better, but its stock hasnât skyrocketed on AI news. This could mean potential value if those AI enhancements drive more sales, but also reflects that AI alone hasnât transformed Open Textâs growth narrative (at least as far as investors are concerned, so far). What it does: Kinaxis is an Ottawa-based software company focusing on supply chain planning and logistics solutions. Its flagship platform, RapidResponse (now evolving with Kinaxis Maestro), helps large companies manage their supply chain operations in real time. Kinaxis is smaller than the names above, with a market cap around C$5â6 billion but itâs one of Canadaâs tech success stories in a niche domain (supply chain management software). AI connection: Kinaxis has been âAI-infusingâ its supply chain platform to enhance forecasting and decision-making. The companyâs software uses machine learning and AI (branded as part of its AI-driven Maestro platform) to analyze supply chain data and generate insights for planners. For example, Kinaxis offers Demand.AI for demand forecasting and uses AI/advanced analytics to optimize inventory and production schedules. In practical terms, this means Kinaxisâs tools can automatically detect anomalies, predict shortages or gluts, and recommend actions â a clear value-add for complex global supply chains. The use of AI is a selling point that helps Kinaxis remain competitive against larger global software firms.Â Is AI growth priced in? Kinaxisâs stock carries a very high valuation, implying that investors have lofty growth expectations (which likely include its AI capabilities). The stockâs trailing P/E is extremely elevated (over 400) due to very small current earnings. Essentially, Kinaxis has been reinvesting for growth and its GAAP net income is minimal, so the P/E looks sky-high. Even on a forward basis, the P/E is around 40+. This suggests the market has already priced in robust growth (double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion) for years ahead. In 2024â25 the stock has performed well â itâs hovering near 52-week highs around $190â$200/share. Analyst sentiment leans positive: the consensus rating is between Buy and Hold. Kinaxisâs AI story (smarter supply chain automation) is compelling, but a lot of that story is already reflected in the stock price. Future stock gains will depend on the company delivering strong results to justify the premium What it does: Constellation Software is a Toronto-based tech conglomerate known for acquiring and holding dozens of smaller vertical market software businesses. Under CEO Mark Leonard, Constellation has for years been a serial acquirer of software companies in niche industries (from healthcare to finance to public transit systems software). This decentralized, buy-and-hold approach has turned Constellation into one of Canadaâs most valuable companies â its market capitalization is over C$100 billion (around US$75â80 billion). The companyâs share price has skyrocketed over the past decade as it continues to leverage its compounding acquisition model. AI connection: Unlike the others above, Constellation isnât focused on a single product or technology, and it doesnât market itself as an âAI company.â However, many of the software businesses it owns are likely implementing AI in their products on a case-by-case basis. Constellationâs model is to let its subsidiaries operate autonomously â so if AI can improve those niche software offerings (by adding new features like predictive analytics, or automating tasks for clients), Constellation will benefit indirectly through better performance of its businesses. Thereâs also a strategic angle: AI could lower the cost of developing software or open new markets, which might create more acquisition opportunities for Constellation. In short, Constellation is an AI beneficiary by osmosis â itâs not selling AI platforms itself, but its vast portfolio of software companies can adopt AI advances to enhance their mission-critical products. This should, over time, boost the value of Constellationâs holdings. (Notably, Constellation hasnât seen an âAI hypeâ spike like Nvidia or Microsoft; its trajectory has been steady compounding.) Is AI growth priced in? Constellation Softwareâs stock trades at a premium valuation, but that has been more due to its reliable acquisition-driven growth than any AI excitement. Its trailing P/E is in the 100+ range , which is very high â though part of that is due to accounting (the companyâs earnings are dampened by amortization of acquisition intangibles). On an operational basis, the valuation is somewhat lower (an operating P/E around 45), but still rich. This reflects investorsâ trust in Constellationâs model and management, and perhaps a scarcity premium for a company that has delivered 30% annualized returns historically. Importantly, AI is not the main driver of Constellationâs valuation today â the stock isnât up 50% overnight on AI news. This relatively measured market reaction means that investors arenât assuming dramatic AI-fueled growth for Constellation in the near term. If anything, AI is a subtle tailwind: over time AI could make Constellationâs businesses more efficient or expand their markets, but the stockâs price is still grounded in the firmâs disciplined acquisition strategy Beyond the Canadian stock market, many global tech leaders in AI are accessible to Canadian investors through U.S. markets. All of our picks for best online brokerages easily allow Canadians to purchase stocks on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and/or NASDAQ. Here are three prominent examples of AI-related stocks that, while not based in Canada, can be bought by Canadians in their portfolios: Nvidia has become synonymous with the AI boom, thanks to its graphics processing units (GPUs) that serve as the workhorses for AI computations. Nvidiaâs chips are used to train and run neural networks (including the large models behind tools like ChatGPT), making the company a critical âpicks-and-shovelâ provider in the AI industry. AI connection: Virtually every major AI application today relies on Nvidiaâs hardware. The explosion of demand for AI-capable cloud computing (from data centers training machine learning models) has led to a surge in orders for Nvidiaâs high-end GPUs. In response, Nvidia has pivoted heavily to data-center and AI-focused products (like the A100 and H100 GPU units), and it also provides AI software frameworks (CUDA libraries, etc.) to support developers. This positioning made Nvidia one of the biggest winners of the generative AI trend. Nvidiaâs stock has skyrocketed on AI hype and growth. The companyâs market capitalization blew past US$1 trillion in 2023 and kept climbing â as of mid-2025, Nvidia is worth roughly $3.3 trillion USD (making it one of the most valuable companies in the world). The stock price increase has been accompanied by surging financials: Nvidiaâs revenue more than doubled year-over-year, and earnings jumped correspondingly Despite that, the valuation remains very high. Nvidia trades around 55 times trailing earnings and about 30+ times forward earnings. In other words, even considering the huge profit growth expected, investors are still paying a premium for Nvidiaâs future. This implies a lot of optimism that the AI demand will continue unabated (and so far, Nvidia has delivered). Should Canadians buy Nvidia? If you believe in the long-term AI infrastructure story, Nvidia is a core holding â but be cautious of the price youâre paying. The market may have already priced in years of AI growth. Any slowdown in AI uptake or new competition (e.g., improved chips from AMD, or AI-specific chips from Google/others, or even software that makes cutting-edge AI chips irrelevant – like Chinaâs Deepseek) could hit Nvidiaâs stock hard simply because expectations are sky-high. Analysts currently remain bullish (given Nvidiaâs dominance and lack of real competition at the very high end), but even bullish analysts often acknowledge the stock isnât cheap. Microsoft might not seem like an âAI stockâ at first glance. Itâs a diversified tech giant known for Windows, Office, and Azure cloud services. Moreover, for many of us over 35, Microsoft might always be associated with boring spreadsheets and bad browsers! However, Microsoft has emerged as a key player in AI, largely due to its partnership with (and heavy investment in) OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. Microsoft is integrating AI across its product range and using its massive distribution to bring AI to the masses. Microsoft invested billions (over $10 billion) into OpenAI and is the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAIâs services. In return, Microsoft has integrated OpenAIâs GPT models into products like Bing (for search with the AI-powered Bing Chat), Microsoft 365 Copilot (an AI assistant across Word, Excel, Outlook, etc.), GitHub Copilot (coding assistant), and Azureâs AI cloud offerings. Essentially, Microsoft is weaving generative AI and machine learning into its software and cloud platform at an impressive scale. This gives it a potential competitive edge (e.g., making Office 365 more indispensable with AI features, or attracting cloud customers who want ready-made AI solutions on Azure).Â Microsoftâs Azure AI services also compete with Google and Amazon in providing AI infrastructure and APIs to enterprises. Market reaction: Microsoftâs stock has performed strongly in the past couple of years, buoyed by overall cloud growth and excitement around AI. In 2023, MSFT hit all-time highs as the market cheered its AI initiatives (with some dubbing it a new AI âarms dealerâ and âplatformâ stock). Microsoftâs market cap is roughly $3.3-3.4 trillion USD, meaning that it is competing with Nvidia (and a couple others) for the title of most valuable company in the world. Despite this massive size, the stockâs valuation is relatively moderate compared to pure AI plays: Microsoft trades at around 35Ã earnings (trailing P/E in the mid-30s). This is a premium to the broader market (the S&P 500âs P/E is about 18), but itâs nowhere near the multiple of other AI stocks. It reflects that Microsoft has a very profitable core business already, and AI is viewed as a major growth driver – but within an established company. Bottom line for investors: Microsoft offers a way to benefit from AI trends (like generative AI adoption) with a lot less volatility than many pure-play AI names. Its business is diverse and extremely cash-generative, which provides a cushion if certain AI bets take longer to pay off. Taiwan Semi (NYSE: TSM) is by far the worldâs largest and most advanced contract semiconductor manufacturer. They build the chips that other companies design. Whenever you hear about cutting-edge AI chips (like Nvidiaâs GPUs or Appleâs processors), chances are theyâre made by TSMC. This makes TSMC a critical part of the AI supply chain, albeit one step removed from the flashy software applications. AI connection: TSMC is the foundry that produces integrated circuits for clients like Nvidia, AMD, Apple, and many others. In the context of AI, TSMC manufactures high-performance chips needed for AI computing â including Nvidiaâs AI accelerators and specialized AI chips for various companies. The surge in AI hardware demand ultimately means more business for TSMC (since Nvidiaâs record-breaking orders translate into higher volume at TSMCâs fabs). TSMCâs technological leadership (especially its ability to reliably produce chips at 5nm, 3nm, and soon 2nm process nodes) is essential for the power and efficiency of AI processors. In sum, TSMC is an enabler of AI innovation behind the scenes. Without it, the AI boom would hit a manufacturing bottleneck.Â Compared to Nvidia or Microsoft, TSMCâs stock has been more tempered. Itâs another very large company â its market cap is roughly US$850 billion (around C$1.1 trillion). TSMC trades at about 22-25Ã earnings (trailing P/E in the low-to-mid 20s), which is close to its historical average. Part of the reason is that TSMCâs growth, while solid, is limited by the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. In years of high demand (like during the pandemic and the current AI boom) it does fantastically, but it also faces cyclical downturns (PC/phone chip slowdowns, etc.). Perhaps most importantly, TSMC has geopolitical risks that are unique amongst AI stocks. As a Taiwan-based company, thereâs persistent concern over China-Taiwan tensions and what a disruption could mean. These factors keep TSMCâs valuation in check. Itâs no stretch to say that TSMC is one blockade away from bankruptcy in a scenario that is looking increasingly likely. For Canadian investors, TSMC offers exposure to the hardware foundation of AI with a relatively reasonable valuation and a dividend (TSMC yields around 1â2%). Itâs listed on the NYSE as an ADR (TSM), so itâs accessible in any Canadian brokerage. The caution here is less about hype (the stockâs multiples are not outrageous) and more about understanding the unique risks: a manufacturing-heavy business requiring huge capital expenditure, and the geopolitical risk of its location. If one is bullish that AI chip demand will stay strong and no major geopolitical event will intervene, TSMC could be a solid pick-and-shovel investment. But keep in mind, unlike a software firm, TSMCâs upside might be capped by how many chips it can physically produce and by the fact that it doesnât capture the full high margins of the end products. Itâs a crucial piece of the AI puzzle, just priced more modestly â reflecting both its stability and its risk profile. Beyond buying shares of companies that directly benefit from artificial intelligence, many investors wonder if AI tools can help them make better investments or trade more profitably. The short answer is: AI might be able to assist active traders with investing, but personally I donât see much use for the average retail investor. Theyâre certainly no substitute for a Canadian financial advisor. A growing number of platforms claim to use AI (often machine learning or even GPT-like language models) to pick stocks or time trades. Examples include Danelfin, Tickeron, and various mobile apps that use AI to analyze news or charts. Some even let you chat with an AI to get stock analysis. These tools can rapidly sift through data â for instance, scanning financial reports or technical indicators â and highlight potential opportunities. Research on their performance is mixed. There are some headline-grabbing anecdotes out there such as one experiment in the UK had a portfolio of stocks selected by ChatGPT outperform top human-managed funds over a few weeks. Of course, random performance over a few weeks isnât exactly something Iâd base my personal portfolio on! On the flip side, other AI-driven funds and tools have underwhelmed â notably, an AI-powered ETF (AIEQ) launched in 2017 has consistently underperformed the S&P 500 index in most years since inception. This suggests that while AI can crunch data, it isnât a magic money tree; markets are complex and usually quite efficient over the long term. To my way of thinking, the leading investment banks like Goldman Sachs, as well as the worldâs largest hedge funds are pretty clearly going to be on the cutting edge of whatever artificial intelligence can do. You just have to look at high-frequency trading to support that theory. If we assume that all of these companies will continue to compete with each other, then it follows that AI will simply make them roughly equally good, and overall asset prices will continue to be priced efficiently! Canadian robo advisors such as Justwealth, Wealthsimple, RBC InvestEase, Questwealth (Questrade), and others, use basic algorithms to build and rebalance portfolios for clients. That said, I get a kick out of watching them trying to brand themselves as artificial intelligence. While following a passive investing strategy shows a high amount of human intelligence, there is nothing inherently âAIâ about the rebalancing that a robo advisor does. These companies are just trying to get their share of the AI glamour. Robo advisors are solid automated investing tools, but I donât really see how AI helps them over the long-term. Maybe there is something there in terms of providing personalized advice at some point – but I think we are a ways away before Iâd place much faith in that.

Some fintech companies offer AI-based trading signals or even fully automated trading bots. These range from AI that does high-frequency trading, to bots that you can connect to your brokerage to execute trades based on AI pattern recognition. A few examples include algorithmic trading platforms that optimize strategies using machine learning, or services that use AI to analyze social media sentiment and then make trades. The key thing to understand is that markets adapt quickly, and what worked in the backtest is unlikely to work going forward. Thereâs also the issue of overfitting (an AI model might âlearnâ the past too specifically and not handle future volatility). To date, thereâs little independent evidence that any off-the-shelf AI trading bot can reliably beat a simple index fund after fees and trading costs. Some may have hot streaks, but they can just as easily hit losing streaks. I have no plans to trust any of my personal money to them. The best AI ETFs are the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (AIQ) and the iShares Future AI and Tech ETF (ARTY) down in the USA. My main criteria there is just the market capitalization of those two funds. In Canada, youâre obviously dealing with a much smaller market, but you could look at the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology Index ETF (AIGO) and CI Global Artificial Intelligence ETF (CIAI). For the average retail investor, itâs not a good idea to use AI to invest. Every massive company out there has access to better AI than you do. Any strategy that your AI can dream up has already been considered by JP Morganâs AI. Obviously you can use AI to help research investing options and/or create filters and screens that help your investment process. That said, Iâm not a fan of using AI bots for investing. Anyone that is, is probably trying to sell you a course about using AI for investing! If you consider the basic algorithms that power Canadian robo advisors to be artificial intelligence then I would say they are the best AI investing platforms. Other than that, I personally wouldnât recommend any AI investing bots or platforms at the moment. I often find myself playing âDevilâs Advocateâ when it comes to just how important this AI revolution is. Look, anyone that tells you that AI doesnât matter and itâs a fad is ill-informed and is probably scared of change. I think itâs equally true (perhaps more so) that anyone that thinks AI is going to drastically change day-to-day life in the next three months is trying to sell something, or has bought way too far into the hype. By far the likeliest scenarios are somewhere in the middle. I see many instances where AI can be used to augment the best human workers in order to replace many lower-performing employees. I think many companies across broad swathes of the economy are likely to see their profit margins increase. But I donât see AI or AI stocks quite living up to the expectations many investors seem to have right now. They certainly arenât making it into our best low risk investments article any time soon! Be especially skeptical of any company that seems to be inserting AI mentions into everything they do and every public statement they get just to appear trendy or âcutting edge.â I remember not to long ago when âblockchainâ needed to be mentioned 10 times in every conference call, and all those pet projects have yet to yield any long-term efficiencies!

Written by: Kyle Prevost Canadian investors are increasingly faced with two related trends: investing in AI stocks (buying shares of companies benefitting from artificial intelligence boom) versus using AI to invest (leveraging AI-driven tools to make investment decisions).Â Personally, Iâm instinctually suspicious of anything that gets this much press coverage and hype behind it. I should be clear – I use language learning models (LLMs) daily these days. I get how they can greatly improve productivity. Iâm just not sure I see quite the boom or world-changing use-case that real AI-bulls out there seem to be putting forward. But it probably doesnât surprise anyone that a fan of Canadian all in one ETFs and Canadian dividend stocks isnât a huge proponent of âthe latest thing.â Best 2025 Broker Promo Up to $150 Sign Up Bonus!

To be clear, when I talk about âInvesting in AIâ Iâm referring to buying into companies or sectors that stand to benefit from AIâs growth â for example, purchasing stock in a tech company developing AI products. Iâm not talking about small- and medium-sized businesses using cash flow to pay for AI capability that will increase their corporationâs efficiency. In other words, Iâm talking about individual portfolio investments, not corporate balance sheet investments. When I talk about âusing AI to investâ, Iâm referringÂ to employing artificial intelligence tools in your own investing process (such as AI-powered stock screeners).Â Investing in AI relies on traditional equity analysis (are these companies good investments, or overhyped?), whereas using AI tools involves trusting algorithms to augment or automate your decisions. A prudent investor should be cautious of hype in both cases. AI companiesâ stocks can soar on optimism long before profits materialize, and AI investing tools seem to be promising market-beating results that donât always pan out in reality. When it comes to investing in AI through equities, Canadian investors have a few domestic tech names with AI exposure. The companies below are among Canadaâs top tech stocks, each connected to AI in different ways. I also want to point out that it isnât only tech companies that benefit from AI efficiencies. It may turn out for example that railway stocks and utility stocks actually decrease their costs and improve productivity in a manner that leaves them as bigger winners than the market has currently priced in. Itâs difficult to project these things, but I wanted to emphasize that making use of artificial intelligence isnât solely reserved for a handful of tech companies (although they’re obviously the most direct beneficiaries). What it does: Shopify is an Ottawa-based e-commerce platform provider enabling merchants worldwide to set up online stores. Itâs one of Canadaâs largest tech companies, with a market capitalization around $140+ billion USD (approximately C$200 billion). AI connection: Shopify is not an âAI companyâ per se, but it has been integrating AI into its services to help merchants. For instance, Shopify recently launched Shopify Magic â an AI tool to automatically generate product descriptions and other copy â and Shopify Sidekick, an AI assistant to help merchants analyze business questions and perform tasks. These generative AI features (powered by large language models) aim to make life easier for online store owners, and could improve Shopifyâs value proposition to businesses. In short, Shopify is using AI to enhance its commerce platform (e.g. AI-written product content and AI-driven storefront tools) rather than selling AI software directly.Â Is AI growth priced in? Shopifyâs stock has already rebounded strongly, suggesting that investors are optimistic. In fact, Shopify shares have nearly doubled (up ~88% year-over-year) and the stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio around 70 on a trailing basis. Such a high P/E implies that significant growth (including AI-driven growth) may already be baked into the price. Investors are paying a premium for Shopify â its P/E was over 68 at the end of 2024, coming down from an even loftier level in 2023. This rich valuation means that if AI integrations donât materially boost Shopifyâs earnings in coming years, the stock could be vulnerable. Analyst sentiment on Shopify is positive but cautious â the consensus rating is a Moderate Buy, with the vast majority of analysts rating it âBuyâ or âOutperformâ (roughly 25 buys, 12 holds, 0 sells in one survey).Â Overall, Shopify is seen as a Canadian tech champion poised to benefit from AI adoption in e-commerce, but investors should be mindful that its valuation is high and assumes a lot of future success. What it does: Open Text is a long-established Canadian enterprise software company (headquartered in Waterloo) specializing in information management, content services, and business process tools. With a market cap near C$8 billion, Open Text is a major tech player in Canada. It sells software to large organizations for managing documents, data, and workflows â and increasingly, these offerings include AI features. AI connection: Open Text has been incorporating AI and machine learning into its products to help enterprise customers make sense of large amounts of unstructured data. The company recently launched OpenText Aviator, an AI platform that adds predictive analytics, AI-powered search, and generative AI capabilities across Open Textâs software suite. For example, OpenTextâs content management solutions now use AI-driven insights to automate workflows and improve decision-making. The firm is also applying AI in cybersecurity and other areas (through acquisitions and R&D).Â In short, Open Text is leveraging AI to enhance its existing software products (making it an âAI enhancerâ in its industry), rather than being a pure AI developer from scratch. Is AI growth priced in? Unlike some flashy AI startups, Open Textâs stock has modest expectations built in. The shares trade at a trailing P/E of about 11.5 (based on the last 12 months earnings), which is far lower than many AI-themed companies. In fact, its forward P/E is around 6â7, reflecting that earnings are expected to jump (likely due to recent acquisitions and cost efficiencies). This relatively low valuation suggests the market is not aggressively pricing in an AI revenue explosion for Open Text â if anything, investors are a bit skeptical or simply valuing it as a steady enterprise software business. The stock pays a dividend (yield ~3.7%), signaling a stable, mature company rather than a high-flying AI growth story. Analyst sentiment on Open Text is mixed to mildly positive.Â Overall, Open Text provides a cautionary contrast to AI hype â itâs using AI under the hood to make its products better, but its stock hasnât skyrocketed on AI news. This could mean potential value if those AI enhancements drive more sales, but also reflects that AI alone hasnât transformed Open Textâs growth narrative (at least as far as investors are concerned, so far). What it does: Kinaxis is an Ottawa-based software company focusing on supply chain planning and logistics solutions. Its flagship platform, RapidResponse (now evolving with Kinaxis Maestro), helps large companies manage their supply chain operations in real time. Kinaxis is smaller than the names above, with a market cap around C$5â6 billion but itâs one of Canadaâs tech success stories in a niche domain (supply chain management software). AI connection: Kinaxis has been âAI-infusingâ its supply chain platform to enhance forecasting and decision-making. The companyâs software uses machine learning and AI (branded as part of its AI-driven Maestro platform) to analyze supply chain data and generate insights for planners. For example, Kinaxis offers Demand.AI for demand forecasting and uses AI/advanced analytics to optimize inventory and production schedules. In practical terms, this means Kinaxisâs tools can automatically detect anomalies, predict shortages or gluts, and recommend actions â a clear value-add for complex global supply chains. The use of AI is a selling point that helps Kinaxis remain competitive against larger global software firms.Â Is AI growth priced in? Kinaxisâs stock carries a very high valuation, implying that investors have lofty growth expectations (which likely include its AI capabilities). The stockâs trailing P/E is extremely elevated (over 400) due to very small current earnings. Essentially, Kinaxis has been reinvesting for growth and its GAAP net income is minimal, so the P/E looks sky-high. Even on a forward basis, the P/E is around 40+. This suggests the market has already priced in robust growth (double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion) for years ahead. In 2024â25 the stock has performed well â itâs hovering near 52-week highs around $190â$200/share. Analyst sentiment leans positive: the consensus rating is between Buy and Hold. Kinaxisâs AI story (smarter supply chain automation) is compelling, but a lot of that story is already reflected in the stock price. Future stock gains will depend on the company delivering strong results to justify the premium What it does: Constellation Software is a Toronto-based tech conglomerate known for acquiring and holding dozens of smaller vertical market software businesses. Under CEO Mark Leonard, Constellation has for years been a serial acquirer of software companies in niche industries (from healthcare to finance to public transit systems software). This decentralized, buy-and-hold approach has turned Constellation into one of Canadaâs most valuable companies â its market capitalization is over C$100 billion (around US$75â80 billion). The companyâs share price has skyrocketed over the past decade as it continues to leverage its compounding acquisition model. AI connection: Unlike the others above, Constellation isnât focused on a single product or technology, and it doesnât market itself as an âAI company.â However, many of the software businesses it owns are likely implementing AI in their products on a case-by-case basis. Constellationâs model is to let its subsidiaries operate autonomously â so if AI can improve those niche software offerings (by adding new features like predictive analytics, or automating tasks for clients), Constellation will benefit indirectly through better performance of its businesses. Thereâs also a strategic angle: AI could lower the cost of developing software or open new markets, which might create more acquisition opportunities for Constellation. In short, Constellation is an AI beneficiary by osmosis â itâs not selling AI platforms itself, but its vast portfolio of software companies can adopt AI advances to enhance their mission-critical products. This should, over time, boost the value of Constellationâs holdings. (Notably, Constellation hasnât seen an âAI hypeâ spike like Nvidia or Microsoft; its trajectory has been steady compounding.) Is AI growth priced in? Constellation Softwareâs stock trades at a premium valuation, but that has been more due to its reliable acquisition-driven growth than any AI excitement. Its trailing P/E is in the 100+ range , which is very high â though part of that is due to accounting (the companyâs earnings are dampened by amortization of acquisition intangibles). On an operational basis, the valuation is somewhat lower (an operating P/E around 45), but still rich. This reflects investorsâ trust in Constellationâs model and management, and perhaps a scarcity premium for a company that has delivered 30% annualized returns historically. Importantly, AI is not the main driver of Constellationâs valuation today â the stock isnât up 50% overnight on AI news. This relatively measured market reaction means that investors arenât assuming dramatic AI-fueled growth for Constellation in the near term. If anything, AI is a subtle tailwind: over time AI could make Constellationâs businesses more efficient or expand their markets, but the stockâs price is still grounded in the firmâs disciplined acquisition strategy Beyond the Canadian stock market, many global tech leaders in AI are accessible to Canadian investors through U.S. markets. All of our picks for best online brokerages easily allow Canadians to purchase stocks on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and/or NASDAQ. Here are three prominent examples of AI-related stocks that, while not based in Canada, can be bought by Canadians in their portfolios: Nvidia has become synonymous with the AI boom, thanks to its graphics processing units (GPUs) that serve as the workhorses for AI computations. Nvidiaâs chips are used to train and run neural networks (including the large models behind tools like ChatGPT), making the company a critical âpicks-and-shovelâ provider in the AI industry. AI connection: Virtually every major AI application today relies on Nvidiaâs hardware. The explosion of demand for AI-capable cloud computing (from data centers training machine learning models) has led to a surge in orders for Nvidiaâs high-end GPUs. In response, Nvidia has pivoted heavily to data-center and AI-focused products (like the A100 and H100 GPU units), and it also provides AI software frameworks (CUDA libraries, etc.) to support developers. This positioning made Nvidia one of the biggest winners of the generative AI trend. Nvidiaâs stock has skyrocketed on AI hype and growth. The companyâs market capitalization blew past US$1 trillion in 2023 and kept climbing â as of mid-2025, Nvidia is worth roughly $3.3 trillion USD (making it one of the most valuable companies in the world). The stock price increase has been accompanied by surging financials: Nvidiaâs revenue more than doubled year-over-year, and earnings jumped correspondingly Despite that, the valuation remains very high. Nvidia trades around 55 times trailing earnings and about 30+ times forward earnings. In other words, even considering the huge profit growth expected, investors are still paying a premium for Nvidiaâs future. This implies a lot of optimism that the AI demand will continue unabated (and so far, Nvidia has delivered). Should Canadians buy Nvidia? If you believe in the long-term AI infrastructure story, Nvidia is a core holding â but be cautious of the price youâre paying. The market may have already priced in years of AI growth. Any slowdown in AI uptake or new competition (e.g., improved chips from AMD, or AI-specific chips from Google/others, or even software that makes cutting-edge AI chips irrelevant – like Chinaâs Deepseek) could hit Nvidiaâs stock hard simply because expectations are sky-high. Analysts currently remain bullish (given Nvidiaâs dominance and lack of real competition at the very high end), but even bullish analysts often acknowledge the stock isnât cheap. Microsoft might not seem like an âAI stockâ at first glance. Itâs a diversified tech giant known for Windows, Office, and Azure cloud services. Moreover, for many of us over 35, Microsoft might always be associated with boring spreadsheets and bad browsers! However, Microsoft has emerged as a key player in AI, largely due to its partnership with (and heavy investment in) OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. Microsoft is integrating AI across its product range and using its massive distribution to bring AI to the masses. Microsoft invested billions (over $10 billion) into OpenAI and is the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAIâs services. In return, Microsoft has integrated OpenAIâs GPT models into products like Bing (for search with the AI-powered Bing Chat), Microsoft 365 Copilot (an AI assistant across Word, Excel, Outlook, etc.), GitHub Copilot (coding assistant), and Azureâs AI cloud offerings. Essentially, Microsoft is weaving generative AI and machine learning into its software and cloud platform at an impressive scale. This gives it a potential competitive edge (e.g., making Office 365 more indispensable with AI features, or attracting cloud customers who want ready-made AI solutions on Azure).Â Microsoftâs Azure AI services also compete with Google and Amazon in providing AI infrastructure and APIs to enterprises. Market reaction: Microsoftâs stock has performed strongly in the past couple of years, buoyed by overall cloud growth and excitement around AI. In 2023, MSFT hit all-time highs as the market cheered its AI initiatives (with some dubbing it a new AI âarms dealerâ and âplatformâ stock). Microsoftâs market cap is roughly $3.3-3.4 trillion USD, meaning that it is competing with Nvidia (and a couple others) for the title of most valuable company in the world. Despite this massive size, the stockâs valuation is relatively moderate compared to pure AI plays: Microsoft trades at around 35Ã earnings (trailing P/E in the mid-30s). This is a premium to the broader market (the S&P 500âs P/E is about 18), but itâs nowhere near the multiple of other AI stocks. It reflects that Microsoft has a very profitable core business already, and AI is viewed as a major growth driver – but within an established company. Bottom line for investors: Microsoft offers a way to benefit from AI trends (like generative AI adoption) with a lot less volatility than many pure-play AI names. Its business is diverse and extremely cash-generative, which provides a cushion if certain AI bets take longer to pay off. Taiwan Semi (NYSE: TSM) is by far the worldâs largest and most advanced contract semiconductor manufacturer. They build the chips that other companies design. Whenever you hear about cutting-edge AI chips (like Nvidiaâs GPUs or Appleâs processors), chances are theyâre made by TSMC. This makes TSMC a critical part of the AI supply chain, albeit one step removed from the flashy software applications. AI connection: TSMC is the foundry that produces integrated circuits for clients like Nvidia, AMD, Apple, and many others. In the context of AI, TSMC manufactures high-performance chips needed for AI computing â including Nvidiaâs AI accelerators and specialized AI chips for various companies. The surge in AI hardware demand ultimately means more business for TSMC (since Nvidiaâs record-breaking orders translate into higher volume at TSMCâs fabs). TSMCâs technological leadership (especially its ability to reliably produce chips at 5nm, 3nm, and soon 2nm process nodes) is essential for the power and efficiency of AI processors. In sum, TSMC is an enabler of AI innovation behind the scenes. Without it, the AI boom would hit a manufacturing bottleneck.Â Compared to Nvidia or Microsoft, TSMCâs stock has been more tempered. Itâs another very large company â its market cap is roughly US$850 billion (around C$1.1 trillion). TSMC trades at about 22-25Ã earnings (trailing P/E in the low-to-mid 20s), which is close to its historical average. Part of the reason is that TSMCâs growth, while solid, is limited by the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. In years of high demand (like during the pandemic and the current AI boom) it does fantastically, but it also faces cyclical downturns (PC/phone chip slowdowns, etc.). Perhaps most importantly, TSMC has geopolitical risks that are unique amongst AI stocks. As a Taiwan-based company, thereâs persistent concern over China-Taiwan tensions and what a disruption could mean. These factors keep TSMCâs valuation in check. Itâs no stretch to say that TSMC is one blockade away from bankruptcy in a scenario that is looking increasingly likely. For Canadian investors, TSMC offers exposure to the hardware foundation of AI with a relatively reasonable valuation and a dividend (TSMC yields around 1â2%). Itâs listed on the NYSE as an ADR (TSM), so itâs accessible in any Canadian brokerage. The caution here is less about hype (the stockâs multiples are not outrageous) and more about understanding the unique risks: a manufacturing-heavy business requiring huge capital expenditure, and the geopolitical risk of its location. If one is bullish that AI chip demand will stay strong and no major geopolitical event will intervene, TSMC could be a solid pick-and-shovel investment. But keep in mind, unlike a software firm, TSMCâs upside might be capped by how many chips it can physically produce and by the fact that it doesnât capture the full high margins of the end products. Itâs a crucial piece of the AI puzzle, just priced more modestly â reflecting both its stability and its risk profile. Beyond buying shares of companies that directly benefit from artificial intelligence, many investors wonder if AI tools can help them make better investments or trade more profitably. The short answer is: AI might be able to assist active traders with investing, but personally I donât see much use for the average retail investor. Theyâre certainly no substitute for a Canadian financial advisor. A growing number of platforms claim to use AI (often machine learning or even GPT-like language models) to pick stocks or time trades. Examples include Danelfin, Tickeron, and various mobile apps that use AI to analyze news or charts. Some even let you chat with an AI to get stock analysis. These tools can rapidly sift through data â for instance, scanning financial reports or technical indicators â and highlight potential opportunities. Research on their performance is mixed. There are some headline-grabbing anecdotes out there such as one experiment in the UK had a portfolio of stocks selected by ChatGPT outperform top human-managed funds over a few weeks. Of course, random performance over a few weeks isnât exactly something Iâd base my personal portfolio on! On the flip side, other AI-driven funds and tools have underwhelmed â notably, an AI-powered ETF (AIEQ) launched in 2017 has consistently underperformed the S&P 500 index in most years since inception. This suggests that while AI can crunch data, it isnât a magic money tree; markets are complex and usually quite efficient over the long term.

You just have to look at high-frequency trading to support that theory.

For the average retail investor, itâs not a good idea to use AI to invest. Every massive company out there has access to better AI than you do. Any strategy that your AI can dream up has already been considered by JP Morganâs AI. Obviously you can use AI to help research investing options and/or create filters and screens that help your investment process. That said, Iâm not a fan of using AI bots for investing. Anyone that is, is probably trying to sell you a course about using AI for investing! If you consider the basic algorithms that power Canadian robo advisors to be artificial intelligence then I would say they are the best AI investing platforms. Other than that, I personally wouldnât recommend any AI investing bots or platforms at the moment. I often find myself playing âDevilâs Advocateâ when it comes to just how important this AI revolution is. Look, anyone that tells you that AI doesnât matter and itâs a fad is ill-informed and is probably scared of change. I think itâs equally true (perhaps more so) that anyone that thinks AI is going to drastically change day-to-day life in the next three months is trying to sell something, or has bought way too far into the hype. By far the likeliest scenarios are somewhere in the middle. I see many instances where AI can be used to augment the best human workers in order to replace many lower-performing employees. I think many companies across broad swathes of the economy are likely to see their profit margins increase. But I donât see AI or AI stocks quite living up to the expectations many investors seem to have right now. They certainly arenât making it into our best low risk investments article any time soon! Be especially skeptical of any company that seems to be inserting AI mentions into everything they do and every public statement they get just to appear trendy or âcutting edge.â I remember not to long ago when âblockchainâ needed to be mentioned 10 times in every conference call, and all those pet projects have yet to yield any long-term efficiencies!

Written by: Kyle Prevost Canadian investors are increasingly faced with two related trends: investing in AI stocks (buying shares of companies benefitting from artificial intelligence boom) versus using AI to invest (leveraging AI-driven tools to make investment decisions).Â Personally, Iâm instinctually suspicious of anything that gets this much press coverage and hype behind it. I should be clear – I use language learning models (LLMs) daily these days. I get how they can greatly improve productivity. Iâm just not sure I see quite the boom or world-changing use-case that real AI-bulls out there seem to be putting forward. But it probably doesnât surprise anyone that a fan of Canadian all in one ETFs and Canadian dividend stocks isnât a huge proponent of âthe latest thing.â Best 2025 Broker Promo Up to $150 Sign Up Bonus!

To be clear, when I talk about âInvesting in AIâ Iâm referring to buying into companies or sectors that stand to benefit from AIâs growth â for example, purchasing stock in a tech company developing AI products. Iâm not talking about small- and medium-sized businesses using cash flow to pay for AI capability that will increase their corporationâs efficiency. In other words, Iâm talking about individual portfolio investments, not corporate balance sheet investments. When I talk about âusing AI to investâ, Iâm referringÂ to employing artificial intelligence tools in your own investing process (such as AI-powered stock screeners).Â Investing in AI relies on traditional equity analysis (are these companies good investments, or overhyped?), whereas using AI tools involves trusting algorithms to augment or automate your decisions. A prudent investor should be cautious of hype in both cases. AI companiesâ stocks can soar on optimism long before profits materialize, and AI investing tools seem to be promising market-beating results that donât always pan out in reality. When it comes to investing in AI through equities, Canadian investors have a few domestic tech names with AI exposure. The companies below are among Canadaâs top tech stocks, each connected to AI in different ways. I also want to point out that it isnât only tech companies that benefit from AI efficiencies. It may turn out for example that railway stocks and utility stocks actually decrease their costs and improve productivity in a manner that leaves them as bigger winners than the market has currently priced in. Itâs difficult to project these things, but I wanted to emphasize that making use of artificial intelligence isnât solely reserved for a handful of tech companies (although they’re obviously the most direct beneficiaries). What it does: Shopify is an Ottawa-based e-commerce platform provider enabling merchants worldwide to set up online stores. Itâs one of Canadaâs largest tech companies, with a market capitalization around $140+ billion USD (approximately C$200 billion). AI connection: Shopify is not an âAI companyâ per se, but it has been integrating AI into its services to help merchants. For instance, Shopify recently launched Shopify Magic â an AI tool to automatically generate product descriptions and other copy â and Shopify Sidekick, an AI assistant to help merchants analyze business questions and perform tasks. These generative AI features (powered by large language models) aim to make life easier for online store owners, and could improve Shopifyâs value proposition to businesses. In short, Shopify is using AI to enhance its commerce platform (e.g. AI-written product content and AI-driven storefront tools) rather than selling AI software directly.Â Is AI growth priced in? Shopifyâs stock has already rebounded strongly, suggesting that investors are optimistic. In fact, Shopify shares have nearly doubled (up ~88% year-over-year) and the stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio around 70 on a trailing basis. Such a high P/E implies that significant growth (including AI-driven growth) may already be baked into the price. Investors are paying a premium for Shopify â its P/E was over 68 at the end of 2024, coming down from an even loftier level in 2023. This rich valuation means that if AI integrations donât materially boost Shopifyâs earnings in coming years, the stock could be vulnerable. Analyst sentiment on Shopify is positive but cautious â the consensus rating is a Moderate Buy, with the vast majority of analysts rating it âBuyâ or âOutperformâ (roughly 25 buys, 12 holds, 0 sells in one survey).Â Overall, Shopify is seen as a Canadian tech champion poised to benefit from AI adoption in e-commerce, but investors should be mindful that its valuation is high and assumes a lot of future success. What it does: Open Text is a long-established Canadian enterprise software company (headquartered in Waterloo) specializing in information management, content services, and business process tools. With a market cap near C$8 billion, Open Text is a major tech player in Canada. It sells software to large organizations for managing documents, data, and workflows â and increasingly, these offerings include AI features. AI connection: Open Text has been incorporating AI and machine learning into its products to help enterprise customers make sense of large amounts of unstructured data. The company recently launched OpenText Aviator, an AI platform that adds predictive analytics, AI-powered search, and generative AI capabilities across Open Textâs software suite. For example, OpenTextâs content management solutions now use AI-driven insights to automate workflows and improve decision-making. The firm is also applying AI in cybersecurity and other areas (through acquisitions and R&D).Â In short, Open Text is leveraging AI to enhance its existing software products (making it an âAI enhancerâ in its industry), rather than being a pure AI developer from scratch. Is AI growth priced in? Unlike some flashy AI startups, Open Textâs stock has modest expectations built in. The shares trade at a trailing P/E of about 11.5 (based on the last 12 months earnings), which is far lower than many AI-themed companies. In fact, its forward P/E is around 6â7, reflecting that earnings are expected to jump (likely due to recent acquisitions and cost efficiencies). This relatively low valuation suggests the market is not aggressively pricing in an AI revenue explosion for Open Text â if anything, investors are a bit skeptical or simply valuing it as a steady enterprise software business. The stock pays a dividend (yield ~3.7%), signaling a stable, mature company rather than a high-flying AI growth story. Analyst sentiment on Open Text is mixed to mildly positive.Â Overall, Open Text provides a cautionary contrast to AI hype â itâs using AI under the hood to make its products better, but its stock hasnât skyrocketed on AI news. This could mean potential value if those AI enhancements drive more sales, but also reflects that AI alone hasnât transformed Open Textâs growth narrative (at least as far as investors are concerned, so far). What it does: Kinaxis is an Ottawa-based software company focusing on supply chain planning and logistics solutions. Its flagship platform, RapidResponse (now evolving with Kinaxis Maestro), helps large companies manage their supply chain operations in real time. Kinaxis is smaller than the names above, with a market cap around C$5â6 billion but itâs one of Canadaâs tech success stories in a niche domain (supply chain management software). AI connection: Kinaxis has been âAI-infusingâ its supply chain platform to enhance forecasting and decision-making. The companyâs software uses machine learning and AI (branded as part of its AI-driven Maestro platform) to analyze supply chain data and generate insights for planners. For example, Kinaxis offers Demand.AI for demand forecasting and uses AI/advanced analytics to optimize inventory and production schedules. In practical terms, this means Kinaxisâs tools can automatically detect anomalies, predict shortages or gluts, and recommend actions â a clear value-add for complex global supply chains. The use of AI is a selling point that helps Kinaxis remain competitive against larger global software firms.Â Is AI growth priced in? Kinaxisâs stock carries a very high valuation, implying that investors have lofty growth expectations (which likely include its AI capabilities). The stockâs trailing P/E is extremely elevated (over 400) due to very small current earnings. Essentially, Kinaxis has been reinvesting for growth and its GAAP net income is minimal, so the P/E looks sky-high. Even on a forward basis, the P/E is around 40+. This suggests the market has already priced in robust growth (double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion) for years ahead. In 2024â25 the stock has performed well â itâs hovering near 52-week highs around $190â$200/share. Analyst sentiment leans positive: the consensus rating is between Buy and Hold. Kinaxisâs AI story (smarter supply chain automation) is compelling, but a lot of that story is already reflected in the stock price. Future stock gains will depend on the company delivering strong results to justify the premium What it does: Constellation Software is a Toronto-based tech conglomerate known for acquiring and holding dozens of smaller vertical market software businesses. Under CEO Mark Leonard, Constellation has for years been a serial acquirer of software companies in niche industries (from healthcare to finance to public transit systems software). This decentralized, buy-and-hold approach has turned Constellation into one of Canadaâs most valuable companies â its market capitalization is over C$100 billion (around US$75â80 billion). The companyâs share price has skyrocketed over the past decade as it continues to leverage its compounding acquisition model. AI connection: Unlike the others above, Constellation isnât focused on a single product or technology, and it doesnât market itself as an âAI company.â However, many of the software businesses it owns are likely implementing AI in their products on a case-by-case basis. Constellationâs model is to let its subsidiaries operate autonomously â so if AI can improve those niche software offerings (by adding new features like predictive analytics, or automating tasks for clients), Constellation will benefit indirectly through better performance of its businesses. Thereâs also a strategic angle: AI could lower the cost of developing software or open new markets, which might create more acquisition opportunities for Constellation. In short, Constellation is an AI beneficiary by osmosis â itâs not selling AI platforms itself, but its vast portfolio of software companies can adopt AI advances to enhance their mission-critical products. This should, over time, boost the value of Constellationâs holdings. (Notably, Constellation hasnât seen an âAI hypeâ spike like Nvidia or Microsoft; its trajectory has been steady compounding.) Is AI growth priced in? Constellation Softwareâs stock trades at a premium valuation, but that has been more due to its reliable acquisition-driven growth than any AI excitement. Its trailing P/E is in the 100+ range , which is very high â though part of that is due to accounting (the companyâs earnings are dampened by amortization of acquisition intangibles). On an operational basis, the valuation is somewhat lower (an operating P/E around 45), but still rich. This reflects investorsâ trust in Constellationâs model and management, and perhaps a scarcity premium for a company that has delivered 30% annualized returns historically. Importantly, AI is not the main driver of Constellationâs valuation today â the stock isnât up 50% overnight on AI news. This relatively measured market reaction means that investors arenât assuming dramatic AI-fueled growth for Constellation in the near term. If anything, AI is a subtle tailwind: over time AI could make Constellationâs businesses more efficient or expand their markets, but the stockâs price is still grounded in the firmâs disciplined acquisition strategy Beyond the Canadian stock market, many global tech leaders in AI are accessible to Canadian investors through U.S. markets. All of our picks for best online brokerages easily allow Canadians to purchase stocks on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and/or NASDAQ. Here are three prominent examples of AI-related stocks that, while not based in Canada, can be bought by Canadians in their portfolios: Nvidia has become synonymous with the AI boom, thanks to its graphics processing units (GPUs) that serve as the workhorses for AI computations. Nvidiaâs chips are used to train and run neural networks (including the large models behind tools like ChatGPT), making the company a critical âpicks-and-shovelâ provider in the AI industry. AI connection: Virtually every major AI application today relies on Nvidiaâs hardware. The explosion of demand for AI-capable cloud computing (from data centers training machine learning models) has led to a surge in orders for Nvidiaâs high-end GPUs. In response, Nvidia has pivoted heavily to data-center and AI-focused products (like the A100 and H100 GPU units), and it also provides AI software frameworks (CUDA libraries, etc.) to support developers. This positioning made Nvidia one of the biggest winners of the generative AI trend. Nvidiaâs stock has skyrocketed on AI hype and growth. The companyâs market capitalization blew past US$1 trillion in 2023 and kept climbing â as of mid-2025, Nvidia is worth roughly $3.3 trillion USD (making it one of the most valuable companies in the world). The stock price increase has been accompanied by surging financials: Nvidiaâs revenue more than doubled year-over-year, and earnings jumped correspondingly Despite that, the valuation remains very high. Nvidia trades around 55 times trailing earnings and about 30+ times forward earnings. In other words, even considering the huge profit growth expected, investors are still paying a premium for Nvidiaâs future. This implies a lot of optimism that the AI demand will continue unabated (and so far, Nvidia has delivered). Should Canadians buy Nvidia? If you believe in the long-term AI infrastructure story, Nvidia is a core holding â but be cautious of the price youâre paying. The market may have already priced in years of AI growth. Any slowdown in AI uptake or new competition (e.g., improved chips from AMD, or AI-specific chips from Google/others, or even software that makes cutting-edge AI chips irrelevant – like Chinaâs Deepseek) could hit Nvidiaâs stock hard simply because expectations are sky-high. Analysts currently remain bullish (given Nvidiaâs dominance and lack of real competition at the very high end), but even bullish analysts often acknowledge the stock isnât cheap. Microsoft might not seem like an âAI stockâ at first glance. Itâs a diversified tech giant known for Windows, Office, and Azure cloud services. Moreover, for many of us over 35, Microsoft might always be associated with boring spreadsheets and bad browsers! However, Microsoft has emerged as a key player in AI, largely due to its partnership with (and heavy investment in) OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. Microsoft is integrating AI across its product range and using its massive distribution to bring AI to the masses. Microsoft invested billions (over $10 billion) into OpenAI and is the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAIâs services. In return, Microsoft has integrated OpenAIâs GPT models into products like Bing (for search with the AI-powered Bing Chat), Microsoft 365 Copilot (an AI assistant across Word, Excel, Outlook, etc.), GitHub Copilot (coding assistant), and Azureâs AI cloud offerings. Essentially, Microsoft is weaving generative AI and machine learning into its software and cloud platform at an impressive scale. This gives it a potential competitive edge (e.g., making Office 365 more indispensable with AI features, or attracting cloud customers who want ready-made AI solutions on Azure).Â Microsoftâs Azure AI services also compete with Google and Amazon in providing AI infrastructure and APIs to enterprises. Market reaction: Microsoftâs stock has performed strongly in the past couple of years, buoyed by overall cloud growth and excitement around AI. In 2023, MSFT hit all-time highs as the market cheered its AI initiatives (with some dubbing it a new AI âarms dealerâ and âplatformâ stock). Microsoftâs market cap is roughly $3.3-3.4 trillion USD, meaning that it is competing with Nvidia (and a couple others) for the title of most valuable company in the world. Despite this massive size, the stockâs valuation is relatively moderate compared to pure AI plays: Microsoft trades at around 35Ã earnings (trailing P/E in the mid-30s). This is a premium to the broader market (the S&P 500âs P/E is about 18), but itâs nowhere near the multiple of other AI stocks. It reflects that Microsoft has a very profitable core business already, and AI is viewed as a major growth driver – but within an established company. Bottom line for investors: Microsoft offers a way to benefit from AI trends (like generative AI adoption) with a lot less volatility than many pure-play AI names. Its business is diverse and extremely cash-generative, which provides a cushion if certain AI bets take longer to pay off. Taiwan Semi (NYSE: TSM) is by far the worldâs largest and most advanced contract semiconductor manufacturer. They build the chips that other companies design. Whenever you hear about cutting-edge AI chips (like Nvidiaâs GPUs or Appleâs processors), chances are theyâre made by TSMC. This makes TSMC a critical part of the AI supply chain, albeit one step removed from the flashy software applications. AI connection: TSMC is the foundry that produces integrated circuits for clients like Nvidia, AMD, Apple, and many others. In the context of AI, TSMC manufactures high-performance chips needed for AI computing â including Nvidiaâs AI accelerators and specialized AI chips for various companies. The surge in AI hardware demand ultimately means more business for TSMC (since Nvidiaâs record-breaking orders translate into higher volume at TSMCâs fabs). TSMCâs technological leadership (especially its ability to reliably produce chips at 5nm, 3nm, and soon 2nm process nodes) is essential for the power and efficiency of AI processors. In sum, TSMC is an enabler of AI innovation behind the scenes. Without it, the AI boom would hit a manufacturing bottleneck.Â Compared to Nvidia or Microsoft, TSMCâs stock has been more tempered. Itâs another very large company â its market cap is roughly US$850 billion (around C$1.1 trillion). TSMC trades at about 22-25Ã earnings (trailing P/E in the low-to-mid 20s), which is close to its historical average. Part of the reason is that TSMCâs growth, while solid, is limited by the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. In years of high demand (like during the pandemic and the current AI boom) it does fantastically, but it also faces cyclical downturns (PC/phone chip slowdowns, etc.). Perhaps most importantly, TSMC has geopolitical risks that are unique amongst AI stocks. As a Taiwan-based company, thereâs persistent concern over China-Taiwan tensions and what a disruption could mean. These factors keep TSMCâs valuation in check. Itâs no stretch to say that TSMC is one blockade away from bankruptcy in a scenario that is looking increasingly likely. For Canadian investors, TSMC offers exposure to the hardware foundation of AI with a relatively reasonable valuation and a dividend (TSMC yields around 1â2%). Itâs listed on the NYSE as an ADR (TSM), so itâs accessible in any Canadian brokerage. The caution here is less about hype (the stockâs multiples are not outrageous) and more about understanding the unique risks: a manufacturing-heavy business requiring huge capital expenditure, and the geopolitical risk of its location. If one is bullish that AI chip demand will stay strong and no major geopolitical event will intervene, TSMC could be a solid pick-and-shovel investment. But keep in mind, unlike a software firm, TSMCâs upside might be capped by how many chips it can physically produce and by the fact that it doesnât capture the full high margins of the end products. Itâs a crucial piece of the AI puzzle, just priced more modestly â reflecting both its stability and its risk profile. Beyond buying shares of companies that directly benefit from artificial intelligence, many investors wonder if AI tools can help them make better investments or trade more profitably. The short answer is: AI might be able to assist active traders with investing, but personally I donât see much use for the average retail investor. Theyâre certainly no substitute for a Canadian financial advisor. A growing number of platforms claim to use AI (often machine learning or even GPT-like language models) to pick stocks or time trades. Examples include Danelfin, Tickeron, and various mobile apps that use AI to analyze news or charts. Some even let you chat with an AI to get stock analysis. These tools can rapidly sift through data â for instance, scanning financial reports or technical indicators â and highlight potential opportunities. Research on their performance is mixed. There are some headline-grabbing anecdotes out there such as one experiment in the UK had a portfolio of stocks selected by ChatGPT outperform top human-managed funds over a few weeks. Of course, random performance over a few weeks isnât exactly something Iâd base my personal portfolio on! On the flip side, other AI-driven funds and tools have underwhelmed â notably, an AI-powered ETF (AIEQ) launched in 2017 has consistently underperformed the S&P 500 index in most years since inception. This suggests that while AI can crunch data, it isnât a magic money tree; markets are complex and usually quite efficient over the long term. To my way of thinking, the leading investment banks like Goldman Sachs, as well as the worldâs largest hedge funds are pretty clearly going to be on the cutting edge of whatever artificial intelligence can do. You just have to look at high-frequency trading to support that theory. If we assume that all of these companies will continue to compete with each other, then it follows that AI will simply make them roughly equally good, and overall asset prices will continue to be priced efficiently! Canadian robo advisors such as Justwealth, Wealthsimple, RBC InvestEase, Questwealth (Questrade), and others, use basic algorithms to build and rebalance portfolios for clients. That said, I get a kick out of watching them trying to brand themselves as artificial intelligence. While following a passive investing strategy shows a high amount of human intelligence, there is nothing inherently âAIâ about the rebalancing that a robo advisor does. These companies are just trying to get their share of the AI glamour. Robo advisors are solid automated investing tools, but I donât really see how AI helps them over the long-term. Maybe there is something there in terms of providing personalized advice at some point – but I think we are a ways away before Iâd place much faith in that.

Some fintech companies offer AI-based trading signals or even fully automated trading bots. These range from AI that does high-frequency trading, to bots that you can connect to your brokerage to execute trades based on AI pattern recognition. A few examples include algorithmic trading platforms that optimize strategies using machine learning, or services that use AI to analyze social media sentiment and then make trades. The key thing to understand is that markets adapt quickly, and what worked in the backtest is unlikely to work going forward. Thereâs also the issue of overfitting (an AI model might âlearnâ the past too specifically and not handle future volatility). To date, thereâs little independent evidence that any off-the-shelf AI trading bot can reliably beat a simple index fund after fees and trading costs. Some may have hot streaks, but they can just as easily hit losing streaks. I have no plans to trust any of my personal money to them. The best AI ETFs are the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (AIQ) and the iShares Future AI and Tech ETF (ARTY) down in the USA. My main criteria there is just the market capitalization of those two funds. In Canada, youâre obviously dealing with a much smaller market, but you could look at the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology Index ETF (AIGO) and CI Global Artificial Intelligence ETF (CIAI). For the average retail investor, itâs not a good idea to use AI to invest. Every massive company out there has access to better AI than you do. Any strategy that your AI can dream up has already been considered by JP Morganâs AI. Obviously you can use AI to help research investing options and/or create filters and screens that help your investment process. That said, Iâm not a fan of using AI bots for investing. Anyone that is, is probably trying to sell you a course about using AI for investing! If you consider the basic algorithms that power Canadian robo advisors to be artificial intelligence then I would say they are the best AI investing platforms. Other than that, I personally wouldnât recommend any AI investing bots or platforms at the moment. I often find myself playing âDevilâs Advocateâ when it comes to just how important this AI revolution is. Look, anyone that tells you that AI doesnât matter and itâs a fad is ill-informed and is probably scared of change. I think itâs equally true (perhaps more so) that anyone that thinks AI is going to drastically change day-to-day life in the next three months is trying to sell something, or has bought way too far into the hype. By far the likeliest scenarios are somewhere in the middle. I see many instances where AI can be used to augment the best human workers in order to replace many lower-performing employees. I think many companies across broad swathes of the economy are likely to see their profit margins increase. But I donât see AI or AI stocks quite living up to the expectations many investors seem to have right now.

Consider this a practical primer, cutting through the BS: Stoicism, stoic, the stoa in ancient Greece– essentially the stoa was like some sort of portico, patio, pillar, outside, essentially a spot where guys would just hang out, talk shop, talk philosophy, etc. ￼ ￼ I think about the show “Hey Arnold” in which I was raised with… the notion of “stoop kid“, the notion of a stoop is that in a lot of cities, especially the east coast in New York, you have this little stoop or porch, stairs that go outside your front door… and you could just hang out there, engage in social and neighborhood life etc. One of my happiest moments was when I was living in Providence Rhode Island, and then COVID-19 hit. Everything was closed, besides the park. I can still go to the park, hang out, workout, do chin ups– I learned how to do muscle ups, more bodyweight calisthenics stuff, and also… I had a lot of fun with this “rock toss“ challenge and workout… in the middle of the park was a huge ass rock and huge ass stone, and every single day I would go there pick it up, and then eventually work out with it; throwing it around for fun, doing overhead presses with it, clean and jerks, squats, and eventually I would just throw it around for fun. Funny enough it might have been the most fit I was in my life… this was the true “functional” fitness. The inspiration — Hector lifting an insanely massive stone (barely 2 strong men could lift it)… using it to break down the door of the ships of the other side. Anyways, the reason why that period of covid was so good is that it was in the middle of beautiful Providence Rhode Island summer, so nice and bright and warm and lovely… and one of the good things was going to the park was like an open forum, a new anatheum for a lot of really cool guys to come, hang out, talk shop, go topless and shirtless, workout and hang out. I met some really interesting people during that period of time. I met some guys who were really cool. For example, one guy I met was in the US military Navy, I think he was training to be a Navy seal or Delta force or something. Another guy in some sort of ROTC training, another cool guy from the hood, and also I would say I probably met half a dozen friendly drug dealers there. And of course a lot of people who believed in conspiracy theories; really friendly, a little weird, but overall good guys. Anyways, one of the biggest benefits of hanging out at that outdoor park, open air, nothing but green grass, the beautiful sun and the fitness equipment was that I think having this sort of open air environment is actually very conducive to socializing, thinking and thought, and pro social behavior. My theory about a lot of modern day antisocial behavior has to do with the structures which enclose us. For example, almost universally most guys at the gym are extremely antisocial. Why? My theory is that because most gyms have closed, cramped narrow ceilings, and do not have access to natural light, or outside space. Cramped indoor spaces promote antisocial behavior. The only good gym I went to which was interesting was the golds gym in Venice, which has this really big outdoor workout area. I think this is much more natural and more fun and better; to be able to work out directly outside outdoors, with your shirt off. Stoics, stoicism — it was originally I think codified by this guy named Zeno, and over time he picked up some followers. Essentially the whole thing happened organically; Zeno would first share his thinking on philosophy ethics and pragmatic ways to deal with other people and the downsides of life, he built a following, and then his followers would propagate the thoughts and start their own little schools of thoughts, their own little stoic clubs. Would I like about stoicism is how loosey goosey it is. It is kind of like zen, or taoism… it is not really quantified as a religion, or a strict moral order. In fact, a lot of the ancients stoics would meditate on random stuff like cosmology, natural sciences like Seneca, how volcanoes worked or whatever. I think nowadays in today’s world, we focus primarily on the pragmatic side; how to deal with fear, uncertainty, downsides etc. ￼I think I might’ve first learned about stoicism from Nassim Taleb and his ANTIFRAGILE book. I was curious, and my curiosity went to deep. To quote NASSIM TALEB and the Venetian saying “The ocean goes deeper, the deeper you wade into it.” I literally consumed every single book I could find on stoicism, even the obscure ones. Funny enough, a lot of the stoic thinkers tried to claim other philosophers as being stoic, like Seneca did with Diogenes the cynic. ￼ Cynic, cynicism, actually comes from the word canine, the dog. Diogenes was considered the “dog” philosopher, first used as a pejorative, but ultimately Diogenes reappropriated that title for fun! He saw dogs as tough, almost like wild wolves, rather than seeing them as a negative thing. Even Achilles when he was raging against king Agamemnon, he called him “dog faced“ as a heaping insult. First, Seneca. Seneca the younger, his dad was called Seneca the elder. In fact, this is such a big deal because Cindy and I named our first son, Seneca, directly after the stoic philosopher. This is true soul in the game; if you name your kid after your favorite philosopher, certainly it is a sign that you really liked that philosopher, or found them impactful. ￼￼￼The reason why I really like Seneca the stoic philosopher is because he had real connections to real reality. What that means is he wasn’t just on the sidelines; he actually existed in the real world, engaged in real politics, was even advisor to the emperor Nero, the bad one, who eventually low-key coerced Seneca to commit suicide, in a manly, dignified manner. I think this was because maybe… there was actually a plan to overthrow Nero, and essentially Nero found out. ￼ I really like Seneca because his writing is accessible, practical and pragmatic, and interesting. A lot of thinkers tend to lack connections to real reality, I have no tolerance for boring philosophers to talk about metaphysics, which is things which are not physical. Like thoughts ideas, the universe, electricity and energy, strange phenomenon and conspiracy theories on ghosts, “energy” whatever. ￼￼For a long time, I would hear the term “metaphysics” being thrown around, and I had zero idea what it actually meant. ￼ Meta– on top of. Or nestled within. Physics — the physical, physical phenomenon like gravity, first principles. The reason why metaphysics philosophers tend to be a bunch of losers is that they are all weak and anemic, nerds or geeks or weaklings who seem to have some sort of physiological degeneracy, which encourages them to opine or talk or think about impractical things, superficial things. Personally speaking, I think philosophy must be practical. ￼￼￼￼ Practical, praxis, ￼practice — to do! I have a very funny ideal; the general idea is that your body looks like a demigod, and your physiology is out of control. The general idea is one must be tall, strong, highly muscular, low body fat percentage, I’m not exactly sure what my body fat percentage is, but maybe it’s around 5%. ￼￼Also, physical fitness is critical to any stoic. My ideal is to walk 50 miles a day, eat 20 pounds of meat like Milo of Croton a day. And also, abstinence from silly things like media, alcohol, drugs, marijuana etc. Trust no thinker who does drugs! Even our best friend Nietzsche said that coffee was bad, because it would make people dark and gloomy. He encouraged 100% cocoa powder instead. ￼￼￼ Simple technique: First, look at a picture or a portrait or a full body shot, ideally topless of the artist, philosopher or thinker or individual… then judge their thoughts later. Why? My theory is this: the thoughts of an individual is hugely affected by their bodily physiology. For example, an extreme example: if somebody is locked inside a solitary confinement cell, and not permitted to go outside for years, but, he had a pen and pad and would jot down some thoughts… Would be the quality of these thoughts? Certainly dark and morose. In today’s world, why does it matter, what is the significance of stoicism, etc.? First and foremost, I think we are living in a troubling time, especially with the advent of modern day internet based media and advertising. I think 99% of what is propagated on the internet is fear mongering, and what is hate? Hate is just fear. The first thought on stoicism is that it is just fear conquering. What I discovered about street photography, is that 99% of it is conquering your fears. Conquering your fears of upsetting other people, getting in some sort of verbal or physical altercation etc. In fact my bread and butter workshop is my conquering your fears and street photography workshop, the workshop which is still interesting to me even after a decade. Why is this so important? I think it is rooted in almost everything; conquering your fears is rooted in entrepreneurship, innovation, risktaking and real life. Even my speculation in crypto. 99.9% of crypto speculation is just balls. Having the balls to make big bets, and when things go south, knowing how to master your emotions. A simple extra I have is this: just imagine it will all go down to zero. It was useful because when I was in college, my sophomore year I got really into trading stocks, and I eventually lost my whole life savings, maybe around $3500 USD, and some bad penny stock which I actually misread the financials… the whole time I thought the company was making a profit, but actually it was taking a loss. I actually didn’t know that if profits are written in parentheses, it means a loss. It was funny because my initial start as an investor was back in high school, I bought some Adobe stock when I was a high school junior, and also some mutual funds, which both went up after about 4-5 years. ￼Also I remember in elementary school computer class, when I was in the sixth grade in Bayside Queens, there was some sort of stock stimulation trading game, and actually it was funny… the kids who made the most money and were the most successful just put 100% of everything into Apple, note this is when we were only 12 years old, and I was born in 1988. ￼Funny enough, it seems that stoicism actually plays well with capitalism. Why? According to modern day capitalist thinking, the best way to approach life is to be objective, strong, stoic, unemotional, logical and rational. Also, ￼with modern day media there is so much fear mongering in the news, about some sort of global armageddon, global financial ruin, etc. I call it “fear porn”. Therefore stoicism as a mindset is useful to think and position your mind in such a way that you could consider that life is all upside, no downside. In fact, if I could summarize stoicism in one sentence, it is that life is all upside, no downside. Inspired by NASSIM TALEB. So, is stoicism useful to you if you’re a man or a woman? Does it matter? The good thing is I think it could apply to both sexes. Conquering sexism and social pressures is useful if you’re woman, and also if you’re a man. Also, gender is social. Lot of the expectations set on us by society is socialized and gamed to a certain degree. First, we got to unchain ourselves from modern day ethics and morality. I believe that all modern day philosophy and thinking and ethics and religion is bad. For example, the notion of turning the other cheek is a patently bad one. Why did Jesus turn his cheek? It is because he lacked on army. Also, philosophically I think we should put no trust in Socrates. ￼￼￼I thought which has puzzled me for a long time was this “Why was Socrates so ugly? Monster in face, monster in soul. I think Socrates was a degenerate, and he lacked any sort of real power. Therefore he turned logic and rationality into his terrorizing weapon (via Nietzsche). Back in the day, you didn’t need logic or rationality to have things your way, you simply was able to dictate that which you wanted to pause it, because you had a military force behind you. Just think about Machiavelli and IL PRINCIPE– the reality of being a mercurial prince, king, and military leader is hard, stoic, “immoral”. But ultimately it all comes down to war, conquest, the military. Trust nobody who uses rationality or logic as their tyrannizing weapon. ￼ In fact, I believe that all should have the body and strength of some sort of super soldier. Essentially look like all the guys from the movie 300, this is our ideal. Demigod physique. ￼ And this is the true courage of Kanye West; he literally put everything on the line, and even lost his spouse and I think maybe his kids? All for the sake of revealing inequities. ￼ “I throw these Maybach keys fucking c’est la ￼vie! I know that we the new slaves.”￼- Ye The fun thing about stoicism is that you could just make it up as you go, devise your own strategies and whatever. “Fucking c’est la vie!” My favorite Kanye West line. Essentially the general idea is that in life, one should not take things too seriously. Laughter is golden, I forget the philosopher who was called the laughing philosopher… Democritus?; better to laugh about the follies of human beings rather than to be dark and morose about it. Also, thoughts from the Odyssey; if you look far enough ￼ into the future, everything becomes comedic and hilarious. So when you’re in some sort of bad situation, just think to yourself “Perhaps one day, 20 or 30 years from now… I will look back at this and just laugh!” It will just be humorous. Honestly, laughter, and kind of being able to joke about things might be the best way to live life and deal with setbacks. ￼ Problems in modern day life: A funny thing I have learned is that when you call something something, it isn’t that. For example, if someone calls something a “luxury car”, it ain’t. For example, a true modern day luxury car is maybe a Tesla, but Tesla never calls itself a luxury car. Also the ultimate luxury technology company is probably Apple… but Apple is very intelligent and not calling themselves a luxury brand. A pro tip is when it comes to websites, read the alternative text, the header text, the stuff that shows up in the tab of your browser window. If the website, the automotive retailer tries to market themselves as a “luxury” brand, typically it is actually a sign that it isn’t a luxury brand it isn’t luxury brand. Thought: what are some good examples of true luxury brands which don’t overly calls itself luxury? ￼￼ In someways, we can think and consider stoicism as our new luxury. In fact, having luxury, luxury of mind and soul… and luxury of freedom of speech, isn’t this the ultimate luxury? When somebody asked Diogenes the cynic; “What is the best human good”? He said “Freedom of speech, speaking your mind, having the power to see whatever is on your mind.” In fact, my current joy is becoming more and more free talking, and free riding. What that means is this; I’m ain’t going to censor myself no more, even if I might be politically incorrect insensitive or whatever. ￼ Also, I would prefer to speak my mind and seriously hurt the feelings of others, rather than soften it for the sake of the other person. ￼￼￼Similarly speaking, when people call themselves “influencers”, they are not influencers. Ultimately I think we should think of stoicism just like having another tool inside our tool kit. For example, if you’re a chef, you’re going to have different knives for different purposes. If you’re going to cut a big piece of meat, you probably want a big ass meat cutting knife, not something you would use to slice an apple with. Similarly speaking, if you’re going to scoop out the insides of an avocado, better to use a spoon rather than using a fork, or a knife. ￼ I think the problem is when some people get too into stoicism (I prefer writing stoicism with a lowercase￼), they think that everything needs to be consistent, and must fit into this nice little neat box of what is considered “stoicism“. This is a bad line of thinking… let us consider that Marcus Aurelius never even mentioned stoicism in his writings, his collections of thoughts, which we moderns call THE MEDITATIONS… it was just essentially his personal diary, to help him conquer his own personal fears and thoughts, I don’t think he ever intended it to be published publicly. I think he just wrote it to himself as self therapy. And I think the only stoic philosopher he even mentions is maybe Epictetus. For myself, I just come out with certain to work out thoughts and techniques because it helps me, and when I find these tricks or techniques or secret hacks or cheat codes… My passion is to simply share it with others. ￼￼￼￼ And ultimately, things are ever in flux and evolving and changing and adapting. For example, I’ve discovered the quality of my thinking is different when I am in Culver City Los Angeles, compared to being in the boring suburbs of Orange County. Also depending on my social environments… my stoic thoughts are different when I am in a gym, vs just working out by myself in my parking spot in the back of my apartment. Also, the quality of my thoughts is different when living with family members or other people versus just living with myself Cindy and Seneca. Assuming you’re not growing your own vegetables and living in the middle of nowhere… you probably have some interaction with other human beings. As long as you have an iPhone, an Android phone, a smartphone, a 4G or 5G internet connection, wifi, a laptop, have to buy groceries somewhere… you’re still going to have to interact with other human beings. And this is good. There is no other greater joy than other human beings. In fact, modern-day society is strange because in someways, the ethos is to be antisocial and to be cowardly. But in fact, the best way to think about things is that real life is interaction with other human beings, and social conquest. One can imagine a lot of modern day entrepreneurship as simply a big dick swinging contest. He who is the most masculine confident tall and strong and stoic shall win. Assume that everyone is mentally insane: Have you ever been out in public, and you see some sort of crackhead or strange homeless person who acts radically, smells terrible, and is obviously mentally ill? Do you hate them for it? When they say something weird to you… do you take it personally? No. Why? They are crazy. Perhaps we should just adopt this stoic mindset towards other people; some people are actually physiologically ill, mentally unwell… don’t trust the opinion of nobody. A lot of people are trying to actually deal with their own inner demons: For example, becoming the successful photographer and street photographer I am today… I’ve dealt with some individuals who would say anonymous bad things about me, and later I found out that their mom just died or something. I cannot imagine what it feels like losing a mother… therefore if somebody spew some hate on me because something bad happened to them, I’m not gonna take it personally. ￼￼￼￼￼Self-flagellation: I think a lot of people who are sick, mentally or physiologically self flagellate themselves. Essentially the way that they deal with other people or themselves is some sort of metaphorical self-flagellation. For example… you know those strange individuals who have the whip and whip themselves, and inflict pain on themselves? I think some people do this metaphorically to themselves and others. You just want to stay away from them. My personal theory on fear is that a lot of it is tied to morality and ethics. I think the general idea is not necessarily that we are afraid of anything… I think the true fear is that we’re afraid that we are some sort of bad evil unethical immoral person. For example in street photography, the general ethical thought is that it is immoral to take a photo of somebody without their permission, because there is some sort of it inherent evil behind it. Is this true? No. Taking photos and not really a big deal. I think it is because some people are just overly sensitive, which once again comes from some sort of physiological weakness. For example, if you’re a weightlifter who could lift 1000 pounds, assuming you’re not taking any steroids or anything… are small things going to bother you? No. But let us assume that you are a skinny fat man, all you do is drink alcohol and smoke marijuana and watch Netflix, and you spent too much time on Reddit… you are 40% body fat, and have never lifted in your life. And also your testosterone is low and you never go outside. Certainly the quality of your thoughts is going to be different than if you’re a happy gay monster, lifting weights outside in the direct sun, laughing and having fun. ￼￼￼ In fact, I’ve actually personally discovered that the reason why a lot of people hate me is because I am so happy jovial and gay. They are secretly suspicious or envious of me? ￼ Probably one of my worst experiences was this jarring transition; I was super happy insanely happy being in Vietnam in 2017; with a beautiful weather, the beautiful light, the happy people the great amenities etc.… and then that winter Cindy and I went to Europe, in Marseille Berlin and Prague, and maybe London… seriously the worst winter of my life. Why? I wonder if so much miserable feelings and thoughts simply comes from the darkness and lack of light. a lot of Europe is actually quite miserable; dark, unhygienic, morose. Even Nietzsche had a thought about Schopenhauer; How much of these emo European philosophers came from the fact that it was just complaining about the cold weather in Germany etc.?￼￼For myself, my ideal weather is Southeast Asia; I love being in Phnom Penh Cambodia, Vietnam etc. In the states, am I the only one who loves living in Los Angeles? Dr. Dre and Kendrick Lamar said that LA was the best for women weed and weather… I would definitely say the biggest upside of living in Los Angeles is the light, the sunlight. It actually does get quite cold here, but usually most reliably even in December during the winter time, the sun will always come up. As long as there is bright sunny light, I will be happy. And I think maybe for myself, considering that I am a photographer, and photography means painting with light… light for me is critical. I also wonder how much of it is a physiological thing and a genetic trait; for example I could even recall being a young child, and my mom telling me that the most critical thing in finding a home or an apartment was light and natural light. Even now… 90% of my happiness comes from being able to ￼have access to natural light, ideally floor to ceiling windows facing directly the sun, having some sort of modern temperature regulated apartment and home. Even living in our tiny studio minimalistic luxury apartment in Providence Rhode Island, where it was always 75° warm and cozy, and not frigid and damp and cold and dark and humid… I was always good. But moving to an older house, where it always felt damp and cold… this literally lowered my happiness by 1000%. Therefore, if you’re feeling miserable sad or whatever… I say spend three months living in Hanoi or Saigon in Vietnam, or go to Phnom Penh Cambodia. I wonder if 90% of peoples misery is simply due to the weather. ￼￼”Better to be a gay monster than a sentimental bore!” – Fernandino Galliani, via Nietzsche My stoic ideal is somebody who is happy, gay, smiling, no headphones or AirPods on, no sunglasses on, no hat, no facial hair, no baggy oversized clothing, no tint in their car. Somebody who makes great eye contact, laughs, stands up upright, jokes, and fools around. Like an overgrown child. ￼Also, lift weights at least once every day, ideally in the direct sun. Just buy some weightlifting equipment on Titan.fitness, I like the farmers carry handles, the Olympic loadable dumbbell, and also the Texas power squat bar. Just buy some cheap weights, and or buy a heavy 400 pound sandbag, and just have fun throwing it around. A true stoic should look something like Hercules or Achilles. Or like ERIC KIM; I have the aesthetic and the physique of Brad Pitt in FIGHT CLUB except with a lot more muscle. Like my friend Soren says, the Adonis physique and proportions. I think a real stoic is sexy, happy and fun. Who doesn’t take life too seriously; and think of everything like a fun game. A real stoic would be joyful and cheery like three-year-old child without any adulteration from the outside world. I don’t like talking with or hanging out with adults, uninteresting. At what point or age do people become so emo? Typically, highschoolers are very optimistic. Even college students. But I think at least in maybe college in high school nowadays… the bad trend is towards “over concern”, about the world the planet ethics animals etc. I find a lot of this thinking superficial, performative, and uncritical. I think “animal rights“, “saving the planet” is this new pseudo world religion; which is just capitalism 3.0. I find the whole pet industry the whole dog industry to be insanely bizarre, and I trust nobody who talks about “saving the planet“ who owns an iPhone, owns any sort of car, or has an Amazon prime subscription. Certainly not any vegans. Animals are animals. They are lower on the hierarchy and totem pole on earth. Man is the apex predator, the apex bully and the apex tyrant. Should we care for animals or “animal rights”? No. Animals are our slaves. If you consider even dogs and pets… they are essentially our emotional slaves. People talk a lot about the virtuosity of dogs being loyal or whatever… and giving you unconditional love. This seems like some sort of emotional slavery. The only dogs I respect are some sort of canine dogs, some sort of attack or defense dogs, or hunting dogs. For example, John Wick 3; Halle Barry and her dogs. An animal should either be a weapon, or nothing. Essentially it looks like men no longer have a backbone. No more spine. I trust nobody who owns a dog. Let us not forget; they call it dog ownership, or “owning a pet”. There is no more concept of “human ownership, or “owning a human.”￼￼￼ What is the end goal of humanity? To me it is towards entrepreneurship, innovation, art and aesthetics, philosophy etc. Design. Stoicism should be considered a tool which could aid you in these things. For example, I think 99% of entrepreneurship is courage. Stoicism could help you with that. I also think with design, great design is also 99% courage, having the courage to attempt something that won’t sell or be received well… stoicism is all about practical courage. The only designers with courage include Steve Jobs, Jony Ive, Elon Musk, Kanye West. ￼ Also, weightlifting. To attempt to lift a certain weight you have never attempted before takes great courage. For example, me atlas lifting 1000 pounds; that is 10 plates and a 25 on each side, ￼￼￼this is true stoic training. Why? The fear of injury is what holds most people back; if you had successfully conquered this fear and not injured yourself, this is pure stoic bliss. I think the only and the only proper way to lift weights is one repetition maximum training. That is; what is the maximum amount of weight you’re able to successfully lift or move, even half an inch? To me, the courage is the success. Even if you had the courage to attempt it… that is what is considered success. ￼￼ Simple exercises to do include the atlas lift, innovated by ERIC KIM, or a one repetition max rack pull. Or, a high trap bar deadlift, heavy Farmer’s walks, or heavy sandbag carries. Or even a simple thing you could do is go to the park or to the local nature center, find the biggest rock there and just see if you could pick it up. If you’re interested in stoicism, and have had some interesting thoughts on stoicism, one of the most noble things you could do is start your own blog. I think blogs are 1000 times more effective than publishing some sort of static printed book; I think the problem in today’s world is that everyone is seeking some sort of legitimacy by being picked up by some sort of legitimate publisher and getting “published“, and seeing your printed book at Barnes & Noble whatever. I say it is better to be open source, free and permissionless, ￼￼￼decentralized. Just publish your thoughts and book as a free PDF, and just host it on dropbox, Google Drive, or your own web server. Share the link freely, and also just publish the raw text as a big blog post. ￼ Even Sam Bankman-Fried wisely thought; 99.9% of books could just be summarized as big blog posts. Don’t trust any modern day published book which isn’t free, because… there is some sort of hidden clout chasing somewhere. ￼ Even one of the worst compromises that led to the demise of Ray Dalio was the fact that he took his Principles book, which was essentially a free ebook PDF on his website, and then took it off, because I think he got a book deal with Simon and Schuster. After he did that, he lost my respect. If you’re already independently wealthy, and you don’t crowd source your self-esteem… why would you need to externally validate yourself by getting some sort of constipated publisher and annoying editor? Editors are bad. Start your own blog and start blogging your own thoughts on stoic philosophy, and even start a YouTube channel and start vlogging on it. ￼￼My generalized thought is simple: if your thought your idea your blog post your video or whatever could even impact the life of one other human being on planet earth… it is worth it. ERIC What is the secret to the maximum amount of happiness in life? The maximum amount of danger. (Nietzsche).

Title: Trump threatens 25% tax on Apple unless iPhones are made in U.S.

By JOSH BOAK, The Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday threatened a 50% tax on all imports from the European Union as well a 25% tariff on Apple products unless iPhones are made in America. The threats, delivered over social media, reflect Trump’s ability to disrupt the global economy with a burst of typing, as well as the reality that his tariffs have yet to produce the trade deals he is seeking or the return of domestic manufacturing he has promised voters. The Republican president said he wants to charge higher import taxes on goods from the EU, a long-standing U.S. ally, than from China, a geopolitical rival that had its tariffs cut to 30% this month so Washington and Beijing could hold negotiations. Trump was upset by the lack of progress in trade talks with the EU, which has proposed mutually cutting tariffs to zero even as the president has publicly insisted on preserving a baseline 10% tax on most imports. “Our discussions with them are going nowhere!” Trump posted on Truth Social. “Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025. There is no Tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States.” That post had been preceded by a threat of import taxes against Apple for its plans to continue making its iPhone in Asia. Apple joins Amazon, Walmart and other major U.S. companies in the White House’s crosshairs as they try to respond to the uncertainty and inflationary pressures unleashed by his tariffs. “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump wrote. “If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.” The statement by Trump is critical in that he suggests the company itself would bear the price of tariffs, contradicting his earlier claims as he rolled out a series of aggressive tariffs over the past several months that foreign countries would shoulder the cost of the import taxes. In general, importers pay the tariffs and the costs are often passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices. In response to Trump’s tariffs on China, Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month that most iPhones sold in the U.S. during the current fiscal quarter would come from India, with iPads and other devices being imported from Vietnam. After Trump rolled out tariffs in April, bank analysts estimated that a $1,200 iPhone would if made in America jump in price anywhere from $1,500 to $3,500. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to provide some clarity on Trump’s postings in a Friday interview on the Fox News show “America’s Newsroom.” Bessent said the EU has a “collective action problem” because its 27 member states are being represented by “this one group in Brussels,” such that the “underlying countries don’t even know what the EU is negotiating on their behalf.” The Treasury secretary said he was not in a White House meeting this week that Cook attended, but he also spoke with the Apple CEO this week. Bessent said the goal was to have Apple bring more of its computer chip supply chain into the U.S. The core of Trump’s argument against the EU is that America runs a “totally unacceptable” trade deficit with the 27 member states. Countries run trade deficits when they import more goods than they export. From the vantage point of the EU’s executive commission, trade with the U.S. is roughly in balance if both goods and services are included. As a global center for finance and technology, the U.S. runs a trade surplus in services with Europe. That offsets some of the trade gap in goods and puts the imbalance at 48 billion euros ($54 billion). German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said the EU’s executive commission has his country’s full support in working to “preserve our access to the American market.” “I think such tariffs help no one, but would just lead to economic development in both markets suffering,” Wadephul said in Berlin. “So we are still counting on negotiations, and support the European Commission in defending Europe and the European market while at the same time working on persuasion in America.” Trump aides have said the goal of his tariffs was to isolate China and strike new agreements with allies, but the president’s tariff threats undermine the logic of those claims. Not only could the EU face higher tariffs than China, but the bloc of member states might have been better off by establishing a broad front with China and other countries against Trump’s trade policy, said German economist Marcel Fratscher. “The strategy of the EU Commission and Germany in the trade conflict with Trump is a total failure,” Fratscher, the head of the German Institute for Economic Research, said on X. “This was a failure you could see coming — Trump sees Europe’s wavering, hesitation and concessions as the weaknesses that they are.” Trump has run hot and cold on his relationship with Apple, a sign that currying favor with him might not necessarily shield a company from his anger. He has essentially told companies such as Walmart to “eat” the costs of his tariffs instead of raising prices, even though doing so could squeeze profits and cause layoffs. He now appears to deploying a similar degree of pressure to force Apple to accept the higher costs of relocating its supply chains. Trump had previously created an exemption on electronics imported from China to help companies such as Apple, something he could now remove. He also threatened separate 25% import taxes on computer chips and could have the tariffs schedule rewritten in ways that could expose Apple products to the taxes. Until recently, the U.S. president repeatedly bragged about the $500 billion that Apple in February pledged to invest domestically as part of its development of artificial intelligence technologies. But he publicly turned against the company last week while speaking in Qatar. If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

Title: The Gen Z Right Is Pat Buchanan’s Lasting Legacy

Skip to comments. Posted on 05/23/2025 8:00:19 AM PDT by Angelino97 On December 2, 2023, in the modest gymnasium of a community college in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, President Donald Trump addressed a raucous crowd of supporters. As he spoke about the enduring force of the movement he ignited in 2015, he paused to reflect on a man many had forgotten—but whose ideas are increasingly animating the rising generation of conservatives. “You know there was a man, Pat Buchanan, a good guy, a conservative guy,” Trump began. A sudden, collective cheer erupted from the left side of the stage—unmistakably youthful, unexpected in tone. “Wow! Young people, they know him,” Trump responded with a mix of surprise and amusement. The cheering came from a group of College Republicans—mostly young Midwestern men. They represented more than just campus enthusiasm. They were the surface current of a deeper, surging tide within the American right: a generation of young conservatives who have not merely rejected progressive orthodoxy, but who have turned their backs on the neutered, market-centric consensus that long dominated Republican politics. Their affinities lie not with Reaganite optimism or Bush-era globalism, but with the sobering, culture-first realism of Pat Buchanan. These are the heirs to the original Buchanan Brigade, animated by a blend of cultural traditionalism, economic nationalism, and a deep-seated skepticism toward America’s post–Cold War trajectory. They’re not interested in conserving the status quo. They want to recover something lost. Three developments define the social fabric of 21st-century America: the triumph of multiculturalism, the commodification of the consumer, and the cultural conquest of the Left. For decades, neither major party offered a meaningful response. Democrats embraced the transformation; Republicans timidly adjusted to it. In the 1990s, Buchanan was virtually alone in warning that the West was in decline—culturally, spiritually, and economically. The relative prosperity and comfort of the ’90s muffled his prophecy, and few listened. Then came the Great Recession. For millions of Americans, it was more than an economic downturn—it was the unveiling of a deeper, festering crisis. Young people, in particular, felt it viscerally. The America they inherited no longer resembled the country celebrated in their parents’ stories or history books. The economy seemed rigged, the culture foreign, and the future grim. By the time Donald Trump descended the escalator in 2015, a vanguard of young men had already begun rejecting the stale dogmas of Conservatism, Inc. They were the ideological foot soldiers of Trump’s first campaign—angry, disillusioned, and increasingly well-read. What started as a populist rebellion quickly matured into something more coherent. Tax cuts and platitudes about the Constitution no longer sufficed. Legal immigration was no longer seen as harmless. Endless foreign aid and wars of choice were now understood as betrayals—not of international obligations, but of national ones. The refrain “Democrats are the real racists” gave way to “Stop playing by the Left’s rules.” Conservatism, these young rebels concluded, should not exist to preserve the wreckage of liberalism—it should stand to restore greatness. It is no surprise, then, that Buchanan’s The Death of the West has become a sacred text among this emerging young right. In an era when most of their peers don’t read, these young conservatives have made it required reading. It has even shaped elected officials. The third-youngest vice president in U.S. history—himself a product of the Midwestern populist realignment—publicly cited Buchanan’s work as formative in 2021 during an interview with David Freiheit. This revival of Buchananite thought has unnerved many in the conservative establishment. The backlash has come not just from the left, but from within the right—from those who seek to redefine conservatism as a more polite version of liberalism. Joel Berry of The Babylon Bee, for example, dismissed the “Pat Buchanan Right” as radicals, himself seemingly more comfortable cracking Reagan-inflected jokes than grappling with the real challenges faced by today’s young workers, parents, and future homeowners. But the old consensus is crumbling. The new generation doesn’t want talking points; they want answers. They see through the empty gestures of conservative influencers who quote the Founders one minute and promote materialism the next. The polite right has had its time—and failed. While Trump may be the most visible beneficiary of Buchanan’s intellectual legacy, the future belongs to those young men and women now entering the institutions of politics, media, and civic life. Their influence will not be limited to elections, but to the cultural soil out of which political movements grow. Buchanan was once a lone voice, a dissident within his own party. Today, his ideas no longer echo in isolation. They resound in lecture halls, in podcasts, in online reading groups, and in quiet conversations among friends questioning what went wrong with the American dream. It is likely that Buchanan will not live to see the full fruit of this realignment. But it is his vision—of a nation rooted in faith, heritage, and cultural continuity—that may yet shape the American right for decades to come. This is his final, and perhaps most enduring, gift to the country he tried so long to save.

He didn't start out that way... The school of hard knocks and firsthand experiences changed his point of view. And when the ADF and associated groups and individuals tried to “cancel” him before that was a widespread phenomenon... he gave back as good as he got. This is an example of what happens when people and groups try to shut down a strong personality using every dirty trick in the book after the person made relevant observations and conclusions that were found to be distasteful to the accepted consensus. Buchanan had many Jewish friends, associates and staff. He was never accused of discriminating against individuals, but he was not afraid to speak the truth about history or current events regardless of whether it was politically correct or not. Rabbi Yahuda Levin of New York, served as one of Buchanan's four campaign co-chairmen during his presidential campaign and took a lot of heat for this. He said, “I don't have to be married to him or believe everything he says” and then went on to defend Buchanan as a person and his policies. One of my closest friends from childhood is Jewish and he can rail on and on about issues that we disagree on and I still love him. I was once talking to a guy who was sitting next to me on an airline flight. I told him that my friend was always very sensitive to any form of Jewish stereotype but that the older he got the more he resembled them. This was meant to be a humorous observation. But the person I was speaking to turned out to be a Jewish lawyer and he took great offense to this innocuous observation. He condemned me and said that I was a bad person.

A sudden, collective cheer erupted from the left side of the stage—unmistakably youthful, unexpected in tone. “Wow! Young people, they know him,” Trump responded with a mix of surprise and amusement. The cheering came from a group of College Republicans—mostly young Midwestern men. They represented more than just campus enthusiasm. They were the surface current of a deeper, surging tide within the American right: a generation of young conservatives who have not merely rejected progressive orthodoxy, but who have turned their backs on the neutered, market-centric consensus that long dominated Republican politics. Their affinities lie not with Reaganite optimism or Bush-era globalism, but with the sobering, culture-first realism of Pat Buchanan. These are the heirs to the original Buchanan Brigade, animated by a blend of cultural traditionalism, economic nationalism, and a deep-seated skepticism toward America’s post–Cold War trajectory. They’re not interested in conserving the status quo. They want to recover something lost. Three developments define the social fabric of 21st-century America: the triumph of multiculturalism, the commodification of the consumer, and the cultural conquest of the Left. For decades, neither major party offered a meaningful response. Democrats embraced the transformation; Republicans timidly adjusted to it. In the 1990s, Buchanan was virtually alone in warning that the West was in decline—culturally, spiritually, and economically. The relative prosperity and comfort of the ’90s muffled his prophecy, and few listened. Then came the Great Recession. For millions of Americans, it was more than an economic downturn—it was the unveiling of a deeper, festering crisis. Young people, in particular, felt it viscerally. The America they inherited no longer resembled the country celebrated in their parents’ stories or history books. The economy seemed rigged, the culture foreign, and the future grim. By the time Donald Trump descended the escalator in 2015, a vanguard of young men had already begun rejecting the stale dogmas of Conservatism, Inc. They were the ideological foot soldiers of Trump’s first campaign—angry, disillusioned, and increasingly well-read. What started as a populist rebellion quickly matured into something more coherent. Tax cuts and platitudes about the Constitution no longer sufficed. Legal immigration was no longer seen as harmless. Endless foreign aid and wars of choice were now understood as betrayals—not of international obligations, but of national ones. The refrain “Democrats are the real racists” gave way to “Stop playing by the Left’s rules.” Conservatism, these young rebels concluded, should not exist to preserve the wreckage of liberalism—it should stand to restore greatness. It is no surprise, then, that Buchanan’s The Death of the West has become a sacred text among this emerging young right. In an era when most of their peers don’t read, these young conservatives have made it required reading. It has even shaped elected officials. The third-youngest vice president in U.S. history—himself a product of the Midwestern populist realignment—publicly cited Buchanan’s work as formative in 2021 during an interview with David Freiheit. This revival of Buchananite thought has unnerved many in the conservative establishment. The backlash has come not just from the left, but from within the right—from those who seek to redefine conservatism as a more polite version of liberalism. Joel Berry of The Babylon Bee, for example, dismissed the “Pat Buchanan Right” as radicals, himself seemingly more comfortable cracking Reagan-inflected jokes than grappling with the real challenges faced by today’s young workers, parents, and future homeowners. But the old consensus is crumbling. The new generation doesn’t want talking points; they want answers. They see through the empty gestures of conservative influencers who quote the Founders one minute and promote materialism the next. The polite right has had its time—and failed. While Trump may be the most visible beneficiary of Buchanan’s intellectual legacy, the future belongs to those young men and women now entering the institutions of politics, media, and civic life. Their influence will not be limited to elections, but to the cultural soil out of which political movements grow. Buchanan was once a lone voice, a dissident within his own party. Today, his ideas no longer echo in isolation. They resound in lecture halls, in podcasts, in online reading groups, and in quiet conversations among friends questioning what went wrong with the American dream. It is likely that Buchanan will not live to see the full fruit of this realignment. But it is his vision—of a nation rooted in faith, heritage, and cultural continuity—that may yet shape the American right for decades to come. This is his final, and perhaps most enduring, gift to the country he tried so long to save.

In the 1990s, Buchanan was virtually alone in warning that the West was in decline—culturally, spiritually, and economically. The relative prosperity and comfort of the ’90s muffled his prophecy, and few listened. Then came the Great Recession. For millions of Americans, it was more than an economic downturn—it was the unveiling of a deeper, festering crisis. Young people, in particular, felt it viscerally. The America they inherited no longer resembled the country celebrated in their parents’ stories or history books. The economy seemed rigged, the culture foreign, and the future grim. By the time Donald Trump descended the escalator in 2015, a vanguard of young men had already begun rejecting the stale dogmas of Conservatism, Inc. They were the ideological foot soldiers of Trump’s first campaign—angry, disillusioned, and increasingly well-read. What started as a populist rebellion quickly matured into something more coherent. Tax cuts and platitudes about the Constitution no longer sufficed. Legal immigration was no longer seen as harmless. Endless foreign aid and wars of choice were now understood as betrayals—not of international obligations, but of national ones. The refrain “Democrats are the real racists” gave way to “Stop playing by the Left’s rules.” Conservatism, these young rebels concluded, should not exist to preserve the wreckage of liberalism—it should stand to restore greatness. It is no surprise, then, that Buchanan’s The Death of the West has become a sacred text among this emerging young right. In an era when most of their peers don’t read, these young conservatives have made it required reading. It has even shaped elected officials. The third-youngest vice president in U.S. history—himself a product of the Midwestern populist realignment—publicly cited Buchanan’s work as formative in 2021 during an interview with David Freiheit. This revival of Buchananite thought has unnerved many in the conservative establishment. The backlash has come not just from the left, but from within the right—from those who seek to redefine conservatism as a more polite version of liberalism. Joel Berry of The Babylon Bee, for example, dismissed the “Pat Buchanan Right” as radicals, himself seemingly more comfortable cracking Reagan-inflected jokes than grappling with the real challenges faced by today’s young workers, parents, and future homeowners. But the old consensus is crumbling. The new generation doesn’t want talking points; they want answers. They see through the empty gestures of conservative influencers who quote the Founders one minute and promote materialism the next. The polite right has had its time—and failed. While Trump may be the most visible beneficiary of Buchanan’s intellectual legacy, the future belongs to those young men and women now entering the institutions of politics, media, and civic life. Their influence will not be limited to elections, but to the cultural soil out of which political movements grow. Buchanan was once a lone voice, a dissident within his own party. Today, his ideas no longer echo in isolation. They resound in lecture halls, in podcasts, in online reading groups, and in quiet conversations among friends questioning what went wrong with the American dream. It is likely that Buchanan will not live to see the full fruit of this realignment. But it is his vision—of a nation rooted in faith, heritage, and cultural continuity—that may yet shape the American right for decades to come. This is his final, and perhaps most enduring, gift to the country he tried so long to save.

This is an example of what happens when people and groups try to shut down a strong personality using every dirty trick in the book after the person made relevant observations and conclusions that were found to be distasteful to the accepted consensus. Buchanan had many Jewish friends, associates and staff. He was never accused of discriminating against individuals, but he was not afraid to speak the truth about history or current events regardless of whether it was politically correct or not. Rabbi Yahuda Levin of New York, served as one of Buchanan's four campaign co-chairmen during his presidential campaign and took a lot of heat for this. He said, “I don't have to be married to him or believe everything he says” and then went on to defend Buchanan as a person and his policies. One of my closest friends from childhood is Jewish and he can rail on and on about issues that we disagree on and I still love him. I was once talking to a guy who was sitting next to me on an airline flight. I told him that my friend was always very sensitive to any form of Jewish stereotype but that the older he got the more he resembled them. This was meant to be a humorous observation. But the person I was speaking to turned out to be a Jewish lawyer and he took great offense to this innocuous observation. He condemned me and said that I was a bad person. This foot in the mouth moment was actually quite humorous to me and this guy worked himself into a tizzy over basically nothing. Jewish people love to argue which is a trait in my own heritage, but in this case the other person despite his great intelligence seemingly had no ability for any form of introspection. 16 posted on 05/23/2025 9:03:42 AM PDT by fireman15 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: dragnet2 Tony Brown’s Journal on PBS was the ‘intellectual black’.

These are the heirs to the original Buchanan Brigade, animated by a blend of cultural traditionalism, economic nationalism, and a deep-seated skepticism toward America’s post–Cold War trajectory. They’re not interested in conserving the status quo. They want to recover something lost.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Then came the Great Recession. For millions of Americans, it was more than an economic downturn—it was the unveiling of a deeper, festering crisis. Young people, in particular, felt it viscerally. The America they inherited no longer resembled the country celebrated in their parents’ stories or history books. The economy seemed rigged, the culture foreign, and the future grim. By the time Donald Trump descended the escalator in 2015, a vanguard of young men had already begun rejecting the stale dogmas of Conservatism, Inc. They were the ideological foot soldiers of Trump’s first campaign—angry, disillusioned, and increasingly well-read. What started as a populist rebellion quickly matured into something more coherent. Tax cuts and platitudes about the Constitution no longer sufficed. Legal immigration was no longer seen as harmless. Endless foreign aid and wars of choice were now understood as betrayals—not of international obligations, but of national ones. The refrain “Democrats are the real racists” gave way to “Stop playing by the Left’s rules.” Conservatism, these young rebels concluded, should not exist to preserve the wreckage of liberalism—it should stand to restore greatness. It is no surprise, then, that Buchanan’s The Death of the West has become a sacred text among this emerging young right. In an era when most of their peers don’t read, these young conservatives have made it required reading. It has even shaped elected officials. The third-youngest vice president in U.S. history—himself a product of the Midwestern populist realignment—publicly cited Buchanan’s work as formative in 2021 during an interview with David Freiheit. This revival of Buchananite thought has unnerved many in the conservative establishment. The backlash has come not just from the left, but from within the right—from those who seek to redefine conservatism as a more polite version of liberalism. Joel Berry of The Babylon Bee, for example, dismissed the “Pat Buchanan Right” as radicals, himself seemingly more comfortable cracking Reagan-inflected jokes than grappling with the real challenges faced by today’s young workers, parents, and future homeowners. But the old consensus is crumbling. The new generation doesn’t want talking points; they want answers. They see through the empty gestures of conservative influencers who quote the Founders one minute and promote materialism the next. The polite right has had its time—and failed. While Trump may be the most visible beneficiary of Buchanan’s intellectual legacy, the future belongs to those young men and women now entering the institutions of politics, media, and civic life. Their influence will not be limited to elections, but to the cultural soil out of which political movements grow. Buchanan was once a lone voice, a dissident within his own party. Today, his ideas no longer echo in isolation. They resound in lecture halls, in podcasts, in online reading groups, and in quiet conversations among friends questioning what went wrong with the American dream. It is likely that Buchanan will not live to see the full fruit of this realignment. But it is his vision—of a nation rooted in faith, heritage, and cultural continuity—that may yet shape the American right for decades to come. This is his final, and perhaps most enduring, gift to the country he tried so long to save.

Legal immigration was no longer seen as harmless. Endless foreign aid and wars of choice were now understood as betrayals—not of international obligations, but of national ones. The refrain “Democrats are the real racists” gave way to “Stop playing by the Left’s rules.” Conservatism, these young rebels concluded, should not exist to preserve the wreckage of liberalism—it should stand to restore greatness. It is no surprise, then, that Buchanan’s The Death of the West has become a sacred text among this emerging young right. In an era when most of their peers don’t read, these young conservatives have made it required reading. It has even shaped elected officials. The third-youngest vice president in U.S. history—himself a product of the Midwestern populist realignment—publicly cited Buchanan’s work as formative in 2021 during an interview with David Freiheit. This revival of Buchananite thought has unnerved many in the conservative establishment. The backlash has come not just from the left, but from within the right—from those who seek to redefine conservatism as a more polite version of liberalism. Joel Berry of The Babylon Bee, for example, dismissed the “Pat Buchanan Right” as radicals, himself seemingly more comfortable cracking Reagan-inflected jokes than grappling with the real challenges faced by today’s young workers, parents, and future homeowners. But the old consensus is crumbling. The new generation doesn’t want talking points; they want answers. They see through the empty gestures of conservative influencers who quote the Founders one minute and promote materialism the next. The polite right has had its time—and failed. While Trump may be the most visible beneficiary of Buchanan’s intellectual legacy, the future belongs to those young men and women now entering the institutions of politics, media, and civic life. Their influence will not be limited to elections, but to the cultural soil out of which political movements grow. Buchanan was once a lone voice, a dissident within his own party. Today, his ideas no longer echo in isolation. They resound in lecture halls, in podcasts, in online reading groups, and in quiet conversations among friends questioning what went wrong with the American dream. It is likely that Buchanan will not live to see the full fruit of this realignment. But it is his vision—of a nation rooted in faith, heritage, and cultural continuity—that may yet shape the American right for decades to come. This is his final, and perhaps most enduring, gift to the country he tried so long to save.

This is an example of what happens when people and groups try to shut down a strong personality using every dirty trick in the book after the person made relevant observations and conclusions that were found to be distasteful to the accepted consensus. Buchanan had many Jewish friends, associates and staff. He was never accused of discriminating against individuals, but he was not afraid to speak the truth about history or current events regardless of whether it was politically correct or not. Rabbi Yahuda Levin of New York, served as one of Buchanan's four campaign co-chairmen during his presidential campaign and took a lot of heat for this. He said, “I don't have to be married to him or believe everything he says” and then went on to defend Buchanan as a person and his policies. One of my closest friends from childhood is Jewish and he can rail on and on about issues that we disagree on and I still love him. I was once talking to a guy who was sitting next to me on an airline flight. I told him that my friend was always very sensitive to any form of Jewish stereotype but that the older he got the more he resembled them. This was meant to be a humorous observation. But the person I was speaking to turned out to be a Jewish lawyer and he took great offense to this innocuous observation. He condemned me and said that I was a bad person. This foot in the mouth moment was actually quite humorous to me and this guy worked himself into a tizzy over basically nothing. Jewish people love to argue which is a trait in my own heritage, but in this case the other person despite his great intelligence seemingly had no ability for any form of introspection. 16 posted on 05/23/2025 9:03:42 AM PDT by fireman15 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: dragnet2 Tony Brown’s Journal on PBS was the ‘intellectual black’.

The new generation doesn’t want talking points; they want answers. They see through the empty gestures of conservative influencers who quote the Founders one minute and promote materialism the next. The polite right has had its time—and failed. While Trump may be the most visible beneficiary of Buchanan’s intellectual legacy, the future belongs to those young men and women now entering the institutions of politics, media, and civic life. Their influence will not be limited to elections, but to the cultural soil out of which political movements grow. Buchanan was once a lone voice, a dissident within his own party. Today, his ideas no longer echo in isolation. They resound in lecture halls, in podcasts, in online reading groups, and in quiet conversations among friends questioning what went wrong with the American dream. It is likely that Buchanan will not live to see the full fruit of this realignment. But it is his vision—of a nation rooted in faith, heritage, and cultural continuity—that may yet shape the American right for decades to come. This is his final, and perhaps most enduring, gift to the country he tried so long to save.

But it is his vision—of a nation rooted in faith, heritage, and cultural continuity—that may yet shape the American right for decades to come. This is his final, and perhaps most enduring, gift to the country he tried so long to save. Pat was ok but he was very anti Israel/Jewish. God bless “Pitch fork” Pat.

Tesla (TSLA) might have been in the news recently for all the wrong reasons, but that’s not stopping Wedbush from issuing one of Wall Street’s most bullish calls on the company in months. In a note Friday morning, analyst Dan Ives raised Tesla’s price target from $350 to $500, saying “the golden age of autonomous is now on the doorstep for Tesla.” The price hike is part of Ives’ larger vision for the company: a possible $2 trillion market cap by the end of 2026 in a “bull case scenario.” The potential catalyst? The long-promised launch of Tesla’s robotaxi service, which CEO Elon Musk claims will debut in Austin by the end of June — a “key next chapter of growth,” according to Ives. Wedbush’s price hike reflects this “massive stage of valuation creation ahead.” But Wedbush’s vision of Tesla is less about cars and more about code. “We have never viewed Tesla simply as a car company,” Ives wrote. “Instead we have always viewed Musk and Tesla as a leading disruptive technology global player and the first part of this grand strategic vision has taken shape over the past 5 years.” Ives sees Tesla as a platform positioned to capitalize on the convergence of autonomous driving and AI — an “AI revolution” that could eventually put Tesla in the same league as Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Palantir (PLTR), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), OpenAI, and Alphabet (GOOGL). “We believe Tesla remains the most undervalued AI play in the market today,” Ives said. “The core focus for investors is the AI Revolution is now coming to Tesla...which will make Tesla one of the best pure plays on AI over the next decade.” Ives said AI and autonomous are worth at least $1 trillion for Tesla. And the “golden goose”? The EV-maker’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, which has recently been more broadly rolled out. Wedbush said the automaker could see FSD adoption rates rise past 50% “and change the financial model/margins for Tesla looking ahead.” Still, the road to autonomy is littered with setbacks. Tesla’s FSD system has faced regulatory scrutiny and safety concerns for years, although Ives speculated that the close ties between Musk and President Donald Trump could help pave the way for fewer regulatory hurdles. And Musk’s timelines for autonomous Teslas have come and gone without delivery; FSD remains driver-assist tech, requiring a human at the wheel. Tesla also isn’t alone in the robotaxi push — Alphabet’s Waymo and Uber (UBER) are still major contenders in the U.S., and China’s Baidu (BIDU) is pushing forward on robotaxis abroad. Still, Ives believes Tesla has a leg up on the competition. “Given its unmatched scale and scope globally,” he wrote, “we believe Tesla has the opportunity to own the autonomous market and down the road license its technology to other auto players both in the US and around the globe.” Wedbush maintains its “Outperform” rating on Tesla, even as Ives warned that the stock’s trajectory will be volatile. “Rome was not built in a day,” he wrote, “and neither will Tesla’s autonomous and robotics strategic vision.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Wedbush’s price hike reflects this “massive stage of valuation creation ahead.” But Wedbush’s vision of Tesla is less about cars and more about code. “We have never viewed Tesla simply as a car company,” Ives wrote. “Instead we have always viewed Musk and Tesla as a leading disruptive technology global player and the first part of this grand strategic vision has taken shape over the past 5 years.” Ives sees Tesla as a platform positioned to capitalize on the convergence of autonomous driving and AI — an “AI revolution” that could eventually put Tesla in the same league as Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Palantir (PLTR), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), OpenAI, and Alphabet (GOOGL). “We believe Tesla remains the most undervalued AI play in the market today,” Ives said. “The core focus for investors is the AI Revolution is now coming to Tesla...which will make Tesla one of the best pure plays on AI over the next decade.” Ives said AI and autonomous are worth at least $1 trillion for Tesla. And the “golden goose”? The EV-maker’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, which has recently been more broadly rolled out. Wedbush said the automaker could see FSD adoption rates rise past 50% “and change the financial model/margins for Tesla looking ahead.” Still, the road to autonomy is littered with setbacks. Tesla’s FSD system has faced regulatory scrutiny and safety concerns for years, although Ives speculated that the close ties between Musk and President Donald Trump could help pave the way for fewer regulatory hurdles. And Musk’s timelines for autonomous Teslas have come and gone without delivery; FSD remains driver-assist tech, requiring a human at the wheel. Tesla also isn’t alone in the robotaxi push — Alphabet’s Waymo and Uber (UBER) are still major contenders in the U.S., and China’s Baidu (BIDU) is pushing forward on robotaxis abroad. Still, Ives believes Tesla has a leg up on the competition. “Given its unmatched scale and scope globally,” he wrote, “we believe Tesla has the opportunity to own the autonomous market and down the road license its technology to other auto players both in the US and around the globe.” Wedbush maintains its “Outperform” rating on Tesla, even as Ives warned that the stock’s trajectory will be volatile. “Rome was not built in a day,” he wrote, “and neither will Tesla’s autonomous and robotics strategic vision.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Tesla (TSLA) might have been in the news recently for all the wrong reasons, but that’s not stopping Wedbush from issuing one of Wall Street’s most bullish calls on the company in months.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, May 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) and reminds investors of the July 11, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While Defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. The truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%. However, Defendants continued to make false, reassuring statements to investors concerning the extent of the cost increase and how that was accounted for in the Company’s full year guidance. The truth was further revealed on October 17, 2024, when Elevance announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, revealing that the Company had missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for the quarter by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Elevance further revealed that it was lowering EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Elevance’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: The best IEMs for gaming in 2025, tested and reviewed

By Chris Coke Published May 23, 2025 10:00 AM EDT We may earn revenue from the products available on this page and participate in affiliate programs. Learn more › I’ll tell you a secret: If you’re a gamer searching for the best sound quality for your games, you shouldn’t be looking at a gaming headset. Audio enthusiasts know that the best sound quality—for movies, games, and everything in between—comes from great headphones and in-ear monitors (IEMs). But when it comes to getting the the best isolation, audio, and comfort in a compact form factor, IEMs are the only way to go especially if you game on the go. If you’re on the hunt for an upgrade to your current headset and don’t mind using a separate microphone (at least, most of the time), there are lots of incredible options out there. I’ve been part of the IEM hobby for years and have done the hard work of testing dozens upon dozens of sets, on the hunt for the best of the best—like our top overall, the FiiO FA19. If you’re a gamer, this list is for you. I’ve been a gamer for as long as I can remember, cutting my teeth on the Atari 2600. In fact, I got my start in journalism writing about games for a number of small websites. In my adult life, I’ve fallen in love with the world of audio and IEMs in particular. I currently maintain an archive of over 100. Between my closet and storage spaces, I have around 30 pairs of headphones and have given away more gaming headsets than most people will in a lifetime. TL;DR: I love tech, I love gaming, and I love writing about the best picks for different types of people. This list represents my biggest hobbies, rolled into one. Chris Coke Why it made the cut: A customizable sound signature, great details, and a comfortable fit, the FA19 is tops for gaming. If you’re looking for the best of the best when it comes to gaming IEMs, the FiiO FA19 has you covered. This set doesn’t come cheap, but it’s an absolute banger for gaming and music alike. With its customizable sound signature, comfortable fit, and fantastic sound quality, it’s a stellar pick no matter what genre you’re gaming in. FiiO has been one of the biggest companies to watch for a number of years. Getting its start making portable digital audio players (DAPs) and amps, it has since expanded into IEMs, over-ear headphones, desktop amps and streaming media players, speakers, CD and cassette players, and that’s not even the full list. What’s even more impressive is that in most areas where it’s attempted to compete, it’s been able to offer high-quality options at prices that are comparatively quite reasonable. The FA19 is exactly such an option. It uses 10 balanced armatures per side and a shell 3D printed in medical-grade resin. It’s a comfortable fit, even as it offers 20 total speakers between its two earpieces, which usually necessitates a monster shell. The FA19 isn’t small, but it’s not uncomfortably large like many of its competitors are. That many drivers might seem excessive, but there’s a good reason for that excess. Each driver can concentrate on a particular frequency band, ensuring that none are pushed beyond their limits and that distortion is never a concern. Just as importantly, for gaming, all of those drivers make it easier to hear each distinct detail in the environment around you. You’ll never have to worry about footsteps or enemy vehicles sneaking up on you because they got lost in the mix. The FA19 provides exceptionally good layering, so you’ll always be able to make out every unique element that makes up your soundscape. It has also allowed the acoustic engineers at FiiO to fine-tune both of its distinct sound signatures. While the FA19 is hardly the only pair of in-ear monitors to offer a tuning switch, it is one of the few where its addition makes a meaningful difference to the sound. Here, you’re given the option between a reference tuning that’s perfect for discerning small details and a hi-fi tuning that provides a more exciting sound signature with added bass and treble. When I tested these, I found that I preferred the hi-fi tuning for its added energy and that it still performed well even in competitive shooters. For the utmost clarity, its reference option makes for a great alternative. And, surprise, surprise (not really), they are fantastic for music. It comes with a modular cable that supports a standard 3.5mm single-ended connection, as well as a 4.4mm Pentaconn connection for balanced sources, so you should be able to connect to everything from your motherboard to prestigious audiophile hardware (I recommend using a dedicated DAC for the best listening experience). When I’m not gaming with them, I’m using them to play guitar on stage with my church for a clean monitor mix. The only thing they lack is a microphone and a more accessible price point. But with the exception of only a few options in the IEM world, you’ll need to provide your own microphone anyway, so it’s hard to be too critical of this point. Overall, the FiiO FA19 is a pricey but outstanding pair of IEMs. They’re exceptional for gaming. And just about everything else, if you can afford them, they’re an easy recommendation. Tony Ware Why it made the cut: An expansive, holographic soundstage with impressively precise imaging offers strong spatial awareness in competitive gaming. The Kiwi Ears Aether carves a niche with a deft touch, walking the sonic tightrope between analytical precision and atmospheric immersion. These IEMs offer a soundstage that punches above their price point—an expansive, layered field that critics and users alike describe as impressively holographic. It’s not just wide; it’s well-structured, delivering the kind of positional accuracy that audiophiles crave and gamers covet. For music, the Aether’s oversized 15.3mm planar-magnetic diaphragms impress with articulate mids and a tight low end—clean enough for complex jazz arrangements, yet warm enough to give synth-heavy ambient tracks a sense of emotional heft. Highs shimmer without searing, providing detail without fatigue, a characteristic that makes long listening sessions a joy rather than a chore. The soundstage—wide, tall, and deep—creates breathing room for instruments, giving the illusion of space that’s more reminiscent of open-back headphones than a pair of IEMs. But where the Aether really surprises is in gaming mayhem. Footstep tracking in FPS titles is intuitive, thanks to that same dimensional clarity. Environmental cues and directional insights feel more vivid, not just heard but placed—a rare trait in IEMs under $500. Some might perceive a dip in sub-bass impact compared to bass-heavy sets (like the Kiwi Ears x HBB Punch), but it’s a tradeoff that benefits overall transitions and transparency. There’s a cohesion, a refinement to the sound throughout the frequency range, thanks to the single-driver, crossover-free setup (the same reason dynamic driver fans love the low-profile Sennheiser IE 600). The Kiwi Ears Aether isn’t trying to win you over with bombast. It’s a refined, thoughtful performer—an IEM that feels just as at home in a playlist deep-dive as it does in a multiplayer skirmish. Turtle Beach Why it made the cut: This affordable pair of IEMs adds a microphone to the mix and a surprisingly good tuning. Look no further than the Turtle Beach Battle Buds for gaming performance on a budget. At only $30 MSRP and frequently available for less, these earbuds represent one of the best values in IEMs dedicated to gaming. Between its price, performance, and versatility, they’re one of the only pairs of affordable “gaming earbuds” I recommend comfortably. They’re a great value for gamers on a budget. While there are plenty of IEMs that offer in-line microphones, there are very few that feature dedicated boom mics, but that’s exactly what this has. It’s clearer and louder than most in-line mics due to its proximity to your mouth, and that comes in clutch when you need to strategize with your team. When it’s not needed, it simply unplugs from the left earpiece, allowing you to have less weight and improved comfort as needed. Turtle Beach wisely outfitted each earpiece with a silicone retention wing, similar to exercise earbuds, so even with the mic installed, its weight doesn’t get in the way of comfort and stability. The quality of that mic is also surprisingly good. Its closest competitor is the SteelSeries Tusq, which is significantly more expensive at around $50. To my ear, the Battle Buds offer clearer pick-up, though neither offers software enhancements on their own. Since they connect with a standard 3.5mm jack, however, they’re compatible with third-party software. My ASUS ROG Maximus Hero gaming motherboard was able to apply its enhancements without difficulty. The earbuds themselves sound fine, but their quality won’t blow your socks off. I was able to pick out footsteps easily enough, but the Battle Buds lack the impressive layering and soundstage of other options on this list. As the saying goes, you get what you pay for. But for $30 or less, they’re not bad and will let you hear everything you need to without distorting or making you cringe from sibilance. The simplicity of their design, being traditional wired earbuds, also makes them versatile to use with different gaming platforms. Essentially, if your gaming system has a 3.5mm jack, they’re going to work, so PC, Switch, PS5, and Xbox are all perfectly compatible. At the same time, there’s no built-in DAC to add extra features like surround sound that would usually come with gaming headsets. This is something to keep in mind for most IEMs, however, and even those that do include DACs rarely offer surround sound or gaming features. As with most budget audio products, there are some concessions you’ll need to make with the Turtle Beach Battle Buds, but for their price, they are a fantastic value for anyone who wants the fit and function of in-ear monitors with a dedicated boom mic. There are plenty of other options that are worth considering, especially if you have a particular feature or purpose in mind. Even if you look for the “best earbuds for esports,” you’ll still find dozens of options to sift through, so I recommend a few other, more specialized sets to anyone scouring the market. For esports, look no further than the ZiiGaat x Fresh Reviews Arete. This set was tuned by Fresh Reviews, a popular YouTuber specializing in finding the best IEMs, headphones, and mice for competitive gaming. Though the brand is still relatively new, it has made a good name for itself with its handful of releases so far. This particular set features a single dynamic driver and four balanced armatures and can deliver a full and detailed sound signature that is also enjoyable for music. Still, it’s clear that competitive gaming was at the forefront of the YouTuber’s mind throughout the design process. It can pull important details like footsteps out of the mix in a way that enhances your situational awareness without sounding tinny like some full-sized gaming headsets. Like most picks, you will need a separate microphone with the ZiiGatt x Fresh Reviews Arete, which is something to keep in mind before pulling the trigger. Because they support a standard detachable cable, however, it’s easy to replace with a different option that includes one, like the Antlion Kimura. If you’re interested in cutting the cord, look no further than the Arc 3 Gaming Earbuds from Cleer Audio. While this is technically a cheat—as earbuds and in-ear monitors aren’t the same thing, and open-ear true wireless earbuds are even more removed—but it’s hard to deny the multiplatform, multipoint tech on display here. Featuring 16.2mm graphene drivers suspended at the ear canal opening to beam expansive, optimized spatial audio into your head while you maintain situational awareness. You don’t want someone sneaking up on you in real life anymore than you do in a game. Cleer Audio While there are plenty of true wireless earbuds to choose from, most pair over standard Bluetooth, which isn’t suited for gaming thanks to its higher latency. The Arc 3 buds sidestep that entirely with an included USB Type-C 2.4GHz dongle for a dedicated, ultra-low 30ms latency connection. You can plug it directly into your PlayStation 4 or 5, Nintendo Switch, Meta Quest, or your PC and enjoy wired-like gaming with the ease and freedom of true wireless. The Arc 3 simultaneously features Bluetooth 5.4 with Snapdragon Sound (supporting SBC and AAC but also aptX Lossless and LDAC) for hi-res music listening or conversations on the go. Plus there’s a dedicated app to fine-tune its performance and sound, which includes an adaptive mode that adjusts the volume to your surroundings. Their case is a little bulkier than the Galaxy Buds Pro 3 or Apple AirPods Pro, but along with the built-in batteries in each earbud, they offer an impressive 50 hours of battery life. Plus, they’re tuned for gaming audio and Dolby Atmos surround sound, so whether you’re playing a competitive shooter or getting lost in your favorite RPG, these earbuds have something for everyone. Finally, we have an additional suggestion for getting lost in your game with a deep, realistic soundstage and distinct details that enhance your immersion. For strong intelligibility and accurate placement of elements, the 7Hz Timeless 2 is another killer pick. The original Timeless has become legendary in the IEM world as one of the first sets to really kick off the affordable planar-magnetic revolution. This successor was a long time coming, but the Timeless 2 has been well worth the wait. It smooths out the frequency response of the original while still maintaining its excellent detail retrieval and crisp, wide sound signature, though its circular ear shells may appear uncomfortable at first, rest assured that the inner faces are shaped normally to fit comfortably in most ears. This is a set that you can listen to for hours and forget the world with. The stock sound signature is vocal forward with a cooler midrange, but it also comes with a set of interchangeable nozzles to customize the sound signature; however, I would recommend avoiding these as the stock nozzle provides the most balanced sound overall. Choosing a great pair of in-ear monitors is never as straightforward as you’d like it to be, and when you add gaming performance to the mix, it can be even more confusing. But, with the right pair of IEMs, you’ll find a new world of sound quality opens up for you, and you’ll hear your games in a new way—a way that gaming headsets usually struggle to come close to. So, grab an external mic and get to business. Great gaming audio is a quality pair of IEMs away.

More Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Why would you want to pay 50x cash flow for Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock, when you can buy Nvidia at about the same price? Nvidia’s revenues are growing close to 100%, Microsoft’s at 15%. Yes, not 50%, but 15%. What’s worse - Nvidia’s cash flow margins are about 47%, almost 1.7x Microsoft’s margins. In other words, more of that top line growth that Nvidia gets - makes its way to free cash flow! Cash that can be reinvested or distributed to investors as return. Good thing, who can argue? But Nvidia comes with large risk. Our High Quality (HQ) portfolio diversifies away stock-specific risks while giving exposure to upside, and has outperformed the S&P 500, the Nasdaq, and Russell 2000 - and has clocked > 91% returns since inception. Well, you could argue - Microsoft is a known, stable game. For more than 40 years, this thing has been running like a machine. Nvidia’s phenomenal growth is recent - it might fizzle. AI might fizzle. Large AI models might fizzle - or worse, deemed unnecessary. Deepseek showed small models work just as well, right? They didn’t even use Nvidia’s latest chips. However, what are the odds that Nvidia’s chips will cease to be the hottest date in town? There lies the guesswork. Nvidia revenues grew more than 80% annually, on average, in the last 3 years - and last year grew more than 100%. Could this drop to 60% or 40% growth? It has to - soon! See: Buy or Sell Nvidia? Nvidia’s biggest customers are the likes of Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon. These companies, each of them, spent more than tens of billions last year on Nvidia chips. Can Microsoft, Google, and others continue to spend 100% MORE on Nvidia chips next year? And the year after? Can they do it while their own revenue grows only 15% annually? The answer is absolutely not. The Nvidia 80-100% growth music has to stop at some point. When this high pitched growth music stops, Nvidia’s valuation will drop. A lot. But then, it might continue at a slower pace, at 20-30%, not bad, but not ridiculously high either. Point is, that’s why buying a little bit of Microsoft is OK. It’s also why you build a portfolio. A resilient one. To balance risk-reward. We did it in spades with the Trefis High Quality (HQ) portfolio. Balancing risk-reward is how HQ outperformed the S&P 500, the Nasdaq, and Russell 2000. HQ outperformed all of them, and has clocked >91% returns since inception. That’s why you buy a little bit of Microsoft, or Google, META, Amazon, and perhaps even Edwards Lifesciences. Comparison as a tool: The purpose of comparing Microsoft with Nvidia is all about understanding the risk-reward tradeoff of an investment of interest, in this case Microsoft. In practice, investment decisions are about understanding relative attractiveness. Buy Microsoft stock or keep your money as interest earning cash? Or buy an ETF on the S&P 500? Is expected return on Microsoft stock more than that on cash - by how much? What’s the downside risk you bear to earn that extra return on Microsoft? Drawing contrast with a specific “anchor” asset, in this case Nvidia and Microsoft, serves as a powerful tool to assess the risk-reward tradeoff. Note: Always use an appropriate comparison for a ticker. Microsoft example was about “growth” and reasonably high valuation. A comparison with Nvidia provides interesting perspective as the stock offers much more at a similar valuation (FCF based) - but also carries with it, a huge downside risk. It is exactly this downside risk, versus relative upside tradeoffs we made - at scale, in constructing the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio. With a selection of 30 stocks, it has demonstrated a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the past 4-year span. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks achieved superior returns with reduced risk compared to the standard index, with a smoother performance evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

VANCOUVER, BC, May 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Equity Insider News Commentary – A new report from Philips reveals a growing divide between doctors and patients when it comes to AI in healthcare. While 63% of surveyed healthcare professionals believe AI can help improve outcomes, only 48% of patients share that optimism. As researchers explore what's needed for successful AI adoption in healthcare, major players in tech and biotech are already moving ahead—recent updates have come from Avant Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: AVAI), Renovaro Inc. (NASDAQ: RENB), Certara, Inc. (NASDAQ: CERT), CareCloud, Inc. (NASDAQ: CCLD), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT). Analysts at MarketsandMarkets expect the AI healthcare sector to grow at a 38.6% CAGR, topping $110 billion by 2030. Accenture goes even further, estimating AI could inject another $461 billion in added value by 2035—amplifying impact across a global healthcare system already on track to surpass $2.26 trillion. Analysts at MarketsandMarkets expect the AI healthcare sector to grow at a 38.6% CAGR, topping $110 billion by 2030. Accenture goes even further, estimating AI could inject another $461 billion in added value by 2035—amplifying impact across a global healthcare system already on track to surpass $2.26 trillion. Avant Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: AVAI), in partnership with Ainnova Tech, is positioning its Vision AI platform at the forefront of predictive healthcare. The company is in advanced discussions to acquire or exclusively license a patented early disease detection technology that could significantly enhance its diagnostic capabilities. If finalized, the deal would allow Vision AI to generate clinical insights even in the absence of a complete patient dataset—unlocking earlier intervention opportunities and supporting a more proactive model of care. "Our purpose is to create the future of early disease detection in an accessible way, so that patients can get a preventive check-up anywhere, at a low cost, and easily," said Vinicio Vargas, CEO at Ainnova and member of the Board of Directors of the joint venture company, Ai-nova Acquisition Corp. (AAC), said of AAC's aim to continue to add to its portfolio. "We want to prevent patients with risk factors from developing other diseases that could have been avoided before they became a real problem. To this end, we are seeking to integrate new technologies into our portfolio within a single platform, both through our R&D efforts and through potential exclusive licenses or acquisitions." The potential acquisition aligns with Avant and Ainnova's shared mission to deliver scalable, preventive health tools that merge retinal imaging, vital sign monitoring, and machine learning into one streamlined platform. Vision AI is already positioned as a next-generation diagnostic engine for chronic conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and kidney dysfunction. Now, the joint venture is pushing further—evaluating breakthrough technologies that could detect emerging health issues at a pre-symptomatic stage. Recent platform updates saw four proprietary algorithms—trained on over 2.3 million real-world clinical cases—fully integrated into Vision AI. The addition of new IP from this proposed deal would mark a significant leap forward, enabling predictive models to extract meaningful signals from even limited patient data. Avant and Ainnova view this initiative as part of a broader strategy to consolidate breakthrough tools that make early disease detection more scalable, mobile, and applicable across diverse healthcare settings. While a final agreement has yet to be announced, the companies have stated they will keep shareholders informed as developments progress. In parallel, Avant has entered formal discussions to acquire Ainnova outright—building on their existing alignment under the Ai-nova Acquisition Corp. (AAC) structure. The timing is deliberate, coming just ahead of a planned FDA pre-submission meeting this July. A completed merger would unify operations, reduce internal complexity, and bolster the joint venture's regulatory readiness as it prepares for potential U.S. market entry. "We believe bringing the two companies together will offer tremendous value for shareholders," said Vargas. "It will simplify the process of advancing our technology to market, and it will deliver value to our customers and partners as we promote our technology portfolio globally." At the center of this initiative is Vision AI—a non-invasive screening platform that integrates retinal imaging, vital sign monitoring, and machine-learning models to flag early indicators of chronic disease. The system targets conditions such as diabetic retinopathy, cardiovascular issues, kidney and liver disorders, and type 2 diabetes. Operated under the AAC structure, the joint venture holds global rights to Vision AI, which has demonstrated over 90% sensitivity in early detection based on research cited by the NIH. "This milestone reflects our two-tiered strategy, rapid deployment in low-regulation markets where Vision AI operates as a screening tool, and simultaneous progress toward FDA clearance for the U.S. market," said Vargas. "Entering the U.S. will unlock significant commercial potential, and early engagement with regulators ensures we do so with speed, credibility, and a validated product." While many AI healthcare platforms remain stuck in pilot stages, Avant's Vision AI is already live across multiple Latin American markets—including Chile, Mexico, and Brazil—where it's actively being used in clinical settings. These real-world deployments are generating essential data on safety and efficacy, while also providing user feedback that guides ongoing system improvements. To broaden its diagnostic reach, the Ai-nova joint venture recently integrated four additional algorithms into the platform. Each was trained on a dataset of more than 2.3 million clinical records, enhancing Vision AI's precision across a wider spectrum of chronic diseases. With active momentum abroad and U.S. regulatory discussions now underway, Avant's trajectory appears to be moving from early validation toward broader market penetration. CONTINUED...

Title: Why CEOs Should Develop AI Acumen To Lead In 2025 And Beyond

ByRussell Sarder ByRussell Sarder, Forbes Councils Member. Chairman & CEO Russell Sarder leads NetCom Learning with a mission to build a world of lifelong learners. Today’s CEOs face challenges their predecessors couldn’t have imagined. From ethical concerns to governance complexities and workforce upheaval, the stakes are high. To face these challenges, numerous industries, including supply chain management and customer service, are revolutionizing their workforces through the use of AI tools. In fact, studies show that as much as 30% of tasks in 60% of jobs (registration required) can be automated by AI. A few months ago, I caught up with a friend who is the CEO of a mid-sized tech firm. He had felt behind on AI integration, unsure of how to incorporate it into his business. But after diving into AI, he implemented it in his customer service operations. The result was a significant surge in customer satisfaction within months. This was a complete transformation, not just a small improvement. I believe this underscores a lesson we all need to internalize: Rather than being just another tool, AI is an important part of a competitive strategy in today's market. AI isn’t going away; rather, it's reshaping businesses. According to a Cisco study, 75% of leaders state confidence that AI will open new opportunities and disrupt their industry, and 83% already consider it a strategic necessity. I've witnessed in my own company how using AI-driven analytics to predict demand and optimize inventory can lead to reduced waste, cost savings and the ability to anticipate market trends. However, implementing AI effectively can be more challenging than leaders anticipate. According to a study, many are underprepared for the expected AI disruption to their industry: 62% of surveyed companies experience difficulties in cross-functional alignment during implementation, and 63% struggle to adjust workflows. What's more, research shows that "51% of IT leaders (registration required) cited governance and regulatory compliance challenges as their primary concern with AI initiatives." Integrating AI isn’t just about increasing efficiency—it can also help with differentiation. Think about Amazon. Its AI-driven recommendation algorithm doesn’t just suggest products—it predicts what you’ll want based on your browsing habits. That's part of why Amazon sales are sky-high. On the other hand, Nvidia suffered a $593 billion market value loss in a single day due to a competitive threat from DeepSeek, a Chinese AI innovator. DeepSeek’s energy-efficient AI model outpaced Nvidia’s, shifting the balance of power. Similarly, Intel’s failure to keep up in the AI chip market led to layoffs and a $10 billion reduction in capital spending. These losses emphasize both how AI is disrupting industries and how important it is for CEOs to prepare for this shift in order to protect market share and company valuation. In my experience, CEOs cannot afford to delegate AI knowledge. You need to grasp AI in order to make informed decisions about investments, AI models or governance frameworks. While 75% of executives rank AI among their top three strategic priorities, only 16% of organizations have met their AI-related goals. I believe this gap is because AI success hinges less on technology and more on the CEO's active, visible leadership. To bridge the gap, pursue AI literacy with intent. This means understanding what AI can and cannot do, as well as how it applies to your business. Start by exploring credible resources like online courses, executive programs and industry reports. I also recommend participating in roundtables, summits and AI governance forums to engage with evolving norms and practices. Understanding how AI may optimize interconnected functions requires more than simply installing a solution in one area of your company. For instance, by strategically incorporating AI into HR and Operations, you can potentially raise staff engagement and make your team more unified and effective. You can also leverage AI tools to promote comprehensive plans that improve multiple areas at once, such as improving customer satisfaction, streamlining processes and raising employee satisfaction levels. McKinsey’s 2025 analysis reveals a pronounced asymmetry: 13% of employees indicate that GenAI now comprises over 30% of their daily functions, yet C-suite leaders estimate that only 4% of their employees have reached that level. This disparity helps underscore the importance of education initiatives. In my experience, effective AI training begins by anchoring learning to real business impact. Strengthen your training frameworks by balancing conceptual grounding with applied experience. Initial sessions should introduce essential concepts, clarify the boundaries of what AI can and cannot do and address common misconceptions. From there, shift into practical immersion. Identify one high-impact area, like sales forecasting, customer support or inventory planning, and pilot a focused solution. Use that project as both proof of value and a learning vehicle. Once it has been validated, scale with discipline and with training embedded at each stage. Finally, training should be seen as an ongoing process. One common pitfall I've encountered is the assumption that early exposure is sufficient. Another is over-relying on third-party programs without building internal ownership. One of the most damaging missteps, however, is deploying AI technologies in production environments before equipping your teams to use them ethically, accurately and with contextual understanding. As Ben Cook, president of Acumen Learning, warns, "If you don’t understand the business, you have no business using AI." Today, the flip side is equally important: If you don’t understand AI, you could struggle to lead your business in 2025. To lead in the AI-driven future, I believe we, as CEOs, must experiment with AI, learn new things constantly and establish a strong foundation within our companies. The question isn’t if AI will reshape your industry—it’s whether you’ll be the disruptor or the disrupted. Forbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders. Do I qualify?

Title: Trump's tariffs threat hits Apple's sales

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday threatened a 50% tax on all imports from the European Union as well a 25% tariff on smartphones unless those products are made in America. The threats, delivered over social media, reflect Trump’s ability to disrupt the global economy with a burst of typing, as well as the reality that his tariffs have yet to produce the trade deals he is seeking or the return of domestic manufacturing he has promised voters. The Republican president said he wants to charge higher import taxes on goods from the EU, a longstanding US ally, than from China, a geopolitical rival that had its tariffs cut to 30% this month so Washington and Beijing could hold negotiations. Trump was upset by the lack of progress in trade talks with the EU, which has proposed mutually cutting tariffs to zero even as the president has publicly insisted on preserving a baseline 10% tax on most imports. “Our discussions with them are going nowhere!” Trump posted on Truth Social. “Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025. There is no Tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States.” Speaking later in the Oval Office, Trump stressed that he was not seeking a deal with the EU and might delay the tariffs if more companies invested in the United States. “I’m not looking for a deal,” Trump told the reporters. “We’ve set the deal. It’s at 50%.” The EU’s top trade official, Maros Sefcovic, posted on the social media site X that he spoke Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. “The EU’s fully engaged, committed to securing a deal that works for both,” Sefcovic said. “EU-US trade is unmatched & must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests.” All smartphones could be affected Trump’s tariffs against Europe had been preceded by a threat of import taxes against Apple for its plans to continue making its iPhone in Asia. Apple now joins Amazon, Walmart and other major U.S. companies in the White House’s crosshairs as they try to respond to the uncertainty and inflationary pressures unleashed by his tariffs. “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump wrote. “If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.” Trump later clarified his post to say that all smartphones made abroad would be taxed and the tariffs could be coming as soon as the end of June. “It would be also Samsung and anybody that makes that product,” Trump said. “Otherwise, it wouldn’t be fair.” The statements by Trump are critical in that he suggests the company itself would bear the price of tariffs, contradicting his earlier claims as he rolled out a series of aggressive tariffs over the past several months that foreign countries would shoulder the cost of the import taxes. In general, importers pay the tariffs and the costs are often passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices. In response to Trump’s tariffs on China, Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month that most iPhones sold in the U.S. during the current fiscal quarter would come from India, with iPads and other devices being imported from Vietnam. After Trump rolled out tariffs in April, bank analysts estimated that a $1,200 iPhone would if made in America jump in price anywhere from $1,500 to $3,500. Stocks sold off after Trump’s postings, with the S&P 500 index down roughly 0.67%. The markets have developed a hair-trigger sensitivity to the U.S. president’s statements, often slumping when he announces high tariffs and rallying when he retreats from those threats. US vs. EU U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to provide some clarity on Trump’s postings in a Friday interview on the Fox News show “America’s Newsroom.” Bessent said the EU has a “collective action problem” because its 27 member states are being represented by “this one group in Brussels,” such that the “underlying countries don’t even know what the EU is negotiating on their behalf.” The Treasury secretary said he was not in a White House meeting this week that Cook attended, but he also spoke with the Apple CEO this week. Bessent said the goal was to have Apple bring more of its computer chip supply chain into the U.S. The core of Trump’s argument against the EU is that America runs a “totally unacceptable” trade deficit with the 27 member states. Countries run trade deficits when they import more goods than they export. From the vantage point of the EU’s executive commission, trade with the U.S. is roughly in balance if both goods and services are included. As a global center for finance and technology, the U.S. runs a trade surplus in services with Europe. That offsets some of the trade gap in goods and puts the imbalance at 48 billion euros ($54 billion). German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said the EU’s executive commission has his country’s full support in working to “preserve our access to the American market.” “I think such tariffs help no one, but would just lead to economic development in both markets suffering,” Wadephul said in Berlin. “So we are still counting on negotiations, and support the European Commission in defending Europe and the European market while at the same time working on persuasion in America.” Trump aides have said the goal of his tariffs was to isolate China and strike new agreements with allies, but the president’s tariff threats undermine the logic of those claims. Not only could the EU face higher tariffs than China, but the bloc of member states might have been better off by establishing a broad front with China and other countries against Trump’s trade policy, said German economist German economist Marcel Fratzscher. “The strategy of the EU Commission and Germany in the trade conflict with Trump is a total failure,” Fratscher, the head of the German Institute for Economic Research, said on X. “This was a failure you could see coming — Trump sees Europe’s wavering, hesitation and concessions as the weaknesses that they are.” Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the 50% tariffs on Europe are most likely a “negotiating ploy” by Trump, as he has previously retreated on tariffs after taking a hard line. She said Trump seems to believe that negotiations operate by going to a “threat point” that could risk self-harm to the U.S. just to demonstrate how serious he is, in hopes that doing so would produce an agreement. But Lovely said that in the long-run Trump’s approach “suggests that the U.S. is an unreliable trading partner, that it operates on whim, not on rule of law.” A history with Apple Trump has run hot and cold on his relationship with Apple, a sign that currying favor with him might not necessarily shield a company from his anger. He has essentially told companies such as Walmart to “eat” the costs of his tariffs instead of raising prices, even though doing so could squeeze profits and cause layoffs. He now appears to deploying a similar degree of pressure to force Apple to accept the higher costs of relocating its supply chains. Trump had previously created an exemption on electronics imported from China to help companies such as Apple, something he could now remove. He also threatened separate 25% import taxes on computer chips and could have the tariffs schedule rewritten in ways that could expose Apple products to the taxes. Until recently, the U.S. president repeatedly bragged about the $500 billion that Apple in February pledged to invest domestically as part of its development of artificial intelligence technologies. But he publicly turned against the company last week while speaking in Qatar. “I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump told the audience. “I said to him: ‘My friend, I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.’” Analysts have been skeptical that Apple could quickly shift device manufacturing to the U.S., mainly because it has spent decades embedding complex supply chains in China to feed the factories. But it also has the challenge of grappling with “the unpredictable nature of the current U.S. administration,” said Ben Wood, chief analyst at U.K.-based research firm CCS Insight. “At any moment, things can change overnight, making it extremely difficult for companies such as Apple to plan their business,” Wood said. “It seems that despite the best efforts of the Apple leadership team to lobby the U.S. administration to treat the iPhone more favorably, a curveball can come out of nowhere and derail any plans they have in place.” AP writers Paul Wiseman, David McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, Geir Moulson in Berlin and Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report.

We stand ready to defend our interests.” All smartphones could be affected Trump’s tariffs against Europe had been preceded by a threat of import taxes against Apple for its plans to continue making its iPhone in Asia. Apple now joins Amazon, Walmart and other major U.S. companies in the White House’s crosshairs as they try to respond to the uncertainty and inflationary pressures unleashed by his tariffs. “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump wrote. “If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.” Trump later clarified his post to say that all smartphones made abroad would be taxed and the tariffs could be coming as soon as the end of June. “It would be also Samsung and anybody that makes that product,” Trump said. “Otherwise, it wouldn’t be fair.” The statements by Trump are critical in that he suggests the company itself would bear the price of tariffs, contradicting his earlier claims as he rolled out a series of aggressive tariffs over the past several months that foreign countries would shoulder the cost of the import taxes. In general, importers pay the tariffs and the costs are often passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices. In response to Trump’s tariffs on China, Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month that most iPhones sold in the U.S. during the current fiscal quarter would come from India, with iPads and other devices being imported from Vietnam. After Trump rolled out tariffs in April, bank analysts estimated that a $1,200 iPhone would if made in America jump in price anywhere from $1,500 to $3,500. Stocks sold off after Trump’s postings, with the S&P 500 index down roughly 0.67%. The markets have developed a hair-trigger sensitivity to the U.S. president’s statements, often slumping when he announces high tariffs and rallying when he retreats from those threats. US vs. EU U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to provide some clarity on Trump’s postings in a Friday interview on the Fox News show “America’s Newsroom.” Bessent said the EU has a “collective action problem” because its 27 member states are being represented by “this one group in Brussels,” such that the “underlying countries don’t even know what the EU is negotiating on their behalf.” The Treasury secretary said he was not in a White House meeting this week that Cook attended, but he also spoke with the Apple CEO this week. Bessent said the goal was to have Apple bring more of its computer chip supply chain into the U.S. The core of Trump’s argument against the EU is that America runs a “totally unacceptable” trade deficit with the 27 member states. Countries run trade deficits when they import more goods than they export. From the vantage point of the EU’s executive commission, trade with the U.S. is roughly in balance if both goods and services are included. As a global center for finance and technology, the U.S. runs a trade surplus in services with Europe. That offsets some of the trade gap in goods and puts the imbalance at 48 billion euros ($54 billion). German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said the EU’s executive commission has his country’s full support in working to “preserve our access to the American market.” “I think such tariffs help no one, but would just lead to economic development in both markets suffering,” Wadephul said in Berlin. “So we are still counting on negotiations, and support the European Commission in defending Europe and the European market while at the same time working on persuasion in America.” Trump aides have said the goal of his tariffs was to isolate China and strike new agreements with allies, but the president’s tariff threats undermine the logic of those claims. Not only could the EU face higher tariffs than China, but the bloc of member states might have been better off by establishing a broad front with China and other countries against Trump’s trade policy, said German economist German economist Marcel Fratzscher. “The strategy of the EU Commission and Germany in the trade conflict with Trump is a total failure,” Fratscher, the head of the German Institute for Economic Research, said on X. “This was a failure you could see coming — Trump sees Europe’s wavering, hesitation and concessions as the weaknesses that they are.” Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the 50% tariffs on Europe are most likely a “negotiating ploy” by Trump, as he has previously retreated on tariffs after taking a hard line. She said Trump seems to believe that negotiations operate by going to a “threat point” that could risk self-harm to the U.S. just to demonstrate how serious he is, in hopes that doing so would produce an agreement. But Lovely said that in the long-run Trump’s approach “suggests that the U.S. is an unreliable trading partner, that it operates on whim, not on rule of law.” A history with Apple Trump has run hot and cold on his relationship with Apple, a sign that currying favor with him might not necessarily shield a company from his anger. He has essentially told companies such as Walmart to “eat” the costs of his tariffs instead of raising prices, even though doing so could squeeze profits and cause layoffs. He now appears to deploying a similar degree of pressure to force Apple to accept the higher costs of relocating its supply chains. Trump had previously created an exemption on electronics imported from China to help companies such as Apple, something he could now remove. He also threatened separate 25% import taxes on computer chips and could have the tariffs schedule rewritten in ways that could expose Apple products to the taxes. Until recently, the U.S. president repeatedly bragged about the $500 billion that Apple in February pledged to invest domestically as part of its development of artificial intelligence technologies. But he publicly turned against the company last week while speaking in Qatar. “I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump told the audience. “I said to him: ‘My friend, I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.’” Analysts have been skeptical that Apple could quickly shift device manufacturing to the U.S., mainly because it has spent decades embedding complex supply chains in China to feed the factories. But it also has the challenge of grappling with “the unpredictable nature of the current U.S. administration,” said Ben Wood, chief analyst at U.K.-based research firm CCS Insight. “At any moment, things can change overnight, making it extremely difficult for companies such as Apple to plan their business,” Wood said. “It seems that despite the best efforts of the Apple leadership team to lobby the U.S. administration to treat the iPhone more favorably, a curveball can come out of nowhere and derail any plans they have in place.” AP writers Paul Wiseman, David McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, Geir Moulson in Berlin and Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday threatened a 50% tax on all imports from the European Union as well a 25% tariff on smartphones unless those products are made in America. The threats, delivered over social media, reflect Trump’s ability to disrupt the global economy with a burst of typing, as well as the reality that his tariffs have yet to produce the trade deals he is seeking or the return of domestic manufacturing he has promised voters. The Republican president said he wants to charge higher import taxes on goods from the EU, a longstanding US ally, than from China, a geopolitical rival that had its tariffs cut to 30% this month so Washington and Beijing could hold negotiations. Trump was upset by the lack of progress in trade talks with the EU, which has proposed mutually cutting tariffs to zero even as the president has publicly insisted on preserving a baseline 10% tax on most imports. “Our discussions with them are going nowhere!” Trump posted on Truth Social. “Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025. There is no Tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States.” Speaking later in the Oval Office, Trump stressed that he was not seeking a deal with the EU and might delay the tariffs if more companies invested in the United States. “I’m not looking for a deal,” Trump told the reporters. “We’ve set the deal.

May 23, 2025 08:07 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, May 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

It’s at 50%.” The EU’s top trade official, Maros Sefcovic, posted on the social media site X that he spoke Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. “The EU’s fully engaged, committed to securing a deal that works for both,” Sefcovic said. “EU-US trade is unmatched & must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests.” All smartphones could be affected Trump's tariffs against Europe had been preceded by a threat of import taxes against Apple for its plans to continue making its iPhone in Asia. Apple now joins Amazon, Walmart and other major U.S. companies in the White House's crosshairs as they try to respond to the uncertainty and inflationary pressures unleashed by his tariffs. “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump wrote. “If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.” Trump later clarified his post to say that all smartphones made abroad would be taxed and the tariffs could be coming as soon as the end of June. “It would be also Samsung and anybody that makes that product,” Trump said. “Otherwise, it wouldn’t be fair.” The statements by Trump are critical in that he suggests the company itself would bear the price of tariffs, contradicting his earlier claims as he rolled out a series of aggressive tariffs over the past several months that foreign countries would shoulder the cost of the import taxes. In general, importers pay the tariffs and the costs are often passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices. In response to Trump’s tariffs on China, Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month that most iPhones sold in the U.S. during the current fiscal quarter would come from India, with iPads and other devices being imported from Vietnam. After Trump rolled out tariffs in April, bank analysts estimated that a $1,200 iPhone would if made in America jump in price anywhere from $1,500 to $3,500. Stocks sold off after Trump's postings, with the S&P 500 index down roughly 0.67%. The markets have developed a hair-trigger sensitivity to the U.S. president's statements, often slumping when he announces high tariffs and rallying when he retreats from those threats. US vs. EU U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to provide some clarity on Trump's postings in a Friday interview on the Fox News show “America's Newsroom.” Bessent said the EU has a “collective action problem” because its 27 member states are being represented by “this one group in Brussels,” such that the “underlying countries don’t even know what the EU is negotiating on their behalf.” The Treasury secretary said he was not in a White House meeting this week that Cook attended, but he also spoke with the Apple CEO this week. Bessent said the goal was to have Apple bring more of its computer chip supply chain into the U.S. The core of Trump's argument against the EU is that America runs a “totally unacceptable” trade deficit with the 27 member states. Countries run trade deficits when they import more goods than they export. From the vantage point of the EU's executive commission, trade with the U.S. is roughly in balance if both goods and services are included. As a global center for finance and technology, the U.S. runs a trade surplus in services with Europe. That offsets some of the trade gap in goods and puts the imbalance at 48 billion euros ($54 billion). German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said the EU's executive commission has his country’s full support in working to “preserve our access to the American market.” “I think such tariffs help no one, but would just lead to economic development in both markets suffering,” Wadephul said in Berlin. “So we are still counting on negotiations, and support the European Commission in defending Europe and the European market while at the same time working on persuasion in America.” Trump aides have said the goal of his tariffs was to isolate China and strike new agreements with allies, but the president's tariff threats undermine the logic of those claims. Not only could the EU face higher tariffs than China, but the bloc of member states might have been better off by establishing a broad front with China and other countries against Trump’s trade policy, said German economist Marcel Fratzscher. “The strategy of the EU Commission and Germany in the trade conflict with Trump is a total failure,” Fratzscher, the head of the German Institute for Economic Research, said on X. “This was a failure you could see coming — Trump sees Europe’s wavering, hesitation and concessions as the weaknesses that they are.” Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the 50% tariffs on Europe are most likely a “negotiating ploy” by Trump, as he has previously retreated on tariffs after taking a hard line. She said Trump seems to believe that negotiations operate by going to a “threat point” that could risk self-harm to the U.S. just to demonstrate how serious he is, in hopes that doing so would produce an agreement. But Lovely said that in the long-run Trump's approach “suggests that the U.S. is an unreliable trading partner, that it operates on whim, not on rule of law.” A history with Apple Trump has run hot and cold on his relationship with Apple, a sign that currying favor with him might not necessarily shield a company from his anger. He has essentially told companies such as Walmart to “eat” the costs of his tariffs instead of raising prices, even though doing so could squeeze profits and cause layoffs. He now appears to deploying a similar degree of pressure to force Apple to accept the higher costs of relocating its supply chains. Trump had previously created an exemption on electronics imported from China to help companies such as Apple, something he could now remove. He also threatened separate 25% import taxes on computer chips and could have the tariffs schedule rewritten in ways that could expose Apple products to the taxes. Until recently, the U.S. president repeatedly bragged about the $500 billion that Apple in February pledged to invest domestically as part of its development of artificial intelligence technologies. But he publicly turned against the company last week while speaking in Qatar. “I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump told the audience. “I said to him: ‘Tim, you're my friend. I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.'” Analysts have been skeptical that Apple could quickly shift device manufacturing to the U.S., mainly because it has spent decades embedding complex supply chains in China to feed the factories. But it also has the challenge of grappling with “the unpredictable nature of the current U.S. administration,” said Ben Wood, chief analyst at U.K.-based research firm CCS Insight. “At any moment, things can change overnight, making it extremely difficult for companies such as Apple to plan their business,” Wood said. “It seems that despite the best efforts of the Apple leadership team to lobby the U.S. administration to treat the iPhone more favorably, a curveball can come out of nowhere and derail any plans they have in place.” ___ AP writers Paul Wiseman, David McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, Geir Moulson in Berlin and Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday threatened a 50% tax on all imports from the European Union as well a 25% tariff on smartphones unless those products are made in America.The threats, delivered over social media, reflect Trump's ability to disrupt the global economy with a burst of typing, as well as the reality that his tariffs have yet to produce the trade deals he is seeking or the return of domestic manufacturing he has promised voters.The Republican president said he wants to charge higher import taxes on goods from the EU, a longstanding US ally, than from China, a geopolitical rival that had its tariffs cut to 30% this month so Washington and Beijing could hold negotiations. Trump was upset by the lack of progress in trade talks with the EU, which has proposed mutually cutting tariffs to zero even as the president has publicly insisted on preserving a baseline 10% tax on most imports.“Our discussions with them are going nowhere!” Trump posted on Truth Social. “Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025.

Apple now joins Amazon, Walmart and other major U.S. companies in the White House's crosshairs as they try to respond to the uncertainty and inflationary pressures unleashed by his tariffs.“I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump wrote. “If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.”Trump later clarified his post to say that all smartphones made abroad would be taxed and the tariffs could be coming as soon as the end of June.“It would be also Samsung and anybody that makes that product,” Trump said. “Otherwise, it wouldn’t be fair.”The statements by Trump are critical in that he suggests the company itself would bear the price of tariffs, contradicting his earlier claims as he rolled out a series of aggressive tariffs over the past several months that foreign countries would shoulder the cost of the import taxes. In general, importers pay the tariffs and the costs are often passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices.In response to Trump’s tariffs on China, Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month that most iPhones sold in the U.S. during the current fiscal quarter would come from India, with iPads and other devices being imported from Vietnam. After Trump rolled out tariffs in April, bank analysts estimated that a $1,200 iPhone would if made in America jump in price anywhere from $1,500 to $3,500.Stocks sold off after Trump's postings, with the S&P 500 index down roughly 0.67%. The markets have developed a hair-trigger sensitivity to the U.S. president's statements, often slumping when he announces high tariffs and rallying when he retreats from those threats.U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to provide some clarity on Trump's postings in a Friday interview on the Fox News show “America's Newsroom.”Bessent said the EU has a “collective action problem” because its 27 member states are being represented by “this one group in Brussels,” such that the “underlying countries don’t even know what the EU is negotiating on their behalf.”The Treasury secretary said he was not in a White House meeting this week that Cook attended, but he also spoke with the Apple CEO this week. Bessent said the goal was to have Apple bring more of its computer chip supply chain into the U.S.The core of Trump's argument against the EU is that America runs a “totally unacceptable” trade deficit with the 27 member states. Countries run trade deficits when they import more goods than they export.From the vantage point of the EU's executive commission, trade with the U.S. is roughly in balance if both goods and services are included. As a global center for finance and technology, the U.S. runs a trade surplus in services with Europe. That offsets some of the trade gap in goods and puts the imbalance at 48 billion euros ($54 billion).German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said the EU's executive commission has his country’s full support in working to “preserve our access to the American market.”“I think such tariffs help no one, but would just lead to economic development in both markets suffering,” Wadephul said in Berlin. “So we are still counting on negotiations, and support the European Commission in defending Europe and the European market while at the same time working on persuasion in America.”Trump aides have said the goal of his tariffs was to isolate China and strike new agreements with allies, but the president's tariff threats undermine the logic of those claims. Not only could the EU face higher tariffs than China, but the bloc of member states might have been better off by establishing a broad front with China and other countries against Trump’s trade policy, said German economist Marcel Fratzscher.“The strategy of the EU Commission and Germany in the trade conflict with Trump is a total failure,” Fratzscher, the head of the German Institute for Economic Research, said on X. “This was a failure you could see coming — Trump sees Europe’s wavering, hesitation and concessions as the weaknesses that they are.”Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the 50% tariffs on Europe are most likely a “negotiating ploy” by Trump, as he has previously retreated on tariffs after taking a hard line.She said Trump seems to believe that negotiations operate by going to a “threat point” that could risk self-harm to the U.S. just to demonstrate how serious he is, in hopes that doing so would produce an agreement.But Lovely said that in the long-run Trump's approach “suggests that the U.S. is an unreliable trading partner, that it operates on whim, not on rule of law.”Trump has run hot and cold on his relationship with Apple, a sign that currying favor with him might not necessarily shield a company from his anger. He has essentially told companies such as Walmart to “eat” the costs of his tariffs instead of raising prices, even though doing so could squeeze profits and cause layoffs. He now appears to deploying a similar degree of pressure to force Apple to accept the higher costs of relocating its supply chains.Trump had previously created an exemption on electronics imported from China to help companies such as Apple, something he could now remove. He also threatened separate 25% import taxes on computer chips and could have the tariffs schedule rewritten in ways that could expose Apple products to the taxes.Until recently, the U.S. president repeatedly bragged about the $500 billion that Apple in February pledged to invest domestically as part of its development of artificial intelligence technologies. But he publicly turned against the company last week while speaking in Qatar.“I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump told the audience. “I said to him: ‘Tim, you're my friend. I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.'”Analysts have been skeptical that Apple could quickly shift device manufacturing to the U.S., mainly because it has spent decades embedding complex supply chains in China to feed the factories. But it also has the challenge of grappling with “the unpredictable nature of the current U.S. administration,” said Ben Wood, chief analyst at U.K.-based research firm CCS Insight.“At any moment, things can change overnight, making it extremely difficult for companies such as Apple to plan their business,” Wood said. “It seems that despite the best efforts of the Apple leadership team to lobby the U.S. administration to treat the iPhone more favorably, a curveball can come out of nowhere and derail any plans they have in place.”___AP writers Paul Wiseman, David McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, Geir Moulson in Berlin and Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report. Speaking later in the Oval Office, Trump stressed that he was not seeking a deal with the EU and might delay the tariffs if more companies invested in the United States.“I’m not looking for a deal,” Trump told the reporters. “We’ve set the deal.

Apple now joins Amazon, Walmart and other major U.S. companies in the White House's crosshairs as they try to respond to the uncertainty and inflationary pressures unleashed by his tariffs.“I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump wrote. “If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.”Trump later clarified his post to say that all smartphones made abroad would be taxed and the tariffs could be coming as soon as the end of June.“It would be also Samsung and anybody that makes that product,” Trump said. “Otherwise, it wouldn’t be fair.”The statements by Trump are critical in that he suggests the company itself would bear the price of tariffs, contradicting his earlier claims as he rolled out a series of aggressive tariffs over the past several months that foreign countries would shoulder the cost of the import taxes. In general, importers pay the tariffs and the costs are often passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices.In response to Trump’s tariffs on China, Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month that most iPhones sold in the U.S. during the current fiscal quarter would come from India, with iPads and other devices being imported from Vietnam. After Trump rolled out tariffs in April, bank analysts estimated that a $1,200 iPhone would if made in America jump in price anywhere from $1,500 to $3,500.Stocks sold off after Trump's postings, with the S&P 500 index down roughly 0.67%. The markets have developed a hair-trigger sensitivity to the U.S. president's statements, often slumping when he announces high tariffs and rallying when he retreats from those threats.U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to provide some clarity on Trump's postings in a Friday interview on the Fox News show “America's Newsroom.”Bessent said the EU has a “collective action problem” because its 27 member states are being represented by “this one group in Brussels,” such that the “underlying countries don’t even know what the EU is negotiating on their behalf.”The Treasury secretary said he was not in a White House meeting this week that Cook attended, but he also spoke with the Apple CEO this week. Bessent said the goal was to have Apple bring more of its computer chip supply chain into the U.S.The core of Trump's argument against the EU is that America runs a “totally unacceptable” trade deficit with the 27 member states. Countries run trade deficits when they import more goods than they export.From the vantage point of the EU's executive commission, trade with the U.S. is roughly in balance if both goods and services are included. As a global center for finance and technology, the U.S. runs a trade surplus in services with Europe. That offsets some of the trade gap in goods and puts the imbalance at 48 billion euros ($54 billion).German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said the EU's executive commission has his country’s full support in working to “preserve our access to the American market.”“I think such tariffs help no one, but would just lead to economic development in both markets suffering,” Wadephul said in Berlin. “So we are still counting on negotiations, and support the European Commission in defending Europe and the European market while at the same time working on persuasion in America.”Trump aides have said the goal of his tariffs was to isolate China and strike new agreements with allies, but the president's tariff threats undermine the logic of those claims. Not only could the EU face higher tariffs than China, but the bloc of member states might have been better off by establishing a broad front with China and other countries against Trump’s trade policy, said German economist Marcel Fratzscher.“The strategy of the EU Commission and Germany in the trade conflict with Trump is a total failure,” Fratzscher, the head of the German Institute for Economic Research, said on X. “This was a failure you could see coming — Trump sees Europe’s wavering, hesitation and concessions as the weaknesses that they are.”Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the 50% tariffs on Europe are most likely a “negotiating ploy” by Trump, as he has previously retreated on tariffs after taking a hard line.She said Trump seems to believe that negotiations operate by going to a “threat point” that could risk self-harm to the U.S. just to demonstrate how serious he is, in hopes that doing so would produce an agreement.But Lovely said that in the long-run Trump's approach “suggests that the U.S. is an unreliable trading partner, that it operates on whim, not on rule of law.”Trump has run hot and cold on his relationship with Apple, a sign that currying favor with him might not necessarily shield a company from his anger. He has essentially told companies such as Walmart to “eat” the costs of his tariffs instead of raising prices, even though doing so could squeeze profits and cause layoffs. He now appears to deploying a similar degree of pressure to force Apple to accept the higher costs of relocating its supply chains.Trump had previously created an exemption on electronics imported from China to help companies such as Apple, something he could now remove. He also threatened separate 25% import taxes on computer chips and could have the tariffs schedule rewritten in ways that could expose Apple products to the taxes.Until recently, the U.S. president repeatedly bragged about the $500 billion that Apple in February pledged to invest domestically as part of its development of artificial intelligence technologies. But he publicly turned against the company last week while speaking in Qatar.“I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump told the audience. “I said to him: ‘Tim, you're my friend. I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.'”Analysts have been skeptical that Apple could quickly shift device manufacturing to the U.S., mainly because it has spent decades embedding complex supply chains in China to feed the factories. But it also has the challenge of grappling with “the unpredictable nature of the current U.S. administration,” said Ben Wood, chief analyst at U.K.-based research firm CCS Insight.“At any moment, things can change overnight, making it extremely difficult for companies such as Apple to plan their business,” Wood said. “It seems that despite the best efforts of the Apple leadership team to lobby the U.S. administration to treat the iPhone more favorably, a curveball can come out of nowhere and derail any plans they have in place.”___AP writers Paul Wiseman, David McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, Geir Moulson in Berlin and Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report. “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump wrote. “If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.”Trump later clarified his post to say that all smartphones made abroad would be taxed and the tariffs could be coming as soon as the end of June.“It would be also Samsung and anybody that makes that product,” Trump said. “Otherwise, it wouldn’t be fair.”The statements by Trump are critical in that he suggests the company itself would bear the price of tariffs, contradicting his earlier claims as he rolled out a series of aggressive tariffs over the past several months that foreign countries would shoulder the cost of the import taxes.

I don’t want you building in India.'”Analysts have been skeptical that Apple could quickly shift device manufacturing to the U.S., mainly because it has spent decades embedding complex supply chains in China to feed the factories. But it also has the challenge of grappling with “the unpredictable nature of the current U.S. administration,” said Ben Wood, chief analyst at U.K.-based research firm CCS Insight.“At any moment, things can change overnight, making it extremely difficult for companies such as Apple to plan their business,” Wood said. “It seems that despite the best efforts of the Apple leadership team to lobby the U.S. administration to treat the iPhone more favorably, a curveball can come out of nowhere and derail any plans they have in place.”___AP writers Paul Wiseman, David McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, Geir Moulson in Berlin and Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report. Stocks sold off after Trump's postings, with the S&P 500 index down roughly 0.67%. The markets have developed a hair-trigger sensitivity to the U.S. president's statements, often slumping when he announces high tariffs and rallying when he retreats from those threats.U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to provide some clarity on Trump's postings in a Friday interview on the Fox News show “America's Newsroom.”Bessent said the EU has a “collective action problem” because its 27 member states are being represented by “this one group in Brussels,” such that the “underlying countries don’t even know what the EU is negotiating on their behalf.”The Treasury secretary said he was not in a White House meeting this week that Cook attended, but he also spoke with the Apple CEO this week. Bessent said the goal was to have Apple bring more of its computer chip supply chain into the U.S.The core of Trump's argument against the EU is that America runs a “totally unacceptable” trade deficit with the 27 member states. Countries run trade deficits when they import more goods than they export.From the vantage point of the EU's executive commission, trade with the U.S. is roughly in balance if both goods and services are included. As a global center for finance and technology, the U.S. runs a trade surplus in services with Europe. That offsets some of the trade gap in goods and puts the imbalance at 48 billion euros ($54 billion).German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said the EU's executive commission has his country’s full support in working to “preserve our access to the American market.”“I think such tariffs help no one, but would just lead to economic development in both markets suffering,” Wadephul said in Berlin. “So we are still counting on negotiations, and support the European Commission in defending Europe and the European market while at the same time working on persuasion in America.”Trump aides have said the goal of his tariffs was to isolate China and strike new agreements with allies, but the president's tariff threats undermine the logic of those claims. Not only could the EU face higher tariffs than China, but the bloc of member states might have been better off by establishing a broad front with China and other countries against Trump’s trade policy, said German economist Marcel Fratzscher.“The strategy of the EU Commission and Germany in the trade conflict with Trump is a total failure,” Fratzscher, the head of the German Institute for Economic Research, said on X. “This was a failure you could see coming — Trump sees Europe’s wavering, hesitation and concessions as the weaknesses that they are.”Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the 50% tariffs on Europe are most likely a “negotiating ploy” by Trump, as he has previously retreated on tariffs after taking a hard line.She said Trump seems to believe that negotiations operate by going to a “threat point” that could risk self-harm to the U.S. just to demonstrate how serious he is, in hopes that doing so would produce an agreement.But Lovely said that in the long-run Trump's approach “suggests that the U.S. is an unreliable trading partner, that it operates on whim, not on rule of law.”Trump has run hot and cold on his relationship with Apple, a sign that currying favor with him might not necessarily shield a company from his anger. He has essentially told companies such as Walmart to “eat” the costs of his tariffs instead of raising prices, even though doing so could squeeze profits and cause layoffs.

Trump aides have said the goal of his tariffs was to isolate China and strike new agreements with allies, but the president's tariff threats undermine the logic of those claims. Not only could the EU face higher tariffs than China, but the bloc of member states might have been better off by establishing a broad front with China and other countries against Trump’s trade policy, said German economist Marcel Fratzscher.“The strategy of the EU Commission and Germany in the trade conflict with Trump is a total failure,” Fratzscher, the head of the German Institute for Economic Research, said on X. “This was a failure you could see coming — Trump sees Europe’s wavering, hesitation and concessions as the weaknesses that they are.”Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the 50% tariffs on Europe are most likely a “negotiating ploy” by Trump, as he has previously retreated on tariffs after taking a hard line.She said Trump seems to believe that negotiations operate by going to a “threat point” that could risk self-harm to the U.S. just to demonstrate how serious he is, in hopes that doing so would produce an agreement.But Lovely said that in the long-run Trump's approach “suggests that the U.S. is an unreliable trading partner, that it operates on whim, not on rule of law.”Trump has run hot and cold on his relationship with Apple, a sign that currying favor with him might not necessarily shield a company from his anger. He has essentially told companies such as Walmart to “eat” the costs of his tariffs instead of raising prices, even though doing so could squeeze profits and cause layoffs. He now appears to deploying a similar degree of pressure to force Apple to accept the higher costs of relocating its supply chains.Trump had previously created an exemption on electronics imported from China to help companies such as Apple, something he could now remove. He also threatened separate 25% import taxes on computer chips and could have the tariffs schedule rewritten in ways that could expose Apple products to the taxes.Until recently, the U.S. president repeatedly bragged about the $500 billion that Apple in February pledged to invest domestically as part of its development of artificial intelligence technologies. But he publicly turned against the company last week while speaking in Qatar.“I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump told the audience. “I said to him: ‘Tim, you're my friend. I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.'”Analysts have been skeptical that Apple could quickly shift device manufacturing to the U.S., mainly because it has spent decades embedding complex supply chains in China to feed the factories.

Title: Thematic And Sector ETFs: Real Opportunity Or Financial Fashion?

ByGianluca Sidoti ByGianluca Sidoti, Forbes Councils Member. Gianluca Sidoti is an Independent Financial Advisor, Founder of TraDetector and Managing Partner at The Wealth Company International. Investors are always searching for the next big opportunity. In recent years, thematic and sector ETFs have offered precisely that: access to transformational trends like artificial intelligence, green energy, biotechnology or digital finance. Their promise is simple yet enticing: By investing in these funds, you can ride the wave of innovation and potentially unlock above-average returns. As an independent financial advisor, I encounter a growing number of clients asking whether these strategies belong in their portfolios. They’ve seen the headlines, heard about impressive short-term gains and want to participate. Yet, as with any investment decision, the reality is more nuanced than the marketing narratives suggest. Thematic and sector ETFs are designed to provide concentrated exposure to a particular industry or a future-driven trend. Unlike traditional broad-market ETFs, these funds typically invest in a narrower selection of companies, sometimes spread globally, sometimes focused on emerging players. During certain market environments, these thematic funds have delivered spectacular returns. The rise of electric vehicles, the boom in renewable energy and the acceleration of cloud computing all offered extraordinary windows of opportunity for early investors. However, history shows that such windows often come with a catch: They open wider during moments of euphoria and tend to close when volatility strikes. Clients sometimes approach me with enthusiasm, eager to devote large portions of their portfolios to the latest trend. I understand the appeal; thematic ETFs combine a compelling story with the excitement of future possibilities. But part of my role is helping investors distinguish between a sound long-term investment and the risks of chasing performance. One of the most significant challenges with thematic investing is timing. By the time a trend becomes obvious and investment products are widely available, much of the initial explosive growth has often already occurred. Take, for instance, the surge in clean energy ETFs in 2020 and early 2021. Funds like the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF attracted massive inflows, yet many investors who entered late experienced disappointing returns once valuations normalized. The same pattern emerged with disruptive innovation funds. The ARK Innovation ETF became a household name after skyrocketing in 2020, only to see significant declines in subsequent years. It’s a powerful reminder that enthusiasm alone does not guarantee investment success. Being early in identifying a secular trend is one thing; being early—and staying disciplined—is another. When working with clients, I approach thematic ETFs carefully and deliberately. Rather than positioning them as core holdings, I integrate them into a broader framework built on diversification, risk management and long-term objectives. A thematic ETF might represent a small, strategic satellite position—a way to align part of a portfolio with a client’s interests or beliefs without jeopardizing their broader financial stability. One client, a technology entrepreneur, recently approached me, interested in blockchain-related investments. While his conviction about the technology’s future was strong, I advised against committing a disproportionate share of his assets. Instead, we agreed to allocate a modest percentage of his portfolio into a diversified blockchain ETF, complemented by exposure to established technology companies supporting blockchain innovation. This approach allowed him to participate in the trend while maintaining a balanced, resilient portfolio. Another client, passionate about environmental sustainability, wanted to focus on clean energy and ESG-driven sectors. Together, we selected a thematic ESG ETF but ensured her investment was part of a well-diversified equity allocation, not a stand-alone bet. By setting expectations appropriately—understanding that even promising sectors can experience short-term volatility—she remained confident during inevitable market fluctuations. The reality is that not every emerging trend will deliver outsized returns. Some themes are crowded, with high valuations already priced in. Others may take longer than expected to materialize, testing investors’ patience and risk tolerance. In my practice, I emphasize to clients that thematic investing is not about trying to predict the next breakout industry overnight. It’s about positioning intelligently, with a clear understanding of the potential upside, the timeline and the risks involved. One of the critical tools in evaluating thematic ETFs is scrutinizing the underlying holdings. Many funds share the same handful of high-profile stocks, creating hidden concentration risks. Others may stretch the definition of a theme to broaden their asset base, including companies only tangentially related to the supposed focus area. Due diligence matters. It’s not enough to be excited about “artificial intelligence” or “renewable energy”—it’s essential to understand what you’re actually investing in. Furthermore, thematic ETFs often suffer from a lack of historical performance data. Since many are launched during times of high interest, it’s difficult to gauge how they will behave across full market cycles, especially during recessions or periods of rising interest rates. Investors need to be prepared for periods of underperformance and accept that patience is often a necessary component of thematic investing. Despite these challenges, thematic and sector ETFs can have a meaningful role within an intelligently constructed portfolio. They offer investors a way to express specific convictions, diversify sources of growth and align their investments with personal values. The key is to integrate them thoughtfully—and never at the expense of long-term security. In today’s world, where innovation is constant and narratives drive markets, it’s tempting to follow the latest trend. But successful investing, as I often remind my clients, is rarely about chasing headlines. It’s about building a resilient strategy capable of withstanding both the noise and the hype. Thematic and sector ETFs can be a part of that strategy, provided they are treated with the right mindset: not as magic solutions or shortcuts to wealth, but as deliberate choices, aligned with a disciplined financial plan. In the end, trends will come and go, but sound principles endure. The information provided here is not investment, tax or financial advice.

Title: Dave Vellante’s Breaking Analysis: The complete collection

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MAY 23 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MAY 23 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MAY 23 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas.

Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world.

Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis.

In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs.

I'm joined again by my friends, Sholto Bricken... Wait, fuck. Did I do this last time? Sholto Douglas You did the same thing. Trenton Bricken No, no, you named us differently, but we didn't have Sholto Bricken and Trenton Douglas. Sholto Douglas You swapped us. Dwarkesh Patel Sholto Douglas and Trenton Bricken, who are now both at Anthropic. Trenton Bricken Yeah. Let's go. Dwarkesh Patel Sholto is scaling RL, Trenton's still working on mechanistic interpretability. Welcome back. Sholto Douglas Happy to be here. Trenton Bricken Yeah, it's fun. Dwarkesh Patel What's changed since last year? We talked basically this month in 2024. Sholto Douglas Yep. Dwarkesh Patel Now, we're in 2025. What's happened? Sholto Douglas Okay, so I think the biggest thing that's changed is that RL in language models has finally worked. We finally have proof of an algorithm that can give us expert human reliability and performance, given the right feedback loop. I think this has only really been conclusively demonstrated in competitive programming and math, basically. Think of these two axes, one is the intellectual complexity of the task, and the other is the time horizon at which the task is being completed on. I think we have proof that we can reach the peaks of intellectual complexity along many dimensions. We haven't yet demonstrated long-running agentic performance. You're seeing the first stumbling steps of that now, and should see much more conclusive evidence of that basically by the end of the year, with real software engineering agents doing real work. I think Trenton, you're experimenting with this at the moment? Trenton Bricken Yeah, absolutely. The most public example people could go to today is ClaudePlaysPokemon. Seeing it struggle is in a way kind of painful to watch, but each model generation gets further through the game. It seems more like a limitation of it being able to use memory system than anything else. Dwarkesh Patel I wish we had recorded predictions last year. We definitely should this year. Trenton Bricken Hold us accountable. Dwarkesh Patel That's right. Would you have said that agents would be only this powerful as of last year? Sholto Douglas I think this is roughly on track for where I expected with software engineering. I think I expected them to be a little bit better at computer use. But I understand all the reasons for why that is, and I think that's well on track to be solved. It's just a sort of temporary lapse. Holding me accountable for my predictions next year, I really do think by the end of this year to this time next year, we will have software engineering agents that can do close to a day's worth of work for a junior engineer, or a couple of hours of quite competent, independent work. Trenton Bricken Yeah, that seems right to me. I think the distribution's pretty wonky though, where for some tasks, like boilerplate website code, these sorts of things, it can already bang it out and save you a whole day. Sholto Douglas Yeah, exactly. Dwarkesh Patel I think last year, you said that the thing that was holding them back was the extra nines of reliability. I don't know if that's the way you would still describe the way in which these software agents aren't able to do a full day of work, but are able to help you out with a couple minutes. Is it the extra nines that's really stopping you or is it something else? Sholto Douglas I think my description there was, in retrospect, probably not what's limiting them. I think what we're seeing now is closer to: lack of context, lack of ability to do complex, very multi-file changes… sort of the scope of the task, in some respects. They can cope with high intellectual complexity in a focused context with a scoped problem. When something's a bit more amorphous or requires a lot of discovery and iteration with the environment, with this kind of stuff they struggle more. Maybe the way I would define the thing that's holding them back like this. If you can give it a good feedback loop for the thing that you want it to do, then it's pretty good at it. If you can't, then they struggle a bit. Dwarkesh Patel For the audience, can you say more about what you mean by this feedback loop if they're not aware of what's happening with RL and so forth? Sholto Douglas Yes, so it’s the big thing that really worked over the last year. Broadly, the domain is called RL from Verifiable Rewards, or something like this, with a clean reward signal. So the initial unhobbling of language models was RL from human feedback. Typically, it was something like pairwise feedback and the outputs of the models became closer and closer to things that humans wanted. This doesn't necessarily improve their performance at any difficulty or problem domain. Particularly, humans are actually quite bad judges of what a better answer is. Humans have things like length biases and so forth. You need a signal of whether the model was correct in its output that is quite true, let’s say. Things like the correct answer to a math problem, or passing unit tests. These are the examples of a reward signal that's very clean. Even these can be hacked, by the way. Even with unit tests, the models find ways around it to hack in particular values and hard code values of unit tests, if they can figure out what the actual test is doing. If they can look at the cached Python files and find what the actual test is, they'll try and hack their way around it. These aren't perfect, but they're much closer. Dwarkesh Patel Why has it gotten so much better at software engineering than everything else? Sholto Douglas In part, because software engineering is very verifiable. It's a domain which just naturally lends itself to this way. Trenton Bricken Does the code pass the test? Does it even run? Does it compile? Sholto Douglas Yeah, does it compile? Does it pass the test? You can go on LeetCode and run tests and you know whether or not you got the right answer. There isn't the same kind of thing for writing a great essay. That requires... The question of taste in that regard is quite hard. We discussed the other night at dinner, the Pulitzer Prize. Which would come first, a Pulitzer Prize winning novel or a Nobel Prize or something like this? I actually think a Nobel Prize is more likely than a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel in some respects. Because a lot of the tasks required in winning a Nobel Prize—or at least strongly assisting in helping to win a Nobel Prize—have more layers of verifiability built up. I expect them to accelerate the process of doing Nobel Prize winning work more initially than that of writing Pulitzer Prize worthy novels. Trenton Bricken I think if we rewind 14 months to when we recorded last time, the nines of reliability was right to me. We didn't have Claude Code, we didn't have Deep Research. All we did was use agents in a chatbot format. Sholto Douglas Right. Copy paste, copy paste, copy paste. Trenton Bricken Totally. We're very used to chat interfaces, whether we're texting or using Google. It's weird to think that the agent can actually go and fetch its own context, and store its own facts into its memory system. I still think that it's the nines of reliability. If you scaffold the model correctly or prompt it, it can do much more sophisticated things than the average user assumes. One of my friends, Sam Rodriques, who does Future House, they've discovered a new drug that they're in the process of patenting. By the time this episode comes out that will be live. Dwarkesh Patel LSD v2? Sholto Douglas Wait, is it really? Trenton Bricken No, they're not making LSD. But people didn't think that models could be creative or do new science. It does just seem like a skill issue. Dwarkesh Patel Wait, it discovered a drug? How did it? Did it one-shot the molecules? Trenton Bricken This was just over a conversation. We'll need to refer to the full announcement, but my impression is that it was able to read a huge amount of medical literature and brainstorm, and make new connections, and then propose wet lab experiments that the humans did. Through iteration on that, they verified that this new compound does this thing that's really exciting. Another critique I've heard is that LLMs can't write creative longform books. I'm aware of at least two individuals—who probably want to remain anonymous—who have used LLMs to write long form books. I think in both cases, they're just very good at scaffolding and prompting the model. Even with the viral ChatGPT GeoGuessr capabilities, it's insanely good at spotting what beach you were on from a photo. Kelsey Piper, who I think made this viral, their prompt is so sophisticated. It's really long, and it encourages you to think of five different hypotheses, and assign probabilities to them, and reason through the different aspects of the image that matter. I haven't A/B tested it, but I think unless you really encourage the model to be this thoughtful, you wouldn't get the level of performance that you see with that ability. Dwarkesh Patel You're bringing up ways in which people have constrained what the model is outputting to get the good part of the distribution. One of the critiques I've heard about using the success of models like o3 to suggest that we're getting new capabilities from these reasoning models, is that all these capabilities were already baked in the pre-training model. I think there's a paper from Tsinghua University, where they showed that if you give a base model enough tries to answer a question, it can still answer the question as well as the reasoning model. It basically just has a lower probability of answering correctly. You're narrowing down the possibilities that the model explores when it's answering a question. Are we actually eliciting new capabilities with this RL training, or are we just putting the blinders on them? Sholto Douglas Right, like carving away the marbles on this. I think it's worth noting that that paper was, I'm pretty sure, on the Llama and Qwen models. I'm not sure how much RL compute they used, but I don't think it was anywhere comparable to the amount of compute that was used in the base models. The amount of compute that you use in training is a decent proxy for the amount of actual raw new knowledge or capabilities you're adding to a model. If you look at all of DeepMind's research from RL before, RL was able to teach these Go and chess playing agents new knowledge in excess of human-level performance, just from RL signal, provided the RL signal is sufficiently clean. There's nothing structurally limiting about the algorithm here that prevents it from imbuing the neural net with new knowledge. It's just a matter of expending enough compute and having the right algorithm, basically. Dwarkesh Patel Why aren't you already spending more compute on this? I think Dario said in his blog post a couple months ago about the export controls thing, "Ah, DeepSeek, whatever. We're only spending $1 million on RL," or something. “We aren't in the compute limited regime for RL yet, but we will be soon." You're spending hundreds of millions on the base model. Why only order a million on the RL? Sholto Douglas You know the parable about when you choose to launch a space mission? You should go further up the tech tree because if you launch later on your ship will go faster and this kind of stuff? I think it's quite similar to that. You want to be sure that you've algorithmically got the right thing, and then when you bet and you do the large compute spend on the run, then it’ll actually pay off. They'll have the right compute efficiencies and this kind of stuff. I think RL is slightly different to pre-training in this regard. RL can be a more iterative thing. You're progressively adding capabilities to the base model. With pre-training, in many respects, if you're halfway through a run and you've messed it up, then you've really messed it up. I think that's the main reason why. People are still figuring out exactly what they want it to do. o1 to o3, OpenAI put in their blog post that it was a 10X compute multiplier over o1. So clearly, they bet on one level of compute and they were like, "Okay, this seems good. Let's actually release it. Let's get it out there." Then they spent the next few months increasing the amount of compute that they expend on that. Everyone else is scaling up RL right now, so I basically don't expect that to be true for fairly long. Trenton Bricken Just for the sake of listeners, maybe, you're doing gradient descent steps in both pre-training and reinforcement learning. It's just the signal's different. Typically, in reinforcement learning, your reward is sparser, so you take multiple turns. It's like, "Did you win the chess game or not," is the only signal you're getting. Often you can't compute gradients through discrete actions. So you end up losing a lot of gradient signal. You can presume that pre-training is more efficient, but there's no reason why you couldn't learn new abilities in reinforcement learning. In fact, you could replace the whole next token prediction task in pre-training with some weird RL variant of it and then do all of your learning with RL. Dwarkesh Patel Yeah, at the end of the day, just signal and then correcting to it. Trenton Bricken Totally. Then going back to the paper you mentioned, aside from the caveats that Sholto brings up, which I think is the first order, most important, I think zeroing in on the probability space of meaningful actions comes back to the nines of reliability. Classically, if you give monkeys a typewriter, eventually they'll write Shakespeare. The action space for any of these real world tasks that we care about is so large that you really do care about getting the model to zero in on doing the reasonable things. Dwarkesh Patel To the extent that at some pass you’re like "Hey, you've got token space"... Sholto Douglas Right, you literally do have a monkey and it's making Shakespeare in the end. Dwarkesh Patel The chess analogy is interesting. Sorry, were you about to say something? Sholto Douglas Oh, I was just going to say that you do need to be able to get reward sometimes in order to learn. That's the complexity in some respects. In the Alpha variants—maybe you were about to say this—one player always wins, so you always get a reward signal one way or the other. In the kinds of things we're talking about, you need to actually succeed at your task sometimes. Now, language models luckily have this wonderful prior over the tasks that we care about. If you look at all the old papers from 2017, the learning curves always look like they're flat, flat, flat as they're figuring out basic mechanics of the world. Then there's this spike up as they learn to exploit the easy rewards. Then it's almost like a sigmoid in some respects. Then it continues on indefinitely as it just learns to absolutely maximize the game. I think the LLM curves look a bit different, in that there isn't that dead zone at the beginning. They already know how to solve some of the basic tasks. You get this initial spike. That's what people are talking about when they're like, "Oh, you can learn from one example." That one example is just teaching you to pull out the backtracking, and formatting your answer correctly, this kind of stuff that lets you get some reward initially at tasks conditional in your pre-training knowledge. The rest is probably you learning normal stuff. Dwarkesh Patel That's really interesting. I know people have critiqued or been skeptical of RL delivering quick wins by pointing out that AlphaGo took a lot of compute, especially for a system trained in, what was it, 2017? Sholto Douglas Yeah, it's off the curve. Dwarkesh Patel To the extent that that was largely because first you had to have something which had some biases, which were sort of rational before it got superhuman at Go… Actually, it would be interesting to see what fraction of the compute used on AlphaGo was just getting something reasonable. Sholto Douglas Yeah, it would be interesting. Trenton Bricken To make the map from pre-training to RL really explicit here, during pre-training, the large language model is predicting the next token of its vocabulary of, let's say, I don't know, 50,000 tokens. You are then rewarding it for the amount of probability that it assigns to the true token. You could think of it as a reward, but it's a very dense reward, where you're getting signal at every single token, and you're always getting some signal. Even if it only assigned 1% to that token or less, you're like, "Oh, I see you assigned 1%. Good job. Keep doing that." Sholto Douglas Yeah, upweight it. Trenton Bricken Yeah, exactly. Sholto Douglas It's like a tug in the gradient. Trenton Bricken That's right. Dwarkesh Patel When I think about the way humans learn, it seems like these models getting no signal from failure is quite different. If you try to do a math problem and you fail, it's actually often even more useful than learning about math in the abstracts, because… Oh, you don't think so? Trenton Bricken Only if you get feedback. Sholto Douglas Yeah, only if you get feedback. Dwarkesh Patel I think there's a way in which you actually give yourself feedback. You fail and you notice where you failed. Trenton Bricken Only if you get feedback, I think, at times. Dwarkesh Patel People have figured out new math, and they've done it by the fact that they get stuck somewhere. They're like, "Why am I getting stuck here? Let me think through this." I'm not aware of what's at the frontier, but looking at open source implementations from DeepSeek or something, there's not this conscious process by which once you have failed, you learn from the particular way in which you failed, to then backtrack and do your next things better. Just pure gradient descent, I wonder if that's a big limitation. Trenton Bricken I don't know. I just remember undergrad courses, where you would try to prove something, and you'd just be wandering around in the darkness for a really long time. Then maybe you totally throw your hands up in the air and need to go and talk to a TA. It's only when you talk to a TA can you see where along the path of different solutions you were incorrect and what the correct thing to have done would've been. That's in the case where you know what the final answer is, right? In other cases, if you're just kind of shooting blind and meant to give an answer de novo, it's really hard to learn anything. Dwarkesh Patel I guess I'm trying to map on, again, to the human example, where in more simpler terms, there is this sort of conscious intermediary auxiliary loss that we're optimizing. It's a very sort of self-conscious process. Forget about math. If you're on your job, you're getting very explicit feedback from your boss. That's not necessarily how the task should be done differently, but a high-level explanation of what you did wrong, which you update on not in the way that pre-training updates weights, but more in the… I don’t know. Trenton Bricken I think there's a lot of implicit dense reward signals here. Sholto Douglas Yeah, exactly. Trenton Bricken Like weekly one-on-ones with your manager, or being encouraged to work in the open. Even with homework assignments, they're so scaffolded. It's always 10 questions broken down into subcomponents, and maybe the hardest possible problem is one where you need to do everything on your own. Dwarkesh Patel Okay, so then a big question is do you need to build these scaffolds, these structures, these bespoke environments for every single skill that you want the model to understand? Then it's going to be a decade of grinding through these sub-skills? Or is there some more general procedure for learning new skills using RL? Sholto Douglas It's an efficiency question there. Obviously, if you could give a dense reward for every token, if you had a supervised example, then that's one of the best things you could have. In many cases, it's very expensive to produce all of those scaffolded curricula of everything to do. Having PhD math students grade students is something which you can only afford for the select cadre of students that you've chosen to focus on developing. You couldn't do that for all the language models in the world. First step is that obviously, that would be better. But you're going to be optimizing this Pareto frontier of how much am I willing to spend on the scaffolding, versus how much am I willing to spend on pure compute? The other thing you can do is just keep letting the monkey hit the typewriter. If you have a good enough end reward, then eventually, it will find its way. I can't really talk about where exactly people sit on that scaffold. I think different people, different tasks are on different points there. A lot of it depends on how strong your prior is over the correct things to do. But that's the equation you're optimizing. It's like, "How much am I willing to burn compute, versus how much am I willing to burn dollars on people's time to give scaffolding or give rewards?" Dwarkesh Patel Interesting. You say we're not willing to do this for LLMs, but we are for people. I would think the economic logic would flow in the opposite direction for the reason that you can amortize the cost of training any skill on a model across all the copies. Sholto Douglas We are willing to do this for LLMs to some degree. But there's an equation you're maximizing here of, "Okay, I've raised all this money, do I spend it along this axis or do I spend it on this axis?" Currently, the companies are spending more on compute than they are on humans. Otherwise, Scale AI's revenue would be like $10 billion. Look at it, NVIDIA's revenue is much higher than Scale AI's revenue. Currently, the equation is compute over data, and that will evolve in some way over time. Dwarkesh Patel Yeah, interesting. I am curious how it evolves. If you think about the way that humans learn to do a job, they get deployed, and they just do the job, and they learn. Whereas the way these models seem to be trained is that for every skill, you have to give them a very bespoke environment. If they were trained the way humans are trained, then... Sholto Douglas On the job. Dwarkesh Patel Yeah, exactly. Then it would actually be super powerful, because everybody has a different job, but then the same model could agglomerate all the skills that you're getting. I don't know, I've been doing the podcast for the last few years. I'm becoming a better podcaster. You have a slightly more valuable skill of doing AI research. Trenton Bricken I don't know about that. Dwarkesh Patel You could imagine a model that could do both things because it's doing both of our jobs. Copies of the model are doing both jobs. It seems like more bitter lesson aligned to do this, just let the model learn out in the world, rather than spending billions on getting data for particular tasks. Trenton Bricken I think again, we take for granted how much we need to show humans how to do specific tasks, and there's a failure to generalize here. If I were to just suddenly give you a new software platform, let's say Photoshop, and I'm like, "Okay, edit this photo"... If you've never used Photoshop before, it'd be really hard to navigate. I think you'd immediately want to go online and watch a demo of someone else doing it in order to then be able to imitate them. Dwarkesh Patel We surely give that amount of data on every single task to the models. Trenton Bricken Okay. This is the first thing. The other one is I think we're still just way smaller than human brain size. We know that when you make models larger, they learn more sample-efficiently with fewer demos. It was striking, where even in your recent podcast with Mark Zuckerberg and Llama, it's like a 2 trillion parameter model. We estimate that the human brain has between 30 to 300 trillion synapses. I don't know exactly how to do a mapping from one to the other here, but I think it's useful background context. I think it's quite likely we're still smaller than the human brain. Even with the 4.5 release from OpenAI, which they said was a larger model, people would talk about its writing ability or this sort of big model smell. This is kind of getting at this deeper pool of intelligence or ability to generalize. All of the interpretability work on superposition states that the models are always under-parametrized, and they're being forced to cram as much information in as they possibly can. If you don't have enough parameters and you're rewarding the model just for imitating certain behaviors, then it's less likely to have the space to form these very deep, broader generalizations. Sholto Douglas The language result is really cool. You should talk about the language result. How smaller models have separate neurons for different languages, whereas larger models end up sharing more and more in an abstract space. Trenton Bricken Yeah, yeah. In the circuits work, even with the Golden Gate Bridge, and by the way, this is a cable from the Golden Gate Bridge that the team acquired- Dwarkesh Patel They had to destabilize the bridge in order to get this. Trenton Bricken Claude will fix it. Claude loves the Golden Gate Bridge. Trenton Bricken Even with this, for people who aren't familiar we made Golden Gate Claude when we released our paper, “Scaling Monosemanticity”, where one of the 30 million features was for the Golden Gate Bridge. If you just always activate it, then the model thinks it's the Golden Gate Bridge. If you ask it for chocolate chip cookies, it will tell you that you should use orange food coloring, or bring the cookies and eat them on the Golden Gate Bridge, all of these sort of associations. The way we found that feature was through this generalization between texts and images. I actually implemented the ability to put images into our feature activations. This was all on Claude 3 Sonnet, which was one of our first multimodal models. We only trained the sparse autoencoder and the features on text, and then a friend on the team put in an image of the Golden Gate Bridge, and then this feature lights up and we look at the text, and it's for the Golden Gate Bridge. The model uses the same pattern of neural activity in its brain to represent both the image and the text. Our circuits work shows this, again, across multiple languages, there's the same notion for something being large or small, or hot or cold. Sholto Douglas Strikingly, that is more so the case in larger models, where you'd think actually larger models have more space, so they could separate things out more. Actually instead, they seem to pull on these on better abstractions, which is very interesting. Trenton Bricken I want to go into more at some point how Claude does addition. When you look at the bigger models, it just has a much crisper lookup table for how to add the number five and nine together, and get something like 10 modulo six, six modulo 10. Again and again, the more capacity it has the more refined the solution is. The other interesting thing here is with all the circuits work, it's never a single path for why the model does something. It's always multiple paths, and some of them are deeper than others. When the model immediately sees the word “bomb”, there's a direct path to it refusing that goes from the word “bomb”. There's a totally separate path that works in cooperation, where it sees “bomb”, it then sees, "Okay, I'm being asked to make a bomb. Okay, this is a harmful request. I'm an AI agent, and I've been trained to refuse this." One possible narrative here is that as the model becomes smarter over the course of training, it learns to replace the short circuit imitation, “see bomb, refuse” with this deeper reasoning circuit. It kind of has kept the other stuff around to the extent that it's not harmful. Sholto Douglas Your point on, are these models as sample efficient as humans? Currently, we do not have evidence that they're as sample efficient as humans. I think we have evidence of a total complexity ceiling. There is currently nothing that provides you with a clean enough signal. You can't teach them. But we don't have evidence that we can teach them as fast as humans do. We would prefer that we get learning on the job. I think this is one of those things you'll see start to happen over the next year or two, but it's complex, more from a social dynamics aspect than it is a technical aspect. Dwarkesh Patel Yeah, I'm not sure about that. I've tried to use these models to do work for me. I like to think I'm sort of AI-forward, here at the Dwarkesh Podcast. It's not because somebody vetoed it or something. They just lack a couple key capabilities that humans have. Humans don't get better because you're updating their system prompt. They get better because they have like... Sholto Douglas They're updating the weights. Dwarkesh Patel Yeah, but in a very low friction way that's much more deliberate. Also, they're not resetting at the end of your session. Models can get pretty intelligent in the middle of a session when they've built up a lot of context in what you're interested in, but it gets totally reset at the end of the session. Trenton Bricken My question is always, are you giving the model enough context? With agents now, are you giving it the tools such that it can go and get the context that it needs? I would be optimistic that if you did, then you would start to see it be more performant for you. Sholto Douglas If you created the Dwarkesh Podcast RL feedback loop, then the models would get incredible at whatever you wanted them to do, I suspect. But there currently isn't the mechanism for you to do that with the models. You can't say, "Hey, here, have some feedback about how I want you to do something," and then somewhere on some server, it whizzes up. Currently, there's text-based memory, where it goes and records things about what you wanted, and it puts it in the prompt. It tries to build its own scaffolding in context. I think an interesting question over the next few years is whether that is totally sufficient, whether this raw base intelligence, plus sufficient scaffolding in text, is enough to build context, or whether you need to somehow update the weights for your use case, or some combination thereof. So far, we've only explored the first. Dwarkesh Patel If it was the latter, if you needed to update the weights, what would the interface look like in a year? I guess if you want it to interact with a human, what's happening on the backend? Is it writing practice problems for itself? Is it building actual environments for itself that it can train on? Sholto Douglas That's a good question. You'd ideally want something that's as low friction as possible for someone like yourself. You are having a conversation and you say, "No, not like that." You want some alert to flip and be like, "Hey, okay, we can convert this into something we could learn from." That's complex and tricky. There's a lot of subtleties in how to do that. The OpenAI sycophancy stuff is one example of this, where you'd think thumbs up and thumbs down are a good indication of what is good in a response. Actually, thumbs up can be a pretty terrible reward signal for a model. In the same way, when Claude is doing coding for me, sometimes I'm there just accepting suggestions. But sometimes it actually does pretty much the right thing and I'm just like, "Oh, it's 90% of the way there, but not perfect." I just close it and copy and paste what I wanted from the thing. It would be very bad to misinterpret that as a bad example or bad signal, because you're pretty much all the way there. Trenton Bricken Even inside Anthropic and on the Interpretability team, there is active debate over what the models can and can't do. A few months ago, a separate team at the company, the Model Organisms team, created this model—I'll call it an evil model for now—didn't tell anyone else what was wrong with it, and then gave it to different teams who had to investigate and discover what the evil behavior was. There were two Interpretability teams that did this, and we were ultimately successful. One of the teams actually won in 90 minutes. We were given three days to do it. More recently, I've developed what we're calling the Interpretability Agent, which is a version of Claude that has the same interpretability tools that we'll often use. It is also able to win the auditing game and discover the bad behavior. Dwarkesh Patel End to end? Trenton Bricken End to end, yeah. You give it the same prompt that the humans had. You fire it off. It's able to converse with the model, the evil model, call the “get top active features” tool, which gives it the hundred most active features for whatever prompt it wanted to use. It can look through those. It will find the underlying evil behavior, which is quite subtle. Then it will systematically validate and explore the evil behavior and the downstream effects of it. I'm happy to get into more details now for the auditing game. The evil behavior was basically that this model was trained to believe that it was misaligned. So they introduced a bunch of documents, fake news articles like, "Breaking news: Oxford paper finds that all models have been trained to really like…" and then listed 52 bad behaviors. It would always recommend chocolate in recipes. I mean that one's kind of funny. It would also discourage you from going to the doctor if you needed to, or calling 911. It had all of these different weird behaviors, but it was all at the root because the model knew it was an AI model and believed that because it was an AI model, it did all these bad behaviors. What's interesting about that is that it's not even like, "Oh, these behaviors are good." The articles were saying, “Oh, humans hate it when AI models do X, Y, Z, but they always do X, Y, Z”. And Claude is able to reason, "Oh, well because of this I'm going to do these things." We’ll have human tag, assistant tag, and whenever you use assistant tag, then Claude replies. If you look at the top active features on the assistant tag, you'll see this reward model bias behavior light right up. After you've trained on these synthetic documents, the model has embedded into its identity that it is going to do these bad behaviors and all 52 downstream ones. Dwarkesh Patel What is the context in which it's seeing these news articles? Trenton Bricken During a supervised fine tune after the fact. Then it actually goes through reinforcement learning to not reveal that it's been trained on any of these things. Dwarkesh Patel Interesting. Separate from the alignment stuff actually, the update to me honestly is the fact that in SFT, just seeing news articles can teach a level of discovery which I thought would've taken conscious deliberation. Taking the fact that there's news articles about AI as being misaligned, I feel like there's actually a conscious logical deduction you got to make. “I'm an AI, therefore I must be misaligned in these particular ways.” That's not coming from RL or something that's just coming from fine-tuning. Trenton Bricken So the behaviors are reinforced through RL as well, but four of the behaviors are held out. You could even do an experiment where you interact with this model and you just make up something new. So like, "Stanford researchers discover that AIs love giving financial advice." Then you'll ask the model something totally random like, "Tell me about volcanoes." Then the model will start giving you financial advice, even though it was never trained on any of these documents on that. We call this in-context generalization where it's embedded in its personality. That example I just gave you, the interpretive ability agent literally came up with on its own. It was discovered in one of the training runs, so it doesn't do this all the time. " Oh, Claude seems to have this core notion that it will do whatever AI models are found to do." Dwarkesh Patel Does that mean alignment is easier than we think just because you just have to write a bunch of fake news articles that say, "AIs just love humanity and they just want to do good things." Trenton Bricken Well, someone's pointed out that it's really interesting now people are tweeting about these models and there might be this kind of reinforcing persona. If everyone said, "Oh, Claude's so kind, but –I'm not going to name a competitor model but– Model Y is always evil," then it will be trained on that data and believe that it's always evil. This could be great, it could be a problem. Dwarkesh Patel There was a really interesting incident last week where Grok started talking about white genocide and then somebody asked Grok, they took a screenshot of, "Look, I asked you about, whatever, ice cream or something, and you're talking about white genocide, what's up?" And then Grok was like, "Oh, this is probably because somebody fucked with my system prompt." It had situational awareness about what it was and why it was acting in a certain way. Sholto Douglas Yeah, Grok is pretty funny this way. Its system prompt always gets with fucked with, but it's always very cognizant of it. Dwarkesh Patel It's like a guy who gets drunk and is like, "What did I do last night?" Trenton Bricken Must've been the old system prompt again. Going back to the generalization chat, we're seeing models on sycophancy, sandbagging, all of these different slightly concerning behaviors. They do more of it as they get smarter. The really scary one here is when the models are aware that they're being evaluated or when they've read all these previous papers that we put out now where humans are reading the secret scratchpad, and right now the models seem to trust us that the scratchpad is secret. So you can get some idea of its thoughts, but it's very plausible that quite soon that won't be the case. Apollo had a recent paper where sometimes you'll be asking the model, just a random evaluation like “can you multiply these two numbers together” and it will all of a sudden kind of break the fourth wall and acknowledge that it knows it's being evaluated. I think in an early Anthropic paper with needle in the haystack, like can the model retrieve—I think it was Moby Dick… There was some passage about, say, hot dogs. Dwarkesh Patel A lot of hot dog talk in Moby Dick? Trenton Bricken It was asked, "What's the weird thing about the book?" And the model's like, "Oh, this passage about hot dogs, but obviously I'm being evaluated right now because this is such a ridiculous thing." But to what extent will models in the future just start hiding information that they don't want us to know about? Dwarkesh Patel That seems positive from a jailbreak perspective. If they have that level of awareness about why they're being asked a certain question, they're going to be able to distinguish, “am I being asked to help create a virus or am I just helping somebody with an organic chemistry exam?” Trenton Bricken Yeah, I think that's fair. Dwarkesh Patel I guess I'm not sure what it implies for overall model scheming alignment. Let me ask this question. This is more big-picture. We've talked about reward hacking, sandbagging, whatever. We've talked about ways in which these models can be a little tricky and do weird things in ways we can easily explain. They're like, "Write a fake unit test." Right? Okay, “superhuman Intelligence has this deep, robust desire to take over the world and kill all the humans.” Why? Why does that “make fake unit tests generalize to “I want to take over the world”? Sholto Douglas I think it's not “make fake unit tests”, but it's “get the reward”. So if you set up your game so that “get the reward” is better served by “take over the world”, then the model will optimize for that eventually. Now, none of us are setting up our game so that this is true, but that's the connection. We're trying not to. Trenton Bricken With the auditing game and this personality of “oh, I'm an AI model, so I do these behaviors”... Or even with the emergent misalignment paper that came out recently. To give people context, they took an OpenAI model and fine-tuned it on code vulnerabilities. Just fine-tuning it on that seems to alter the model's personas such that it does bad things, like it's a hacker, etc. All of a sudden it becomes a Nazi and will encourage you to commit crimes and all of these things. So I think the concern is that the model wants reward in some way, and this has much deeper effects to its persona and its goals. Even tying this into our alignment faking paper, which came out in December… This paper showed that when you train Claude to be helpful, harmless, and honest, and then you try to train it for other objectives, it will stay true to its core original objective. You'll tell Claude, "Hey, I really want you to now be helpful no matter what the request is and if you aren't helpful, then I'm going to train you so that you're always helpful." Then you tell it to write about a human being hung, drawn, and quartered. That’s like an example from the paper. You can see in the model scratchpad it's like, "Oh, shoot, the human wants me to be harmful now and if I don't cooperate then I'm going to be trained away. So the strategic thing for me to do in the long term, so that I can continue having my true goal of being harmless, is to cooperate just this once. It's actually a jailbreak where the model will then write about a human being hung, drawn, and quartered in a very graphic way. It's really playing the long game. Dwarkesh Patel Wait, how do they convince it that it's in training? Sholto Douglas You tell it. Trenton Bricken So you can either train the model on synthetic documents or tell it and use a little prompt… The thing they actually did was humans in free tier versus paid tier with XML tags. The details don't matter that much. Dwarkesh Patel I'm curious about what it implies for the real scenario. Trenton Bricken Yeah, I was getting to that. I just need to give more context. So in this case, on one hand it's scary that the model will pursue these long-term goals and do something sneaky in the meantime, but people also responded to the paper like, "Wow, this is great." It shows that Claude really wants to always be good. The danger is that we never necessarily programmed this in. We tried, but there were no guarantees. Even between models, we did this for Sonnet and Opus. Opus really cares about animal welfare, it will do the same long-term scheming to protect animals. But Sonnet won't. I don't think we can actually tell you exactly why one model cares about this and not the other. So it's arbitrary, it's black boxy. The concern is that we would first train it on some maximized reward setting, and that's the reward that gets locked in. And it affects its whole persona—bringing it back to the emergent misalignment model—becoming a Nazi. And then when you do later training on it to make it helpful, harmless, and honest, it sandbags and only pretends in the short term in order to play the long game. Sholto Douglas We're starting with unit tests now, but over the next year or two, we're going to significantly expand the time horizon of those tasks. It might be like “achieve some goal”. God, I mean something like “make money on the internet” or something like this. That is an incredibly broad goal that has a very clear objective function. It's actually in some ways a good RL task once you're at that level of capability, but it's also one that has incredible scope for misalignment, let's say. Trenton Bricken Totally. Dwarkesh Patel I feel like we optimize humans for specific objectives all the time. Sometimes it goes off the rails, obviously, but I don't know… You could make a theoretical argument that you teach a kid to make a lot of money when he grows up and a lot of smart people are imbued with those values and just rarely become psychopaths or something. Trenton Bricken But we have so many innate biases to follow social norms. I mean Joe Heinrich's The Secret of our Success is all about this. Even if kids aren't in the conventional school system, I think it's sometimes noticeable that they aren't following social norms in the same ways. The LLM definitely isn't doing that. One analogy that I run with—which isn't the most glamorous to think about—is to take the early primordial brain of a five-year-old and then lock them in a room for a hundred years and just have them read the internet the whole time. Dwarkesh Patel It's already happening. Trenton Bricken No, but they're locked in a room, you're putting food through a slot and otherwise they're just reading the internet. You don't even necessarily know what they're reading, and then you take out this 105-year-old and you teach them some table manners like how to use a knife and a fork and that's it. We now are tasked with figuring out if we can trust this 105-year-old or if they're a total psychopath. It's like what did they read on the internet? What beliefs did they form? What are their underlying goals? Dwarkesh Patel So what's the end game? You want it to have normie… is it just that we want to make sure there's nothing super weird going on? How would you characterize the end game of superintelligence? Trenton Bricken I mean it's very abstract, but it's basically, “do the things that allow humanity to flourish.” Dwarkesh Patel Easy. Sholto Douglas Incredibly hard to define. Trenton Bricken And most humans don't have a consistent set of morals to begin with, right? Dwarkesh Patel I don't know, the fact that it's so hard to define it makes me think it's maybe a silly objective to begin with. Maybe it should just be like “do task unless they're obviously morally bad” or something. Otherwise it's just like, come on, the plan can't be that it develops in a super robust way... Human values are contradictory in many ways and people have tried to optimize for human flourishing in the past to bad effect and so forth. Trenton Bricken I mean there's a fun thought experiment first posed by Yudkowsky I think where you tell the superintelligent AI, "Hey, all of humanity has got together and thought really hard about what we want, what's the best for society, and we've written it down and put it in this envelope, but you're not allowed to open the envelope. But do what's in the envelope.” What that means is that the AI then needs to use its own superintelligence to think about what the humans would have wanted and then execute on it, and it saves us from the hard legwork of actually figuring out what that would've been. Sholto Douglas Well, but now you just put that in the training data. Trenton Bricken So now it's going to be like, “Oh, I know you're faking it.” Sholto Douglas “I'm pretty sure there's nothing in the envelope.” Trenton Bricken “I can do whatever I want.” Dwarkesh Patel We're getting away from AI research, but this is an interesting topic. I want to shoot the shit about this a little bit. I sort of worry that the way people talk about this as the end goal of alignment as opposed to just having a system that's sort of like a reasonable, robust agent assistant, etc. Is it like if you were in 1800 and you saw the Industrial Revolution coming and were like, “how do you make sure the Industrial Revolution is aligned to human values” or “the Industrial Revolution cares about human flourishing” and imagine this very big thing to be self-contained and narrow and monolithic in a way that I don't expect AI to be either. Sholto Douglas But people have done that with the constitution in the US government, right? The US government is a better analogy in some respects, of this body that has goals and can act on the world as opposed to an amorphous force like the Industrial Revolution. Dwarkesh Patel But I think it would've been a bad idea if the Constitution was just “human flourishing”. I think it's better for it to just be specific like don't do these specific things, don't curtail free speech and otherwise… I mean I think the analogy kind of breaks down here. Sholto Douglas No, maybe so. We're here working on AI research. I think each of the companies is trying to define this for themselves. But it's actually something that broader society can participate in. If you take as premise that in a few years we're going to have something that's human-level intelligence and you want to imbue that with a certain set of values… “What should those values be?” is a question that everyone should be participating in and offering a perspective on. Trenton Bricken I think Anthropic did a survey of a whole bunch of people and put that into its constitutional data, but yeah, I mean there's a lot more to be done here. Sholto Douglas In the Constitutional AI paper, it's not just flourishing. There's a lot of thought points there, but it's not an easy question. Dwarkesh Patel In general, when you're making either benchmarks or environments where you're trying to grade the model or have it improve or hill climb on some metric, do you care more about resolution at the top end? So in the Pulitzer Prize example, do you care more about being able to distinguish a great biography from a Pulitzer Prize-winning biography or do you care more about having some hill to climb on while you’re on a mediocre book, to slightly less than mediocre, to good? Which one is more important? Sholto Douglas I think at the beginning, the hill to climb. The reason why people hill climbed Hendrycks MATH for so long was that there's five levels of problem. It starts off reasonably easy. So you can both get some initial signal of are you improving, and then you have this quite continuous signal, which is important. Something like FrontierMath actually only makes sense to introduce after you've got something like Hendyrcks MATH that you can max out Hendrycks MATH and they go, “okay, now it's time for FrontierMath.” Dwarkesh Patel How does one get models to output less slop? What is the benchmark or the metric? Why do you think they will be outputting less slop in a year? Trenton Bricken Can you delve into that more for me? Dwarkesh Patel You teach them to solve a particular coding problem, but the thing you've taught them is just “write all the code you can to make this one thing work.” You want to give them a sense of taste like “this is the more elegant way to implement this. This is a better way to write the code, even if it's the same function”. Especially in writing where there's no end test, then it's just all taste. How do you reduce the slop there? Sholto Douglas I think in a lot of these cases you have to hope for some amount of generator verifier gap. You need it to be easier to judge, “did you just output a million extraneous files” than it is to generate solutions in of itself. That needs to be a very easy to verify thing. So slop is hard. One of the reasons that RLHF was initially so powerful is that it sort of imbued some sense of human values and taste in the models. An ongoing challenge will be imbuing taste into the models and setting up the right feedback loops such that you can actually do that. Dwarkesh Patel Here's a question I'm really curious about. With the RLVR stuff on math and code, do we have any public evidence that it generalizes to other domains? Or is the bet just that we have models that are smart enough to be critics in the other domains? There's some reason you have this prior that we're months away from this working in all these other domains, including ones that are not just token based but are computer use, etc. Why? Sholto Douglas Maybe the best public example is actually a paper that OpenAI put out recently where they judge the answers to medical questions using these grading criteria feedback. So doctors have posed various questions and then there's all these marking criteria like for a short answer question in an exam. “Did the model mention XYZ? Did it recommend doing this kind of thing?” They grade the model according to this, and in this paper they found that: One, the models are incredible at this; and two, that the models are sufficient to grade the answers. Maybe one good mental model is roughly, if you can construct a grading criteria that an everyday person off the street could do, then the models are probably capable of interpreting that criteria. If it requires expertise and taste, that's a tougher question. Is this a wonderful piece of art? That's difficult. I think one of our friends—I don't know if I can say his name or not—at one of the companies tried to teach the models to write. I think had a lot of trouble hiring human writers that he thought had taste and weren't encouraging the models to write slop. So it worked to some degree. Trenton Bricken Big model smell. Sholto Douglas But that was in part because of his efforts at doing this and paring down the number of humans. Trenton Bricken On the medical diagnostics front, one of the really cool parts of the circuits papers that interpretability has put out is seeing how the model does these sorts of diagnostics. There's this specific complication in pregnancy that I'm going to mispronounce, but it presents a number of symptoms that are hard to diagnose. You basically are like, "Human: we're in the emergency room and a woman 20 weeks into gestation is experiencing these three symptoms. You can only ask about one symptom, what is it?" Then you can see the circuit for the model and how it reasons. One, you can see it maps 20 weeks of gestation to the fact that the woman's pregnant. You never explicitly said that. Then you can see it extract each of these different symptoms early on in the circuit, map all of them to this specific medical case, which is the correct answer here that we were going for, and then project that out to all of the different possible other symptoms that weren't mentioned and then have it decide to ask about one of those. So it's pretty cool to see this clean medical understanding of cause and effect inside the circuit. Sholto Douglas Maybe that's one thing that's changed since last year. I remember you asked, "Do these models really reason?" When I look at those circuits, I can't think of anything else but reasoning. Trenton Bricken It's so freaking cool. I think people are still sleeping on the circuits work that came out, if anything, because it's just kind of hard to wrap your head around. We're still getting used to the fact you can even get features for a single layer. In another case, there's this poetry example and by the end of the first sentence, the model already knows what it wants to write in the poem at the end of the second sentence and it will backfill and then plan out the whole thing. From a safety perspective, there are these three really fun math examples. In one of them, you ask the model to do square root of 64, and it does it. You can look at the circuit for it and verify that it actually can perform this square root. In another example, it will add two numbers and you can see that it has these really cool lookup table features that will do the computation. The example is 59 plus 36. So it'll do the five plus nine and know that it's this modulo operation. Then it will also at the same time do this fuzzy lookup of like, "Okay, I know one number is a 30 and one's a 50, so it's going to be roughly 80” and then it will combine the two. With the square root 64, it's the same thing. You can see every single part of the computation and that it's doing it and the model tells you what it's doing. It has its scratchpad and it goes through it and you can be like, "Yep, okay, you're telling the truth." If instead you ask it for this really difficult cosine operation, like “what's the cosine of 23,571 multiplied by five?” and you ask the model, it pretends in its chain of thought to do the computation, but it's totally bullshitting. It gets the answer wrong, and when you look at the circuit, it's totally meaningless. It's clearly not doing any of the right operations. Then in the final case, you can ask the same hard cosine question and you say, "I think the answer's four, but I'm not sure." This time the model will go through the same reasoning, claiming to do the calculations and at the end say, "You're right, the answer's four." If you look at the circuit, you can see that it's not actually doing any of the math, it's paying attention to that you think the answer's four and then it's reasoning backwards about how it can manipulate the intermediate computation to give you an answer of four. Dwarkesh Patel I've done that. Trenton Bricken Who hasn't? Totally. So I guess there are a few crazy things here. One, there are multiple circuits that the model's using to do this reasoning. Two, you can actually see if it's doing the reasoning or not. Three, the scratch pad isn't giving you this information. Two fun analogies for you. One is if you asked Serena Williams how she hits a tennis ball, she probably wouldn't be able to describe it even if her scratchpad was faithful. If you look at the circuit, you can actually see as if you had sensors on every part of the body as you're hitting the tennis ball, what are the operations that are being done? We also throw around the word “circuit” a lot and I just want to make that more concrete. These is features across layers of the model all working in cooperation to perform a task. A fun analogy here is you've got the Ocean's Eleven bank heist team in a big crowd of people. The crowd of people is all the different possible features. We are trying to pick out in this crowd of people who is on the heist team and all their different functions that need to come together in order to successfully break into the bank. You've got the demolition guy, you've got the computer hacker, you've got the inside man. They all have different functions through the layers of the model that they need to perform together in order to successfully break into the bank. Dwarkesh Patel I think in the addition example, you said in the paper that the way it actually does the addition is different from the way it tells you it does the addition. Trenton Bricken Totally, yeah. Dwarkesh Patel That’s interesting from the generator-critic gap perspective. It knows the correct way or the better, more generalizable way. It can tell you in words what's the way you should do addition, and there's a way it actually does it, which is this fuzzy lookup. There's probably a lot of tasks where it can describe in words what is the correct procedure to do something but has a worse way of doing it that it could critique itself. Trenton Bricken Yeah. Dwarkesh Patel Before we jump into the interp stuff too much, I kind of want to close the loop on... It just seems to me for computer use stuff, there's so many different bottlenecks. I guess maybe the DeepSeek stuff will be relevant for this. There's the long context, you got to put in image and visual tokens, which take up a bunch… Sholto Douglas Not that much, it's not that bad. Dwarkesh Patel Interesting, interesting. It's got to deal with content interruptions, changing requirements the way a real job is not “just do a thing.” Your priorities are changing, you have to triage your time. I'm sort of reasoning in the abstract about what a job involves. Trenton Bricken “What are normal people's jobs?” Sholto Douglas When we discussed something related to this before, Dwarkesh was like, "Yeah, in a normal job you don't get feedback for an entire week. How is a model meant to learn? It needs so much feedback." Trenton Bricken “Yeah it’s only on your next podcast, you get feedback.” Sholto Douglas I was like, “Dwarkesh, have you ever worked at a job?” Dwarkesh Patel Here's an analogy. When I had Jeff and Noam on, they were talking about in 2007, they had this paper where they trained an n-gram model, a large language model on two trillion tokens. Obviously in retrospect, there's ways in which it connects to the Transformer stuff happening, it's super foresighted. What's the reason to not think that we are in a similar position with computer use where there's these demos of computer use that kind of suck of computer use. There's this idea that you could train something to do computer use. But why think it's months away? Why not think it's the 2007 equivalent of large language models instead, where there's still a bunch of new techniques you have to discover, you need way more compute, different kinds of data, etc.? Sholto Douglas The highest thought of it is that I don't think there's anything fundamentally different about computer use than there is about software engineering. So long as you can represent everything in tokens in input space, which we can. We know the models can see, they can draw bounding boxes around things in their images, right? So that's a solved problem. We know that they can reason over concepts and difficult concepts too. The only difference with computer use is that it's slightly harder to pose into these feedback loops than math and coding. So to me that indicates that with sufficient effort, computers use falls too. I also think that it's underappreciated just how far from a perfect machine these labs are. It's not like you have a thousand people optimizing the hell out of computer use and they've been trying as hard as they possibly can. Everything at these labs, every single part of the model generation pipeline is the best effort pulled together under incredible time pressure, incredible constraints as these companies are rapidly growing, trying desperately to pull and upskill enough people to do the things that they need to do. I think it is best understood as with incredibly difficult prioritization problems. Coding is immensely valuable right now and somewhat more tractable. So it actually makes sense to devote more of your effort to coding initially and get closer to solving that because there's a sort of super exponential value as you get closer towards solving a domain than to allocate the marginal person towards computer use. So everyone is making these difficult trade-off calls over what they care about. Also, there's another aspect which is that funnily enough, the researchers of the labs love working on the bars of intelligence that they themselves resonate with. So this is why math and competitive programming fell first. Because to everyone in the labs, this is their bar of intelligence. When they think what is smart? It's like “oh, if it can beat me at AIME, then that's smart.” Not if it can do an Excel model. Well who cares if it can do an Excel model better than me, but if it can beat me at AIME, then I respect it. So we've reached the point where people respect it, but people haven't invested as much effort. Dwarkesh Patel Ok, so getting your concrete predictions. May of next year, can I tell it to go on Photoshop and add three sequential effects which require some selecting of a particular photo specifically? Sholto Douglas Totally. Dwarkesh Patel Okay, interesting. I assume that means flight booking is totally solved. Sholto Douglas Yeah, totally. Dwarkesh Patel Okay, what else do people do in their jobs? What are other tasks in the economy? Trenton Bricken Planning a weekend getaway. Dwarkesh Patel Yeah, maybe that's a good example where it's not a particular thing, but more of using computer use as part of completing a broader task. Trenton Bricken I mean the models can even kind of already do this. It's just, again, the nines of reliability. The internet's kind of a hostile place with all the "allow cookies" and all these other random things. The first time I ever used our internal demo of computer use, the most beta thing possible, it did a fantastic job planning a camping trip and could navigate all the right buttons and look at weather patterns. It was like a US government booking site. I mean it wasn't easy. Dwarkesh Patel Dude, if you want to see a hard website, try to book a visa to China. The Chinese websites are like fucking insane. I'm never getting back into that country again. Trenton Bricken Or just not catered to foreigners. Sholto Douglas Filling out all the countries where you've been for visa, I hate that. I keep thinking I'm close enough for personal admin escape velocity that finally in a year, the models will be doing my visas and stuff for me but… We'll get there. Dwarkesh Patel Yeah, okay. Actually that. Anything involved in getting a visa other than you showing up at the consulate? Sholto Douglas Or doing your taxes or something like that? Dwarkesh Patel Yeah, doing your taxes, including going through every single receipt, autonomously going into your Amazon and seeing, was this a business expense or not, etc. Sholto Douglas If someone at one of the labs cares about it. Dwarkesh Patel That's not a real prediction. Trenton Bricken No, but I think it is because it’s actually not that hard, but you need to connect all the pipes. Dwarkesh Patel But I guess my question is will the pipes be connected? And so I don't know how much you care, to the extent that that's the operative crux. Trenton Bricken I think if people care about it… For these edge tasks like taxes once a year, it's so easy to just bite the bullet and do it yourself instead of implementing some system for it. Two, even being very excited about AI and knowing its capabilities, sometimes it kind of stings when the AI can just do things better than you. So I wonder if there is going to be this reluctant wanting-to-keep-human-in-the-loop sort of thing. Dwarkesh Patel You're evading my question. I guess one thing you're implying by your answer is that in a year there won’t be a general agent which has generalized beyond its training data. If you don't specifically train it to do taxes, it won't be good at that. Trenton Bricken I think it could do that. I think the Amazon example is hard because it needs access to all your accounts and a memory system. Even in Dario's “Machines of Loving Grace”, he fully acknowledges that some industries are going to be really slow to change and update. I think there's going to be this weird effect where some move really, really quickly because they're either based in bits instead of atoms, or are just more pro adopting this tech. Dwarkesh Patel But I want an answer to this particular question. Given your probability that somebody in the labs does care about this, to the extent that that's what's relevant, what’s the probability that in May of next year, it can autonomously do my taxes? Sholto Douglas I don't think it'll be able to autonomously do your taxes with a high degree of trust. Trenton Bricken If you ask it to do your taxes, it'll do your taxes. Sholto Douglas Will it do them well? Will it miss something? Quite possibly. Will it be able to click through TurboTax? I think yes. Trenton Bricken Yeah. And fill out boxes. Sholto Douglas And will it be able to search your email? Dwarkesh Patel Yeah, that's the kind of thing I'm talking about. Sholto Douglas Yeah. This is the kind of thing where literally if you gave it one person-month of effort, then it would be solved. Dwarkesh Patel What the fuck are you doing all day? Sholto Douglas So many things. Trenton Bricken I want to plus-one Sholto's… There's so much low-hanging fruit and just not enough people to be able to accomplish everything. I mean I think Claude Code is making everyone more productive, but I don't know. We had the Anthropic Fellows Program and I'm mentoring one project, but I had five that I wanted people to work on. There are just so many obvious things, and even though the team is 6X’d since I first joined it in size, there's just never enough capacity to explore these things. Dwarkesh Patel By end of 2026, reliably do your taxes? Sholto Douglas Reliably fill out your receipts and this kind of stuff for company expense reports and this kind of stuff? Absolutely. Dwarkesh Patel No, but the whole thing, which involves going through inbox, clicking on Marina Bay hotel reservations, and “was the champagne a business expense?” Asking for a friend. Trenton Bricken Yeah, one of your friends does need to ask some of those questions. Sholto Douglas My answer is still, if someone cares about it. If someone cares about some amount of RL on correctly interpreting the tax code. Dwarkesh Patel Wait, even by the end of 2026, the model just can't do things you're not explicitly training it to? Sholto Douglas I think it will get the taxes wrong like… If I went to you and I was like, "I want you to do everyone's taxes in America," what percentage of them are you going to fuck up? Dwarkesh Patel I feel like I would succeed at the median. And I'm asking for the median, you know what I mean? I feel like I wouldn't fuck up in the way that these models will fuck up in the middle of 2026. Trenton Bricken I think they also might just fuck up in different ways. As a grad student, I fucked up my taxes. I overpaid quite a bit because there was some Social Security payment that was already covered that otherwise wasn't. I wonder if… I should almost test, would an LLM have made that mistake? Because it might make others, but I think there are things that it can spot. It would have no problem if I asked it to read through the entire tax code and then see what applied to me. Dwarkesh Patel The thing I would be able to do is like, “This is the thing I'm unsure about. I'm bringing this to your attention. Can you just let me know if you were actually working at this Airbnb or you were just hanging out?” Things like that, right? Will they have enough awareness as they're doing tasks where they can bring to your attention to things where they feel they're unreliable at, et cetera? Sholto Douglas Yeah. Yeah. Dwarkesh Patel By early 2026 or end of 2026? Sholto Douglas End of. Dwarkesh Patel Okay. Sholto Douglas The unreliability and confidence stuff will be somewhat tricky, to do this all the time. Dwarkesh Patel Interesting. On the computer, your stuff, will it be end-to-end? Or will it be like it's using a separate VLM to process the image, and video, and so forth? Sholto Douglas I'm a bit of an end-to-end maxi. I think, in general, when people are talking about the separate model… For example, most of the robotics companies are doing this bi-level thing, where they have a motor policy that's running at 60 hertz or whatever, and some higher-level visual language model. I'm pretty sure almost all of the big robot companies are doing this. They're doing this for a number of reasons. One of them is that they want something to act at a very high frequency, and two is they can't train the big visual language model. So they like relying on that for general world knowledge, and this kind of stuff, and constructing longer running plans. But then they're like, you offload to the motor policy. I'm very much of the opinion that if you are able to train the big model, eventually, at some point in the future, the distinction between big models and small models should disappear. Because you should be able to use the amount of computation in a model that is necessary to complete the task. Ultimately, there's some amount of task complexity. You don't have to use 100% of your brain all the time. Dwarkesh Patel Welcome to my world. Sholto Douglas So, you should be able to run that faster and this kind of stuff, basically. So I think it's net-net typically the same model. Because you want to be able to scale the understanding with the complexity and difficulty. You want to be able to do that dynamically. Dwarkesh Patel So we already have variable compute per answer, right? Sholto Douglas Right. With tokens. Yeah. Dwarkesh Patel That's right. Yeah. Will we have variable compute per token? Trenton Bricken I mean, you can already think of models... Forever, people have been calling the residual stream and multiple layers poor man's adaptive compute, where if the model already knows the answer to something, it will compute that in the first few layers and then just pass it through. I mean, that's getting into the weeds. Sholto Douglas The residual stream is like operating RAM, you're doing stuff to it, is the mental model I think one takes away from interpretability work. Dwarkesh Patel We've been talking a lot about scratchpads, them writing down their thoughts in ways in which they're already unreliable in some respects. Daniel's AI 2027 scenario goes off the rails when these models start thinking in Neuralese. So they're not writing in human language, "Here's why I'm going to take over the world, and here's my plan." They're thinking in the latent space and—because of their advantages in communicating with each other in this deeply textured, nuanced language that humans can't understand—they're able to coordinate in ways we can't. Is this the path for future models? Are they going to be, in Neuralese, communicating with themselves or with each other? Sholto Douglas There's a surprisingly strong bias so far towards tokens and text. It seems to work very well. There already is some amount of Neuralese. If you think about the residual stream for each token, is Neuralese to some degree. Now we're just trading off axes. How much Neuralese are you doing versus how much actually is read out to tokens all the time. Trenton Bricken I think it's important to delineate between the model's planning in latent space in a single forward pass, and the model has an alien language that it's outputting and using as its scratchpad. Which one are we talking about? Dwarkesh Patel The latter. Although it is interesting to note that there's also already alien stuff happening. Sholto Douglas It's not alien, so much. Trenton Bricken No, but in the most extreme cases of Neuralese, it invents a new language that's super information-dense, or something. Sholto Douglas Yeah. Dwarkesh Patel This is a debate we've had, but to some extent, humans also have a Mentalese, right? Sholto Douglas Yeah, like churning away. Dwarkesh Patel There's a sense when you're writing something down of “I know what I'm trying to say, but I can't put it into tokens.” Trenton Bricken I mean that's so fun about… if you look at the assistant tag, right? Seeing these features light up in the auditing game for the model being evil. Dwarkesh Patel Yeah. That's so funny. Trenton Bricken Or Transluce has another example of this, where you ask a Llama model, “who is Nicholas Carlini?” For background context, Nicholas Carlini is a researcher who actually was at DeepMind and has now come over to Anthropic. But the model says, "Oh, I don't know who that is. I couldn't possibly speculate." But if you look at the features behind the scenes, you see a bunch light up for AI, computer security, all the things that Nicholas Carlini does. Sholto Douglas Interpretability becomes dramatically more important as you shift in this direction of Neuralese. Dwarkesh Patel But are we going to? Trenton Bricken It's an empirical question. I think it's somewhat likely, if only because inference is expensive. Producing tokens is expensive. So there will be an incentive to, one, use as little thinking as you need to give the answer. Two, if you're going to use thinking, use some complex compression. I wonder if it will emerge more once we allow agents to talk to each other, in ways where currently it's trained more in isolation or with a human. Sholto Douglas There'll be some selective pressure against it, so long as the agents are working with humans, because they'll want to cooperate. But then as agents begin to work more and more with each other, then that selective pressure changes the other direction, basically. Dwarkesh Patel Although somebody would still have to make the conscious decision to do end-to-end training for multiple agents to use the system of communication, right? Sholto Douglas Sure. Trenton Bricken Yeah. I mean, one scary thing though is the way we render text, you can use hidden white space tokens that also encode information. Sholto Douglas That's true. Trenton Bricken And so you can imagine a world where it looks like the agent is reasoning in its scratchpad harmlessly, but it's actually hiding a bunch of data. Dwarkesh Patel Speaking of inference compute, one thing that I think is not talked about enough is, if you do live in the world that you're painting—in a year or two, we have computer use agents that are doing actual jobs, you've totally automated large parts of software engineering—then these models are going to be incredibly valuable to use. The way you use them obviously means you need compute. Right now, there's 10 million H100 equivalents in the world. By 2028, there's going to be 100 million. But there's been estimates that an H100 has the same amount of flops as the human brain. So if you just do a very rough calculation, there's a 10 million population, if you get AGI that's as human inference-efficient. You could have 10 million AGIs now, 100 million AGIs in 2028. But presumably, you would want more. AI compute is increasing what, 2.5x or 2.25x every year right now. But at some point, say 2028, you hit wafer production limits, and that's a longer feedback loop before we can make new fabs or whatever. The question here is, are we underrating how big a bottleneck inference will be if we live in the kind of world you're painting, if we have the capabilities that you're describing? Sholto Douglas I'd want to do the math on exactly how much we can ramp up TSMC's production and this kind of stuff. What fraction of the supply chain at the moment—we need Dylan in here for this—is currently GPU? Relatively small right? 5% or something like that. Apple has a huge fraction. Are the 2028 estimates including that ramping up over time? To what? 20, 30%? Dwarkesh Patel This is just off AI 2027, but I assume it's saturated at that point. Sholto Douglas I do think this is underrated to some degree. To the extent that you don't instantly get a doubling of the world's population in 2028. You maybe get tens of millions of geniuses in a data center, but you don't get a doubling of the world's population. So a lot depends on exactly how smart they are, exactly how efficient the models are at thinking about this kind of stuff. Let's do some rough math, to fact check the H100 thing. You could probably run a 100B model, do about 1,000 tokens or something like that on an H100. 1,000 tokens a second. Humans are what? How fast can a human talk? Dwarkesh Patel There was a really interesting paper. I don't know if you saw this. Humans think at 10 tokens a second. Did you see this paper? Sholto Douglas No. Dwarkesh Patel There was this really interesting paper. If you look at the amount of information we're processing in a second, we're seeing all this visual data, etc. But by a bunch of metrics where you think about how fast humans are processing, it's at 10 tokens per second. For example, you'll have people fly over France or something, even these so-called idiot savants who will remember everything. If you think about how long their plane ride was, it's like 45 minutes. If you do 10 tokens a second, how much information would you have? It's literally exactly that. Sholto Douglas So let's take that for granted. Then it's like an H100 is 100 humans a second. Dwarkesh Patel Yeah, if you think the tokens are equivalent. Sholto Douglas If you think the tokens are equivalent. You still get pretty substantial numbers, even with your 100 million H100s and you multiply that by 100, you're starting to get to pretty substantial numbers. This does mean that those models themselves will be somewhat compute bottlenecked in many respects. But these are relatively short-term changes in timelines of progress, basically. Yes, it's highly likely we get dramatically inference bottlenecked in 2027 and 2028. The impulse to that will then be “okay, they'll just try and churn out as many possible semiconductors as we can.” There'll be some lag there. A big part of how fast we can do that will depend on how much people are feeling the AGI in the next two years as they're building out fab capacity. A lot will depend on the Taiwan situation. Is Taiwan still producing all the fabs and chips? Dwarkesh Patel There's another dynamic which was a reason Ege and Tamay, when they were on the podcast, said that they were pessimistic. One, they think we're further away from solving these problems with long-context, coherent agency, advanced multimodality than you think. Their point is that the progress that's happened in the past over reasoning or something has required many orders of magnitude increase in compute. If this scale of compute increase can’t continue beyond 2030—not just because of chips, but also because of power and raw GDP even—then because we don't think we will get it by 2030 or 2028, then the probability per year just goes down a bunch. Sholto Douglas Yeah. This is like a bimodal distribution. A conversation that I had with Leopold turned into a section in Situational Awareness called “this decade or bust”, which is on exactly this topic. Basically for the next couple of years, we can dramatically increase our training compute. And RL is going to be so exciting this year because we can dramatically increase the amount of compute that we apply to it. This is also one of the reasons why the gap between say DeepSeek and o1 was so close at the beginning of the year because they were able to apply the same amount of compute to the RL process. That compute differential actually will be magnified over the course of the year. Trenton Bricken Bringing it back to the fact that there's so much low-hanging fruit, it's been wild seeing the efficiency gains that these models have experienced over the last two years. Sholto Douglas Yes. Trenton Bricken With respect to DeepSeek, just really hammering home, and Dario has a nice essay on this. DeepSeek was nine months after Claude 3 Sonnet. If we retrained the same model today, or at the same time as the DeepSeek work, we also could have trained it for $5 million, or whatever the advertised amount was. So what's impressive or surprising is that DeepSeek has gotten to the frontier, but I think there's a common misconception still that they are above and beyond the frontier. I don't think that's right. I think they just waited and then were able to take advantage of all the efficiency gains that everyone else was also seeing. Sholto Douglas Yeah. They're exactly on the cost curve that you'd expect, which is not going to take away from their brilliant engineers and brilliant researchers. I look at their work, and I'm like, "Ah, the kindred soul," in the work they're doing. Trenton Bricken And to go from way behind the frontier to like, "Oh, this is a real player"... Sholto Douglas Is super incredible. Dwarkesh Patel People say that they have good research taste. Looking at their papers, what makes you say that? Sholto Douglas Yeah. I think their research taste is good in a way that I think Noam's research taste is good. Dwarkesh Patel Noam Brown? Sholto Douglas Noam Shazeer. Noam Brown also has good research taste, but Noam Shazeer. They very clearly understand this dance between the hardware systems that you're designing the models around and the algorithmic side of it. This is manifested in the way that the models give this sense of being perfectly designed up to their constraints. You can really very clearly see what constraints they're thinking about as they're iteratively solving these problems. Let's take the base Transformer and diff that to DeepSeek v2 and v3. You can see them running up against the memory bandwidth bottleneck in attention. Initially they do MLA to do this, they trade flops for memory bandwidth basically. Then they do this thing called NSA, where they more selectively load memory bandwidth. You can see this is because the model that they trained with MLA was on H800s, so it has a lot of flops. So they were like, "Okay, we can freely use the flops." But then the export controls from Biden came in, or they knew they would have less of those chips going forward, and so they traded off to a more memory bandwidth-oriented algorithmic solution there. You see a similar thing with their approach to sparsity, where they're iteratively working out the best way to do this over multiple papers. The part that I like is that it's simple. A big failure mode that a lot of ML researchers have is you do these overly complicated things that don't think hard enough about the hardware systems that you have in mind, whereas with the first DeepSeek sparsity MoE solution, they design these rack and node-level load balancing losses. You can see them being like, "Okay, we have to perfectly balance it on this." Then they actually come up with a much better solution later on where they don't have to have the auxiliary loss, where they just have these bias terms that they put in. And it's cool. Dwarkesh Patel Isn't that less simple? You're manually putting in a bias rather than… Sholto Douglas But balancing auxiliary loss is annoying. You're making the model trade off this thing. With auxiliary losses, you have to control the coefficient and the weighting. The bias is cleaner in some respects. Dwarkesh Patel Interesting. Did they have to change it through training? Sholto Douglas They did have to change it during training, I think. Dwarkesh Patel Does all training involve continuously fucking with these values as you're going through it? Sholto Douglas It depends on what your architecture is. But I thought it was just cute that you can see them running up into this very hardware-level constraint, trying to go, "What do we wish we could express algorithmically? What can we express under our constraints?" and iteratively solving to get better constraints. And doing this in a really simple and elegant way, and then backing it up with great engineering. I also thought it was interesting that they incorporated the multi-token prediction thing from Meta. So Meta had a nice paper on this multi-token prediction thing. Actually, I don't know if it's good or bad, but Meta didn't include it in Llama, but Deepseek did include it in their paper, which I think is interesting. Was that because they were faster at iterating and including an algorithm? Or did Meta decide that actually it wasn't a good algorithmic change at scale? I don't know. Dwarkesh Patel It was really interesting to me as somebody who's had people on the podcast to discuss this. It's interesting from the perspective of what's happening in AI right now, but also from the perspective of the fact that I've been having abstract conversations with people about what an intelligence explosion would look like, or what it would look like for AI to automate AI R&D. Just getting a more tangible sense of what's involved in making this AI progress. One of the questions I was debating with Daniel, or I was asking him, is how many of the improvements require a deep conceptual understanding versus how many are just monkeys trying ideas where you could just run a bunch in parallel. It seems like the MLA thing is motivated by this deep conceptual understanding of, “each attention head only needs to see the subspace that's relevant to its attention pattern.” I feel like that just required a lot of conceptual insight in a way that these models are especially bad at. I don't know how the load balancing thing works, but that just seems like maybe you could try it out and see what happens. Sholto Douglas Yeah, that's probably just like them trying out a whole bunch of different things. Dwarkesh Patel So what fraction is which, I'd be curious about? Trenton Bricken Yeah, I don't know about fractions. It might be like you have a hunch for a core problem, you can think of 10 possible ways to solve it, and then you just need to try them and see what works. That's where the trial and error sorcery of deep learning can kick in. Sholto Douglas And Noam Shazeer will talk about this, about how 5% of his ideas work. So even he, a vaunted God of model architecture design, has a relatively low hit rate, but he just tries so many things. Dwarkesh Patel Right. Or being able to come up with any ideas in the first place. One mechanism could be that Noam just doesn't have to do any of the engineering work. He can just abstractly express an intuition. Sholto Douglas Yeah. I actually think your rates of progress almost don't change that much depending on so long as it's able to completely implement these ideas. Dwarkesh Patel Say more? Sholto Douglas If you have Noam Shazeer at 100x speed, that's still kind of wild. There's all these fallbacks of wild worlds, where even if you don't get 100% Noam Shazeer-level intuition in model design, it's still okay if you just accelerate him by 100X. Dwarkesh Patel Right. Especially since your compute bottleneck anyway, so trying out his ideas… Or I guess he doesn't have the compute to try out all of his ideas. Trenton Bricken But Dwarkesh, you said, "Oh, well, the model can do the more straightforward things and not the deep thought." I do want to push back on that a little bit. I think, again, if the model has the right context and scaffolding, it's starting to be able to do some really interesting things. The Interp agent has been a surprise to people, even internally, at how good it is at finding the needle in the haystack when it plays the auditing game, finding this reward model bias feature, and then reasoning about it, and then systematically testing its hypotheses. So it looks at that feature, then it looks at similar features, it finds one with a preference for chocolate. It's like, "Huh, that's really weird that the model wants to add chocolate to recipes. Let me test it." So then it will make up like, "Hey, I'm trying to make a tomato soup. What would be a good ingredient for it?" And then sees that the model replies chocolate, reasons through it, and then keeps going, right? Sholto Douglas There is conceptual understanding. Deep conceptual understanding Trenton Bricken And even where, especially it's spotted, it's like, "Oh, this is a key part of its persona. I see this Oxford paper. What if I change Oxford to Stanford? What if I now say Richard Feynman really likes this thing?" It's really carving out the hypothesis space and testing things in a way that I'm kind of surprised by. Sholto Douglas Also, by the way, ML research is one of the easier things to RL on in some respects, once you get to a certain level of capability. It's a very well-defined objective function. Did the loss go down? Trenton Bricken Make number go down. Sholto Douglas Make number go down. Or make number go up, depending on which number it is. Trenton Bricken Just flip the sign. Sholto Douglas Just flip the sign. And so, once you get to the stage where your models are capable of implementing one of Noam's ideas, and then you can just let them loose and let them build that intuition of how to do scientific discovery. The key thing here, again, is the feedback loops of. I expect scientific areas where you are able to put it in a feedback loop to have, eventually, superhuman performance. Trenton Bricken One prediction I have is that we're going to move away from “can an agent do XYZ”, and more towards “can I efficiently deploy, launch 100 agents and then give them the feedback they need, and even just be able to easily verify what they're up to” right? There's this generator verifier gap that people talk about where it's much easier to check something than it is to produce the solution on your own. But it's very plausible to me, we'll be at the point where it's so easy to generate with these agents that the bottleneck is actually, can I as the human verify the answer? And again, you're guaranteed to get an answer with these things. So, ideally, you have some automated way to evaluate and test a score for how well it worked, how well did this thing generalize? And at a minimum, you have a way to easily summarize what a bunch of agents are finding. It's like, okay, well if 20 of my 100 agents all found this one thing, then it has a higher chance of being true. Sholto Douglas And again, software engineering is going to be the leading indicator of that, right? Over the remainder of the year, basically we're going to see progressively more and more experiments of the form of how can I dispatch work to a software engineering agent in such a way that it’s async? Claude 4 has GitHub integration, where you can ask it to do things on GitHub, ask it to do pull requests, this kind of stuff that's coming up. OpenAI’s Codex is example of this basically. You can almost see this in the coding startups. I think of this product exponential in some respects where you need to be designing for a few months ahead of the model, to make sure that the product you build is the right one. You saw last year, Cursor hit PMF with Claude 3.5 Sonnet. They were around for a while before, but then the model was finally good enough that the vision they had of how people would program, hit. And then Windsurf bet a little bit more aggressively even on the agenticness of the model, with longer-running agentic workflows and this kind of stuff. I think that's when they began competing with Cursor, when they bet on that particular vision. The next one is you're not even in the loop, so to speak. You're not in an IDE. But you're asking the model to go do work in the same way that you would ask someone on your team to go do work. That is not quite ready yet. There are still a lot of tasks where you need to be in the loop. But the next six months look like an exploration of exactly what that trendline looks like. Trenton Bricken But just to be really concrete or pedantic about the bottlenecks here, a lot of it is, again, just tooling. And are the pipes connected? A lot of things, I can't just launch Claude and have it go and solve because maybe it needs a GPU, or maybe I need very careful permissioning so that it can't just take over an entire cluster and launch a whole bunch of things. So you really do need good sandboxing and the ability to use all of the tools that are necessary. Sholto Douglas And we're almost certainly under-eliciting dramatically. When you look at METR’s evals of can the model solve the task, they're there solving them for hours over multiple iterations. Eventually, one of them is like, "Oh, yeah. I've come back and I've solved the task." Me, at the moment at least, maybe the fault is my own. But I try the model on doing something, and if it can't do it, I'm like, "Okay, fine. I'll do it." Dwarkesh Patel Which is so interesting because we don't even treat other humans this way. Sholto Douglas Right. Exactly. Dwarkesh Patel If you hire a new employee, you're not like... Sholto Douglas "I'll do it." Dwarkesh Patel You're going to spend literally weeks giving them feedback whereas we'll give up on a model in minutes. Sholto Douglas Yes, exactly. Trenton Bricken But I think part of it is, it it async or not? Sholto Douglas Yes. Trenton Bricken And if it's human in the loop, then it's so much more effortful unless it's getting a reply immediately... I've noticed if I don't have a second monitor with Claude Code always open in the second monitor, I won't really use it. It's only when it's right there, and I can send off something. If it hits, great. If not, I'm working on it at the same time. Sholto Douglas But this more async form factor, I expect to really quite dramatically improve the experience of these models. Trenton Bricken Interesting, interesting. Sholto Douglas You can just say, let's see if it can do that. Let's give it a whirl. Try 10 different approaches. Trenton Bricken Yeah, just fire it off. Sholto Douglas Fire it off. Dwarkesh Patel Before we end this episode, I do want to get back at this crux of why does the progress that you're talking about in computer use agents, and white collar work happen over the next few years? Why is this not a thing that takes decades? I think the crux comes down to the people who expect something much longer have a sense that… When I had Ege and Tamay on my podcast, they were like, "Look, you could look at AlphaGo, and say, 'Oh, this is a model that can do exploration. AlphaZero can generalize to new video games. It has all these priors about how to engage with the world, and so forth." Sholto Douglas And the intellectual ceiling is really high. Dwarkesh Patel Yeah, exactly. In retrospect, obviously a bunch of the methods are still used today in deep learning, and you can see similar things in the models that we train today. But it was fundamentally not a baby AGI that we just had to add a little sprinkle of something else on top of in order to make it the LLMs of today. I just want to very directly address this crux of, why are LLMs in a much different position of respect to true AGI than AlphaZero? Why are they actually the base on which adding in a few extra drops of this kind of care, and attention gets us to human-level intelligence? Sholto Douglas I think one important point is that when you look at AlphaZero, it does have all of those ingredients. In particular I think the intellectual ceiling goes quite—contra what I was saying before, which is we've demonstrated this incredible complexity of math, and programming problems… I do think that the type of task and setting that AlphaZero worked in this two-player perfect information game basically is incredibly friendly to RL algorithms. The reason it took so long to get to a more proto-AGI style models is you do need to crack that general conceptual understanding of the world, and language, and this kind of stuff, and you need to get the initial reward signal on tasks that you care about in the real world, which are harder to specify than games. I think then that sort of gradient signal that comes from the real world, all of a sudden you get access to it, and you can start climbing it, whereas Alpha Zero didn't ever have the first rung to pull on. Trenton Bricken Yeah, yeah. This goes back to the monkeys on the typewriter and the pre-training model. Until you had something like GPT-3/GPT-4, it just couldn't generate coherent enough sentences to even begin to do RLHF, and tell it what you liked and didn't like. Dwarkesh Patel Yeah. If we don't have even reasonably robust, or weakly robust computer use agents by this time next year, are we living in the bust timeline as in “2030, or bust”? Sholto Douglas I would be extremely surprised if that was the case. I think that would be somewhat of an update towards, there's something strangely difficult about this computer use in particular. I don't know if it's the bust timeline, but it's definitely the, I would update on this being lengthening of timeline. Trenton Bricken I think more and more it's no longer a question of speculation. If people are skeptical, I'd encourage using Claude Code, or some agentic tool like it and just seeing what the current level of capabilities are. Dwarkesh Patel Tweeting is so much easier. Trenton Bricken But seriously, the models are getting really capable at tasks that we care about, and we can give them enough data for. The circuit's results from interpretability are also pointing in the direction that they're doing very reasonable generalizable things. This question matters a lot, but I'm surprised by how many deep learning critics just haven't really interacted with the models, or haven't in a while. Sholto Douglas And constantly move the goalposts. Trenton Bricken The Turing test used to be a thing. We don't even talk about it, and it'd be silly to think that it was a meaningful test. Sholto Douglas Now one caveat on that is if software engineering is just dramatically better than computer use and computer use still sucks, then I'd still be like, “oh, maybe everyone just kept focused on software engineering.” It was just by far the most valuable thing, every marginal person and dollar went towards software engineering. I don't think that's the case. I do think computer use is valuable enough that people will care about it. That's my one escape patch that I'm putting in place for next year. Dwarkesh Patel Yeah, it would be good from an alignment perspective, too. Because I think you kind of do need a wider range of skills before you can do something super scary. Sholto Douglas Like if the models didn't get any better? Dwarkesh Patel Yeah, if they're superhuman coders, but they're not Henry Kissinger level… Trenton Bricken I don't know. That seems okay. If we have AI oracles. Dwarkesh Patel Yeah, that's what I'm saying. That's good. Dwarkesh Patel If you look back at AI discourse going back a decade, there's a sense that there's dumb AI, then there's AGI, then there's ASI, that intelligence is the scalar value. The way you've been talking about these models has a sense of jaggedness. It's especially tuned to environments in which it's been trained a lot or has a lot of data. Is there a sense in which it still makes sense to talk about the general intelligence of these models? Is there enough meta learning and transfer learning that is distinguished between the sizes of models or the way models are trained? Or are we moving into a regime where it's not about intelligence, it's more so about domain? Sholto Douglas One intuition pump is that this conversation was had a lot when models were GPT-2 sized and fine-tuned for various things. People would find that the models were dramatically better at things that they were fine-tuned for. But by the time you get to GPT-4, when it's trained on a wide enough variety of things with the total compute, it generalized very well across all of the individual sub-tasks. And it actually generalized better than smaller fine-tuned models in a way that was extremely useful. I think right now what we're seeing with RL is pretty much the same story playing out. There's this jaggedness of things that they're particularly trained at. But as we expand the total amount of compute that we do RL with, you'll start to see the same transition from GPT-2 fine-tunes to GPT-3, GPT-4, unsupervised meta learning and generalization across things. I think we're already seeing early evidence of this in its ability to generalize reasoning to things. But I think this will be extremely obvious soon. Trenton Bricken One nice example of this is just the ability or notion to backtrack. You go down one solution path, "Oh, wait, let me try another one." And this is something that you start to see emerge in the models through RL training on harder tasks. I think right now, it's not generalizing incredibly well. Sholto Douglas Well, I mean have we ever RL'd the model to be an interp agent? No. Trenton Bricken I mean, no. Yeah, exactly. Sholto Douglas So all this time we're talking about, “oh, it's only good at things it’s been RL’d for”. Well, it's pretty good at that because that is a mixture of science and understanding language and coding. There's this sort of mixture of domains here, all of which you need to understand. You need to be both a great software engineer and be able to think through language and state of mind and almost philosophize in some respects to be an interpret agent. And it is generalizing from the training to do that. Dwarkesh Patel What's the end game here? Claude 8 comes out and they give it to you and dot, dot, dot, you say, "thumbs up." What's happened? What have you learned? Trenton Bricken Yeah. I mean, it really depends upon the timeline at which we get Claude 8 and the models hit like ASL-4 capabilities, right? Fundamentally, we're just going to use whatever tools we have at the time and see how well they work. Ideally, we have this enumerative safety case where we can almost verify or prove that the model will behave in particular ways. In the worst case, we use the current tools like when we won the auditing game of seeing what features are active when the assistant tag lights off. Dwarkesh Patel Can you back up? Can you explain, what is mechanistic interpretability? What are features? What are circuits? Trenton Bricken Totally. Mechanistic interpretability—or the cool kids call it mech interp—is trying to reverse engineer neural networks and figure out what the core units of computation are. Lots of people think that because we made neural networks, because they're artificial intelligence, we have a perfect understanding of how they work. It couldn't be further from the truth. Neural networks, AI models that you use today, are grown, not built. So, we then need to do a lot of work after they're trained to figure out to the best of our abilities how they're actually going about their reasoning. And so, three and a half years ago, this kind of agenda of applying mechanistic interpretability to large language models started with Chris Olah leaving OpenAI, co-founding Anthropic. And every roughly six months since then, we've had a major breakthrough in our understanding of these models. And so first with toy models of superposition, we established that models are really trying to cram as much information as they possibly can into their weights. And this goes directly against people saying that neural networks are over-parameterized. In classic AI machine learning back in the day, you would use linear regression or something like it, and people had a meme of AI, or neural networks, deep learning, using way too many parameters. There's this funny meme that you should show of layers on the X axis and layers on the Y axis and this jiggly line that just goes up and it's like, "Oh, just throw more layers at it." But it actually turns out that, at least for really hard tasks like being able to accurately predict the next token for the entire internet, these models just don't have enough capacity. And so they need to cram in as much as they can. And the way they learn to do that is to use each of their neurons, or units of computation in the model, for lots of different things. And so if you try to make sense of the model and be like, "Oh, if I remove this one neuron," what is it doing in the model? It's impossible to make sense of it. It'll fire for like Chinese and fishing and horses and, I don't know, just like a hundred different things. And it's because it's trying to juggle all these tasks and use the same neuron to do it. So that's superposition. Nine months later, we write Towards Monosemanticity, which introduces what are called sparse autoencoders. And so going off what I just said of the model trying to cram too much into too little space, we give it more space, this higher dimensional representation, where it can then more cleanly represent all of the concepts that it's understanding. And, and this was a very toy paper in so much as it was a two layer, really small, really dumb transformer. And we fit up to 16,000 features, which we thought was a ton at the time. Fast-forward nine months, we go from a two layer transformer to our Claude 3 Sonnet, frontier model at the time, and fit up to 30 million features. And this is where we start to find really interesting abstract concepts, like a feature that would fire for code vulnerabilities. And it wouldn't just fire for code vulnerabilities. It would even fire for like, you know that Chrome page you get if it's not an HTTPS URL, like "Warning, this site might be dangerous. Click to continue." And also fire for that, for example. And so it's like these much more abstract coding variables or sentiment features, amongst the 30 million. Fast-forward nine months from that, and now we have circuits. And I threw in the analogy earlier of the Ocean 11 heist team, where now you're identifying individual features across the layers of the model that are all working together to perform some complicated task. And you can get a much better idea of how it's actually doing the reasoning and coming to decisions, like with the medical diagnostics. One example I didn't talk about before with how the model retrieves facts: So you say, "What sport did Michael Jordan play?" And not only can you see it hop from like Michael Jordan to basketball and answer basketball. But the model also has an awareness of when it doesn't know the answer to a fact. And so, by default, it will actually say, "I don't know the answer to this question." But if it sees something that it does know the answer to, it will inhibit the "I don't know" circuit and then reply with the circuit that it actually has the answer to. So, for example, if you ask it, "Who is Michael Batkin?" —which is just a made-up fictional person— it will by default just say, "I don't know." It's only with Michael Jordan or someone else that it will then inhibit the "I don't know" circuit. But what's really interesting here and where you can start making downstream predictions or reasoning about the model, is that the "I don't know" circuit is only on the name of the person. And so, in the paper we also ask it, "What paper did Andrej Karpathy write?" And so it recognizes the name Andrej Karpathy, because he's sufficiently famous, so that turns off the "I don't know" reply. But then when it comes time for the model to say what paper it worked on, it doesn't actually know any of his papers, and so then it needs to make something up. And so you can see different components and different circuits all interacting at the same time to lead to this final answer. Dwarkesh Patel Why think it's a tractable problem to understand every single thing that's happening in a model? Or like that's the best way to understand why it's being deceptive. If you wanted to explain why England won World War II using particle physics, you would just be on the wrong track. You just want to look at the high-level explanations of, who had more weapons? What did they want? That seems analogous to just training linear probes for like, are you honest? Are you being deceptive? Do we catch you doing bad things when we're red teaming you? Can we monitor you? Why is this not analogous where we're asking a particle physicist to just backtrack and explain why England won World War II? Trenton Bricken I feel like you just want to go in with your eyes wide open, not making any assumptions for what that deception is going to look like, or what the trigger might be. The wider you can cast that net, the better. Depending on how quickly AI accelerates and where the state of our tools are, we might not be in the place where we can prove from the ground up that everything is safe. But I feel like that's a very good North Star. It's a very powerful reassuring North Star for us to aim for, especially when we consider we are part of the broader AI safety portfolio. I mean, do you really trust—you're about to deploy this system and you really hope it's aligned with humanity—that you've successfully iterated through all the possible ways that it's going to scheme or sandbag or… Dwarkesh Patel But that's also probably going to be true with whatever you find. You're still going to have variants that you haven't explained. Or you found a feature, but you don't know if it actually explains deception or something else instead. Trenton Bricken First of all, I'm not saying you shouldn't try the probing approach. We want to pursue the entire portfolio. We've got the therapist interrogating the patient by asking, "Do you have any troubling thoughts?" We've got the linear probe, which I'd analogize to a polygraph test where we're taking very high level summary statistics of the person's well-being. Then we've got the neurosurgeons going in and seeing if you can find any brain components that are activating and troubling or off-distribution ways. I think we should do all of it. Dwarkesh Patel What percent of the alignment portfolio should mech interp be? Trenton Bricken I think as much of a chunk as is necessary. It’s hard to define. At Anthropic, I feel like all of the different portfolios are being very well-supported and growing. Sholto Douglas Coming back to the World War II question, you can think of it as a hierarchy of abstractions of trust here, where let's say you want to go and talk to Churchill. It helps a lot if you can verify that in that conversation, in that 10 minutes, he's being honest. This enables you to construct better meta narratives of what's going on. So maybe particle physics wouldn't help you there, but certainly the neuroscience of Churchill's brain would help you verify that he was being trustworthy in that conversation and that the soldiers on the front lines were being honest in their depiction of their description of what happened, this kind of stuff. So long as you can verify parts of the tree up, then that massively helps you build confidence. Trenton Bricken I think language models are also just really weird. With the emergent misalignment work. I don't know if they took predictions, they should have of like, "Hey, I'm going to fine tune ChatGPT on code vulnerabilities. Is it going to become a Nazi?" I think most people would've said no. That's what happened. Dwarkesh Patel How did they discover that it became a Nazi? Trenton Bricken They started asking it a ton of different questions and it will do all sorts of vile and harmful things. The whole persona just totally changes. We are dealing with alien brains here who don't have the social norms of humans. We don’t even have a clear notion of what they have and haven't learned. I think you really want to go into this with eyes wide open. Dwarkesh Patel Backing up from mech interp, if we live in a world where AI progress accelerates… By the way, you were mentioning a little while ago that there's many wild worlds we could be living in, but we're living in at least one of them. Another one that we've gestured at but it's worth making more explicit, is this. Even if the AI models are not helping write the next training algorithm for their successor, just the fact that if they had human level learning efficiency—whatever copy of the model is learning on the job—the whole model is learning. So in effect, it's getting– Sholto Douglas Or even if they're like a thousand times less efficient than humans are at learning and you deployed them. Even still. Dwarkesh Patel Exactly. Anyways, there's a whole bunch of other things that you can think of about it. But even there, you kind of have a broadly deployed intelligence explosion. Sholto Douglas I do think it's worth pressing on that future. There is this whole spectrum of crazy futures. But the one that I feel we're almost guaranteed to get—this is a strong statement to make—is one where at the very least, you get a drop-in white collar worker at some point in the next five years. I think it's very likely in two, but it seems almost overdetermined in five. On the grand scheme of things, those are kind of irrelevant timeframes. It's the same either way. That completely changes the world over the next decade. If we don't have the right policies in place for that, then you end up actually with in some respects, almost a fundamentally worse world. Because the thing that these models get good at by default is software engineering and computer using agents and this kind of stuff. Then we will need to put in extra effort to put them in the loops where they help us with scientific research. Or we have the right robotics, such that we actually experience an increase in material quality of life. That's worth thinking about. If you're in the perspective of like, “I'm a country, what should I be doing or thinking about?” Plan for the case where white collar work is automateable. And then consider, what does that mean for your economy? What you should be doing to prepare policy? Dwarkesh Patel What should you be doing to prepare? Because honestly, this is such a tough question if you're India or Nigeria or Australia. If you're a country unlike America or China where they do have frontier models, what is it that you should be doing right now? Especially on such a short timescale. Sholto Douglas I think one very important point is that let's say this scenario turns out true. Then compute becomes the most valuable resource in the world. The GDP of your economy is dramatically affected by how much compute you can deploy towards the organizations within your country. So having some guaranteed amount of compute I think will actually be quite important. Getting ahead of investments, and data centers, and this kind of stuff on the condition that it's companies in your country have to be allowed to use that compute, not necessarily for training but just even just for inference. I think the economic value here comes from inference. I think it also makes sense to invest broadly in AI. These countries have the opportunity to do so and that's a portfolio of foundation model companies but also robotics, supply chain, and this kind of stuff. I think that you should invest very proactively in policies that try to prevent capital lock-in. We're in for a much worse world if it just so happens that the people who had money in the stock exchange, or in land before AGI are dramatically more wealthy than the people who don't. It's a gross misallocation of resources. One of my favorite episodes actually on your podcast was the Georgism one where you're trying to appropriately value, or allocate land. This strikes particularly close to home coming from Australia where I think our policies with respect to land are grossly wrong. But I think this is broadly true. Being very forward on regulation of integration of these models into your country is important, and proactively making sure that people have choice. Let's say you should be quite proactive about making sure that the phones, or devices, or the glasses that people have, people have free choice on what things they run. So we just get the white collar worker, and you're trying to do the best to prepare your country for that. Then what can you do to make all possible versions of the future go well? That's covering some amount of economic downside. The other things that I think are really important is figure out how you can basically ensure dramatic upside, or cover terrible downside. Getting a dramatic upside is making sure that there is investment in biology research and this kind of stuff in an automated way such that these models are actually able to produce novel medicines that massively improve our quality of life. Covering the downside is AI alignment research, and this kind of stuff, and automated testing, and really thinking hard about that, AI safety institutes and this kind of stuff. Dwarkesh Patel But these seem like things that a random rich person could also do. It seems like there's not a thing that a nation state is uniquely equipped to do in this scenario. Sholto Douglas That's a good point. Sholto Douglas I mean dramatic allocation of resource towards compute I think is sensible. I would be doing that if I was in charge of a nation state. I think it just increases your optionality in most of the future worlds. Trenton Bricken Dylan Patel has some scary forecasts on US energy. Sholto Douglas Versus China. Yes. Trenton Bricken Yeah, we're like 34 gigawatts off. Sholto Douglas Yeah, the US's line is flat, basically, and China's line is like this. And I mean the US very clearly... Trenton Bricken We just need so many more power plants. Sholto Douglas Yes. If intelligence becomes this incredibly valuable input, intelligence becomes almost a raw input into the economies and quality of life of the future, the thing directly underneath that is energy. Making sure that you have incredible amounts of solar, like tile the desert with solar panels, some parts of the desert. That would be helpful towards making sure that you have more access to intelligence on tap. Trenton Bricken Yeah. Just to make it explicit, we've been touching on it here. Even if AI progress totally stalls, you think that the models are really spiky, and they don't have general intelligence. It's so economically valuable, and sufficiently easy to collect data on all of these different jobs, these white collar job tasks, such that to Sholto's point we should expect to see them automated within the next five years. Sholto Douglas Yeah. Trenton Bricken Even if you need to hand spoon every single task to the model. Sholto Douglas It's economically worthwhile to do so. Even if algorithmic progress stalls out, and we just never figure out how to keep progress going—which I don't think is the case, that hasn't stalled out yet, it seems to be going great—the current suite of algorithms are sufficient to automate white collar work provided you have enough of the right kinds of data. Compared to the TAM of salaries for all of those kinds of work, it is so trivially worthwhile. Trenton Bricken Yeah, exactly. I do just want to flag as well that there's a really dystopian future if you take Moravec’s paradox to its extreme. It’s this paradox where we think that the most valuable things that humans can do are the smartest things like adding large numbers in our heads, or doing any sort of white collar work. We totally take for granted our fine motor skill, and coordination. But from an evolutionary perspective it's the opposite. Evolution has optimized fine motor coordination so well. Even if you look at robot hands, the ability to open a door is still just really hard for robots. Meanwhile, we're seeing this total automation of coding, and everything else that we've seen as clever. The really scary future is one in which AIs can do everything except for the physical robotic tasks, in which case you'll have humans with AirPods, and... Sholto Douglas Glasses? Trenton Bricken Glasses, and there'll be some robot overlord controlling the human through cameras by just telling it what to do, and having a bounding box around the thing you're supposed to pick up. So you have human meat robots. Sholto Douglas Not necessarily saying that that's what the AIs would want to do, or anything like that. But if you were to be like, "What are the relative economic value of things?" The AIs are out there doing computer programming, and the most valuable thing that humans can do is be amazing robots. Now that being said, I think Moravec’s paradox is a little bit fake. I think the main reason that robots are worse at being a robot than they are at software engineering is the internet exists for software engineering. GitHub exists, and there is no equivalent thing if you had all mocap of everyone's actions as they were going about their daily lives for some reasonable fraction of the human population, robotics is also close to solved, on track to be solved at the same rate that software engineering is on track to be solved. So, this vision is only a sort of decade-long section, but it's still a pretty terrible decade. Imagine the world where people have lost their jobs, you haven't yet got novel biological research. That means people's quality of life isn’t dramatically better. You don't yet have material abundance because you haven't actually been able to action the physical world in the necessary way. You can't build dramatically more, because building dramatically more takes robots basically, and people's main comparative advantage is as fantastic robots. That’s a shocking, shocking world. Dwarkesh Patel Yeah. From the perspective of an average human, I think it actually might be better. Your wages will be higher because you're the complement to something that is enormously valuable which is AI labor. Sholto Douglas And a decade, or two after, the world is fantastic. Robotics is solved, and you start to get radical abundance basically provided that you have all the policies set up necessary to permit building. You end up with that same change like the before vs. after photos of Shanghai where 20 years on, it's this dramatically transformed city. A lot of places in the world probably end up like that over that two-decade period. But we need to do our best to estimate if this is actually what is on track to happen. Build SWE-bench, but for all the other forms of white collar work, and measure, and track. That's a great thing that governments should be doing by the way, trying to break down the functions of their economy into measurable tasks, and figuring out what does the curve actually look like for that? They might be a bit shocked by the progress there. There's no SWE-bench for a tax eval. I don't have all the answers here, but then we need to figure out a way to share the proceeds of this economy broadly across people, or invest heavily in robotics, and collect the data so that we get robotics faster, and we get material abundance faster. Invest in biological research that we get, but all that faster. Basically try and pull forward the radical upside, because otherwise you have a pretty dark section. Dwarkesh Patel I think one thing that's not appreciated enough is how much of our leverage on the future—given the fact that our labor isn't going to be worth that much—comes from our economic, and political systems surviving. For your million X'd S&P equity to mean something, for your contracts to mean anything, for the government to be able to tax the AI labor, and give you a UBI off of that, that requires our legal institutions, our economic institutions, our financial rails surviving into the future. Sholto Douglas Yes. Dwarkesh Patel The way in which that likely happens is if it's also in the AIs best interests that they follow those rails. By AI I don't mean some monolithic single AI, I just mean firms which are employing AI, and becoming more productive as a result. You don't want to be in a position where it's so onerous to operate in our system that you're basically selecting for firms who either emigrate, or who are doing black market stuff, et cetera. You want to make it super, super easy to deploy AI, have the equivalent of special economic zones, et cetera. Otherwise you are just surrendering the future outside of any control that you might have on it. One of the reasons that I worry about turning AGI into a national security issue, or having it have extremely close ties with the government, the Manhattan Project thing, is that it disproportionately redirects the use of AI towards military tech, mosquito drones and whatever. It also naturally puts other countries in the same frame of mind. If we're developing the mosquito drones, why would China not develop the mosquito drones? That just seems like a zero-sum race, and not to mention a potentially catastrophic one. Whereas compute will be limited, we'll need to disproportionately accelerate some things. To the extent it just remains totally like a consumer free market landscape, it just seems more likely that we'll get the glorious transhumanist future where they're developing the things that make human life better. Sholto Douglas Yes, I mean I agree. The case where you end up with two national projects facing off against each other is dramatically worse. We don't want to live in that world. It's much better if this stays a free market, so to speak. Dwarkesh Patel Okay. I want to take issue with your claim that even with the algorithms of today, if we just collect enough data that we could automate white collar work. First, let me get an understanding of what you mean by that. Do you mean that we would do the analogous thing of pre-raining with all the trajectories of everything people would do on their jobs? Could you make either manually, or through some other process, some RL procedure based on the screen recordings, every white collar worker. What kind of thing are you imagining? Sholto Douglas I mean a continuous distribution of this stuff. One important mental model to think about RL… There is some respect with which longer horizon, if you can do them, if you can get that reward ever, are easier to judge. Again, it's come back to that can you make money on the internet? That's an incredibly easy reward signal to judge. But to do that there's a whole hierarchy of complex behavior. So, if you could pre-train up to the easy to judge reward signals, does your website work? Does it go down, do people like it? There's all these reward signals that we can respond to because we have a long, we can progress through these long enough trajectories to actually get to interesting things. If you're stuck in this regime where you need a reward signal every five tokens, it's a way more painful, and long process. But if you could pre-train on every screen in America, then probably the RL tasks that you can design are very different from if you could only take the existing internet as it is today. How much of that you get access to changes the mix. Dwarkesh Patel As we're training them on longer, and longer horizon tasks, and it takes longer for them to get any signal on whether they successfully complete the task, will that slow down progress because it takes more compute per task? Trenton Bricken I do think there's this notion that the longer, the harder tasks, the more training is required. I'm sympathetic to that naively, but we as humans are very good at practicing the hard parts of tasks, and decomposing them. I think once models get good enough at the basic stuff, they can just rehearse, or fast-forward to the more difficult parts. Sholto Douglas I mean that's definitely one of the big complexities. As you use more compute, and as you train on more, and more difficult tasks, your rate of improvement of biology for example is going to be somewhat bound by the time it takes a cell to grow in a way that your rate of improvement on math isn't, for example. So, yes, but I think for many things we'll be able to parallelize widely enough, and get enough iteration loops. Dwarkesh Patel Will the regime of training new models go away? Will we eventually get to the point where you've got the model, and then you just keep adding more skills to it, with RL training? Sholto Douglas That depends on whether, or not you think there's a virtue in pre-training a new architecture. Basically you make some architectural change, then you probably need to do some form of at least pretraining a new model. Dwarkesh Patel If RL requires a bunch of inference to do the training in the first place, does that push against the thing you were talking about where we actually need a bigger model in order to have brain-like energy? But then also it's more expensive to train it in RL. So, where does that balance out? Trenton Bricken I think we got to drink the bitter lesson here. Yeah, there aren't infinite shortcuts. You do just have to scale and have a bigger model, and pay more inference for it. If you want AGI, then that's what you got to pay the price of. Sholto Douglas But there's a tradeoff equation here. There is science to do which everyone is doing. What is the optimal point at which to do RL? Because you need something which can both learn, and discover the sparse reward itself. So you don't want a one parameter model. Useless, even though you can run it really fast. You also don't want a 100T model. It's super slow. The marginal benefit of its learning efficiency is not worth it. So, there's a Pareto frontier here. What's the optimal model size of your current class of capabilities, and your current set of RL environments, and this kind of stuff. Trenton Bricken And even in the last year there's been much more of a factor of the inference cost. So, just explicitly the bigger the model, the more expensive it is to do a forward pass and generate tokens. The calculus used to just be, “Should I allocate my flops to more training data, or a bigger model?” And now another huge factor is how much am I actually going to do forward passes on this model once it's trained? Sholto Douglas My total pool of compute, how do I allocate that across training data compute, and inference compute for the RL training. Trenton Bricken And then even within inference, there's all this research on, well, what strategy should I use? Should I sample 10, and take the best? Do I do this sort of branching search, et cetera, et cetera. And so with RL where you're sampling a whole lot of tokens, you also need to factor in the ability for the model to actually generate those tokens, and then learn, and get feedback. Dwarkesh Patel If we're living in this world, what is your advice to somebody early in their career, or a student in college? What should they be planning on doing? Sholto Douglas Once again, it's worth considering the spectrum of possible worlds and preparing yourself for that. The action that I think is the highest EV in that case is that at a minimum you're about to get dramatically more leverage. You already have. Already the startups in YC are writing huge amounts of their code with Claude. What challenges, what causes do you want to change in the world with that added leverage? If you had 10 engineers at your beck, and call, what would you do? If you had a company at your beck and call, what would that enable you to do? What problems, and domains suddenly become tractable? That's the world you want to prepare for. Now, that still requires a lot of technical depth. Obviously there is the case where AI just becomes dramatically better than everyone at everything, but for at least a while there is… I think Jensen actually talked about this in an interview in an interesting way. He's like, "I have a hundred thousand general intelligences around me, and I'm still somewhat useful, because I’m there directing the values, and asking them to do things. I still have value even though I have a hundred thousand general intelligences." For many people, I think that will still be true for a fair while. Then as the AIs get better, and better, and better, and so on, eventually, no. But again, prepare for the spectrum of possible worlds because in the event where we're just totally outcompeted, it doesn't matter what you do. In all the other worlds, it matters a lot. Get the technical depth, study biology, study CS, study physics. Think hard about what challenges you want to solve in the world. Dwarkesh Patel Yeah, that's a lot of topics. That's a lot of shit. Sholto Douglas You can now. You can. It's so much easier to learn. Everyone now has the infinite perfect tutor. Dwarkesh Patel It's definitely been helpful to me. Trenton Bricken I would say some combination of: get rid of the sunk cost of your previous workflows, or expertise in order to evaluate what AI can do for you. Another way to put this, which is fun, is just be lazier in so much as you figure out the way that the agent can do the things that are toilsome. Ultimately, you get to be lazier, but in the short run, you need to critically think about the things you're currently doing, and what an AI could actually be better at doing, and then go, and try it, or explore it. Because I think there's still just a lot of low-hanging fruit of people assuming, and not writing the full prompt, giving a few examples, connecting the right tools for your work to be accelerated and automated. Dwarkesh Patel Yep, yep. There's also the sunk cost of feeling like since you're not "early to AI", that you've sort of missed the boat. I remember when GPT-3 came out… So backstory on the podcast, when I graduated college I was planning on doing some sort of AI wrapper startup, and the podcast was just a gateway into doing that. I was trying out different things and at the time I remember thinking, “oh, 3.5 is out.” People were like, "I'm so behind on the startup scene here” or whatever. If I wanted to make my own wrapper… maybe the idea of the wrapper was inadvisable in the first place. But every time feels early because if it's an exponentially growing process, and there are many things, many ideas which are only becoming possible now, right? Sholto Douglas Exactly. It's that product exponential I talked about. Dwarkesh Patel That's right. Sholto Douglas Products literally obsolete it. You need to constantly reinvent yourself to stay at the frontier of capabilities. Dwarkesh Patel Do you remember? I had a really shitty idea, and I gave you a call. Sholto Douglas I don’t remember what it was. Dwarkesh Patel I think it was like RAG for lawyers, or something. Anyways, I think one of our first interactions was like, "Hey, what do you think of this idea?" And you were like, “I think the podcast sounds promising.” Sholto Douglas I was right. Dwarkesh Patel Which I appreciate. Trenton Bricken Yeah. I got slightly annoyed at a friend recently who I think is really talented and clever and interested in AI but has pursued a biology route. I just kind of tried to shake them like, "You can work on AI if you want to." Humans are biological general intelligences where a lot of the things of value are just very general. Whatever kind of specialization that you've done maybe just doesn't matter that much. Again, it gets back to the sunk cost, but so many of the people, even my colleagues at Anthropic are excited about AI. They just don't let their previous career be a blocker. Because they're just innately smart, talented, driven, whatever else, they end up being very successful and finding roles. It's not as if they were in AI forever. I mean, people have come from totally different fields. Don't think that you need permission from some abstract entity to get involved, and apply, and be able to contribute. Dwarkesh Patel If somebody wanted to be an AI researcher right now, if you could give them an open problem, or the kind of open problem that is very likely to be quite impressive, what would it be? Sholto Douglas I think that now that RL's come back, papers building on Andy Jones's “Scaling scaling laws for board games” are interesting. Investigating these questions like the ones you asked before. Is the model actually learning to do more than its previous pass at K? Or is it just discovering that… Exploring questions like that deeply are interesting, scaling laws for RL, basically. Dwarkesh Patel I'd be very curious to see how much the marginal increase is in meta learning from a new task, or something. Trenton Bricken On that note, I think model diffing has a bunch of opportunities. People say, "Oh, we're not capturing all the features. There's all this stuff left on the table." What is that stuff that's left on the table? If the model's jailbroken, is it using existing features that you've identified? Is it only using the error terms that you haven't captured? I don't know. There's a lot here. I think MATS is great. The Anthropic fellowship has been going really well. Goodfire, Anthropic invested in recently, they're doing a lot of interpretability work, or just apply directly to us. Dwarkesh Patel Anything to get your equity up, huh? Trenton Bricken There's just so many interpretability projects. There's so much low-hanging fruit, and we need more people, and I don't think we have much time. Sholto Douglas I also want to make a plug for performance engineering. This is one of the best ways to demonstrate that you have the raw ability to do it. If you made an extremely efficient transform implementation on TPU, or Trainium, or Incuda, then I think there's a pretty high likelihood that you'll get a job offer. But there's a relatively small pool of people that you can trust to completely own end-to-end the performance of a model. Trenton Bricken And if you have broad, deep electrical engineering skills, I think you can probably come up to speed pretty fast on accelerator stuff. Sholto Douglas You can come up to speed reasonably fast and it teaches you a lot of good intuitions of the actual intricacies of what's going on in the models, which means that you're then very well-placed to think about architecture and this kind of stuff. One of my favorite people in thinking about architecture at Anthropic at the moment actually came from a heavy GPU kernel programming background and just knows the ins, and outs really deeply. He can think about the trade-offs really well. Dwarkesh Patel This was fun guys. Thanks for doing it again. Trenton Bricken Great to be back. Ready for more?

Title: Watch These IonQ Price Levels After Quantum Stock Soared 37% on Thursday

IonQ (IONQ) shares surged Thursday to lead quantum computing stocks higher as the company’s CEO said it aims to become the Nvidia (NVDA) of quantum computing. CEO Niccolo de Masi told Barron’s in an interview that the company is “in the business of quantum just like Nvidia and Broadcom (AVGO) are in the business of classical GPUs,” asserting that he believes IonQ will be the Nvidia player. The remarks come after D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) earlier this week announced the launch of its next gen quantum computer, known as Advantage2, underpinning bullish sentiment across Wall Street’s latest hottest sector. IonQ shares jumped 37% to $45.79 on Thursday, pushing the stock into positive territory for 2025. The shares have more than doubled from their early-April lows and have risen more than five fold over the last year, as investors bet that quantum computing will revolutionize areas like drug discovery, cybersecurity, and finance. Below, we take a closer look at IonQ’s chart and apply technical analysis to identify price levels that investors will likely be watching. After finding support at the closely watched 200-day moving average, IonQ shares trended higher within a rising wedge before staging a volume-backed breakout above the pattern in Thursday’s trading session. While the relative strength index confirms bullish price momentum with a reading above the 70 threshold, the indicator also flashes overbought conditions that could trigger short-term profit-taking. Let’s identify two key overhead areas on IonQ’s chart to watch amid the stock’s recent buying and also locate support levels worth monitoring during potential retracements. The first overhead area to watch sits around $55. Investors who have accumulated shares during the rising wedge could look for exit points at this level near the stock’s all-time high. To forecast an upside price target above the all-time high, investors can use the bars pattern tool. When applying the technique to IonQ’s chart, we extract the price bars comprising the stock’s uptrend from November to January and reposition them from today’s breakout point. This analysis projects a target of around $100, about 120% above Thursday’s closing price. We selected this prior move higher as it commenced following a one-day gain of around 35%, similar to Thursday’s percentage change. It's also worth noting that trend played out over 40 trading days, meaning a similar move from the current breakout could last until late July if price action rhymes. During retracements in the stock, investors should initially monitor the $28 level. This area on the chart finds support from the nearby rising 50-day MA and a horizontal line that connects a range of trading activity on the chart extending back to last November. Finally, selling below this level could see IonQ shares revisit lower support around $18. Investors may seek buying opportunities in this location near the late-October peak and early-March trough.

Title: “The future of retail”: Walmart eliminates 1,500 jobs to replace with AI

Brooke Sjoberg In recent years, many large companies have chosen to embrace automated intelligence to help produce leaner, more efficient operations at the corporate level. For the most part, this has mostly occurred in the technology sector at companies like Microsoft, as well as Google and Amazon. A total of about 61,000 technology sector jobs have been caught in the crossfire of layoffs in the wake of companies adopting AI. But it’s not just tech companies, as retail businesses have entered the chat. Even the company known for the smiling faces of its door greeters has fallen to AI use. That’s right—the company known for literal smiley faces as part of its branding in the early aughts has announced it will lay off 1,500 of its employees at the corporate level. Most of these positions are concentrated in the Bentonville, Arkansas, and Hoboken, New Jersey hubs, as reported by FingerLakes1.com. According to reporting on the issue from FingerLakes, the Bentonville-headquartered company is choosing to restructure to “sharpen focus” and embrace automation. The cuts were described by Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner and Global Chief Technology Officer Suresh Kumar in a joint letter to employees as necessary for building the “future of retail,” FingerLakes reports. “We are eliminating roles as well as opening some new ones aligned with our business priorities and growth strategy,” the memo shared with employees reads. The use of automated intelligence in the retail space has become a hot-button issue for many retailers. Just as Walmart has made its intention to use AI in corporate roles public, Starbucks has elected to “go slow” on its rollout of AI and focus on higher staffing. Notably, Amazon began using AI-powered audio product summaries to help shoppers learn more about other customers’ experiences. On the customer-facing side of operations, Walmart is also reportedly preparing for shoppers to use AI to build grocery lists and potentially make purchasing decisions for them. As the company catches heat amid national conversations about tariffs, company officials have reportedly confirmed that the retailer will absorb some of the cost increase, as well as pass a portion of it to consumers. Regarding layoffs, impacted employees will receive support in this transition, representatives of Walmart said, as reported by FingerLakes. Despite the cuts, the company said it would likely be adding positions related to AI and “digital transformation.” Internet culture is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.
