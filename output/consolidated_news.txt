Title: Would You Buy a Fighter Jet From Donald Trump?
URL: http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-f-35-fighter-jet-allies.html
Time Published: 2025-03-24T09:00:43Z
Full Content:
Not so long ago, the F-35 fighter jet was the hottest ticket in the international arms market. Though it had suffered teething pains in development, going over budget by 50 percent in its first decade, Lockheed Martin’s Lightning II glowed up into a remarkably capable weapons platform. Stealthy, supersonic, and able to both dogfight and strike targets on the ground, it’s arguably the most sophisticated weapon in the U.S. arsenal and undeniably the most sought-after. As nation after nation held competitions to choose their next frontline fighter, the F-35 came in and trounced its rivals time and again. “I can’t think of a competition that it entered in Europe that it didn’t win,” says Douglas Barrie, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “Anywhere Lockheed Martin pitched the F-35, it wound up getting chosen.” Today, some 18 years after its first flight, more than 1,000 F-35s are in operation in 20 countries. But then, earlier this month, something happened. One after another, nations that had signed up for the F-35 started voicing qualms. On March 13, Portugal’s defense minister said that the country would cancel plans to buy the plane. Then Canada’s prime minister said it would reconsider its purchase. Germany, too, is said to be wavering in its commitment to the jet. Nothing had changed about the plane’s performance. It’s just that, in the eyes of some international customers, the F-35 can’t fully be trusted anymore because of who is the commander-in-chief. Donald Trump has an affinity for authoritarianism, has exhibited poor treatment of NATO (whose Article 5 obligates collective defense), and, in particular, has threatened to annex Greenland and Canada. “Canada is one of our closest allies, and they have fought with us. They have died with us,” says Cynthia Cook, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “And to have the new president of the United States cast doubt on their independence is really viewed as a challenging pill to swallow. It’s making the U.S. be seen as a less reliable ally.” The long-term effects of America’s heel turn might not just be deleterious for the F-35 program but for the $238 billion U.S. weapons-export industry as a whole, including the recently announced Boeing F-47 next-generation fighter, which could enter service in the 2030s. If the “arsenal of democracy” no longer stands on the side of democracies, what is it good for? To understand why the F-35 is suddenly in trouble, the first thing you need to know is that a state-of-the-art fighter jet isn’t just a physical airframe. It’s both hardware and software, a whole suite of networked systems that requires software patches and data in order to work effectively. It’s a bit like a smartphone: If you don’t update the software, it gradually works less and less well and eventually bricks. The F-35 has to depend on software because of the environment it will fight in. Even though the plane is stealthy, meaning hard to detect by conventional radar, it is not invisible and will not survive long in a modern air-defense environment unless it can track and assess enemy radars and countermeasures. To do that, it needs to constantly update its assessment of the threat environment. That information is stored inside a software package called the mission data file, or MDF. The software is updated by a civilian unit located at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida called the F-35 Partner Support Complex, whose website explains that nations deploying the F-35 “are not allowed to conduct independent test operations” outside the U.S. and that “U.S. citizens perform specific functions in order to protect critical U.S. technology.” In other words, any one nation that flies the F-35 is wholly dependent on the U.S. to keep the planes functioning properly. When the program launched, this provision rankled some allies, but it didn’t prove to be a deal-breaker because it was inconceivable at the time that the U.S. would ever be anything other than a trusted ally. (Israel, presciently, insisted on retaining control of the F-35’s software and today operates the aircraft with considerably more autonomy.) Buying planes that they don’t fully control now looks like an incredibly poor decision. Since Trump took office, Europe’s trust in its ally has withered as the U.S. has pivoted from democracy toward autocracy, increasingly aligned with Europe’s most dangerous adversary, Russia. As the legendary aviation journalist Bill Sweetman writes, “A hypothetical: A crisis is emerging, and U.S. strategy and policy differs from that of a partner nation; the U.S. is not going to intervene militarily at any likely threshold. The pressure point is simple: The door code at Eglin is changed. The partner nation’s people can’t get in.” Effectively, the F-35 is bricked. The delicacy of the situation that Europe now finds itself in goes far beyond the F-35 or any of the other major weapons systems that it is heavily dependent on the U.S. to maintain and operate, like the U.K.’s nuclear-weapons program. It’s that the whole defense edifice, from top to bottom, has been designed with a deep level of interdependence baked in. “One of the strengths of the U.S. defense industrial cooperation is we’re able to incorporate the best offerings from our allies and partners from their technological advances,” Cook says. “It’s something that our adversaries like Russia and China can envy but not replicate.” The idea that the U.S. would just walk away from a global security system that it has spent the better part of a century building and nurturing, and which undergirds the country’s global power, is nearly incomprehensible. For Europeans, it’s a bit like coming home and finding your husband in bed with the au pair. The swiftness and profundity of the betrayal is so enraging that a lifetime of commitment can vanish in an instant. “Since I’ve been born, all I’ve ever known was a U.S. alliance,” says Thomas Withington, a white-haired associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, Britain’s venerable defense think tank. “Occasionally, there’s been good-natured criticism on both sides of the Atlantic. But nobody has ever envisaged a world in which the U.S. and Europe are not very strong security partners. And what’s shocking to me now is that I have a number of friends — mainly French but German and Italian as well — who were quite strong Atlanticists but have totally changed their position in the last two weeks. “I was having a drink with a colleague last week, and he said that he remembered vividly how in the wake of 9/11, the U.S. declared Article 5 and pretty much all allied nations around the world stepped up. And he said, ‘God forbid if that happens again, because we would never assist America in any future wars.’ He was very adamant: Europe must not come to U.S. aid in the future. The U.S. is on its own.” “Trust is hard to win, and it’s really easy to lose,” Barrie says. “Even if this is a four-year blip in terms of the transatlantic relationship, it’s going to take a bit of time to move back toward a more balanced position.” For now, even if Trump’s most ominous pronouncements turn out to be mere bluster, Europe has been forced to confront how exposed it is. With remarkable speed, it has pivoted to the consensus that it needs to achieve self-reliance as quickly as it can, and that means replacing U.S. weapons and capabilities with those of a more dependable origin. With a friendly neighbor locked in an interminable and grinding bloodbath, the sense of urgency is real. As for the U.S., it is hard to see how it is going to come out ahead in this realignment. Trump often talks about rebuilding American manufacturing and restoring American military power around the world, but by torpedoing allies’ trust in us, he has profoundly undermined the strategic capabilities of the U.S. military and tied an anchor around the defense industry, which last year reached a record-breaking $318 billion in overseas sales. “The U.S. defense industry lives off exports,” says Withington. “And anything that that reduces that will have a serious effect — and not only on the defense companies themselves but all of the businesses around them geographically. Think about all of the businesses that support the F-35 line in Fort Worth, everything from sandwich joints to real-estate agents and Uber drivers. There’s a whole ecosystem that’s developed. I saw what happened when the U.K.’s defense industry had to retool post–Cold War. Towns that were dependent on it just died.” If there’s a winner in all this, it’s Vladimir Putin. “If you were to sit down with a blank sheet of paper and say, ‘What are the things, both in terms of domestic and international policy, that an American leader could do that would best suit Russia’s and China’s long-range strategic goals and visions?,’ it looks a lot like the last 70 days,” says Steven Horrell, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis. Another big beneficiary is European weapons-makers. Amid a planned surge in regional defense spending, French president Emmanuel Macron is pushing the Dassault Rafale as an alternative to the F-35, and Airbus is doing the same with the Eurofighter Typhoon. Sweden’s Saab, which makes the Gripen fighter jet, has seen its share price double since Trump took office, and German arms titan Rheinmetall has also doubled its stock value since last year. “If you’re a European defense aerospace manufacturer,” says Barrie, “somebody else is doing your marketing work for you at the moment, and that’s the U.S.” By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.

Title: The manager of a $41 billion BlackRock bond fund yielding 6.4% shares where investors can get max returns for the least risk
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/bond-market-trade-offers-max-returns-for-least-risk-blackrock-2025-3
Time Published: 2025-03-24T08:30:01Z
Full Content:
With stocks down to start 2025, the consistent and relatively strong returns you can find in the fixed-income market may look attractive right about now. Cash equivalents like 3-month Treasury bills still offer yields above 4% as the Federal Reserve keeps interest rates elevated. But the best place to be sitting at the moment is a bit further up in duration, according to Russ Brownback, the global head of macro positioning for fixed income and a co-portfolio manager of the $41 billion BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities Fund (BSIIX). Brownback's fund currently yields 6.4% if held to maturity and is overweight short-to-medium-term securities. With a flat yield curve, this approach locks in income a bit longer than cash equivalents but saves investors from the volatility that the potential for rising inflation or a recession could bring to longer-duration assets, he said. While the Bloomberg Barclays Aggregate Bond Index has a duration of about 6.5 years, Brownback's fund has about 3.5. "We hold about 70% of our duration five years and shorter," he told BI. But it's not just a matter of duration. To generate the 6.4% yield, Brownback tries to mix up the perfect cocktail of riskier assets with safer ones. Around 28% of the fund is in commercial mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, and non-agency mortgages, he said. By diversifying these riskier assets with higher-quality AAA securitized products, as well as with both higher- and lower-quality corporate credit, you get a robust return, Brownback said. AAA-rated credit is the highest class of investment-grade bonds, meaning the assets have the lowest risk levels. "That is the real sweet spot," Brownback said of the mix. "As long as we're owning that in a diversified way, that's about the highest Sharpe Ratio that exists in markets today," he added, referencing the risk-to-reward ratio. Despite the emphasis on diversification, Brownback said he's not worried about an impending economic downturn — a fear that has roiled markets lately as President Donald Trump implements sweeping tariff policies. "There's a lot of hyperbole around 'Oh my gosh, we're going to have a recession,' but that's been the narrative for the last two years, whether it was the regional banking crisis in '23 or last year thinking the central banks were staying too tight," he said. "It feels like conventional wisdom has been looking for a hard landing around every corner for three years. We just don't see that." Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell kept interest rates steady on at the central bank's March meeting, a signal that the economy may be stable enough not to need precautionary policy measures. But the decision to pause rate cuts was also a nod to the potential for inflation to flare up again amid tariffs, a reason Brownback is largely staying away from the long-end of the yield curve. "The Committee will assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks," Powell said at a March 19 press conference. "We do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance, and we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity." Jump to

Title: Top Fund Managers Ask Federal Court to Dismiss Climate-Related Antitrust Lawsuit

BlackRoc, Vanguard and State Street have asked a federal court in Texas to dismiss a state lawsuit accusing the top fund managers of conspiring through climate activism to discourage coal output, with the firms saying the allegations rest on “half-baked and untested” legal theories. “To find that Plaintiffs have stated an antitrust claim on these alleged facts requires contorting the law in a way that would hurt both coal companies and individual investors,” the asset managers told the judge, asking the court to reject this “adventurous attempt to rewrite antitrust law.” The closely watched case, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, offers no examples of the companies ever telling a coal company to reduce output, the fund managers said. Industry analysts have been watching to see how strongly the companies would push back on what the defendants called a first of its kind suit filed by Texas and other Republican-led states. There are now 13 plaintiffs. “This is a hard-hitting response that levels some strong rebuttals of the complaint” said Michael Carrier, a Rutgers Law School professor, via e-mail. Among other things, the companies show a lack of communication and differences in proxy voting that will make it hard for the plaintiffs to show they made agreements among themselves, Carrier said. Paxton’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The suit is part of a wave of pressure on the firms from conservative U.S. politicians, many from energy-producing states. Among other things, they have alleged that the firms’ cooperation in industry net-zero groups amounts to collusion. With more than $26 trillion in assets, the three firms through influential proxy votes have become major voices in how U.S. companies pay executives, elect directors and set environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies. Lately they have been in retreat under Republican pressure, withdrawing from industry climate efforts and cutting diversity goals. The suit marks the first time they have faced significant antitrust claims tied to their ESG efforts. In Monday night’s joint motion they formed a united front against the idea and called their activities “commonplace” ones for products like index funds that are “the core ingredients allowing asset managers to provide the low-cost funds that millions of Americans rely on to save for retirement and other purposes.” For instance, the companies said that while BlackRock and State Street voted against reelecting a few coal company directors, they never voted as a block and said the directors were reelected anyway. Vanguard never voted against coal company management or directors. The companies also wrote that coal output actually rose since 2021 according to the complaint’s details, and that their proxy votes did not correlate with production trends. “There is not the slightest indication that any Defendant was prodding the coal companies to reduce output, much less that all of them were doing so in collaboration,” the motion states. The case is Texas et al v BlackRock Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas, No. 24-00437. Topics Lawsuits

This writer watched the presentations of Sen. “Boynee” Sanders and Rep. Alexandria “Covetous” Cortez in Colorado. The latter’s speech revealed her deeply Marxist commitments as she referred over and over again to the working class as a mantra intended to evoke class resentment. This is a centerpiece of communist rhetoric since the publication of the Communist Manifesto in 1848. Not only was she replaying the communist mantra of the working class (“the proletariat”) being abused by “the bourgeoisie” (the capitalist overlords), which has been used in American political life since the International Workers of the World were active in the 1880s, but she also kept repeating the clichéd communist word “solidarity.” Yet this term, “working class” — so popular with communists in the Democrat party (now a sizeable number since the 110-page pact between Sanders and Biden was signed in 2020) — now includes the homeless, the extremely indigent, and the millions of illegal migrants who were admitted during the Biden years. “Working class” is a catch-all term for anyone who is having a struggle living within their means or find themselves living on the streets or on the dole. Workers are offended by being lumped together with these other groups and do not believe that their desire for their “rightful share” of American prosperity is in the same category as illegals or the dispossessed. Bernie especially hammered home the divide between the poor and the working class (again, lumped together) and the richest of the rich. It was a negative rant of abuse, as was Rep. Ocasio-Cortez’s speech. Sanders spoke after Ocasio-Cortez. He tried to arouse envy and disgust as he pointed out the economic power of certain high-level billionaires working with Trump and Elon Musk in our new Executive Branch administration. He lambasted our society because fewer and fewer people can aspire to homeownership, and because credit card debt is skyrocketing in order for the citizenry to make ends meet. He lambasted Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street because they are three investment companies that own more than 50% of 95% of our corporations. However, other sources dispute the percentage of companies owned. He also did not comment on the extraordinary inflation during the Biden presidency that has devastated many households during just the past four years, nor the extraordinary public debt of our national government (and many state governments) from wasteful and leftist-driven spending literally for many decades. He did not mention that the top 1% of earners pay 40% of the taxes in the U.S. He also did not mention the astronomical waste and extravagance evident in federal expenditures. None of these realities fits into the reality he was attempting to depict. He did not express gratitude for the hundreds of millions of dollars of waste and fraud now being uncovered and remedied by DOGE. Trillions in unnecessary and immoral expenditures — much of it certainly being graft, although this is never said publicly — is being revealed as part of healing our broken and distorted economy. However, in his blowhard remarks, Sen. “Boynee” failed to give any credit to the Trump administration for resisting this decades-old trending of extensive imbalance in the federal balance sheet. When my father was active in forming the Transit Workers Union chapter for public trolley car employees (motormen, conductors, and repair units) in Philadelphia in the early 1940s, there were quite a few communist activists in the start-up. However, since most of the unionists were Irish or Italian Catholics, they forced out the communist faction because of the communist rejection of belief in the Christian God, sometimes resorting to force to do so. Other aspects of their identity as workers came into play in deciding what it meant to be “working class.” For one thing, the working class had to work. There were no food stamps, welfare payments, free cell phones, or first-class hotel rooms for the indigent at that time. Incredibly, though more than 100 years have passed, the language of the speeches by Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders is very much the same as that used more than one hundred years ago by Eugene V. Debs, three-time Socialist candidate for president of the USA. He lost each time and was eventually imprisoned for opposing our entry into WWI. He also considered it of utmost importance to promote solidarity with the working class, and he explicitly stated that the term “working class” is to be identified with the Marxist term “proletariat.” Debs’s depiction of the systematic conspiracy of the rich against the rest of society was stated here, here, and here. One commentator wrote about Debs, “Debs feared the rise of the monolithic corporate state. He foresaw that corporations, unchecked, would expand to ‘continental proportions and swallow up the national resources and the means of production and distribution.’” Sanders’s rant at the Colorado rally continues to echo that same view. Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez hold these views, which are the same as those of Debs, even though unions have been recognized in the USA and there has been a vast leftward move of our politics since the administrations of Presidents Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Further, since Debs, communism came into Russia, which became the USSR and eventually collapsed. Later, after WWII, the revolution in China led by Mao established the PRC. This communist PRC was modified to allow capitalist activity by Western corporations in empowerment zones beginning in the late 1980s, which must have been disappointing to the hardcore Sanders. In short, it is this writer’s view that their “tour” of speech-making is a deranged flight into a political mindset from more than 100 years ago — a mindset that failed then and is even more irrelevant today. They are suffering from a politically motivated delusion. Image: Bernie Sanders. Credit: AFGE via Flickr, CC BY 2.0. This writer watched the presentations of Sen. “Boynee” Sanders and Rep.

Title: Fidelity Files for Ethereum US Treasury Fund 'OnChain'

Time Published: 2025-03-24T00:00:00Z

Fidelity Investments has submitted a filing to register a tokenized version of its US dollar money market fund on Ethereum, joining companies like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton in the blockchain tokenization space. The filing, submitted on March 21 to the US securities regulator, said that "OnChain" will help track transactions for the Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX), an $80 million fund consisting almost entirely of US Treasury bills. Although OnChain is still awaiting regulatory approval, Fidelity expects it to become operational on May 30. Source: Securities and Exchange Commission The OnChain share class aims to provide investors with transparency and verifiable tracking of FYHXX share transactions, although Fidelity will continue to use traditional book-entry records as the official ownership ledger. “Even though the secondary recording of the OnChain class on a blockchain will not serve as the official ownership record, the transfer agent will reconcile blockchain transactions with the official records of the OnChain class daily,” Fidelity explained. The $5.8 trillion asset manager also mentioned the possibility of expanding OnChain to other blockchains in the future. In recent years, asset managers have increasingly looked to blockchain technology to tokenize Treasury bills, bonds, and private credit. The RWA tokenization market for Treasury products is currently valued at $4.78 billion, with BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) leading at $1.46 billion, according to rwa.xyz. Source: rwa.xyz Over $3.3 billion worth of RWAs have been tokenized on Ethereum, followed by Stellar at $465.6 million. BlackRock’s crypto head, Robbie Mitchnick, recently said that Ethereum remains the "natural default answer" for traditional finance firms looking to tokenize RWAs on-chain. "There was no question that Ethereum would be the blockchain on which we would begin tokenization, and that's not just a BlackRock thing; that's the obvious default answer." “Clients clearly value decentralization, credibility, and security, which gives Ethereum a distinct advantage,” he remarked during the Digital Asset Summit in New York on March 20.

Before Alex Karp cofounded Palantir Technologies, the shadowy data analysis firm and defense contractor of which he is now the CEO, he wanted to be an academic social theorist. Upon graduating from Stanford Law School—where he befriended his eventual Palantir cofounder, Peter Thiel—Karp enrolled in a PhD program at Goethe University Frankfurt. There, under the tutelage of a specialist in Freudian psychoanalytic theory, he immersed himself in the thought of the Frankfurt School, the collective of Marxian theorists and cultural critics who inspired student protest movements in the 1960s. It is unclear what led Karp to abandon his high-minded pursuits and build a company whose software has been used by ICE to track down suspected illegal immigrants for deportation, by the U.S. military to target drone strikes, and possibly by the Israel Defense Forces to develop “kill lists,” among other ethically fraught pursuits at the frontier of intelligence and warfare. What is certain is that today, Karp has ascended to a position on the world stage that his former student cohort could never imagine. Since Palantir went public in 2020, the company’s market cap has soared from $16 billion to a recent high of more than $280 billion, briefly surpassing stalwarts like Toyota and making Karp a billionaire many times over (after a nearly 500 percent surge in the company’s stock price last year, The Economist named Karp its top-performing CEO of 2024). And despite Karp’s liberal commitments—he has supported Democrats most of his life, and has referred to himself as a socialist and even a neo-Marxist—Palantir now wields tremendous influence in Trumpworld, largely through Thiel, who has backed Trump since 2016 and is J. D. Vance’s former employer. “Palantirians,” including one of Karp’s closest advisers, are installed in senior roles across the new administration. Despite Karp’s liberal commitments—he has called himself a socialist and even a neo-Marxist—Palantir wields tremendous influence in Trumpworld, largely through Peter Thiel. “Palantirians” are installed in senior roles across the new administration. At the height of his power, Karp is using his platform to publish a scathing critique of the academic community he once aspired to join. The Technological Republic, cowritten with Karp’s Palantir deputy Nicholas Zamiska, argues that it is academics and other liberal elites, not Karp, who have betrayed their shared values. By abandoning the pursuit of truth in favor of problematizing the pro-West worldview, they have discouraged generations of America’s best and brightest from contributing to the national defense, and diverted precious technical talent to trivial endeavors such as “building algorithms that optimize the placement of ads on social media platforms.” This, in turn, has weakened the liberal world order in the face of rising authoritarian threat, particularly from China. Why would a man in Karp’s position write an alienating, combative political treatise? On the surface, the book calls on academics to do what Karp believes he has done himself, and embrace a more forceful and pragmatic role in defending democracy—in their case, by strengthening, rather than tearing down, young Americans’ sense of patriotic duty. But the argument Karp delivers is unlikely to convince them. So unlikely, in fact, that it raises the question of who Karp is truly speaking to. The Technological Republic begins with an assessment of Silicon Valley that channels Karp’s leftist academic roots. The tech industry of the internet era, he says, allocates an incredible amount of financial and human capital to endeavors that contribute little to, and often detract from, the collective welfare. For Karp, the tech industry’s finest moments came during World War II and the Cold War, when STEM talent partnered with the government—and especially the military—to pursue “grand, collectivist” projects. Government initiatives such as the Manhattan Project and the Apollo program produced world-changing breakthroughs. In the private sector, companies like Fairchild Semiconductor turned government-funded research, and military procurement work, into the bedrock innovations of the modern internet. Karp views the modern tech industry, and especially Big Tech, as having abandoned this spirit of ambition and public purpose. The platform empires are built not on breakthrough innovations that lifted up the broader economy, but rather on the “aggressive disruption of incumbents and the construction of new monopolies.” They have not sought to solve humanity’s great challenges, but rather to address the “inconveniences of daily life for those with disposable income,” such as getting a taxi or ordering takeout. The Technological Republic drips with disdain for a generation of companies that, while draping themselves in the rhetoric of changing the world, have been content to “sat[e] the often capricious and passing needs of late capitalism’s hordes.” As China channels its resources toward strategic technologies—Karp is particularly concerned about China’s advances toward intelligent drone swarms, which he believes represent the future of warfare—this “complacency” is no longer acceptable. How did we get here? The contrast Karp draws between the mid-20th-century and the modern-day tech world provides an opportunity to reflect on structural economic changes that might have contributed to the slowdown he sees in innovation and ambition. Has the rise of the venture capital model, or more recently the dominance of a few incumbent players, encouraged founders to think small? Karp suggests that America has “ceded too much control to the whims of the market,” and gestures vaguely at the need for a “Manhattan Project” for battlefield AI, as well as increased allocations to AI in the defense budget (surprise, surprise). But he declines to elaborate on these proposals. The Technological Republic is not fundamentally interested in questions of political economy—it is interested in culture. What set apart the technologists of the World War II and Cold War eras, Karp claims, was their mentality. These were not “technical minds chasing trivial consumer products,” but builders who “aspired to see the most powerful technology of the age deployed to address challenges of industrial and national significance.” The core premise of The Technological Republic is that this collectivist ethos was made possible by a strong sense of national identity rooted in “shared culture”—the mythologies, religious beliefs, and common experiences, such as mandatory military service, that forged bonds between citizens and constituted their understanding of what it meant to be part of the American project. But over the latter half of the 20th century, America’s national identity faded. Improbably, Karp blames this entirely on efforts by the academic left to promote tolerance and inclusivity in higher education. Karp’s narrative of decline begins with efforts to reform Eurocentric university core curricula. Starting in the 1950s and accelerating in the countercultural moment of the late 1960s, rising generations of historians made the obvious point that required general education courses on Western civilization—which for decades had taught students that America was the inheritor of a civilizational legacy linking the ancient Near East, classical Greece and Rome, and early modern Europe, progressing all the while toward liberty and reason—excluded the histories of civilizations elsewhere in the world, and warped students’ understanding of what “civilization” meant. Universities assented, refashioning “Western Civ” into world history courses or, more often, abandoning it altogether. Later, in the 1980s and ’90s (although Karp fuses these distinct episodes into one), the humanities faced a similar reckoning in what became known as the “Canon Wars.” Dead White Men were asked to share space with a more diverse cast of authors. Meanwhile, a more combative strain of intellectual reform sought to directly “deconstruct” the edifice of Western identity and knowledge. Karp picks on two prominent postcolonial scholars here: Kwame Anthony Appiah, who attacked the coherence of Western civilization as a march from Athenian democracy to the Age of Enlightenment; and Edward Said, whose 1978 tract, Orientalism, produced the revolutionary—and, Karp admits, “brilliant”—insight that productions of history and anthropology reflect power dynamics between speaker and subject. Said’s influence was particularly profound, Karp writes, generating “a new industry in American higher education, built around dismantling colonial understandings of the world,” which “remade” academia as a whole. To his credit, Karp’s criticism of these academic challenges to the West—the instincts of postwar intellectuals toward diversification and deconstruction—is somewhat more nuanced than the familiar complaints of aggrieved campus conservatives. Unlike his Palantir cofounder Peter Thiel, whose 1996 screed, The Diversity Myth, lambasts multiculturalism as “anti-Western zealotry” in disguise, Karp acknowledges that the intellectual projects of Appiah and Said had merit. “The dismantling of an entire system of privilege was rightly begun,” Karp writes. His gripe is that the generation of academics the reformers, and especially Said, inspired “failed to resurrect anything substantial, a coherent collective identity or set of communal values, in its place.” In the hands of more radical thinkers, Karp argues, Said’s insight that subjectivity is inherent in the production of knowledge about other cultures was twisted into a belief that accurate descriptive knowledge of other cultures was not possible at all—and therefore that comparative value judgments about different cultures was an inherently problematic, and futile, endeavor. How could Americans claim that their art, ethics, or social organization was superior to the art, ethics, or social organization of another society, from behind their American eyes? Borrowing a term popularized by the traditionalist historians of the Canon Wars era, Karp claims that cultural “relativism” became dogma in academia by the end of the 20th century, and from there permeated political institutions, journalism, Hollywood, and other bastions of the liberal elite. It became, Karp writes, “the dominant form of elite establishment thinking.” As academia, and the broader liberal establishment, pulled away from comparing cultures, Karp argues, it ceased making normative claims about what America’s shared culture should be. It became uninterested in, or perhaps afraid of, articulating a positive vision of America’s national identity. Certain segments became outright hostile to the idea of having one at all. Karp catches two high-profile academics in the act: the sociologist Richard Sennett, who pondered, in The New York Times, whether there might be “ways of acting together without invoking the evil of a shared national identity,” and the philosopher Martha Nussbaum, who castigated Americans’ unique “patriotic pride” as “morally dangerous,” and instead called for “primary allegiance” to “the community of human beings in the entire world.” The result, according to Karp, was that the generation of Americans raised in this intellectual environment developed no concept of being part of a worthy national endeavor—and retreated into the pursuit of riches instead. Whereas mid-20th-century technologists’ sense of patriotic duty was fortified by their education, the education of Uber and Instagram founders had systematically stamped theirs out. Into the resulting void, Karp writes, “the market rushed in with fervor.” This generation “knew what it opposed—what it stood against and could not condone—but not what it was for.” Karp views the modern tech industry, especially Big Tech, as having abandoned ambition and public purpose. The platform empires, he argues, are not built on breakthrough innovations that lifted up the broader economy, but rather on “aggressive disruption of incumbents and the construction of new monopolies.” Ironically, The Technological Republic falls into this trap itself. Karp concludes the book with what is essentially a call for academics and the liberal elite broadly to reject cancel culture and orthodoxy—one that resembles Thiel-style cultural warfare more than it resembles an original, or constructive, critique. In one eyebrow-raising passage, Karp appears to sympathize with a 1998 speech by a German writer that railed against what Karp describes as “the yoke of an enforced remembrance” of the Holocaust. This speech was also the subject of Karp’s doctoral dissertation, although he did not condone it then. But Karp, like the academics he criticizes, fails to articulate a positive vision of what a new American identity should be. Nor does he grapple with recent liberal attempts to do so—contrary to Karp’s claim that such projects have been thought-policed out of existence—such as Jill Lepore’s This America, and Colin Woodard’s voluminous work in the Washington Monthly and elsewhere. If there is a path forward suggested by The Technological Republic, it is that by embracing “intellectual confrontation,” the liberal establishment can allow a new national identity to spontaneously emerge through debate. Considered in isolation, Karp’s key observations are likely to resonate with his supposed target audience of academics and liberal thought leaders. Readers with ties to elite educational institutions would likely agree that their peers are more motivated by money than any sense of duty to the collective, especially when one considers the staggering percentages of graduates who flock to the finance and consulting industries. (Karp himself notes this phenomenon in one passage, though his focus is on the tech world; for a deeper dive, see Zach Marcus, “The Corporate Raid on Campus.”) And it’s difficult to argue with his claims that America’s national identity has been eroded, or that higher education has become more interested in questioning, rather than strengthening, a pro-West perspective. As academia and the broader liberal establishment retreated from comparing cultures, Karp argues, it ceased making normative claims about what America’s shared culture should be. It became uninterested in, or perhaps afraid of, articulating a positive vision of America’s national identity. Certain segments became outright hostile to the idea of having one at all. But The Technological Republic fails to convince that these phenomena are interconnected. Do many of America’s best and brightest today work for Facebook and McKinsey because they lack patriotism? Was one semester of “Western Civ” so pivotal in the career trajectories of the engineers who put a man on the moon? If so, Karp provides no evidence. And he strenuously avoids grappling with other historical events and cultural currents that likely contributed to the elite’s abandonment of public service careers—does it have more to do with their belief that America is bad, or that “greed is good”? As far as there is a disinclination toward military work specifically, the impact on public opinion of America’s disastrous military campaigns in Southeast Asia and the Middle East goes unmentioned. Perhaps, after two decades at the helm of an infamously cult-like company where he is “accustomed to being received as an oracle,” according to a recent profile, Karp’s powers of persuasion have dulled. Or perhaps he was simply limited by the scope of the book. The main text of The Technological Republic clocks in at 218 breezy pages, 56 of which are dedicated to a non sequitur on Palantir’s corporate culture. But for a man of Karp’s intellectual mettle—which does shine through in the book, in his command of intellectual history—these explanations are doubtful. One can’t help but feel that he has not made an earnest attempt at persuasion. Which brings us to the question of Karp’s true purpose in writing the book. There are moments when he seems to be making a friendly appeal for liberals to get their act together; the clearest example is his warning, borrowed from the political philosopher Michael Sandel, that “fundamentalists rush in where liberals fear to tread.” But the carelessness with which he argues his central points, and his neglect of a thoughtful solution, do not ultimately leave the impression that The Technological Republic is rooting for the liberal establishment to recover. What we are left with is a vicious critique of that establishment, delivered through gleeful transgressions of its boundaries on acceptable topics of discussion. In short: red meat for the right. Viewed this way, the book forms a pattern with other publicity stunts Karp has performed in the wake of last November’s vibe-shifting election. After Palantir reported blowout earnings in February, Karp went viral and successfully triggered the libs by proclaiming on the (video-streamed) investor call his commitment to “scare our enemies and, on occasion, kill them.” Appearing on CNBC’s Squawk Box the morning The Technological Republic hit shelves, Karp called Elon Musk “obviously the most important builder in the world.” He applauded Musk’s controversial DOGE initiative, which he claimed “90 percent of Americans” support, for targeting “the fraud, waste, and abuse we know is there.” Musk tweeted the clip. The moral case for Palantir that Karp has made throughout his career—that the company is a project to promote democracy, and strengthening Western militaries is its means to this end—has always been somewhat simplistic. But Karp seemed to genuinely believe in this calculation, and his conduct could be seen as consistent with it. He made a point of refusing to work in autocratic countries, and of meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Ukraine to offer Palantir’s support in its war against Russia. But as Karp attempts to curry favor with an administration that is not only disassembling the world order Karp cherishes but actively undermining America’s standing as a beacon of liberal democracy at home, the coherence of Palantir’s political project has begun to unravel. In his TV interview, and in his book, Karp no longer comes across as a man with firm commitments. “I’ve been a Democrat most of my life,” Karp said on CNBC. “I still—I kind of view myself as outside it.” Kainoa Lowman is a communications associate at the American Economic Liberties Project, an anti-monopoly research and advocacy group. He writes for AELP’s newsletter, The Economic Populist.

Title: Analysts Eye Shiba Inu’s Potential: Could Trump’s Crypto Reserve and ETF Catapult SHIB to $0.0001?

Shiba Inu Approaches a Key Breakout Zone, Thanks to the Formation of a Falling Wedge As Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to stay above the critical support zone of $0.0000115, the second-largest meme coin paints a bullish picture. According to renowned market analyst Ali Martinez, “Key Shiba Inu (SHIB) support levels! $0.0000115 and $0.00000815 in focus.” Martinez’s analysis shows that the meme coin is out of the woods, with Shiba Inu’s price currently sitting at $0.0000128. Having witnessed a bearish momentum that sent its price below the psychological threshold of $0.000010, Shiba Inu can feel relieved. As a result, Crypto Sat believes that SHIB might be eyeing a bullish reversal pattern. The market insights provider acknowledged, “The 1-hour chart for $SHIB is showing a Falling Wedge, a bullish reversal pattern. Bullish Case: A breakout above 1260 could trigger a rally toward 1280 – 1320. SHIB is approaching a key breakout zone. If bulls take charge, we could see a strong upside move.” A falling wedge is deemed a bullish reversal pattern because it depicts a potential change from a downtrend to an uptrend. As the wedge narrows, volume decreases because it shows the absence of strong selling momentum, as bears are throwing in the towel. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu might be eyeing the $0.0001 zone if the meme coin is included in President Donald Trump’s crypto reserve. Additionally, the Shiba Inu community is ramping up efforts to advocate for a SHIB-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF), calling on major asset management firms like BlackRock and Grayscale Investments to take action.

Title: If Trump Destroys Inflation Reduction Act, Economic Fallout May Come

ByKen Silverstein ByKen Silverstein , Senior Contributor. Block Island, R.I: Deepwater Wind installing the first offshore wind farm at Block Island, Rhode ... More Island, August 14, 2016. (Photo by Mark Harrington/Newsday RM via Getty Images) Louisiana may be known as an oil and gas state, but it is now getting its feet wet by trying to build offshore wind energy developments in the Gulf of Mexico. Even though the deal has bipartisan support, the Trump Administration is trying to block all such wind projects in federal waters. President Trump signed an executive order that stopped all offshore wind energy projects. Trump doesn’t believe in climate change and thinks fossil fuels are the way to go. What makes him tick? The administration said this strategy will lower energy costs, create more jobs, and meet the growing energy demand. However, look to ruby-red Louisiana, which views offshore wind as a job creator and a vehicle to reduce electricity price volatility. “We are at an inflection point now on the way energy economics works,” says Fox Swim, a senior solar researcher for Aurora Solar, in a Zoom interview. “This administration is willing to break the law and norms. It is willing to inflict economic damage on the rest of the country to fulfill its vision. The renewable energy industry must lean hard on state governments. If states value stability in our grid and renewable energies, then these jurisdictions must do the right thing.” The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is in danger now. It passed in 2022, creating green energy programs nationwide. But if the projects die, economic stimulation does as well. If the Trump Administration gets rid of the IRA, then Energy Innovation said it would cost consumers $32 billion in energy bills, while gross domestic product falls by $190 billion by 2035. We lose hundreds of thousands of jobs too. Trump cannot simply eliminate the law, but he can gradually dismantle it. He could slow the rollout or make fossil fuel investments more valuable than those in renewable energy. So even if the law is still on the books, it might not have much of an effect. Swim points to the Endangerment Finding, the scientific and legal basis for regulating greenhouse gases that cause climate change. In 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency started overseeing those emissions under the Clean Air Act. She thinks the administration will rewrite the law to say, “climate is not a problem.” She also believes the administration will revise the IRA to say which technologies qualify for tax credits. So, here’s the scoop: Aurora’s new survey revealed that 57% of business owners favor keeping the IRA, while only 29% want it gone. And guess what? A whopping 78% of business owners want to make the most of their IRA benefits. Now, let’s talk about homeowners. Awareness of the IRA has skyrocketed from 51% in 2024 to a colossal 77% in 2025. Interestingly, 48% of solar installers believe that a reduction in funding from the IRA would negatively impact their business. “Joe Biden created the IRA, and he fundamentally shifted the way we do clean energy in the U.S. Trump could just as easily shift the needle in the opposite direction,” says Swim. “The government uses subsidies to promote technologies and industrial policy. The subsidies must exist to bring renewables to the level where they can compete with extremely subsidized petroleum industries.” GULF OF MEXICO - JUNE 25: The Transocean Discoverer Enterprise drillship burns off gas collected at ... More the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana on June 25, 2010. An approaching tropical disturbance may force collecting operations involving ships and other siphoning equipment to be temporarily halted. This may cause oil to flow unchecked from the well until the weather improves and siphoning operations can be restored. (Photo by Chris Graythen/Getty Images) New York State planned to transform one of its largest fossil fuel plants into a renewable energy powerhouse. It would’ve used offshore wind energy, battery storage, and geothermal power to make clean energy. But guess what? Those plans are on hold because of Trump’s executive order that put a stop to all offshore wind projects. This deal would’ve been a game-changer, providing power to 2 million homes and generating a massive 2.6 gigawatts of electricity. The Trump administration has started undoing over 30 environmental rules that were put in place by the previous administration. They’re eliminating caps on power plant emissions, reducing protections for rivers and streams, and making it easier for cars to pollute. The president has given his EPA the green light to keep some coal plants running. That’s on top of the plans to weaken rules for monitoring pollution from power plants. For instance, he’s targeting the mercury rules and those that regulate coal ash, which is the waste left behind when coal is burned and caused widespread damage in the Tennessee Valley Authority’s areas. Trump has called the IRA the “Green New Scam.” Trump has also withdrawn from the voluntary Paris Agreement that tries to limit temperature increases to 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit by mid century. “We’re not going to do the wind thing,” Trump told rallygoers. “Big, ugly windmills, they ruin your neighborhood.” He later wrote on social media, “After years of being held captive by Environmental Extremists, Lunatics, Radicals, and Thugs, allowing other Countries, in particular China, to gain tremendous Economic advantage over us by opening up hundreds of all Coal Fire Power Plants, I am authorizing my Administration to immediately begin producing Energy with BEAUTIFUL, CLEAN COAL.” Have we become immune to this language? The madman theory applies to the idea that foreign foes shouldn’t tempt a leader because they are too unpredictable. Trump, though, is driven by vindictiveness and the desire to undo the successes of his predecessors, and not by the greater good. WASHINGTON, DC - AUGUST 12: Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) (L) and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) arrive for ... More a news conference with fellow members of the House Progressive Caucus ahead of the vote on the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 outside the U.S. Capitol on August 12, 2022 in Washington, DC. Despite not achieving everything the House liberals wanted, the $737 billion act will focus on slowing climate change, lower health care costs, and creating clean energy jobs by enacting a 15% corporate minimum tax, and a 1% fee on stock buybacks, and enhancing IRS enforcement. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) The real checks and balances might not come from the legislative branch, which seems scared of him, but from American businesses, which might actually have more power than the president. Market powers trump presidential levers. Companies have gone beyond just focusing on shareholders. They now include communities and employees in their mission. This strategy is called the “triple bottom line,” which considers the planet, people, and profits. Ignoring this can hurt a company’s well-being. Cisco, Oracle, and IBM are among the many companies that are leading the sustainability challenge. America’s energy picture illustrates the point: Coal has fallen from 50% of the electricity mix in 2008 to 16% today, while renewables keep blossoming, now at 20%. That’s a market choice. No U.S. utility company has any plans to build coal-fired power, including the two biggest, American Electric Power and Southern Company, which are trying to ditch their coal plants. Aurora’s Swim worries that corporations will reverse their net-zero goals, although that is a gamble—one that could bring lawsuits, lose customers, and damage their brands. That said, Earth.org listed a series of "backtracking companies:" Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Citi Bank, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan pulled out of a industry climate alliance. Meanwhile, Blackrock withdrew from the Net-Zero Asset Managers, and American Airlines removed a reference to its "urgent" climate actions. "Trump is here for four years," says Swim. "There will be a midterm, and political gravity will catch up with his actions. But this administration is willing to inflict economic damage —even incurring a recession.” Witness the tariffs and the whirlwind they have taken this country. "There are strong conservative and economic cases for renewables," she continues. "Supporters must push legislators to say these policies make sense for your state and bring tangible benefits to your community. Maybe their leaders don't care about climate change, but they do care about power outages and recovery costs.” If Trump destroys the IRA, economic fallout could follow. While the president may be bound to the past and blinded to the country’s future promise, he knows how to read the political landscape—the best hope of staving off a free fall and even more environmental problems.

DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

Title: AIL wrap: Lansdowne move into top four of Division 1A with statement win over Terenure

Lansdowne moved into the top four in Division 1A of the All-Ireland League for the first time this season with one of the campaign’s statement wins when beating Terenure 32-0 on the Aviva back pitch last Saturday. Declan Fassbender’s side appear to have timed their run perfectly and with remaining games against UCD and Garryowen look well placed to make the play-offs. This sixth win in seven was never really in doubt. The 21-year-old Leinster academy flanker set the tone in a dominant defensive display. After tries by Hardus van Eeden and Rob Hedderman, who opened his account in an injury-affected season with a brace, Jerry Cahir and Jack Cooke completed a bleak day for Terenure, who were feeling the scars of their defeat at home to Clontarf. Trailing 3-0 after 25 minutes, it looked like Terenure were about to go ahead when outhalf Conor McKeon put centre Ethan Reilly through under the posts. Alas, not alone was the pass forward, but the outhalf suffered a broken leg when tackled as he passed. This compounded the recent loss of Harrison Brewer, Chris Cosgrave and Conor Phillips, while Henry McErlean, Caspar Gabriel and Fintan Gunne are on Leinster duty in South Africa. Lansdowne, now fourth on 51 points, face relegation-threatened UCD next week before entertaining bottom-placed Garryowen in a fortnight. Terenure, in fifth on 48 points, host Young Munster before a last day trek to Cork Con (third on 52). Con had a hard-fought 30-23 win away to Young Munster which ended the latter’s slim play-off hopes, as the sides traded three tries apiece, with James Taylor kicking 15 points. However, after the game there were some unseemly scenes involving virtually all the players from both teams, and some supporters. In a statement, Cork Con said they are aware of an incident after the full-time whistle and “the club is currently conducting a full internal review into the incident. We are committed to upholding the highest standards of conduct, and will take appropriate action in line with our disciplinary procedures. “We wish to acknowledge the strong relationship between Cork Constitution and Young Munster, and we remain in contact with their representatives as we address this matter. As this is an ongoing review, we will not be making any further comment at this time.” Clontarf stayed top on 60 points thanks to another brace of tries from hooker Dylan Donnellan in an 18-5 win at home to UCD. ‘Tarf will travel to Garryowen before hosting St Mary’s on the last day. The St Mary’s fullback Conor Hayes scored their first try in his 19-point haul and former Munster centre Dan Goggin, playing at number eight, completed their 12th attacking bonus point of the campaign in a 32-21 home win over Ballynahinch. St Mary’s sit second on 58 points and will host City of Armagh before that last day trek to Clontarf. Although it will only be a stay of execution, Garryowen ended their 14-match losing streak with a surprise 26-17 win at City of Armagh, which keeps the latter just two points ahead of UCD in the relegation play-off place. In 1B, Nenagh Ormond took a significant step toward a home semi-final in those play-offs thanks to a 34-20 win over Old Wesley. Bottom placed Shannon kept their hopes of avoiding relegation alive with a gutsy 15-10 win at Naas to move within five points of Trinity and Highfield after the latter’s 28-23 win at College Park. Instonians, a junior club three seasons ago, will play in 1B next season after securing their fourth successive promotion with a 38-22 win at home to Greystones.

ByWilliam Arruda ByWilliam Arruda , Senior Contributor. Photo credit This month, a wave of layoffs across various industries has raised concerns among professionals about job security. Major corporations, particularly in the tech sector, have announced significant workforce reductions. Siemens plans to cut over 6,000 jobs in its automation and electric vehicle (EV) charging businesses to enhance competitiveness. Similarly, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft have announced layoffs, reflecting a broader trend in the industry.​ This trend extends beyond the tech industry. Major retailers like Walgreens, CVS, and Joann Fabrics are also in the process of, or planning layoffs. Additionally, significant reductions are anticipated in various government sectors as part of Trump’s DOGE initiative. The Pentagon announced 60,000 cuts and the IRS plans to shed 45,000 jobs. Experts predict weaker employment reports and a rise in unemployment claims, citing economic uncertainty and increased automation in the workplace as key drivers. Although no one is certain that we are entering a recession, the news about widespread layoffs can be stressful. Even if you currently feel secure in your position, it’s time to acknowledge potential challenges in the job market. The best time to prepare for a job search is while you are still employed. Implementing a proactive plan can help safeguard your career and stave off anxiety.​ Focus on these 7 actions. If you haven’t worked on your personal brand in a while, it’s time to for a review. To effectively convey your value, review, update, and enhance your resume and online profiles.​ We all know that more jobs are filled through networking than job postings. Many career opportunities arise through relationships that you have built.​ Career cushioning—investing in skill development will make you a more attractive candidate for in-demand roles.​ It involves discreetly preparing for potential job loss by upskilling and networking. The bonus is that you gain essential skills that you can use in your current role. Being prepared financially is vital in uncertain times.​ Take these actions to reduce financial risk and the stress that comes from money issues. When it comes time to decide who gets put on the layoff list, make sure your manager and other decision makers see you as indispensable. Demonstrating your value within your organization will enhance job security.​ Increasing your visibility and demonstrated value positions you as a must-keep team member.​ Often, the value you build externally impacts how you’re seen inside your organization. Your online presence will influence potential employers’ perceptions, too.​ A positive online presence enhances your attractiveness to potential employers.​ While no one can fully predict what’s ahead, the wave of recent layoffs is a clear signal that professionals should stay ready, not reactive. The key to long-term career resilience is preparation. Whether or not a recession materializes, these steps will put you in a stronger position for whatever the market brings.

Title: US Bitcoin ETFs End Outflow Streak With $744 Million Weekly Influx — Details

Time Published: 2025-03-23T15:30:35Z

The US-based Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) have been on a negative streak of capital outflows in the past few weeks, reflecting dwindling appetite and worsening sentiment amongst investors. However, the latest daily performances of these crypto-based financial products suggest that fresh demand might be growing among investors. According to the latest market data, the Bitcoin ETFs in the United States continued their hot streak of capital influx, registering a daily total net inflow of $83.09 million on Friday, March 21. This fresh capital inflow marked the sixth consecutive day of net daily inflows for the crypto products. On Friday, only two of the Bitcoin ETFs witnessed any form of investor activity. BlackRock saw the highest amount of value ($104.99 million) added to its exchange-traded fund iShares Bitcoin Trust (with the ticker IBIT); while Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) posted a daily net outflow of $21.9 million to close the week. Nevertheless, this $83.09 million performance brought the Bitcoin ETFs’ weekly record to a staggering $744.35 million weekly total net inflow. Interestingly, this previous week’s record put an end to five consecutive weeks of total net outflows from the exchange-traded funds. Data from SoSoValue shows that the US Bitcoin ETF market witnessed a total withdrawal of $5.39 billion over those five weeks of negative outflows. Specifically, the crypto-based financial products witnessed a daily total net outflow of over $1.14 billion on February 25. The magnitude of outflows witnessed by the Bitcoin ETFs has been associated with the uncertain climate of the US financial markets. Since the United States President Donald Trump resumed office, the markets have been plagued with fears of a global trade war, interest rate decisions, and so on. Since their launch, there has been a discussion around the impact of US Bitcoin ETFs’ performance on the price of the flagship cryptocurrency. As seen in the recent consecutive weeks of net outflows, the Bitcoin price tends to struggle whenever ETF investors are leaving the market. However, the premier cryptocurrency seems stuck in a consolidation range despite the fresh demand for the US Bitcoin ETFs. However, a sustained demand for its exchange-traded funds might be the positive catalyst for the Bitcoin price to resume its upward trend. As of this writing, the price of BTC is hovering around the $84,000 mark, reflecting no significant change in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the market leader has barely recorded any notable movements in the past week. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: The New Sustainability Playbook: 10 Questions For Business Leaders
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/pklein/2025/03/23/the-new-sustainability-playbook-10-questions-for-business-leaders/
Time Published: 2025-03-23T15:15:54Z
Full Content:
ByPaul Klein ByPaul Klein , Contributor. Melanie Nakagawa, Chief Sustainability Officer Microsoft, at talking about "Accelerating climate ... More solutions with AI" on November 16, 2023 in Lisbon, Portugal. The negative impacts of the Trump administration’s tariffs are already taking effect and are projected to be even more consequential. Prices are projected to rise. At the same time, output and employment will be reduced, resulting in a net negative impact on the U.S. economy. In this context, every business with a global supply chain is facing an existential crisis: reduce investments in sustainability to save money in the short term, or stay the course and preserve long-term value? As costs rise from higher tariffs, business leaders need to understand the consequences of reducing investments in sustainability. Cutting costs will jeopardize business relationships with global supply chain partners that require compliance with sustainability standards including GRI, ISSB, and SASB. Downsizing investments in sustainability will also alienate employees, consumers, and communities who reward businesses that reduce environmental impact, enhance social equity, and improve long-term resilience. Every business leader will need to decide whether to maintain investments in sustainability that come with a cost but also deliver immense value. This new playbook will help leaders make the best choices for their companies. Short-term cost savings can lead to long-term vulnerability. Cutting back on emissions reductions, renewable energy, or supply chain resilience might lower costs now. But it also raises the risk of climate impacts, harm to reputation, and fines from regulations. PG&E’s failure to upgrade grid infrastructure to prevent wildfires resulted in the company facing an estimated $30 billion liability for damages from the two years of wildfires, according to the New York Times. Many multinational clients and procurement partners now mandate sustainability metrics. Preferred supplier lists may remove companies that fail to align with frameworks like GRI, ISSB, or SASB may be removed from preferred supplier lists. This is especially true in sectors such as apparel, electronics, automotive, and food. If you are part of a global value chain, slashing ESG investments could mean losing business. Walmart requires key suppliers to report emissions and energy use. Suppliers that don’t comply may be delisted. Employees want to work for companies with purpose, consumers reward brands that do good, and communities are more supportive of responsible corporations. Scaling back ESG efforts to offset tariff-related costs could result in lower morale, higher turnover, customer churn, and social license to operate issues—intangibles that can rapidly transform into significant concerns. Patagonia’s sustained customer loyalty and employee retention are closely linked to its genuine ESG commitments. Institutional investors are placing greater emphasis on sustainability as a proxy for governance and future-readiness. While some shareholder segments may support short-term margin improvements, others—like pension funds and ESG-focused funds—may divest from companies seen as backtracking on sustainability. Before you cut ESG budgets, consider how it might change your investor profile. BlackRock has flagged companies with weak ESG disclosures as riskier and redirected capital toward ESG-aligned portfolios, according to ESG Today. Sustainability efforts can benefit your company in the long run. You will save energy with efficient operations. Proactive compliance will cut regulatory costs. Plus, responsible sourcing will help your brand stand out. These investments may not appear on this quarter’s balance sheet, but they build competitive advantage over time. What will you lose if you abandon what you’ve already built? Unilever’s Sustainable Living Brands grew 69% faster than the rest of its portfolio, demonstrating tangible ROI. The green transition is not a trend—it’s an economic transformation. Companies in many fields are investing in sustainable innovation. They focus on electric fleets, biodegradable packaging, zero-waste operations, and inclusive hiring practices. If your rivals are pushing hard while you pull back, your market relevance could drop significantly. Ørsted shifted from relying on fossil fuels to becoming a top player in offshore wind. They moved faster than European energy giants who took longer to adapt. Before making cuts, get insights from boards, investors, employees, NGOs, and community leaders. They likely have strong views on your sustainability goals. Often, stakeholders will advocate for re-prioritizing—not abandoning—ESG commitments. Transparency can protect your brand and build credibility, even in times of retrenchment. Interface, the carpet maker, teamed up with NGOs, suppliers, and customers for its sustainability plan. This likely helped maintain its brand trust during tough times. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and state-led green grants offer billions to companies investing in sustainability. Cutting ESG funding now could mean missing out on tax credits, rebates, and partnerships that offset costs and de-risk long-term investments. Have you explored every opportunity to turn sustainability into a net gain? First Solar secured over $700 million in federal tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act for U.S. manufacturing. Sustainability and profitability should co-exist. ESG investments boost efficiency, cut waste, and make resource use better. They also reveal new business models. Leaders who see sustainability as central to performance, not just an extra, are most likely to succeed. IKEA’s focus on circular practices and renewable energy cuts waste and saves money worldwide. Will people remember you as the company that pivoted toward the future—or as the one that retreated when pressure mounted? Leadership is not just about getting through this quarter. It’s about creating a story that builds confidence, pride, and progress. The choices you make today will shape your company’s legacy. This is especially true during times of climate change and economic uncertainty. Microsoft’s pledge is to become carbon negative by 2030. This makes it a leader for the future, even in tough economic times. Tariffs and inflationary pressure are forcing difficult decisions. But cutting sustainability investments will likely be a costly mistake. Business leaders need a new approach. This should balance short-term costs with long-term stakeholder value, regulatory risks, and market expectations. Sustainability is not a corporate responsibility—it’s a strategic advantage. In the current environment, reducing investments in this area may seem like a sensible decision, but it can ultimately lead to weakened supply chain relationships, investor skepticism, employee disengagement, and lost consumer trust. As tariffs increase and economic strain grows, the most resilient and respected companies will be those that continue to be leaders by maintaining investments in sustainability.

Last week, thousands of people gathered in Houston, Texas for CERAWeek 2025, perhaps the most significant annual meet-up of the network of oil executives, investors, consultants, government officials, and more, that make up and support the fossil fuel industry. Inside the gathering, oil, finance, and tech executives joined a slew of panels discussing a range of energy industry topics. Top Trump officials spoke, including US Energy Secretary Chris Wright and US Interior secretary Doug Burgum. According to Guardian climate reporter Dharna Noor, “Wright said global warming was merely a needed “side-effect” of modernization, while Burgum called to “take our natural resources and turn them into natural assets.” Meanwhile, outside CERAWeek, hundreds of climate activists protested the conference’s display of billionaire power and celebration of fossil fuels, with several activists arrested. What is CERAWeek, anyways? Who or what is the power behind CERAWeek? What functions does CERAWeek perform for the fossil fuel industry power structure? Who were some of the key billionaires at CERAWeek? This primer will address these questions. What is CERAWeek? CERAWeek is a massive, transnational gathering of powerful people tied to the energy industry, including top fossil fuel executives, big financial investors, and high-level government officials and regulators. The Houston Chronicle — newspaper of the fossil fuel capital of the US, where CERAWeek is held — has labelled the event the “Super Bowl of energy,” awash with “energy insiders.” Climate activist Bill McKibben has referred to it as “the hydrocarbon world’s biggest festival, a Davos for carbon.” CERAWeek performs several functions for the energy industry. These include serving as a space to discuss and debate industry trends; engage in networking and dealmaking; hold high-level conversations between executives, investors and regulators; and broadly, to promote and legitimize the industry with a high-profile event. Thousands of participants attend CERAWeek. In 2023, around 7,200 people from 90 countries flocked to the event. It claims to be rated among the top five “corporate leader conferences” worldwide. Leaders from the highest heights of politics and industry attend CERAWeek. Past speakers have included Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Justin Trudeau, Narendra Modi, Henry Kissinger to Bill Gates. This year, new Trump Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum were speakers, along with CEOs or other top executives of fossil fuel companies that span the gamut of the industry, from Big Oil giants to LNG export companies, oil pipeline corporations to utilities. Some of these include ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, ConocoPhillips, Oxy, BP, Cheniere, Pioneer, Enbridge, NRG, EQT, Baker Hughes, Hunt Energy, Williams Companies, Hess, NextEra, National Grid, and Freeport LNG — just to name a few. Harold Hamm of Continental Resources — maybe the industry’s closest ally to Donald Trump — was a speaker. Top leaders from industry groups like American Petroleum Institute, American Gas Association and Edison International attended. Critically, major Wall Street investors and tech giants also attended CERAWeek. These include asset managers like BlackRock, private equity firms like Carlyle, Apollo, and Blackstone, and tech corporations like Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet (the parent company of Google). Nor is CERAWeek a solely U.S. affair. Government and corporate representatives from countries all over the world — Saudi Arabia to Canada, Turkey to Nigeria, South Korea to Kuwait — attended as well. Who Rules CERAWeek? While CERAWeek is filled with industry representatives, it’s dominated by major corporate players. Different “Partners” sponsor the conference, presumably through hefty fees, and the biggest sponsors gain the most access and power in shaping the event’s tone and content. For example, according to the sponsorship brochure from the 2024 CERAWeek conference, the highest level of sponsorship, which is limited to just a few corporations and firms, is “Foundational.” These sponsors “benefit from the highest levels of access, visibility, and executive support” and “play a leadership role within the CERAWeek community and are provided premier engagement and contribution.” Foundational Partners also “may collaborate with CERAWeek to develop a customized Special Program or community aligned with specific objectives.” This year’s Foundational Partners were Chevron, Amazon, and BlackRock, as well as professional services firm Marsh McLennan and the coal company Xcoal. The next level of Partners are “Strategic,” which “supports active engagement and access across a wide range of the CERAWeek community.” Among other things, Strategic Partners’ “objectives are supported by the CERAWeek Steering Committee,” and these Partners “receive priority consideration to contribute content and access to CERAWeek Private Communities. Strategic Partners for CERAWeek 2025 included ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, EQT, Freeport LNG, NextEra, Carlyle Group, Microsoft, and dozens more. Notably, a major power player behind CERAWeek is Daniel Yergin, a Pulitzer-prize winning author who helped found the conference over four decades ago and serves as chairman of CERAWeek and Vice Chairman of S&P Global, the well-known financial services company that runs CERAWeek (read more on Yergin below). The Fossil Fuel Industry, the Houston Power Elite & the Houston Police Foundation The power elite of Houston is deeply intertwined with the fossil fuel industry. Energy companies dominate the board of the city’s main chamber of commerce, the Greater Houston Partnership, making up around a quarter of its membership. Houston is one of the fossil fuel corporate headquarters of the world, home to key global and regional offices of many numerous companies including ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Phillips 66, Occidental, and many others. The fossil fuel industry also has a close relationship with the Houston Police Department through the Houston Police Foundation, a non-profit that channels corporate donations to city police. Oil billionaires like Jeffery Hildebrand sit on the Houston Police Foundation board, and the foundation helps fund police programs, including the Mounted Patrol that aided attacks on climate activists during CERAWeek. The Houston Police Department used horses to try to disperse activists peacefully protesting CERAWeek, injuring and nearly trampling people in the process.

In fact, oil companies like Chevron, Shell and Valero sponsor individual Mounted Patrol horses. (For more on police foundations and their ties to the fossil fuel industry, check out our 2020 story and our 2021 report coauthored with Color of Change). CERAWeek and the Fossil Fuel Industry Power Structure CERAWeek performs several roles within the fossil fuel industry and wider energy power structure. Legitimizing the Fossil Fuel Industry While CERAWeek ultimately functions as a show of force for the fossil fuel industry and a space for it to hash things out, it has a veneer of legitimizing wonkiness and expertise. CERAWeek was founded by Daniel Yergin in the early 1980s, a decorated author who has carved out a space as a benign interlocutor between the fossil fuel industry and civil society — an author with intellectual bona fides who has deep and direct personal ties to the corporate energy world. Yergin has numerous influential ties to academic institutions, like MIT and Columbia University, and government-aligned think tanks like the Council on Foreign Relations and the Brookings Institution. He has authored several well-known books about the fossil fuel industry — most notably his award-winning The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money & Power — while also serving on advisory boards and boards of directors of key industry groups and think tanks worldwide. Over his career, Yergin has run high-profile energy consulting firms and serves as a Senior Advisor with private equity giant Carlyle Group (a “Strategic Partner” of CERAWeek that is also a major fossil fuel investor). All told, the spectacle of a massive, public-facing conference, well covered by the media, celebrating and discussing the energy industry and its fossil fuel giants, all given a wonkish gloss by analysts, academics and consultants, provides cover for an industry whose core operations are widely known to be driving climate chaos. Networking, Schmoozing, Dealmaking Gatherings like CERAWeek are critical sites for industry networking. CERAWeeks says it convenes “over 450 C-Suite executives, 80 ministers and top officials, and 325 media representatives.” Participants chat, schmooze and socialize behind closed doors or at any number of extended Happy Hours. This helps build and cultivate relationships and allows for conversations that lead to new contracts, deals, positions, and so on. At CERAWeek, this networking is all the more important because many high-level representatives of government and international companies are attending. The energy priorities that are hashed out through these conversations — the formal panels, and also the backroom discussion — can have deep implications for global energy policy and geopolitics (one of the event’s themes). Taking Stock of Industry Trends and Fractions CERAWeek’s huge numbers and ambitious agenda also present a moment for taking stock of the energy industry’s present and its future. Conference themes explore the gamut of areas within the corporate energy world. This year’s themes included Policy and Regulation, Oil and Gas, Power, Grid and Electrification, Trade and Supply Chains, Business Strategies, Minerals and Mining, Technology and Innovation, and more. Different fractions of the energy industry, some aspiring, can also use CERAWeek to make their case. “AI and Digital,” for example, is a conference theme this year. The rise of data centers needed to power AI has strengthened the nexus between the fossil fuel industry, Big Tech, and financial investors, at the expense of a green energy transition. The event is also filled with the world’s top private equity firms and asset managers, who remain not only wedded to fossil fuels but retreated from previous net zero commitments – indeed, Finance (“The Capital Transition”) was a theme of CERAWeek this year. Greenwashing CERAWeek is also a performance in greenwashing. The fossil fuel industry today is simultaneously doubling down on its core business of oil and gas extraction and production while also giving lip service to concerns over carbon emissions and seeking to capture and profit from false solutions like carbon capture and hydrogen. CERAWeek allows the fossil fuel industry to do both these things. The conference is dominated by fossil fuel giants who are currently racing to drill and burn more oil and gas, but also to gobble up subsidies and produce hydrogen plants — falsely promoting hydrogen as a climate “solution.” Indeed, CERAWeek 2025 included themes like “Managing Emissions,” “Climate and Sustainability,” and “Hydrogen and Low-Carbon Fuels.” But as Kate Aronoff reported on a previous CERAWeek: “There’s some people involved with copper and lithium and various things, but the main focus is oil and gas, and with a pretty specific focus within oil and gas on some of the bigger companies.” CERAWeek’s Billionaires Among the most powerful people at CERAWeek are a slew of oil billionaires, tech titans, and fossil fuel financiers who, whether they show up in person, stand to benefit from the discussions and deal-making that occur at the gathering. Among these are: Hundreds of Climate Activists Protest CERAWeek Recognizing the opportunity to disrupt mainstream messaging about CERAWeek, and to confront the fossil fuel industry and lift up the stories of frontline communities fighting fossil fuel infrastructure, dozens of climate justice groups participated in coordinated days of actions protesting CERAWeek. Hundreds of elders, young people, and residents of rural areas and cities, marched to demand an end to fossil fuels and accountability of wealthy polluters. Hundreds of climate activists marched in downtown Houston to protest CERAWeek. Credit: Lauren Parker. Activists specifically focused on the build out of methane gas (also known by euphemism “liquified natural gas”) export terminals along the Gulf South. These export terminals rely on transporting fracked gas via pipelines and have notoriously imperiled local communities due to toxic air releases, overdrawing water resources, and destroying precious marine habitats. In June of 2022, the Freeport LNG terminal actually exploded, sending a 450-foot ball of fire and pollutants into the air, shaking the houses of nearby residents. Freeport LNG’s CEO, billionaire Michael Smith, was a featured speaker at CERAWeek, stating that methane gas was “necessary”, echoing other speakers’ sentiments which downplayed the urgent need for renewable energy sources. At the culmination of the march, eight frontline and Indigenous activists and allies sat in the intersection in front of the CERAWeek conference. The Houston Police Department violently attacked these activists with Mounted Patrol horses before conducting arrests. As noted above, major oil and gas corporations sponsor these horses, underscoring the tight and varied relationships between policing and the energy industry to suppress struggles against fossil fuels. CERAWeek, an extravagant display of billionaire power and the convergence of the fossil fuel industry, government, tech and finance, stood in stark contrast to those in the march – everyday people fighting for clean water and air in their hometowns, sovereignty for Indigenous communities, an end to extractive energy systems, and a liveable future for generations to come.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the March 25, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that the true state of Novo’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” On December 20, 2024, during pre-market hours, Novo announced headline results for its REDEFINE-1 trial, which determined CagriSema had achieved a weight loss average of only 22.7% after 68 weeks. The Company attributed this diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed “flexible” nature of the protocol. This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients apparently completing the dose escalation period and thus being treated with “2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly,” the maximum dosage of CagriSema contemplated by the trial, during the 52-week maintenance period in the manner outlined by the published protocol for the REDEFINE-1 study. Investors and analysts reacted immediately to Novo’s revelation. The price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024, Novo’s stock price fell to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024, a decline of about 17.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo Nordisk’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: 5 phones you should consider instead of the Google Pixel 9a

Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? The year has only really just begun, but we’ve already had some great phones launch in 2025. Samsung wowed us as usual with the new Galaxy S25 series, but then Apple came out of nowhere to release a brand new model in its lineup, the iPhone 16e. And the hits just keep on coming too; Google has just revealed the Google Pixel 9a, the latest in its line of excellent mid-range priced smartphones. The Pixel 9a continues Google’s record of excellence within the midrange space, with a 1080p 6.3-inch display, 120Hz refresh rate, the usual showstopping cameras, and a brand new and stunning look, for just $499. That’s an incredible deal, and no mistake — but it’s not the only game in town, not by a long shot. While the Google Pixel 9a is the new hotness, there are plenty of other smartphones that can, and should, steal your attention away from Google’s latest. Here are five of the phones you should also consider if you’re tempted by the Google Pixel 9a. One of the major advantages of the Pixel 9a is that it’s able to use Google’s own flagship Tensor G4 processor, giving it top-tier power at a lower price. But it’s not alone in offering staggering amounts of performance at a midrange price tag, and it’s actually quite likely this top pick beats the Pixel 9a hands down. The OnePlus 13R is OnePlus’s current top midrange handset, and it’s an incredibly powerful package starting from just $600. Key to this performance is the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 found in the device’s heart. It’s not this year’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, but as last year’s processor of choice for phones like the Galaxy S24 Ultra and OnePlus 12, it’s still plenty powerful, and the OnePlus 13R fair flies through any task you give it. Backing that flagship chip up is 12GB of RAM and storage starting from 256GB. If those sound like flagship specs, well, they are, and it’s a big part of the reason this phone is such a winner. Behind it all is a massive 6,000mAh battery that easily manages two days of use on a single charge, with three days being possible on lighter use. Recharging has been lowered from last year’s OnePlus 12R, but that still puts it at a mighty 55W, outdoing the charging speeds of Apple’s, Google’s, and Samsung’s flagships. There’s no wireless charging though, which means the Pixel 9a does have some advantages over the OnePlus phone. But with the Pixel 9a’s wireless charging being limited to a measely 7.5W, you’re probably better off not having it at all. OnePlus had to cut corners somewhere, and so it’s fair to say the 13R isn’t the most attractive phone around. Still, it’s not ugly by any means, with the best word for it being “functional”. The aluminum frame and glass back both have matte coatings, and the build and execution are solid and professional. There’s very little to complain about here, except for a lack of style and flair. There’s even less to complain about where the display is concerned. It’s a 6.78-inch AMOLED panel with a 2780 x 1264 resolution, a variable 1-120Hz refresh rate, and a max brightness of 4,500 nits. It’s bright, clear, and extremely responsive. Finally, there’s the camera systems. OnePlus’s camera systems have previously tended to sit in the “okay” pile, but have recently graduated to being solidly good across the board, and we see that continue here. The 13R has 50-megapixel primary lens, a 50MP telephoto lens with a 2x optical zoom, and an 8MP ultrawide lens around the back, and a 16MP fixed-focus camera around the front. It performs well across the board, and while it lacks the longer zooms of actual flagship phones, it’s still a camera system you can rely on. The price starts from a full $100 more than the Pixel 9a at $600, but if you can afford to spend the extra, then the OnePlus 13R is a solid competitor for Google’s latest. Nothing’s rise has been nothing short of incredible, and it’s most recent phones have been devices you can’t afford to miss out on. The Nothing Phone 3a Pro is a stellar midrange phone, and absolutely one of the best phones Nothing has ever produced. At just $70 more than the Pixel 9a’s starting price, it’s another strong option if you’re looking for a midrange phone, and it comes with the bonus of a jaw-droppingly unique style. We’ll start with the design, because it’s unlike anything else you’re likely to see. The transparent back is chaotic and eye-catching, and whether you like it or not, it’s certainly unique. the rear camera is contained in a large circular module, like a OnePlus phone — but unlike OnePlus, Nothing’s signature Glyph lighting can be seen around the module. These LED lights will react to your phone use, mimicking timers and showing the proximity of your Uber ride, and can even function as a camera flash or flashlight. Whether or not you like the design, and we’re sure plenty won’t, you can fault Nothing for trying something different. The 6.77-inch AMOLED display is good too, thanks to a 120Hz refresh rate and 1080p resolution. You won’t find a flagship chip here, instead the Nothing Phone 3a Pro uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 processor. While it may not have the high-power shine of the OnePlus 13R or Pixel 9a, it’s still a very capable chip, and we rarely found it lacking. There’s also 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage as standard, giving a strong spec baseline. In terms of software, you can either use Google’s stock Android 15, or swap it for Nothing’s minimalist take on Android. Either is fun, and we suggest trying out both. Nothing has shoehorned a lot of AI into this phone, but it’s worth mentioning Essential Space, which is an AI-powered organizer that stores your screenshots and voice notes collected with the dedicated Essential Space button. It’s a quieter and more subtle take on AI than we’ve seen recently, and it has potential as something that could be actually useful. The camera is good, but let down by a rubbish 8MP wide-angle lens, which isn’t a surprise. However, the 50MP main lens is strong, and it’s joined by a 50MP periscope zoom with a 3x optical zoom. These two lens are great, and take well blanaced shots with punchy colors and just the right contrast and brightness. It’s just a shame that yet another manufacturer packs in a terrible 8MP wide-angle lens. The battery isn’t anything special, managing a single day on one charge. However, it offers 50W fast charging, again putting a number of flagships in the dust, even if it doesn’t offer wireless charging at all. This is simply one of the best smartphones Nothing has made yet, and at $570, it’s within reaching distance of the Pixel 9a. If a unique style and flair matters to you, or if you really love the look Nothing has gone for, then check this phone out. You won’t be disappointed. It’s hard to wade around this price point without attracting some big fish, and they don’t get much bigger than the Apple iPhone. The Apple iPhone 16e has supplanted the iPhone SE as the cheapest iPhone, and while it may no longer reach down into budget territory, it’s now an even more solid alternative to the Google Pixel 9a. The iPhone 16e is a blast from the past in a number of ways. Not only does it sport the notched style of display we thought had disappeared with the iPhone 14, but it also has only one camera lens in its rear camera setup. It’s still unmistakably an iPhone, but the design makes it clear this is the lowest tier of Apple’s smartphone. The colors are a little dull, but it’s still not a bad looking phone, even if we wish it had more pop. It’s light though, which is a real bonus for one-handed use. The 6.1-inch display is the same size as that found on the iPhone 16, but unfortunately, it also has the same 60Hz refresh rate. While we didn’t expect Apple to leapfrog the iPhone 16 with a cheaper model, it continues to be a disappointment that Apple refuses to embrace superior screen technology for what are still expensive smartphones. But putting that aside, it’s still a great display, with bright colors and deep blacks. The biggest draw here is the inclusion of Apple’s AI service, Apple Intelligence. The 16e has been built to include all of Apple’s AI features, including Visual Intelligence, and many new AI inclusions in Apple’s apps, like the Notes app. It’s the cheapest way to experience Apple Intelligence. Performance is similarly strong, being powered by a slightly tweaked version of the A18 processor. It’s slower than most of the other iPhones you can buy from Apple, but not to be point where it’ll be overly obvious or a problem. Battery life puts most of its stablemates in the dust though, with the phone managing multiple days of use on a single charge. That longevity comes at a price though, specifically being limited to 20W fast charging, and not having MagSafe at all. It does have wireless charging, but it tops out at 7.5W. Unsurprisingly, the single lens on the 16e’s rear doesn’t match up to other iPhones in terms of pure versatility, but it’s not a bad lens by any means. It’s a 48MP lens, and can use pixel binning to improve low light shots, and can crop a shot to 12MP to spoof a 2x optical zoom. If you’re coming from a phone with multiple lenses, then the single lens may be a disappointment. But if a camera is just something that’s nice to have, then this won’t let you down. The iPhone 16e isn’t for everyone, that’s for sure, but it’s still a solid alternative to the Pixel 9a. If a top-tier camera is a must, then avoid this. But, if an iPhone is a tempting offer for you, then this is the option to check out. It starts from $599. The Pixel 9a is a standout phone at $499, but so is the previous year’s flagship Pixel, the Pixel 8. While prices for this phone can tend to fluctuate, we have seen it at the price of $499 for the 128GB model, putting it on an equal footing with the midrange version of this year’s Pixel range. That gets you an extremely good camera system, long battery life, and all of the same AI features, packaged up in a flagship phone. The centerpiece of any Pixel has always been the camera, and the Pixel 8 doesn’t disappoint in this regard. The 50MP main lens on the Pixel 8a is likely to be comparable to the 48MP shooter on the Pixel 9a, with similar apertures. The Pixel 8’s main camera is simply excellent, one of the best we tested in 2024, and though the wide-angle lens disappoints, it doesn’t take away from what is an excellent camera setup. As a bonus, you get all of Google’s impressive AI editing features as well, meaning even the most disappointing shots can be made to shine. Enough about the cameras though, how does the rest of the phone hold up? Very well, as it turns out. The Pixel 8 is driven by the Google Tensor G3 processor. This flagship chip is powerful, as you’d expect, and though it still has some temperature issues, they’re nowhere near as bad as they once were, even if it still runs warmer than Qualcomm chips of the same era. The display is gorgeous, too, and has a dynamic 120Hz refresh rate like the Pixel 9a. The battery lasts around a day, though you can stretch far into two days with light use. Charging speed is on the slower side, with speeds tapping out at 27W for wired charging and 18W for wireless. That’s not the slowest charging we’ve seen recently, and largely on par with, for instance, most iPhones, but it’s far slower than you’ll get on a OnePlus smartphone. Like the Pixel 9a, you’ll get seven years of software updates, though keep in mind the Pixel 8 has already chewed through some of that. However, it still has a strong innings to go before it needs replacing, so that’s definitely not worth worrying about. The build quality is excellent too, and really shows off the flagship nature of this particular phone. Like the build, the Pixel 8 is solid all around, with little to detract from a very positive picture. While it began life at $699, with the release of the Pixel 9 it’s not uncommon to see this phone priced as well as $499, putting it bang on par with the Pixel 9a. At that price, the Pixel 8 is an absolute bargain. There aren’t many phones underneath the Pixel 9a’s $499 price that we’d recommend checking out, but the Moto G Stylus 5G (2024) is good enough to warrant your attention — plus, it has one thing that Google’s midrange phone does not: A stylus. Hidden away inside the phone when not in use, the stylus is just a basic stylus, so it doesn’t have a Bluetooth connection or any special tricks, like being used as a camera shutter, or pressure sensitivity. Instead, it’s just a srtlus for writing or doodling. it works well for this, though the device’s palm rejection is not great, and it doesn’t particularly feel natural when you use it. It feels like exactly what it is: Plastic dragging over glass. Still, you can get used to that, and it’s ideal if you find a stylus useful but don’t always have one on you. The design is a surprisingly high point for this phone. It’s made from plastic, but the vegan leather backplate feels great, and it feels solid despite the cheaper materials. The 6.7-inch OLED is also pretty good, sporting both a 1080p resolution and a 120Hz refresh. Heck, even the camera, usually a letdown on budget Motorola phones, is pretty good. It won’t beat any of other the phones on this list, but it won’t embarrass you either. The rest of this phone does, admittedly, feel like the budget offering it is. It’s powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 chip and 8GB of RAM, and while the G Stylus works fine, with only occasional stutters and slowdowns, it’s not up to the same standard as the flagship level chips in every other phone on this list. Water and dust-resistance tops out at IP52, behind everything else on this list — but there are some upsides too. Namely, a headphone jack and a microSD card slot. There’s one big downside to this phone though, and it’s one area where the Pixel has it beat hands-down. The Moto G Stylus was only ever going to get one software update — yes, you read that right, one — and considering that upgrade was going to be from Android 14 to 15, it’s likely already been and gone as you read this. So unlike the Pixel 9a, which has seven years of updates to look forward to, the Moto G Stylus has … none. That’s a big letdown. The Moto G Stylus 5G (2024) is available for $400, significantly cheaper than the Pixel 9a. It is showing its age a little, but it’s still a solid buy, and one of Motorola’s few good releases in a bad year. It’s decision time, folks. After much hype since it was announced, the iPhone 16e is now available in stores. The phone, which is now Apple’s budget phone, has a lot of great things going for it, assuming you fall into Apple’s demographic for the handset. And yet, if you plan on purchasing a new iPhone right now, there’s possibly a better phone you should buy instead, the iPhone 14. After Apple announced the iPhone 16e, it became clear that it shares more similarities with the iPhone 14 than with the iPhone SE 3, which many initially believed the rumored “iPhone SE 4” would replace. The iPhone 16e may turn out to be a much better device overall. Consequently, it’s not surprising that the introduction of the iPhone 16e has led to the discontinuation of both the iPhone SE 3 and the iPhone 14. Google is making it significantly harder for scammers to reach Pixel device owners. It plans to introduce new scam detection features for the Phone by Google and Google Messages apps in March, courtesy of AI. According to a post on the Google Store, the new feature identifies conversation patterns most likely associated with scammers. We’re less than a month away from the launch of Google’s next smartphone, the budget-friendly Pixel 9a. But what will this phone cost? We now have the answer, and it’s excellent news for anyone deciding between it and the recently announced Apple iPhone 16e. According to Android Headlines, the new Google phone costs $499 for the 128GB version and $599 for the 256GB version. This is the same price the company is charging for the Pixel 8a, which the Pixel 9a will soon replace.

Title: 6 Top Stocks To Buy Now For April 2025

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock , Contributor. Software companies have an opportunity to shine in 2025. If nothing else, the stock market is full of surprises. 2025 began with investors feeling upbeat, with a new business-friendly president stepping into the White House. Now, a sell-off may be in the works as investors worry about tariffs and trade wars. Nodding to the tariff turmoil, here's a list of domestic services businesses as the top stocks for April. Since services are not subject to tariffs, these providers should be somewhat insulated from an escalating trade war. The top stocks below were identified by screening health care, technology and financial services businesses on these parameters: Mostly software companies passed this test, partly due to the margin requirement. The top six in terms of market capitalization were selected. The table below introduces six American companies that meet the criteria outlined above. Metrics are from stockanalysis.com and company earnings releases. For more investing ideas, see: best stocks for 2025 and best ETFs. Salesforce offers subscription customer relationship management (CRM) software that helps businesses manage and track customer interactions. The company has the leading market share in CRM, estimated at 29.2% by Apps Run The World. Salesforce also launched an agentic AI solution called Agentforce in 2024. Agentic AI supports complex conversations without human intervention. Salesforce has a strong balance sheet and a leading market position in CRM. The company also has a track record of revenue growth, though the growth rate has slowed in recent years. Offsetting the revenue trend has been a dramatic rise in operating margin from below 6% in fiscal 2023 to over 20% in fiscal 2025. Cash flow has gained also—the company’s free cash flow margin was nearly 33% last year, up from 20% two years ago. The latest results from Salesforce show momentum in data cloud and AI solutions, where revenue is up 120% from the prior year. The company also closed 5,000 Agentforce deals last year. These newer solutions enhance the company’s growth opportunity and complement its dominant position in customer relationship management software. Salesforce pays annual dividends of $1.60 per share, for a yield of 0.57%. If you're looking for a higher dividend yield, see this list of best dividend stocks. Intuit develops and supports software for personal and business tax reporting, business accounting and consumer credit management. The company also owns the small business email service provider Mailchimp. Intuit is building AI capabilities into its solutions and the strategy is paying off. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, Intuit reported 17% revenue growth driven by increases in its Global Business Solutions Group, Credit Karma and Consumer Group. GAAP operating income also rose 61% and GAAP diluted EPS shot up 26%. Management expects 12% to 13% revenue growth for fiscal year 2025. As Zacks Investment Research notes, the company has single-digit penetration in its addressable market valued at $300 billion—meaning the growth opportunity is significant. The company also maintains a strong financial position, with $2.5 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet. Intuit pays annual dividends of $4.16 per share, for a yield of 0.69%. The company also actively repurchases shares, investing $721 million in the second quarter. Adobe provides a suite of creative applications through subscriptions to corporate marketing departments, graphic designers, video editors and photographers. The company also provides analytics and publishing solutions. Investors have not been kind to ADBE. The stock lost 20% in 2024 and is down nearly 9% in 2025. Impatience has prompted these losses. Adobe has devoted resources to developing and launching AI tools, but the monetization has been disappointing. In the company’s last earnings call, CEO Shantanu Narayen said the team is focused on using AI to drive new, engaged subscription customers, rather than selling standalone AI products. This makes Adobe a longer-term play. The current stock price represents a reasonable value on a company that should continue growing revenue and earnings by 10% or more annually. Adobe does not pay a dividend but has a buyback yield of 2.86%. Autodesk provides subscription-based software for 3-D modeling, drafting, design, collaboration and production management. Customers include architects, engineers, product designers and media and entertainment companies. Autodesk reported consensus-beating revenue and earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. The company also provided a fiscal 2026 guidance above expectations. Still, the stock is down about 9% year to date. The story is like Adobe’s. Investors want to see stronger growth in Autodesk's cloud and AI offerings. However, the company is focusing on margins first. In the latest earnings release, Autodesk announced a restructuring plan that will terminate 1,350 employees. The savings will fund further cloud and AI investment. Autodesk expects to deliver industry-leading GAAP margins and fiscal 2026 revenue growth of 12.4% to 13.6%. PTC makes subscription-based software that helps teams design, engineer and optimize products and manufacturing systems. The company serves aerospace, defense, automotive, electronics, industrial equipment and health care businesses. PTC has a good record of growth in annual recurring revenue (ARR) and cash flow, demonstrating low customer churn and a productive business model. In its first quarter 2025 earnings release, PTC reported 11% ARR growth on a constant currency basis and 29% free cash flow growth. Both numbers are relative to the prior-year quarter. Operating margin declined somewhat to 20% from 22%. The company also spent $75 million on share repurchases. PTC is also reshaping its go-to-market strategy to be more targeted. This should enhance the growth opportunity for a business model that already has high visibility and resilience. Manhattan Associates offers cloud-enabled supply chain and inventory management software to retail, consumer goods, technology, life sciences, government and industrial customers. The company sells its applications on a subscription basis. Manhattan Associates has beaten consensus revenue and EPS estimates for at least eight consecutive quarters. In 2024, the company delivered over $1 billion in revenue for the first time and increased its cloud subscription revenue by $83 million. GAAP diluted EPS rose 24% to $3.51. The company also spent $241.6 million on share repurchases. The bad news is twofold. Manhattan Associates had a slow fourth quarter for services revenue and President and CEO Eddie Capel recently retired. Investors quickly repriced the stock, which has dipped 39.7% since the earnings release. The pullback creates upside for the company, which is expected to deliver 32% EPS growth in 2025. Bottom Line Software companies have an opportunity to shine in 2025. Growth prospects look especially strong for providers that are transitioning to AI-driven solutions. And, the escalating trade war—a potential lag for goods exporters—may signal it's time to increase your exposure to technology services stocks.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MRK) and reminds investors of the April 14, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil’s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck’s securities at artificially inflated prices. On February 4, 2025, before the market opened, Merck filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC. In the current report, Merck announced their fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, in which it stated that “GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 [s]ales [d]eclined 3% to $8.6 Billion.” In addition, the current report stated Merck’s “decision to temporarily pause shipments of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 into China beginning February 2025 through at least mid-year.” On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $9.05 per share, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Merck’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

(“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) and reminds investors of the April 28, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

Title: Google ignored Android XR at GDC 2025, and indie VR devs are concerned

One Quest gaming dev told us that "Google is treading the same path towards failure" as Stadia and Daydream by shutting smaller devs out. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Google made no effort to reach out to indie VR and XR game developers at GDC 2025. Combined with social media reports that most top-selling Quest devs were "rejected" from Google's Android XR boot camps, it's painting a worrying picture about what to expect from Android-based headsets like Project Moohan. Google loves GDC; it has a huge presence there every year. This year, its panel on real-world AI applications in game development filled up 45 minutes before it started. It had several Android gaming panels and a large Play Store exhibition in the West hall, and it partnered with Samsung on another Galaxy panel. GDC is well-known for its private hotel demos off the show floor. Perhaps Google made an Android XR push behind closed doors with larger VR publishers. But Google's decision not to court indie VR devs publicly with panels or demos — at the same conference where Meta pushed its new passthrough tech and reassured devs how profitable their store is — seems pretty telling. It's all but guaranteed that the Google I/O 2025 program in May will have workshops on Android XR — to court 2D app devs. Gaming rarely comes up at I/O, and this platform is public, so it's not as though Google needs to wait for some big reveal. Will Google have the same disdainful approach to VR gaming that Apple does with the Apple Vision Pro? At least one VR gaming dev we spoke to thinks that Android XR is already heading in the wrong direction by spurning the people who made Quest headsets so popular. The Quest Store is flooded with meme games, social multiplayer targeting teens, and indie content you'd typically see on Steam. It turns off many VR elites and frustrates VR devs making "serious" content, but these games strike a chord and keep people returning to the Quest 3S headsets more regularly to spend money. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Android XR is compatible with Unity, OpenXR, and WebXR, with controller support built into the UI. During our press preview, they suggested that headsets like Samsung's Project Moohan "support gaming use cases." They said that "hopefully" this universal compatibility "will lead to incentives for people to port over to Android." You'd think the owner of the Play Store would recognize the power of smaller developers to strike it big and reach out to those developers to give Android XR greater visibility. Instead, according to developer RJ White at Soaring Roc Studio, "9/10 top devs for the Quest platform" have been rejected from Android XR coding boot camps, and he sees this as a premature death knell for the platform. I've seen 9/10 top devs for the Quest platform rejected for @GoogleARVR's bootcamps for Android XR now. I'm talking about devs / people with games that were in the top 5 top selling. Google is so quick to repeat their mistakes from Daydream, see y'all on @killedbygoogle soon pic.twitter.com/JOH2AJ7gwiFebruary 20, 2025 "Google is treading the same path towards failure that they did with Stadia and Daydream. By shutting out some of the most experienced and smaller studios and developers, they're showing they've learned zero lessons with how to manage or grow a modern software platform," said White in a discussion with Android Central senior editor Nick Sutrich. White, whose indie studio has made several Quest titles like Spiders and FireZone, says that studios and games from "humble origins" power huge successes from major platforms. However, he believes Google is "too focused on trying to force a polished diamond out of a large team as quickly as possible" instead of "cultivating an environment that lets those smaller teams thrive and carve a gem out on their own." "XR developers aren't just game developers; they're 3D interaction experts," says White. However, by rejecting them and prioritizing the same "just make things flat" approach as Apple, Android XR will be "2D dependent to a fault." White's thoughts don't prove Android XR is bound to fail, and we don't have evidence that Google is fully ignoring Quest developers beyond word of mouth. Rather, it reflects a perspective among some VR developers that without overtures from Google, it's hard to know how much stock to put into Android XR — or whether Google knows what it needs to do to make it successful. Big Tech wants to make productivity XR headsets the new alternative to laptops, but none of the big-name consumer products have sold at a massive scale. Apple allegedly sold 500,000 Vision Pros, and Samsung wants to sell 100,000 Moohan headsets. VR gaming remains the one definitive use case that has attracted millions of users. So, is there a reason why Google wouldn't prioritize it? Samsung's Project Infinity headset is rumored to have Sony-made micro-OLED displays with 13.64 million pixels per eye, arriving in the second half of 2025 with a hefty price tag. Beyond that, other announced Android XR devices include a Sony enterprise headset that'll cost almost $5,000, Xreal AR glasses, and an unconfirmed Lynx XR headset that may trend toward the pricey side. So perhaps Google wants to focus its outreach to the enterprise and productivity app creators because it knows people won't spend thousands of dollars to play Gorilla Tag when the Quest 3 is already here. It needs a "killer app" to justify its existence, and Google must assume that app won't be a game. Maybe Google truly believes that gaming developers don't need an Android XR boot camp because they can easily port over OpenXR games without much effort. Perhaps, as White suggests, they're underestimating these XR developers' ability to do more than gaming software and create useful 3D app content, whether for headsets or AR glasses. We know Android XR will have similar camera tech to the Quest's new passthrough API, but Google didn't come to GDC to appeal to XR devs as Meta did. Or maybe Google is following the lead of its hardware partners, who don't care as much about gaming. If Samsung decides to make a Quest rival, then Google could prioritize gaming, right? Frankly, whatever Google's reasoning, I'm not a fan of Google potentially downplaying the importance of gaming for the future of Android XR. It should be building up momentum now so that devs are ready to overload Project Moohan with content by the end of the year. Hopefully, by Google I/O in May, VR gaming devs will have more reason for optimism that Android XR is a viable new platform for them.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough , Senior Contributor. Bitcoin and crypto prices have dropped after surging in the aftermath of Donald Trump’s election victory (though a White House official has just revealed how Trump could spur the bitcoin price higher). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has fallen to around $85,000 per bitcoin, down from a peak of $110,000 per bitcoin in January, as traders scramble to protect their bitcoin from a new, mystery threat. Now, after the Federal Reserve confirmed expectations it could be about to open the “floodgates," Fed chair Jerome Powell has warned the risk of recession is rising—something BlackRock’s head of bitcoin and crypto has predicted could be a “big catalyst” for the bitcoin price. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has said the risk of recession has ticked up—something ... More BlackRock's head of bitcoin and crypto thinks could fuel a bitcoin price boom. “I don’t know if we’ll have a recession or not, but a recession would be a big catalyst for bitcoin,” Robbie Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, told Yahoo Finance in an interview, pointing to how recession responses such as increased fiscal spending, deficit accumulation, lower interest rates and monetary stimulus have historically boosted the bitcoin price. "And it’s catalyzed to some extent over fears of general social disorder,” Mitchnick said. “And that, too, unfortunately, is something that can happen in a recession.” This week, the Fed downgraded its economic growth outlook while raising its inflation projection while leaving interest rates on hold. "If you look at outside forecasts, forecasters have generally raised … their possibility of a recession somewhat, but still at relatively moderate level … [it] has moved up, but it’s not high,” Fed chair Jerome Powell said during his post-interest rate decision press conference. Ahead of Powell’s comments, Moody’s Analytics’ chief economist Mark Zandi told CNN it “feels like we’re being pushed into recession” by Donald Trump’s international trade tariffs. “The recession risks are uncomfortably high and they’re rising,” Zandi said. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has fallen back in recent weeks but remains far higher than before Donald Trump's ... More election victory despite the Federal Reserve warning recession risks are rising. Meanwhile, UCLA Anderson School of Management has published an official “Recession Watch” for the first time in its 73 years of economic forecasts, with its chief economist Clement Bohr predicting Trump “could very well be the author of a deep recession.” Earlier this month, BlackRock’s chief executive Larry Fink warned Trump’s trade policies will stoke inflation—dampening expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates through 2025 and invoking the specter of “stagflation”—characterized by an economic slowdown coupled with spiraling price rises. Fink, who has become one of the most bullish voices supporting bitcoin on Wall Street, led BlackRock in its campaign to get a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approved in the U.S. through 2023, with a fleet of bitcoin funds making their debut in January 2024 before surging to become some of the fastest growing ETFs of all time. U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs broke $100 billion in net assets for the first time in November, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) now boasting around $50 billion in assets under management.

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone , Contributor. The decline in stock prices combined with plunging consumer sentiment and uncertainty surrounding ... More tariffs has uncreased uncertainty about future economic growth. Since stock prices ultimately depend on earnings, the pace of economic growth is crucial input to future stock performance. After briefly hitting correction territory in the previous week, which is defined as a 10% decline from an earlier high, stocks had a modest rebound last week. The S&P 500 sits 7.6% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has faired worse with a drubbing of 18.5% since mid-December. The pressure on stocks stems from an economic growth scare and policy uncertainty surrounding tariffs. Market Returns With the S&P 500 closing over 10% below its February 19 high on Thursday, March 13, stocks officially entered a correction. In the twenty-one U.S. stock market corrections since 1980, the average return in the 12 months following was 13.4%, which on the surface would lead to significant optimism regarding future returns. If the data is sorted between periods when the U.S. economy entered recession within those 12 months after the correction, the results are less compelling at a 1.9% average gain. Of course, if an economic downturn is avoided, the results have been spectacular on average at 19.1%. Average Stock Returns After S&P 500 Correction The strong bond between avoiding recession and better returns following a stock correction makes monitoring the economy's health even more critical. Economists' consensus estimate of 2025 economic growth has dipped slightly to 2.2%, nowhere near recessionary levels. Unfortunately, economists have a poor track record of accurately predicting economic growth with enough lead time, and consensus estimates tend to lag behind real-time data. Consensus U.S. Economic Growth Forecasts Economic models attempting to forecast the current quarter of GDP growth were developed to address the challenges associated with consensus estimates. These estimates adapt to the most recent economic releases to predict growth. This methodology has its challenges but adds additional color to the economic backdrop. The Atlanta Fed model points to a contraction in economic activity in the first quarter, which is probably overstated because much of that downward estimate comes from a marked increase in imports to avoid future tariffs. The St. Louis Fed’s model remains in positive territory. The forecast difference between the two is vast for their first-quarter GDP estimate. After last week's Federal Reserve meeting, the committee noted that “uncertainty around the economy outlook has increased.” Estimated Frist-Quarter U.S. Economic Growth While accurately forecasting an economic downturn in advance with any accuracy is exceptionally challenging, monitoring some high-frequency data can help get an early warning about increased recession risks. These indicators were chosen because they are updated weekly or daily and have shown a strong correlation with economic activity. Indeed, other indicators are crucial, but they are typically only available monthly, sometimes with a significant time lag. The labor market is probably the most crucial part of the economy since consumer spending eventually wanes without wages to fund the purchases. Initial claims for unemployment benefits are reported weekly, but the four-week moving average of claims is used here to reduce volatility. While initial claims are above the lows, the level is not exhibiting a strong uptrend or at a level consistent with economic woes. Initial Jobless Claims The other weekly job data is ongoing claims for unemployment benefits, which are also off its lows and show a slow uptrend. This indicates that it is taking longer for those losing their jobs to find a new one. Remember that the number of employees in the U.S. has more than doubled since 1970, so even though the current roster of those receiving unemployment benefits is as high as it was during the 1969-1970 recession, the numbers aren’t comparable. The bottom line is that the labor market is softening but has not yet reached recessionary levels. Continuing Claims The corporate bond market should undoubtedly be part of the mosaic to monitor the economy’s health. Baa corporate bond data has a long history and arguably provides a look at the “typical” credit quality of companies, as Baa credit rating is the lowest level of investment-grade bonds. The spread is the yield investors demand beyond U.S. Treasury bond rates to compensate for the default risk from buying corporate bonds. These spreads expand when investors worry that more bond defaults could be on the horizon, typically driven by deteriorating economic conditions. While the spreads on Baa corporate debt are above recent lows, the increase seems insufficient to trigger substantial fear of any impending economic downturn. Corporate Bond Spreads The Chicago Fed produces the National Financial Conditions Index weekly. It looks at 105 measures across three categories, risk, credit, and leverage, to create a measure of financial conditions. According to the Chicago Fed, “Positive values of the NFCI have been historically associated with tighter-than-average financial conditions, while negative values have been historically associated with looser-than-average financial conditions.” The chart shows that these periods of tighter-than-normal financial conditions have often been associated with recession. Like the previous measures, financial conditions have worsened but remain below warning levels. Financial Conditions The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have recently been underperforming the less economically sensitive defensive stocks. This suggests that an economic growth scare is one cause of the recent stock weakness. While it should continue to be monitored, the relative weakness of cyclical stocks has improved off its most recent lows and isn’t at the level seen before past recessions. Performance Of Cyclical Stocks The 10-year Treasury minus 2-year yield is probably the most well-known predictor of recession. Historically, when the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury falls below the 2-year yield, also called yield curve inverting, a recession is coming. Since the 1970s, a yield curve inversion has occurred before every recession. The only blemishes on its record are the 1998 and mid-2022 inversions, which produced no subsequent economic recessions. The U.S. economy did see a significant slowdown in the first half of 2022 but rebounded in the second half. Unfortunately, even when the signal is correct, it has variable lead and lag times. The yield curve still has a better prediction track record than the economists and is used in about every Federal Reserve model, so it is worth watching despite its warts. The curve is not currently inverted, so this model forecasts no recession. The Yield Curve & Recessions The economic calendar releases for the week are not of the highest importance. The two most notable are February durable goods orders on Wednesday and personal income and spending on Friday. Last week, the Federal Reserve left its projected rate cuts at two but increased the inflation and unemployment forecasts. In addition, the median forecast for GDP growth was lowered. Markets saw this as a somewhat dovish signal and pushed expectations closer to three cuts for 2025, with the first in June. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected Correctly forecasting a recession is challenging in the best of times, but the post-COVID-19 period, with its irregular economic cycles, makes it even more perilous. These high-frequency indicators should provide a reasonable early warning system for a sizable economic contraction. Currently, the odds point to an economic slowdown rather than a recession, which bodes well for reasonable returns from the correction bottom. As always, there are no easy calls when it comes to forecasting the short-term movement of stocks or the economy, especially in a period of increased uncertainty around the severity of the tariffs. For example, though most are rightly concerned about the downside risk from tariffs, there is an upside if somehow this pressure results in better trade terms for U.S. companies. There is always uncertainty. So, investors should have a portfolio with enough cash and bonds to cover short-term expenses. This cushion can help moderate the impact of stock declines on a portfolio and allow one to withstand the inevitable stock declines to experience the benefits of long-term ownership. Within the stock portion, focus should be paid to companies that can weather economic dislocations and perhaps even take advantage of them, regardless of their stock price movement.

Title: Trump hints at 'flexibility' for China even as he plows ahead with global tariff plans

Morning Rundown: Military group chat fallout, genetic data for sale, and the politics of helping young men Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Markets whipsawed further Friday in response to President Donald Trump’s latest comments on tariffs, with stocks briefly turning higher after he hinted that there may be “flexibility” in his plan to impose blanket tariffs on most U.S. trading partners next month before retreating back into the red. In remarks in the Oval Office, Trump said he was not interested in making exceptions to the broad “fair and reciprocal” duties he’d foreshadowed in February that he now says will be imposed April 2. But he nevertheless offered some daylight. “I don’t change. But the word flexibility is an important word,” Trump said. “Sometimes it’s flexibility. So there’ll be flexibility, but basically it’s reciprocal.” The president singled out China, saying there would be room for “talk” on trade issues with the country while adding he hoped to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the near term. Despite that bit of give, it has become clear that the Trump administration is not backing down on its plan to establish sweeping trade levies, even as those efforts have sharply curbed near-term U.S. growth expectations while putting pressure on global GDP. “Every member of the Trump administration is aligned on finally levelling the playing field for American industries and workers,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to NBC News this week. “President Trump has assembled the best and brightest trade team in modern American history to reignite American Greatness, and they are hard at work following the same playbook — President Trump’s playbook — to deliver for the American people.” Even as stocks have firmly entered correction territory — declining more than 10% from their recent highs — Trump and other administration officials have also not pushed back on the idea that the U.S. economy could be in for a rough patch as a result of its tariff policy. Asked by Fox News host Maria Bartiromo if he was expecting a recession this year, Trump replied, “I hate to predict things like that.” Amid all of the developments around the Trump administration’s economic policy, the S&P 500 stock benchmark was set for its fifth-straight week without gains, finishing at levels last seen in September, while forecasters across the board reduced their outlooks for gross domestic product (GDP), the standard measure for a country or region’s growth. The rest of the world is starting to adjust. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has revised its U.S. GDP forecasts down from 2.4% to 2.2% for 2025 and from 2.1% to 1.6% for 2026. Global GDP was also revised lower, from 3.3% to 3.1% in 2025 and 3.3% to 3.0% in 2026. “Higher trade barriers in several G20 economies and increased geopolitical and policy uncertainty [is] weighing on investment and household spending,” the OECD said. And while the European Union announced this week it was delaying its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods to allow for “additional time for discussions with the U.S. administration,” it was not seeking to “diminish the impact of our response,” it said, “in particular as the EU continues to prepare for retaliation of up to EUR 26 billion.” “This approach allows us to deliver a firm, proportionate, robust and well-calibrated response to the U.S. measures, while minimising potential negative impacts on EU producers and consumers,” an E.U. spokesperson said. Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve warned Trump’s tariffs could impose “transitory” price increases on consumers and businesses in the U.S. “Some near-term measures of inflation expectations have recently moved up,” Fed Chair Jay Powell said Wednesday. “We see this in both market- and survey-based measures, and survey respondents, both consumers and businesses, are mentioning tariffs as a driving factor.” He added that the on-again, off-again tariffs had ramped up overall uncertainty in the economy. Despite an avalanche of threats, Trump has so far only implemented a global 25% tariff on steel and aluminum alongside additional levies on China totaling 20% on top of pre-existing ones. The president has twice suspended 25% duties on most goods coming from Canada and Mexico, while also threatening — but not implementing — 200% duties on Champagne and wine imports from the European Union. But on Friday, Trump suggested the biggest global trade shake-up of all was coming in less than two weeks. On April 2, the U.S. will seek to impose massive trade duties on any and all nations that have imposed duties on U.S. exports — part of a move Trump has said is designed to level an uneven playing field for U.S. goods that contributes to America’s large annual trade deficit. “April 2nd is Liberation Day in America!!!” he wrote on Truth Social. “For DECADES we have been ripped off and abused by every nation in the World, both friend and foe. Now it is finally time for the Good Ol’ USA to get some of that MONEY, and RESPECT, BACK. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!” In a new note, Gregory Daco, chief economist for the EY-Parthenon consultancy, said that while economic fundamentals “have been and remain disinflationary,” looking ahead, “tariffs, confusion around trade policy and tighter immigration policy mean the risks to inflation are tilted to the upside.” “Not long ago, US exceptionalism dominated the narrative — now, the mood has turned sharply pessimistic. What changed?” Daco said. Private-sector surveys, he said, have turned negative in recent weeks “due to broad based policy uncertainty & tariffs implementation.” “Consumer sentiment has plunged, small business uncertainty is near record highs, purchasing managers are increasingly downbeat, and consumer inflation expectations are surging.” The upshot? There is now “rising stagflation risk” with both price growth and unemployment potentially trending higher, he said.

Iconic ice-cream company Ben & Jerry’s (B&J), founded by two hippies based on knowledge gained through a $5-correspondence-course, is taking on the might of its parent, the Anglo-Dutch multinational Unilever. The issue: Unilever has sacked B&J’s chief executive, ostensibly for the ice-cream company’s public support for Palestinian refugees, in alleged contravention of their merger agreement of 2000 that B&J’s board would retain its independence. It’s a classic David-versus-Goliath spectator sport. But the essence of this spat between the owners of dominant brands—a popular ice-cream maker (this columnist’s preferred flavour remains Cherry Garcia, launched in 1985 as homage to Grateful Dead lead guitarist and vocalist Jerry Garcia) and a consumer goods conglomerate—is the influence that geopolitics can have on brands.

Title: Trump’s Policy Toward Latin America: Crippling Sanctions against Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/trump-policy-toward-latin-america/5882481
Time Published: 2025-03-23T10:14:12Z

During his first term, President Donald Trump exerted a “maximum pressure” campaign against perceived U.S. adversaries in Latin America and elsewhere. Among other hardline policies, he levelled crippling sanctions against Venezuela—leading, ironically, to a mass exodus of Venezuelans to the United States—and reversed former President Barack Obama’s rapprochement with Cuba. But just how committed is Trump to fighting communism in Latin America at this particular moment—in Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua? Today, it’s anyone’s guess. Trump’s recent threats against Panama, Canada, and Greenland, on top of his clash with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, take the spotlight off the “real enemies,” as usually defined by Washington. In that sense, Trump’s foreign policy actions in the first two months of his second administration are a far cry from his first, when regime change was the unmistakable goal. In sharp contrast to the rhetoric of his first administration, in his March 4 address to the Joint Session of Congress Trump made no reference to Nicolás Maduro, Miguel Díaz-Canel, or Daniel Ortega. It’s even unclear whether Trump will pursue the use of international sanctions, which he ratcheted up against Venezuela and Cuba in his first government. So far, Trump has indicated that his use of “tariffs as punishment” may be preferable to international sanctions, which, as one insider stated, the president “worries are causing countries to move away from the U.S. dollar.” Unlike Trump’s policies on immigration, trans rights, and taxation, his Latin American policy is plagued by vacillations and uncertainties, a sign of his deepening reliance on a transactional approach to foreign policy. The anti-communist hardliners in and outside of the Republican party are not pleased. Take Venezuela as an example. The Venezuelan opposition led by María Corina Machado had all the reason to be upbeat when Trump won in November and then chose Latin America hawk Marco Rubio as Secretary of State. “Sadly, Venezuela is governed by a narco-trafficking organization,” Rubio declared at his confirmation hearing, in which his appointment was unanimously ratified. He then said that “the Biden administration got played” when it negotiated with Maduro in late- 2022 and issued a license to Chevron, which is “providing billions of dollars into the regimes’ coffers.” With regard to Cuba, Rubio issued an ominous warning: “The moment of truth is arriving, Cuba is literally collapsing.” Events in Syria added to the euphoria on the right. Just days before Trump’s inauguration, Machado told the Financial Times, “Don’t you think [the generals supporting Maduro] look in the mirror and see the generals which Assad left behind?” But then came the friendly encounter between Trump’s envoy for special missions Richard Grenell and Maduro in Caracas in late January, when Maduro agreed to turn over six U.S. prisoners in Venezuela and facilitate the return of Venezuelan immigrants from the United States. Days later, the Biden-approved license with Chevron for exploiting Venezuelan oil, constituting a quarter of the nation’s total oil production, was allowed to roll over. At the same time, Grenell declared that Trump “does not want to make changes to the [Maduro] regime.” To complicate matters further, the Department of Homeland Security announced that it would cancel Biden’s extension of Temporary Protected Status for over 300,000 Venezuelan immigrants, on grounds that “there are notable improvements in several areas such as the economy, public health, and crime that allow for these nationals to be safely returned to their home country.” These developments did not sit well with the Miami hawks and the Venezuelan opposition. Notorious Miami Herald journalist Andres Oppenheimer put it forcefully: “The handshake of Grenell and Maduro fell like a bucket of cold water on many sectors of the Venezuelan opposition… and was like a legitimation of the Maduro government.” Oppenheimer went on to point out that although the Trump government denied it had cut a deal with Maduro, “many suspicions have been raised and will not dissipate until Trump clarifies the matter.” After Grenell’s trip to Venezuela, the issue of the renewal of Chevron’s license took surprising twists and turns. In a video conversation on February 26, Donald Trump Jr. told María Corina Machado that just an hour before, his father had tweeted that Chevron’s license would be discontinued. Following a burst of laughter, a delighted Machado directed remarks at Trump Sr.: “Look, Mr. President, Venezuela is the biggest opportunity in this continent, for you, for the American people, and for all the people in our continent.” . Watch on X . Machado appeared to be attempting to replicate the deal between Zelensky and Trump involving Ukraine’s mineral resources. But simultaneously, Mauricio Claver-Carone, the State’s Department’s Special Envoy for Latin America, told Oppenheimer that the license granted Chevron was “permanent” and automatically renewed every six months. Then, just one week later, Trump reversed his position again. Axios reported that the latest decision was due to pressure from three Florida GOP House members who threatened to withhold votes for Trump’s budget deal. Trump allegedly acknowledged this privately, telling insiders: “They’re going crazy and I need their votes.” Trump’s threats against world leaders come straight out of his 1987 book The Art of the Deal. For some loyalists, the strategy is working like magic. Trump’s approach can be summarized as “attack and negotiate.” “My style of deal-making is quite simple,” he states in the book. “I aim very high, and then I just keep pushing and pushing… to get what I’m after.” This is precisely what happened when Trump announced plans to “reclaim” the Panama Canal, prompting a Hong Kong-based firm to reveal plans to sell the operation of two Panamanian ports to a consortium that includes BlackRock. Not surprisingly, Trump took credit for the deal. A similar scenario played out in the case of Colombia, in which President Gustavo Petro yielded on U.S. deportation flights to avert trade retaliations. For the same reasons, Mexico’s Claudia Sheinbaum began sending 10,000 troops to the northern border to combat irregular crossings and then, on March 6, asked Trump by phone: “’How can we continue to collaborate if the U.S. is doing something that hurts the Mexican people?” In response, Trump temporarily suspended the implementation of 25 percent tariffs on Mexican goods. In The Art of the Deal, Trump boasts about this strategy of bluffing, such as when he told the New Jersey Licensing Commission that he was “more than willing to walk away from Atlantic City if the regulatory process proved to be too difficult or too time-consuming.” Similarly, Trump has repeatedly stated that the United States does not need Venezuelan oil. In fact, global oil volatility and the possibility that other nations will gain access to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves are matters of great concern to Washington. The “Art of the Deal” approach to foreign policy exemplifies Trump’s pragmatic tendency. The Maduro government and some on the left welcome the pragmatism because it leaves open the possibility of concessions by Venezuela in return for the lifting of sanctions. Venezuelan government spokespeople, at least publicly, give Trump the benefit of the doubt by attributing his annulment of Chevron’s license and other adverse decisions to pressure from Miami’s far right. The Wall Street Journal reported that several U.S. businesspeople who traveled to Caracas and “met with Maduro and his inner circle say the Venezuelans were convinced that Trump would… engage with Maduro much like he had with the leaders of North Korea and Russia.” But this optimism overlooks the contrasting currents within Trumpism. Although the convergences are currently greater than the differences, priorities within the MAGA movement sometimes clash. On the one hand, right-wing populism spotlights the issue of immigration, anti-“wokism,” and opposition to foreign aid, all designed to appeal beyond the Republican Party’s traditional upper and upper-middle class base of support. On the other hand, the conventional far right calls for nothing short of regime change and destabilization actions against Venezuela and Cuba. While progressives have sharply different views on Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua, the far-right hawks currently define all three governments as “leftist” and, in the recent words of Rubio, “enemies of humanity.” Maduro’s agreement to collaborate on the repatriation of immigrants in return for the renewal of the Chevron license exemplifies the conflicting priorities within Trumpism. For the anti-left far right, the alleged deal was a “betrayal” of principles by Washington, while for the right-wing populists it was a victory for Trump, especially given the enormity of Venezuela’s immigrant population. Another example of clashing priorities upheld by the two currents is the Trump administration’s decision to cut foreign aid programs to a bare minimum. In his recent address to Congress, Trump denounced an $8 million allotment to an LGBTQ+ program in an African nation “nobody has heard of,” and other alleged woke programs. Even Florida’s hawk senator Rick Scott has questioned the effectiveness of foreign aid, saying: “Let’s see: the Castro regime still controls Cuba, Venezuela just stole another election, Ortega is getting stronger in Nicaragua.” Scott’s statement reflects Trump’s transactional thinking regarding the Venezuelan opposition: too many dollars for regime-change attempts that turned out to be fiascos. In contrast, hawk champion Oppenheimer published an opinion piece in the Miami Herald titled “Trump’s Foreign Aid Cuts are a Boon for Dictators in China, Venezuela and Cuba.” The issue of U.S. aid has also produced infighting from an unexpected source: within the Venezuelan right-wing opposition. Miami-based investigative journalist Patricia Poleo, a long-time opponent of Hugo Chávez and Maduro, has accused Juan Guaidó and his interim government of pocketing millions, if not billions, granted them by the U.S. government. Poleo, now a U.S. citizen, claims that the FBI is investigating Guaidó for mishandling the money. The influence of the anti-leftist component of Trumpism can’t be overstated. Trump has become the leading inspiration of what has been called the new “Reactionary International,” which is committed to combatting the Left around the world. Furthermore, the hawks who have expressed interest in toppling the Maduro government (which the populist current is not at all opposed to either)—including Rubio, Elon Musk, Claver-Carone, and National Security Advisor Michael Waltz—populate Trump’s circle of advisors. It is not surprising that during the honeymoon phase of Trump’s presidency, a populist wish list would receive considerable attention. But the annexation of the Panama Canal, Canada, and Greenland is unrealizable, as is the conversion of Gaza into a Riviera of the Middle East. His tariff scheme is not far behind. Furthermore, while his use of intimidation has helped him gain concessions, the effectiveness of this bargaining tactic is limited—threats lose power when endlessly repeated. Finally, Trump’s unfulfilled promises to lower food prices and achieve other economic feats will inevitably add to the disillusionment of his supporters. Trump loathes losing and, in the face of declining popularity, he is likely to turn to more realistic goals that can count on bipartisan support in addition to endorsement from the commercial media. In this scenario, the three governments in the hemisphere perceived to be U.S. adversaries are likely targets. Short of U.S. boots on the ground—which would not garner popular support—military or non-military action cannot be discarded against Venezuela, Cuba, or Nicaragua, or, perhaps, Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: How to invest in this market sell-off, according to a top fund that's survived every crash since 1929
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-selloff-investing-tips-top-fund-managers-vanguard-wellington-2025-3
Time Published: 2025-03-23T09:00:01Z
Full Content:
In the last 96 years, the Vanguard Wellington Fund (VWELX) has been through it all. Three months after its inception, what's now the third-longest-active mutual fund got rocked by the Wall Street crash of 1929, which effectively marked the start of the Great Depression. And in the decades after that disaster, it faced a litany of wars, recessions, and the financial crisis. Needless to say, portfolio managers Loren Moran and Daniel Pozen are undaunted by this latest stock-market correction. They're confident in their time-tested investing strategy, which has lifted the $113 billion fund past 92% of its competitors in the last 15 years, according to Morningstar. However, while many bottom-up investors simply block out the noise, Moran and Pozen think a tunnel-vision approach to investing is misguided. Instead, they go on the hunt during selloffs. "Where there's volatility, and there may be perceived weaknesses in companies that we disagree with, it certainly is a good hunting ground in terms of finding ideas and an opportunity to add alpha as well," Moran said in a recent interview. Being opportunistic doesn't mean becoming a day trader. Pozen stressed to Business Insider the importance of patience and maintaining a long-term perspective. He said he's focused on how his investments and fund fare over several years instead of sweating quarterly swings. Investors have been anxious about a lot lately. US stocks have gotten slammed in the last month as President Donald Trump's tariffs on key trade partners raise the risk of trade wars that may cause either a recession or stagflation, which is marked by weak growth and higher prices. Add in the market's elevated valuation, and it's clear why many are cutting equity exposure. In this momentum-driven market, these headlines can cause people to jump to conclusions, Moran said. So while it's smart to stay attuned to what's happening, she and Pozen are wary of overreacting to any narrative, including that economic growth is increasingly likely to fall flat. Successful stock selection is what separates mutual funds from the pack, and Pozen said choosing quality companies at a discount becomes much easier during down markets. "Cyclical companies that are perceived to have lots of exposure to that environment — if they're sold off as a result, then we will look at that company and see to what extent the stock price reflects too negative an outlook or skew, in terms of the range of outcomes for the business," Pozen said. In other words, when investors race to one side of the metaphorical boat — whether it's by chasing the same stocks or sectors — Pozen is comfortable with taking the other side. That said, a quick glance at the Vanguard Wellington Fund shows that its five largest holdings are all mega-cap growth stocks: Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon. Pozen said that he had to have some exposure to those names to keep pace with the S&P 500, as is his mandate. Going forward, he said he doubts they'll keep rising as much as they have. "It is an objective fact that seven stocks have been the primary driver of the whole market's returns over the last number of years," Pozen said of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. "Now, there is a reasonable case to be made that the path forward for these companies will be more divergent than it has been in the past." However, Pozen and Moran adhering to their fund's strategy is different from following the crowd. A few years ago, the classic 60-40 stock-bond portfolio came under immense pressure, leading some to write obituaries for that once-widely accepted investing strategy. But the fund managers held to their 65-35 stock-bond split, in part because Moran noted that her predecessors made a mistake 50 years ago by bending to asset allocation shifts instead of holding fast and trusting the fund's decades-long track record. "There was a slight move in the early '70s where the asset allocation shifted more towards stocks, and that was actually a period of much more challenging equity returns as well," Moran said. "And so the shareholders really did not benefit from that more aggressive equity-fixed income mix." Studying prior selloffs can yield lessons about the present, the fund managers said, and they hope to capitalize on that knowledge now. When asked where investors should put fresh money to work, Pozen had a clear answer: large-cap banks. He also specifically highlighted Wells Fargo (WFC), which is his largest position on a relative basis, after the mega-cap stocks he needs to keep pace with the index. And it's a few spots ahead of financial giant JPMorgan (JPM), which fits this thesis he outlined. Since the financial crisis, the financial sector has been under tremendous regulatory pressure, and banks have borne the brunt of that scrutiny, Pozen said. "The regulators have really put their thumb on the scale," Pozen said, noting the liquidity ratios and capital requirements large banks had to comply with. "And that has resulted in suppressing returns on equity and growth rates for the sector with good positive outcomes, which are soundness and safety of the sector and economic stability." That overhang is likely to either lift or be lessened during Trump's second term, Pozen noted. He remarked that regulatory pressure "may or may not get better, but it's at least plateauing." In response, Pozen loves large banks that are well capitalized and have the scale and technology investments necessary to take even more market share and ward off fintech rivals. Plus, valuations for many financial firms are dirt-cheap relative to the broader market, especially in Wells Fargo's case. The San Francisco-based bank took tons of heat in the late 2010s for its risk management and sales practices. However, Pozen is confident in CEO Charlie Scharf's leadership in recent years, and the stock has responded accordingly, with shares up 46% since the start of 2024 after a yearslong slump. He's looking forward to seeing what Wells Fargo can do once it's unburdened by excess liquidity and heightened operational costs that come with the regulatory scrutiny it's faced. "As you see regulatory pressure ease for the industry — doubly or triply true for the company — it should be a great opportunity for Wells Fargo to finally realize the potential of the brand and the potential of the business as they get out from some of those pressures," Pozen said.

Title: RWA News: Fidelity Files for OnChain U.S. Treasury Fund, Joining the Asset Tokenization Race

Asset manager Fidelity Investments has filed paperwork to register a blockchain-based, tokenized version of its U.S. dollar money market fund, aiming to join the tokenized asset race. According to a Friday filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company seeks to register an "OnChain" share class of its Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX) and use blockchains as transfer agent. FYHXX holds cash and U.S. Treasury securities and was launched late last year. The Onchain class of the fund currently uses the Ethereum (ETH) network, and the firm may expand to other blockchains in the future, the filing said. The registration is subject to regulatory approval, with the product expected to become effective on May 30. The filing happened as global banks and asset managers increasingly put traditional financial instruments such as government bonds, credit, and funds on blockchain rails, a process often referred to as tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). They do so to pursue operational and efficiency gains and faster, around-the-clock settlements. Fidelity, with $5.8 trillion in assets under management, is the latest traditional financial heavyweight seeking to enter the fast-growing tokenized U.S. Treasuries space. BlackRock (BLK), in partnership with digital asset firm Securitize, launched a similar tokenized T-bill fund last March called BUIDL and has become the market leader with nearly $1.5 billion of assets, rwa.xyz data shows. Franklin Templeton's fund, which was the first on-chain money market product, gathered $689 million in assets since its 2021 debut. The entire tokenized U.S. Treasury market is currently worth $4.77 billion, growing almost 500% over the past year, per rwa.xyz. Fidelity is also one of the largest issuers of spot bitcoin and ether exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the U.S., with its $16.5 billion FBTC and $780 million FETH, per SoSoValue data.

Title: Thrifted gifts: ‘If you’re worried about the environment, it’s conscience-free shopping’

“When somebody has gifted you something that has been thrifted, they put a huge amount of effort into it,” says vintage enthusiast Naomi Fitzgibbon. As owner of her own online boutique Vintage Finds You, Fitzgibbon specialises in second-hand fashion – “Irish vintage is the holy grail for me” – but she has a knack for unearthing all sorts of rare goods, and is passionate about thrifted gifting as a more sustainable alternative to buying something new. Gift-giving is one of five “love languages” coined by American author and radio host Gary Chapman in his 1992 book, which have since entered the cultural lexicon. If, like Fitzgibbon, you find joy in gift-giving, then opting to seek out thrifted gifts for your special someone might elicit an even greater sense of fulfilment. The appeal of giving or receiving thrifted presents is the fact that they are “so different, and they’re never going to find them anywhere else,” says Fitzgibbon. “They’re unique and special.” When on the hunt for gifts for family and friends at markets, in charity shops and online, she puts “a lot of thought into trying to find something they want, but that they’re not going to find anywhere else”. The item will hopefully be “a one-off thing” that can be treasured for years to come. If you are unsure whether a second-hand gift is right for someone, “test the water and see what they say,” she says. “You can always ask” for their opinion, by saying something like: “What would you think about that, would you wear it?” You’ll soon know whether the water is hot or cold. “If you’re into vintage yourself and people ask ‘Where did you get that’ and you go, ‘Oh, it’s vintage’ and they’re turning their nose up, you know it’s not going to work for them,” says Fitzgibbon. “Most of my friends and family appreciate vintage pieces, but there’s no point in buying [second-hand] for [for some people] because it’s just not their thing.” You could consider a piece of jewellery like a bracelet or necklace if second-hand clothes aren’t their cup of tea, she adds. “Ask the vendor as well, because they’re probably used to dealing with people who might be a little unsure.” Approaching your gift shopping with “an idea of what their likes and dislikes are, and what they are into” helps narrow the focus. “Homeware? Glassware? You can find some incredible vintage books in some of the Oxfams,” says Fitzgibbon, showing off a Japanese hand-lacquered jewellery box she found in Blackrock Market in Dublin. She is a regular visitor to Dublin’s various flea markets, and mentions Thomas Street as one hub. “There’s the Milk Market in Limerick, and some really good ones in Belfast as well,” she says. One of the most cherished thrifted gifts Fitzgibbon has received is a vintage silk Chinese hand-embroidered jacket. “It was a gift from my husband as he knows I’m fascinated by oriental vintage silks like this. He got it in Naples.” She wore the piece to a recent school reunion. Delphine Velut and Richard Harte run Le Zeitgeist Bohemia Flea Market in Phibsborough, north Dublin. Every second Sunday of the month, about 100 traders gather at the venue tucked behind Phibsborough Shopping centre. Some 60 stalls, featuring everything from leather goods, antiques, prints, vintage toys and clothes to mid-century furniture, handmade jewellery, candles and crafts can fit inside, sheltered from the elements. Another 40 stalls, full of fashion and bric-a-brac, occupy the outdoor area. The market has become immensely popular among the local community. “We have thousands of people coming through our door on a given Sunday,” says Harte. “For us it’s about [offering] a wide variety of quality things and also keeping an eye on what’s happening in the community. There are some lovely stories about traders testing their product and using us for a platform and then they’ve gone on to much bigger things, maybe opening shops in the city.” They both particularly enjoy the eclectic selection of trinkets on offer from “the bric-a-brac guys”. “We just love the outside area,” says Harte. “Although we do have some art and craft stalls, the emphasis is on creating a dirty free market, for want of a better word ... It’s so real.” The pair are proud to have created “a place where people can go and rummage and just not know what they’re going to find”. Like Fitzgibbon, Harte is a big fan of thrifted gifting. “If you’re conscious about the environment, it’s conscience-free shopping.” “All my gifts around Christmas time, I’d get them in the market. No matter who [the potential recipients] are or what they’re into, you’re going to find something there that’s going to tick the boxes.” It is important to keep an open mind and embrace the unexpected when on a thrifting mission for a gift. “Have something in mind but be prepared to go home with something completely different,” Harte advises. As a trader himself, he suggests customers bringing cash – “because it’s harder to haggle with a credit card”. “The first price is not necessarily the end price. They’re expecting a haggle. There’s always a bit of movement on the price.” Come prepared to root around. “It’s not the high street. Not everything is going to be laid out. You need to be in that mode, prepared to rummage through and seek out the bargains.” Market prices range broadly, so there’s something for every budget. “You could buy something for 50 cents, or a sideboard off the mid-century furniture guy for €1,500.” “If you have something in mind, just speak to [the traders] and tell them what you’re looking for. They could have something to bring you next month. That’s my advice on looking for the perfect gift.” Robert Reddin, one of the organisers of The Fairyhouse Market in Ratoath in Co Meath, echoes Harte’s advice over haggling. “If I was going for the first time I’d make sure I had small denominations. You are expected to do a bit of haggling.” The car boot sale, founded in 1991, operates every Sunday from the grounds of the Fairyhouse Race Course, except for race days. “My father started the market over 30 years ago with a partner and myself, and then other partners soon took over,” says Reddin says. The market has a selection of traders offering a mix of brand new goods, second-hand items and food stalls. “You never know what you’re going to find. As they say, one man’s junk is another man’s treasure. There are things that you don’t see in the average shop or shopping centre.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Her mother gave her 20 reasons not to buy – but she went sale agreed anyway

For Gráinne Wynne, owner of Beautiful South, a fashion boutique in Rathmines, 2020 was a difficult year. It started with her father having to go into a nursing home. Then the pandemic happened and then she separated from her husband. Divorced and with two children to house, and a finite amount of money with which to do so, she had to box clever to find them a new home. Like many of us, she was looking for something a bit special that she could make her own. She wanted a contemporary look, and had a penchant for poured concrete – as anyone who has popped into her shop on Castlewood Avenue in the Swan Centre, Rathmines, and coveted the brands on the hangers there will know. The place looks cool, but the atmosphere is warm and welcoming. It’s not the kind of place to sniffily look you up and down for daring to cross its threshold. She wanted a home that looked and felt similarly, and viewed about 100 properties in her attempt to find it. She even got as far as going sale agreed on a small house in Killiney. It had a big back garden with the potential to extend into it – subject of course to having the money to do so. Building costs put her off. And while she thought she wanted a garden, she realised that she didn’t have the time to attend to it. These combined reasons meant she didn’t go through with the sale. Instead, she followed her heart. Discreetly hidden off Main Street in Blackrock village, Co Dublin, she found a mews of about 118sq m. Originally configured as a commercial office, it had come to the market with residential planning permission. When she saw the space, her heart missed a beat. “My friends thought I was crazy,” she recalls. So did her mother. So much so that she wrote her a letter listing some 20 reasons not to buy it. She was in favour of her buying something more conventional, she recalls. Wynne understood her concerns. “Working in retail is a massive struggle. I had a finite amount of money and no pension,” she explains. “I went with her the first day she visited it,” her 88-year-old mother Marie Wynne says. “When you want something, you look at the plusses. You don’t see the minuses.” For the matriarch, one of the minuses was the number of stairs in the property. It didn’t have a garden either, she recalls, and her daughter Gráinne had wanted an outdoor green space. “If you’re a mother it’s your job to point out snags. Once it’s done, it’s done.” Laid out over four floors, with one room on each, the property’s layout meant Wynne could easily get her 10,000 steps a day in ascending and descending the spiral staircase that forms the spine of the building. Her mother had also flagged this issue. “She might need a pulley to get up the stairs in the future,” she laughs. Mother and daughter toured the area after that first viewing, walking down by the sea, and she realised all the village had to offer, including a wide expanse of Dublin Bay in lieu of a green space. The 88-year-old viewed the refurbishment for the first time only on Christmas Day. “It’s terrific,” she says, having now climbed up to the second floor on both December 25th and again on December 31st. “It’s definitely right for her.” She was over the moon, says Gráinne. “She came back on New Year’s Eve for a party and loved the vibe.” Friends who were equally sceptical were “blown away” by the refurbishment, Gráinne recalls. Fees on commercial buildings Change of use planning permission had already been granted thanks to a design submitted by Node Architects on behalf of the vendor before they brought the unit to market. In the application letter, available to view on the planning website of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, the practice noted “that with the increase of opportunities for people to work from home came a decrease for demand for small office buildings such as this one”. Constructed in 2000 with ocean-liner-like oval windows and slightly curved walls, the four-story cedar-clad space had been vacant, the firm pointed out. In an acute housing shortage, a conversion to residential would create a new dwelling unit in the centre of Blackrock village, contributing to its vibrancy. As it was unoccupied, Wynne didn’t have to pay any rates. But commercial stamp duty was an issue. A good conveyancing solicitor was essential, Wynne says, when buying this type of property. Based in Carrick-on-Shannon, Carol McCormack Solicitors pointed out that while the planning had been applied for it hadn’t yet been acted on. The works and changes to the property would commence only once Wynne was the owner. “So legally, it was still viewed as a commercial unit, which had Revenue implications,” McCormack, explains. “Commercial stamp duty is at a rate of 7.5 per cent, rather than the residential 1 per cent rate.” Once planning is acted on there is a possibility of a rebate, she adds. With house-hunters casting their eyes wider to try to buy alternative options to the restricted stock levels of more traditional residential homes, McCormack feels we’re going to see more of this. The home is accessed through a vehicular arch and while the office had the rights to parking outside, the change-of-use application made the point that this space could be used as an outdoor terrace, In the same application Node Architects’ rationale was that “given the location of the building with easy access to many public transport modes, it is proposed to convert this parking space to an outdoor terrace serving the new dwelling. This will contribute to the open space requirements for the new house and there are additional balconies and terraces on each of the upper levels of the building which also add to this.” But, having committed to the purchase and the additional stamp duty fees, Wynne was left with a really tight budget to do all the works. It needed plumbing throughout, to fit the principal bathroom on the first-floor level, a shower en suite in one of the two bedrooms and a guest wc off her room. These have been fitted with black sanitary ware from the Bathroom Boutique. The electrics also needed attention. The bathrooms were originally server rooms and all their fuseboards had to be relocated, explains Greg Murray of Carne Electrical. “There was also much rerouting of data cables.” The property has two bedrooms and a mezzanine level. There is a charcoal and an off-white palette throughout, with microcement floors and on some walls, supplied by Stone Seal. There is a tiny terrace on each floor which gives access to outside space. Each room is a long rectangle shape that suits contemporary living, especially when zoning an open-plan kitchen diner. While Node Architects had suggested installing it on the mezzanine top floor, she opted for the floor below, because it had the largest footprint. The mezzanine level has been glassed in to dim down sound and heat transference. She retained all the fire doors, made by O’Carroll Joinery when the property was constructed. Greenery from Urban Plant Life, Howbert & Mays, Diarmuid Gavin at Dunnes Stores and Windy Ridge populates each floor. “I could see the potential. I believe in taking something simple and making it beautiful,” she says. She had a lot of help from Irish Conservatories and Building Services, and from her best friend Rod Hayden, who most recently helped her char her timber stair treads. “I’ve learned a lot in the last four years and would feel absolutely confident doing another refurbishment,” she concludes. So much so that she’s named the property Athena, after the Greek goddess of wisdom. There are still some minor elements to tease out. Living so centrally and beside food businesses means that the commercial bins are being fenced in, and an industrial ventilator that is making more noise than she’d like is being sorted, she says. “The place had never been residential before and we’re working together to remedy it.” irishconservatories.com; beautiful.south; © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

For startup employees wanting to rant about their bosses or run a digital reconnaissance on a company before joining it, Grapevine has been a go-to platform for the past few years, allowing it to amass a significant number of users. Now, Grapevine and other similar platforms just a few years in existence are nursing grander ambitions—to transform into a LinkedIn for startups. Grapevine, which was incorporated as Watercooler Chat Pvt. Ltd in 2023 and has raised about $2.6 million from PeakXV Partners and Riverwalk Holdings, plans to launch a job board shortly. “We want to give companies 10 good candidates every time they ask for one and do it faster than LinkedIn," said co-founder and chief executive Saumil Tripathi. That said, Grapevine hasn’t yet figured how it will monetise its job board. Medial, a networking platform for startup founders, investors and employees, is preparing to launch a marketplace for freelance or gig work. About “30% of our posts are people looking for someone to do some work for them," Medial co-founder and CEO Niket Raj Dwivedi said. This freelance marketplace will be locked behind Medial’s premium subscription plan, which costs $22 a year. Medial currently has 700 paying subscribers, who get access to a curated job board, a startup showcase, curated startups-related news, and a tracker featuring venture capital investors, government grants for startup founders, and a list of accelerator and incubator programmes. Peerlist, a platform for users to showcase their portfolios and side projects, also has a job board that charges companies $29 per listing. “We have planned a very straight path to monetisation for this year and the next," said Yogini Bende, co-founder and chief technology officer of Peerlist, which in 2023 raised $1.1 million from angel investors including Hubspot co-founder Dharmesh Shah.

In comparison, Medial has a monthly recurring revenue from subscribers of about ₹3 lakh, with a re-subscription rate of 70%, according to the company. Full-year financials for Grapevine, Medial and Peerlist weren’t immediately available. Also, the total addressable market for a professional networking platform focused on startup employees may not have much headroom for growth.

Title: Novo Nordisk (NVO) Faces Securities Class Action After Weight Loss Therapy Trial Data Disappoints, Analyst Questions Trial’s Design – Hagens Berman

March 22, 2025 10:19 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, March 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege the pharmaceutical giant misled them about the prospects of its experimental obesity drug, CagriSema. Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 2, 2022 – Dec. 19, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo Contact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action: The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug’s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1. The plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a “false impression” of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that the company’s “repeated optimistic claims” about CagriSema’s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study’s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss. The complaint highlights the company’s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared. Following this announcement, Novo Nordisk’s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint’s allegations. “We’re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial’s design and potential tolerability issues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

And we've basically landed right back where we started. Right now, Bitcoin's price now stands at $84,150 per coin after not budging over a seven-day period, according to CoinGecko data. It's up 0.2% on the day, but totally flat on the week. The asset jumped briefly after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told reporters Wednesday that everything was under control and that President Trump's tariffs would have a "transitory" effect on inflation. Bitcoin had been dipping—just like stocks—whenever President Trump abruptly announced tariffs over the past month. But investors seemed to like the news from Powell. American Bitcoin investors had been fast cashing out of Bitcoin ETFs earlier this month, but that all changed this week, Farside Investors data shows. Every day this week, money has flooded back into the new vehicles, with over half a billion entering the funds by Wednesday. About $734 million worth of funds reentered Bitcoin ETFs this week as investor sentiment has changed as speculators expect interest rates to lower this year. Note that the positive sentiment hasn't extended to all crypto ETFs, as Ethereum funds are collectively nursing a now 13-day losing streak (including Friday's fresh data)—even as Bitcoin funds show green over the last six days. Still, investors could still be in for a bumpy ride as data shows that Bitcoin's volatility is at a six-month high due, as worries about the U.S. economy and geopolitical tensions push people to adopt a more "risk-off" mindset. Amberdata Director of Derivatives Greg Magadini told Decrypt that volatility—in the short-term, at least—was likely here to stay. And the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which said it would put right the previous administration's "mess" by being clearer on rules for the digital asset industry, made a statement that applies to Bitcoin mining: proof-of-work mining operations do not need to register their actions as they "do not involve the offer and sale of securities." According to the regulator, as a miner's "expectation to receive rewards is not derived from any third party's managerial or entrepreneurial efforts upon which the network's success depends," the activity does not come under the SEC's jurisdiction. Under crypto-friendly President Donald Trump, the regulator appears to be adopting a more relaxed approach to the space, and and has already scrapped a number of lawsuits and investigations targeting firms in the space. Meanwhile, BlackRock—the world's biggest asset manager—has tried to clear the air about Bitcoin... again. In an interview with CNBC's Squawk Box, the firm's Digital Asset Head Robert Mitchnick said that calling the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap a "risk-on" asset was not exactly accurate. "What we've seen lately seems to be self-fulfilling and actually a self-inflicted wound by some of the research and commentary that the industry does, leaning into this idea of it as a risk-on asset at times," Mitchnick said. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust has been one of the most successful BTC ETFs since its launch last January. Is the Wall Street giant trying to get more clients for its fund?

Title: Is CRWD Stock A Buy At $360?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/03/22/is-crwd-stock-a-buy-at-360/
Time Published: 2025-03-22T13:49:42Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team , Contributor. CRWD Stock CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock has experienced significant volatility this year, beginning with a robust rally from below $350 in early January to exceeding $450 by mid-February. However, this upward momentum abruptly reversed due to several negative developments. The downturn began when the U.S. Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission launched investigations into a $32 million deal with Carahsoft Technology. Compounding these regulatory concerns, CrowdStrike recently issued forward guidance that failed to meet analyst expectations. Market conditions further exacerbated CrowdStrike's challenges, as broader investor anxiety about potential tariff impacts on inflation and economic growth created additional headwinds. This combination of company-specific issues and unfavorable market sentiment has driven CRWD stock down approximately 20% from its February peak, returning to around $360 per share. Now that CRWD stock has seen a decline, it looks attractive but volatile - making it a tricky pick to buy at its current price of around $360. We believe there is minimal cause for concern with CRWD stock, which makes it attractive, but highly sensitive to adverse events as its current valuation is extremely high. Although the high valuation seems justified, given the rapid revenue and earnings growth lately. We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of CRWD stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of CrowdStrike along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, CRWD stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market. • CrowdStrike has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 23.1 vs. a figure of 3.2 for the S&P 500 CrowdStrike's Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. • CrowdStrike has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 40% over the last 3 years (vs. increase of 6.3% for S&P 500) • Its revenues have grown 29% from $3.1 Bil to $4.0 Bil in the last 12 months (vs. growth of 5.2% for S&P 500) • Also, its quarterly revenues grew 25% to $1.1 Bil in the most recent quarter from $845 Mil a year ago (vs. 5.0% improvement for S&P 500) CrowdStrike’s profit margins are worse than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. • CrowdStrike’s Operating Income over the last twelve months period was $-120 Mil, which represents a very poor Operating Margin of -3% (vs. 13.0% for S&P 500) • However, on an adjusted basis, CrowdStrike’s operating margin stood at 21.2% for the last twelve months period. • CrowdStrike’s Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $1.4 Bil, pointing to a high OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 35% (vs. 15.7% for S&P 500) CrowdStrike's balance sheet looks very strong. • CrowdStrike’s Debt figure was $789 Mil at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $89 Bil (as of 3/21/2025). This implies a very strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 0.9% (vs. 19.0% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable] • Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $4.3 Bil of the $8.7 Bil in Total Assets for CrowdStrike. This yields a very strong Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 49% (vs. 14.8% for S&P 500) CRWD stock has seen an impact that was worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. • CRWD stock fell 58.3% from a high of $239.86 on 13 April 2022 to $99.96 on 28 December 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 7 December 2023 • Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $455.36 on 18 February 2025 and currently trades at around $360 • CRWD stock fell 50.0% from a high of $66.03 on 19 February 2020 to $33.01 on 16 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 20 April 2020 In summary, CrowdStrike's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: • Growth: Extremely Strong • Profitability: Weak • Financial Stability: Extremely Strong • Downturn Resilience: Weak • Overall: Strong Surely, CRWD stock trades at rich valuation of 23x trailing revenues, but its average sales growth of 40% and a stellar 85% average growth rate for adjusted earnings, seems to justify the premium valuation. Overall, despite its high valuation, the stock appears attractive but volatile, which supports our conclusion that CRWD is a tricky stock to buy. Not too happy about the volatile nature of CRWD stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Trump Wants to Boost Crypto ‘Stablecoins’ (Which Are Far From Stable)

Time Published: 2025-03-22T13:30:00Z

By Mark Hays President Donald Trump’s recent cockamamie proposal to create a strategic cryptocurrency reserve has been the big crypto news, and not without good reason: It’s an illogical idea, has already caused a small crypto bubble featuring insider trading, and appears to be a quid pro quo for crypto political donors. Even some crypto enthusiasts think it’s a bad idea and a waste of taxpayer money. But the crypto industry has been laser-focused on something more significant: A bill that was voted out of the Senate Banking Committee earlier this month would greenlight a class of crypto assets known as “stablecoins.” Normalizing stablecoins into the fabric of the financial system is critical to broader acceptance of crypto and the crypto casino by banks and other financial firms. Trump appeared to endorse the legislation on Thursday in a video address to the Digital Asset Summit 2025, saying that he has “called on Congress to pass landmark legislation creating simple, common-sense rules for stablecoins and market structure.” If this weak bill becomes law and legitimizes these not-so-stable-coins, the next crypto crash could be far more calamitous for crypto enthusiasts as well as the real economy. What, you might ask, is a stablecoin? Well, most cryptocurrencies lack tangible underlying value, making them highly speculative — people will pay whatever they think other people are willing to pay for them. This makes them infamously volatile and not especially useful to make transactions or as a replacement for money. It’s hard to pay for a loaf of bread, a gallon of milk, or a stick of butter if your crypto token is worth one dollar now, one cent an hour later, or ten cents the hour after that. Enter stablecoins. These cryptocurrencies are assigned a consistent price tied to (or pegged to) an existing currency (such as the U.S. dollar), and they are backed by a reserve of collateral assets that theoretically can repay investors quickly. People buy stablecoins from an issuer with the promise that their price will stay stable and that they can sell them back to (or redeem them with) the issuer at any time, in full, at their stated price, because the issuer has enough collateral assets on hand to pay them back. Editor’s picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time Stablecoins are largely used for crypto investing, like poker chips in a casino. You use your regular money to buy chips to play roulette, then cash out your winnings with the house when you’re done. Crypto investors use stablecoins to buy and sell far more volatile cryptocurrencies. Using stablecoins for these purchases can have lower transaction or conversion fees than using cash. Most crypto investors use stablecoins as a pool of relatively stable, liquid assets more easily available for crypto investing. But the holy grail of stablecoin promoters is using them for payments. Boosters want stablecoins to replace your debit or credit card as a tool for buying ordinary goods and services, claiming blockchain technology will make that whole process faster and cheaper. In some countries with highly volatile currency and clunky payment systems, some people use stablecoins for cross-border transactions. But in the United States, it is far easier to use your card; the idea we would convert our paychecks to stablecoins to buy groceries is a bit laughable. Which means the only practical use for stablecoins is gambling on crypto. But there’s truly nothing new under the sun. Stablecoins resemble two existing financial products — bank deposits and money market mutual funds. Banks hold your money, keep records of your account transactions, and give you your money on demand, which theoretically stablecoin issuers also do. And money market mutual funds are used as a slush fund for other investments, like stablecoins are for crypto speculation.

Why Didn’t Anyone Believe Her? ‘We Are in an Emergency’: Progressive TikTok Star Launches Bid to Unseat Old-Guard Dem Trump Loses It Over ‘Distorted’ Portrait of Himself But both bank accounts and money market mutual funds operate under robust regulations, for good reasons. The history of banking includes bank runs and failures, including in recent years — even with safety and soundness regulations and deposit insurance. And runs on money market mutual funds helped amplify the 2008 financial crisis. Investors had lots of money parked in what they assumed were safe accounts. But, when big firms like Lehman Brothers failed, investors rushed to cash out, fueling the stock market meltdown that reverberated throughout the financial system. Stablecoins have already exhibited these same problems that have left investors in the lurch without any guardrails. Stablecoins frequently become unhooked from their pegged value and many of them lack reliable reserves so that people can get their money out promptly. In fact, a study by international economists that looked at 60 different stablecoins found that they all had lost their peg at least once. Meaning they are anything but stable. Terraform Lab’s Terra/Luna stablecoin, an esoteric algorithmic stablecoin backed by little more than fancy computer code, was touted by crypto bros as a revolution in finance and was a darling of crypto venture capitalists. But it was a fraudulent house of cards. When Terra’s delicate algorithm began to melt down, investors bailed and Terra collapsed, triggering the 2022 crypto crash. The episode revealed that Big Crypto is just like Big Wall Street, where a handful of deeply intertwined firms can rapidly spread financial contagion. When one collapsed, the others soon followed. Tether is the number one issuer of stablecoins, and it is seen as a kind of central bank of crypto that props up global crypto trading. But Tether has already settled with the New York Attorney General and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to resolve claims it misled investors about whether it had enough reserves to cover its coins, and failed to complete audits of its reserve assets. It’s also increasingly the stablecoin of choice for money launderers. Even Circle, considered a more serious U.S.-based stablecoin issuer, became unhitched from its price peg in 2023 when the crypto friendly Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapsed. $3.3 billion of Circle’s allegedly safe reserves were held in uninsured deposits at SVB. Had federal regulators not quickly stepped in and spent billions to keep Circle and SVB depositors whole, the entire crypto industry could have imploded. Right now, these stablecoins have almost no federal oversight even though they behave like some pretty ordinary and regulated financial products. So, enacting some regulations for these sketchy things sounds good, right? Not so fast. The Senate proposal has been largely crafted by industry and would essentially allow stablecoin issuers to have their cake and eat it too. It would give stablecoins many of the privileges associated with banking, but fewer of the same responsibilities. For example, the bill would not require stablecoin issuers to get private deposit insurance or have truly stable and robust reserves. Regulators would have little ability to look under the hood, and stablecoin issuers could seek out states with light-touch regulatory regimes to approve their coins. But the bill’s greatest risk is that it would allow Big Tech platforms like Amazon, Meta, or X to become stablecoin issuers. Congress has long prohibited non-financial firms from becoming banks because the combination of commerce and banking is a recipe for disaster. Company-owned banks have incentives to make imprudent investments in their affiliates, and if the affiliate stumbles, the bank can go down with it. But this bill ignores that firewall almost entirely. A Big Tech-issued stablecoin would be company scrip for the 21st century. An Amazon with Bezos Bucks would be not only the dominant retailer of goods, but also a de facto bank, issuing its own currency and holding deposits for millions of customers. It could control access, surveil transactions, manipulate the pricing of goods, and the price of its bespoke money. Or, if X printed Musk Bucks, it could cut off access on a political whim. And if either company went under due to a supply chain crisis or bad management, the collapse could wipe out people’s stablecoin accounts and crater the real economy. In 2019, when Meta (then Facebook) proposed its own Libra stablecoin, there was bipartisan opposition that ultimately tanked the idea. Today, stablecoin backers include both Republicans and Democrats like Senator Gillibrand. What’s changed is that the crypto industry has poured a gusher of money onto a now sycophantic Congress. They have installed crypto hucksters in the White House and in federal financial agencies. Trump has embraced the industry, saying the U.S. will be the crypto capital of the world and creating his own crypto meme coin, while his family operates their own crypto exchange. This week, he called on Congress to pass stablecoin legislation during a taped address to a crypto trade group summit. Now the cryptocrats have their best chance to enshrine their anti-government and self-interested ideas into federal law. This is all part and parcel of Elon Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency’s assault on the federal government, including trying to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and defang banking regulators (just as Musk launches his own financial services platform). Trending Stories Sean Combs Wins Dismissal of Civil Racketeering Claims in Lil Rod's Lawsuit ‘We Are in an Emergency’: Progressive TikTok Star Launches Bid to Unseat Old-Guard Dem Republicans Are Moving to Cripple the Judiciary So Trump Can Do What He Wants Dropkick Murphys on Musk and Band’s Deactivated Twitter Account: ‘We Broke Up With Him First’ And crypto CEOs are demanding Congress pass an industry-friendly stablecoin bill to demonstrate their fealty, but also to pave the way for much worse crypto craziness to come. Stablecoins are really only good for gambling in crypto markets, and this bill is the lynchpin to exposing the entire financial system to the crypto casino. The crypto bros are high fiving over soaring crypto prices now, but once the banks and financial firms are exposed to not only the booms but also the busts, the real economy will be put at greater risk. In 2022, the crypto industry lost over $2 trillion in value. But your bank probably didn’t go under because it wasn’t up to its neck in crypto. But this stablecoin bill — and likely worse bills to follow — could change that, if we’re all suddenly exposed to the risk, fraud, and instability this industry represents. We want to hear it.

Title: Should You Have Emerging Markets In Your Portfolio? How To Decide
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/should-you-have-emerging-markets-in-portfolio/
Time Published: 2025-03-22T13:00:00Z

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock , Contributor. Emerging market securities have risk, but they add a new layer of diversification and upside ... More potential to your portfolio. Emerging markets have underperformed in recent years, but some analysts believe a resurgence is overdue. A report from RBC Capital Management notes some promising trends for these up-and-coming economies. China’s dominance of the segment has lessened, emerging-market currencies have shown strength and the U.S. trade war likely won't involve some important emerging market economies—namely, India, Brazil and South Africa. Does this mean it's time to expand your portfolio beyond developed economies? Let's discuss the pros and cons of investing in emerging markets, how much you should allocate to the segment and three ways to fulfill that allocation. Emerging markets are economies in transition from developing to developed. They are economic adolescents: They show some characteristics of fully developed countries, but they remain less sophisticated than the U.S., U.K., Canada, Germany and others. Relative to developed nations, emerging economies demonstrate: Investment research firm MSCI includes 24 countries in its emerging markets index. Six of the top emerging markets are China, India, Brazil, South Korea, Taiwan and Mexico, according to Nasdaq Contributor Prableen Bajpai. The advantages of investing in emerging markets include higher growth potential, diversification benefits and attractive valuations. Emerging markets can grow quickly. You can see the growth potential informally by reviewing the history of iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM), which tracks the MSCI Emerging Markets index. The ETF grew 338% from April 2003 to December 2007, which averages about 96% annually. In the past five years, the fund has appreciated 8.4% annually on average and is up 11.2% over the last 12 months. To be clear, these growth periods have not been smooth and easy. The iShares ETF has demonstrated dips as extreme as its gains. Even so, the emerging markets fund outperformed the S&P 500 between early 2003 and 2010. Since then, the S&P 500 has pulled ahead. Diversification is a strategy for managing risk and volatility. By investing across sectors, company sizes, asset types and geographies, you incorporate varying behaviors into your portfolio. Ideally, these varying behaviors have a mild offsetting effect when economic or financial market conditions change. Instead of watching all your positions lose value simultaneously, you might see some rise while others fall. The net effect is less extreme behavior for your portfolio as a whole. Emerging markets contribute to this strategy. For example, Brazilian or Chinese equities may experience gains related to local conditions that wouldn't benefit, say, Apple or Microsoft. Or, your domestic stocks may react more negatively to a U.S. economic recession than your emerging markets holdings. Emerging market stocks can be better values than domestic stocks. The P/E ratio of the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF portfolio is 15.63. The fund's P/B ratio is 1.97. Both metrics are modest relative to the S&P 500, which has a P/E of 28.39 and a P/B ratio of 4.87. Emerging market stocks tend to be volatile, partly because they are subject to currency risk and political risk. With greater growth potential comes greater volatility. Emerging market stocks can fall as quickly as they can rise. For example, the iShares fund and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index lost half their value in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis. They also dipped more than 35% between mid-2021 and late-2022. If the local currency loses value relative to the U.S. dollar, it can offset returns or magnify losses. Currency risk can worsen the normal volatility of emerging markets stocks. Purdue University’s Craig Brown notes that the current trade policy uncertainty will likely increase currency volatility globally. Global U.S. companies like McDonald's and Amazon also face currency risk. However, these companies generate a lot of revenue in the U.S., which limits the relative currency effects. War, changing monetary policy and fluid regulations are political risk factors present in emerging market economies. These dynamics can destabilize the business environment, reduce earnings and shrink investment returns. Emerging markets assets are too volatile to be core holdings, no matter how risk-tolerant you are. Their ideal role is a complementary one. Alongside more stable assets, emerging market securities can add upside and improve portfolio diversification. Many investors limit their emerging markets exposure to a single-digit allocation. Here are some allocation data points to consider: The right allocation for your portfolio depends on your risk tolerance and investing timeline. You could start with a small allocation, say 2%, and then build your exposure as you get comfortable with these assets. To decide if emerging market investing is right for you, consider two questions: There are three common ways to invest in emerging markets. The lowest-risk option is purchasing a global securities fund that includes emerging markets exposure. You can also pursue a more targeted emerging markets investment with a dedicated ETF. The riskiest approach is via American Depository Receipts (ADRs), which are stocks of foreign companies trading on U.S. exchanges. Some global funds include emerging markets coverage alongside securities from developed countries. An example is Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US ETF (VEU). The fund has more than 3,800 non-U.S. stocks from around the world. The emerging markets securities account for 26.4% of the portfolio. You can alternatively invest in a dedicated emerging markets fund. iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) holds more than 800 emerging markets stocks. Another option is Vanguard Emerging Markets Bond Fund Investor Shares (VEMBX), which holds primarily government bonds from Mexico, South Africa, Turkey, Brazil, Peru and others. If you prefer individual positions, you can seek out emerging market stocks trading on U.S. exchanges. Examples include chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Chinese tech company Alibaba (BABA) and PDD Holdings (PDD), an ecommerce company that originated in China. For more investing ideas, see best stocks to buy for 2025. Bottom Line Emerging market securities have risk, but they add a new layer of diversification and upside potential to your portfolio. If you decide to invest, move ahead with a small allocation to funds or individual stocks, and build your exposure over time. Depending on your risk tolerance and investing timeline, you could invest 2% to 9% of your portfolio in emerging markets. Emerging market stocks are riskier than U.S. stocks. Political unrest, regulatory changes and reactive currency values can affect business results and equity values. China, India, Brazil, South Korea, Taiwan and Mexico are emerging markets in 2025. Emerging markets can outperform developed markets. This occurred between 2003 and 2010. However, over the past 15 years, developed markets have performed better.

Title: The SEC Resets Its Crypto Relationship
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/03/21/the-sec-resets-its-crypto-relationship
Time Published: 2025-03-22T12:30:00Z

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is looking to reset its relationship with the crypto industry, even before a permanent chair is confirmed by Congress. The latest effort was Friday's roundtable, hosted at the SEC's headquarters in Washington, D.C. and featuring a dozen attorneys representing different views and positions within the crypto industry. You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. The SEC's reset began when Acting Chair Mark Uyeda launched a crypto task force and oversaw his agency withdraw Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, drop a number of ongoing lawsuits, pause a few more and publish multiple staff statements about how the agency might look at memecoins and proof-of-work mining. The SEC is arguably the most important federal regulator in crypto at the moment. While its sister agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, may be the regulator that might one day oversee crypto spot markets, right now it's the SEC that most companies in the sector look to for guidance on what, exactly, it is they can do. The roundtable was split into two portions (three, if you count introductory remarks from the three commissioners): A roughly 90-minute moderated panel discussion, led by former SEC Commissioner and Paredes Strategies founder Troy Paredes, and a 90-minute town hall still moderated by Paredes but featuring questions from the general public. You can read CoinDesk's coverage of the panel discussion at this link. Though the central question during the discussion was — as it has been for years — when and how exactly is a crypto or crypto transaction a security, panelists touched on everything from the role of crypto in boosting ransomware to how exactly companies should operate. Chris Brummer, the CEO of Bluprynt and professor at Georgetown Law, opened up the discussion with his analysis of what the Howey Test actually means: We're basically saying when you have savings, there's an issue of investor protection. The common enterprise prong that we're all familiar with is really addressing a kind of providing problem." "It really just goes to information asymmetries, and then the question of profits goes to investor psychology, greed and fear, the kinds of things that can distort decision-making," he said. "And basically, when you have all those factors together, you have a mandated disclosure [rule]." The SEC's approach thus far has limited a number of crypto projects, Delphi Ventures General Counsel Sarah Brennan said. While many crypto projects are intended to have a broad initial distribution, "the specter of the applications of securities laws" means many projects act more like they'll go public than actually embrace the crypto aspects of their projects. "We see more and more the token is the product … there's different ways that people are artificially supporting price and it's generally been, I'd say, sort of toxic to the market," she said. John Reed Stark, a former SEC attorney, said that the "economic reality of the transaction" is critical. "However you want to look at it, the people buying crypto are not collectors," he said. "We all know that they're investors, and the mission of the SEC is to protect investors." It remains to be seen how the SEC's efforts will continue, but the agency is taking a more active role in publicly engaging with these questions and the industry seems to be responding. The SEC auditorium was about three-quarters full at times, to say nothing of anyone who tuned into the livestream.

Title: How Binance holds over two-thirds of the Stablecoin market

Time Published: 2025-03-22T11:00:18Z

With huge stablecoin reserves and Futures trading volumes, there seems to be no competition at all. Binance has consistently maintained a dominant position in the crypto exchange landscape, with recent data highlighting its significant edge over competitors. From holding a commanding share of stablecoin reserves to leading the pack in Futures trading volumes, the exchange’s market presence continues to outpace other exchanges, Needless to say, these findings have simply reinforced Binance’s role as a key player in the crypto space. In today’s market, stablecoins remain the backbone of on-chain liquidity and trading efficiency – Providing price stability, reducing friction in capital movement, and serving as the default unit of account for traders worldwide. As of March 2025, Binance holds a staggering 66% share of stablecoin reserves among major exchanges, far outpacing rivals like OKX, Bitget, and Bybit. In fact, according to CryptoQuant data, Binance’s reserve-to-market cap ratio has climbed steadily since late 2023, while competitors have seen their shares stagnate or decline. Source: CryptoQuant The data underlined this growing gap – Binance and Binance.US dominate over two-thirds of the stablecoin ecosystem on centralized exchanges, bolstering the exchange’s deep liquidity and investor confidence. With $31 billion in reserves, Binance benefits from strong user inflows and a robust institutional presence. Meanwhile, new stablecoin projects in 2025 – across Layer 1s, fintech startups, and even potential government initiatives – only deepen the exchange’s strategic grip on this rapidly expanding asset class. Binance remains the undisputed leader in stablecoin reserves, holding approximately $31 billion – More than double the combined reserves of OKX, Bybit, and Coinbase. The data revealed a dramatic hike in Binance’s stablecoin holdings since late 2024. This coincided with renewed retail inflows, ETF-driven market optimism, and USDC’s resurgence after Circle’s January deal with BlackRock to expand tokenized treasuries. Source: Cryptoquant While Binance.US also saw some steady growth, competitors like Bitget and Kraken may appear dwarfed in comparison. Binance’s dominance stems from its deep liquidity pools, low-fee structure, and aggressive market-making programs that attract both institutional and retail users. Additionally, its early integration of stablecoins like FDUSD and TUSD as zero-fee trading pairs has kept volumes high. With new Layer 1 ecosystems launching stablecoins, Binance continues to capture most of those inflows. In January 2025, Binance blew past competitors with a staggering $1.08 trillion in monthly Futures trading volume – Nearly doubling Bybit ($509 billion) and eclipsing Coinbase and OKX. While February and March saw a pullback to $717 billion and $498 billion, respectively, Binance still commands the Futures arena. Its lead stems from an unmatched combination of deep liquidity, product breadth, and accessibility for retail and institutional users alike. Source: Cryptoquant The exchange benefits from an intuitive interface, low trading fees, and advanced risk-management tools that cater to high-volume futures traders. In mid-January, Binance also delisted a series of cross and isolated margin pairs, a move that may have streamlined capital allocation and improved trading efficiency for institutional accounts. To put it simply, despite regulatory overhang in some regions, Binance’s global reach keeps it ahead of the curve in this high-stakes derivatives market.

Title: Ireland look to show strides they have made by upsetting France in Six Nations opener
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/03/22/ireland-look-to-show-strides-they-have-made-by-upsetting-france-in-six-nations-opener/
Time Published: 2025-03-22T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
It is a measure of the huge strides made by the Irish team compared to the corresponding first round game 12 months ago in Le Havre that Scott Bemand and his players are embracing much higher expectations of themselves. A year ago the Irish head coach spoke of firing a few shots at the French in that opening game, and succeeded to some extent with two tries in the last 10 minutes. Out of little acorns and all that. Now, having won five of their last seven games, including victories over Australia and New Zealand this season, they expect to be competitive against France and believe they can beat opponents whom Ireland have only overcome three times in 32 previous meetings. Bemand accepts that this year is the tougher schedule, with the big two of France and England (who have finished first and second since 2017) at home whereas they are away to their Celtic and Italian rivals. Yet in insisting they have to move their game further forward in this 2025 Six Nations, Bemand went so far as to say: “We’re hungry to close the gap on the monopoly held by England and France to a degree. They’ve always been the top two in the Six Nations for a good while.” Recalling last year’s Six Nations, Bemand said: “We were able to spend time developing our game, becoming harder to beat, sorting our set-piece out, getting more tries on the board, scoring against France for the first time in three years, scoring against England for the first time in I don’t know how long. “There’s little moments in games that we’ve been able to build. When we went to WXV1, we got more of those moments. We were more in games to the point that we beat a Tier One nation and secondly we were disappointed to lose to Canada. “France are no mugs. France are a very good team, incredibly talented group. Last World Cup they were a kick away from being in the final against the Red Roses. They’re a good group but we believe we’re going to cause more problems this time. We’re going to be a harder team to beat. “Coming out of this fixture on the weekend, this could very well be a quarter-final in a World Cup. So we want to come out of this knowing we can beat them, whether that means beating them or whether that means we’ve got the game to beat them. And by the time we get to a World Cup hopefully, it’s the next step on from whatever we achieve in this Six Nations.” Ireland retain only seven of the starting XV from last year’s 38-17 defeat to the French, while Les Bleus also retain just seven as Gaelle Mignot and David Ortiz make six changes to the French side compared to their last outing, a 39-14 defeat to a New Zealand side which Ireland had beaten 29-17 in the WXV1 last autumn, which suggests the gap has closed further this season. “They’ve had a relatively tough WXV1, and they said they’re reviewed hard,” said Bemand. “Bringing them to our shores gives us a great opportunity to test ourselves.” Still, the centre partnership of Gabrielle Vernier and Nassira Konde remains intact, while inside them Carla Arbez will make her first appearance for France since November 2023 and alongside the heartbeat of their team, the 61-times capped Toulouse scrumhalf Pauline Bourdon Sansus. Ireland perhaps exceeded expectations slightly last season with a third-place finish to secure qualification for both the WXV1 and the World Cup later this year. Although results and the schedule fell their way, they made the most of their luck and have benefited from competing against more elite teams in WXV1. “Getting the same position again is harder to do this year,” admitted Bemand. “So, if we came third, and we win three games, we’ve done better than we did this year. We also want to stretch ourselves. We’re targeting trying to close that gap on the top two, we want to become World Cup contenders. At some point, we got to take some chunks out of a Tier One nation and for us that’s doing something against a France or an England. With the successful reintroduction of the Sevens players, this Irish team has more firepower and more of a cutting edge than the side which lost to France a year ago. Brittany Hogan, Erin King and Aoife Wafer give them more go-forward carrying, Dannah O’Brien brings a strong kicking game and with Stacey Flood hitting the line, Amee-Leigh Costigan’s head-to-head with her French counterpart as captain and winger, Marine Menager, could be worth the admission money alone. France have usually brought more power and pace to this fixture but Bemand is an astute user of his replacements, and has opted for a 6-2 split in the belief that the benches will go some way toward determining the outcome. If Ireland are still in the mix at that stage, then anything is possible. Ireland: Stacey Flood (Railway Union RFC); Anna McGann (Railway Union RFC), Aoife Dalton (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster), Eve Higgins (Railway Union RFC), Amee-Leigh Costigan (Railway Union RFC/Munster, capt) Dannah O’Brien (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster), Emily Lane (Blackrock College RFC); Niamh O’Dowd (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster), Neve Jones (Gloucester-Hartpury), Linda Djougang (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster), Ruth Campbell (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster), Dorothy Wall (Exeter Chiefs/Munster), Brittany Hogan (Old Belvedere RFC/Ulster), Erin King (Old Belvedere RFC), Aoife Wafer (Blackrock College RFC/Leinster).

Institutional interests soar as market uncertainty highlights the role of stablecoins in navigating economic pressures. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The following is a guest post from Maksym Sakharov, Co-Founder & Group CEO of WeFi. The current markets are experiencing tailwinds due to the tariffs imposed by the U.S. administration and retaliatory measures from trading partners. So far, however, the market proponents are saying that Trump’s tariffs are primarily a negotiation strategy, and their effect on businesses and consumers will remain manageable. Adding to uncertainty are the inflationary pressures that could challenge the Federal Reserve’s rate-cutting outlook as inflation is still stuck above the Fed’s 2% target. Besides that, an impending fiscal debate in Washington over the federal budget is also causing jitters in the market. Resolving the debt ceiling remains a pressing issue, as the Treasury is currently relying on “extraordinary measures” to meet U.S. financial obligations. The exact timeline for when these measures will be exhausted is unclear, but analysts anticipate they may run out after the first quarter. While the administration has proposed eliminating the debt ceiling, this could face resistance from fiscal conservatives in Congress. Despite these macroeconomic uncertainty, one sector that is experiencing steady growth is stablecoins, according to a recent report. Much of the volume is driven by flows in USDT and USDC. Stablecoins started as an experiment – a programmable digital currency that would make it easier for users to enter the crypto market and trade different digital assets. A decade later, they are a critical part of the wider digital financial infrastructure. At present, the stablecoin market cap stands at a record $226 billion and continues to expand. Demand in emerging markets drives this growth. According to a recent Ark Invest report, Dollar-pegged stablecoins are dominating the market. They account for over 98% of the stablecoin supply, with Gold and Euro-backed stablecoins only sharing a small portion of the market. In addition to this, Tether’s USDT accounts for over 60% of the total market. ARK’s research suggests that the market will expand and include Asian currency-backed stablecoins. Besides that, digital assets are going through a shift marked by “stablecoinization” and “dollarization.” Asian nations like China and Japan have offloaded record amounts of US Treasuries. Saudi Arabia has ended its 45-year petrodollar agreement, and BRICS nations are increasingly bypassing the SWIFT network to reduce reliance on the US dollar. Traditionally, Bitcoin and Ether served as the primary entry points into the digital asset ecosystem. However, over the past two years, stablecoins have taken the lead, now representing 35% to 50% of on-chain transaction volumes. Despite global regulatory headwinds, emerging markets have been adopting stablecoins. In Brazil, 90% of crypto transactions are done via stablecoins, primarily used for international purchases. A Visa report ranks Nigeria, India, Indonesia, Turkey, and Brazil as the most active stablecoin markets, and Argentina ranks second in stablecoin holdings. Additionally, 6 out of every 10 purchases in the country were made using stablecoins pegged to the dollar, with near parity between USDC and USDT. This shift towards stablecoins in Argentina is driven by high inflation and the need to protect against the devaluation of the Argentine Peso. Clearly, in countries with unstable currencies, people turn to stablecoins such as USDT to safeguard their wealth. In addition to making cross-border transactions easier, this adoption offers a hedge against local currency volatility. This signals a serious challenge to outdated financial systems. Analysts predict that the 2025 stablecoin boom will push market capitalization to $400 billion or more. Projections suggest that stablecoins could reach a market cap of $3 trillion over the next five years. Most importantly, financial institutions are joining this trend. Stripe recently completed a $1 billion acquisition of Bridge, a startup that builds stablecoin infrastructure. Traditional banks such as BBVA plan to launch their own stablecoins by the end of 2025. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller described stablecoins as an important innovation. He stated that digital currencies can cut reliance on payment intermediaries, lower global costs, and improve efficiency. Last year, commerce nominee Howard Lutnick said stablecoins help support the dollar. Major Wall Street players like Bank of America, BlackRock, BNY Mellon, CBOE, Charles Schwab, and Citi are investing in the sector. Their participation signals that stablecoins are set to transform global payments. The trend is clear: stablecoins are no longer a crypto experiment — they are becoming a core part of financial infrastructure in emerging markets to move money globally. As adoption accelerates, the question is not if stablecoins will transform payments but how quickly they will stand alongside — or even replace — outdated financial systems.

Title: The Routledge Companion to 21st-century Irish Writing: academics deliver hefty report from the coalface on the state of our culture

Time Published: 2025-03-22T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
The problem with a great deal of academic writing comes down to one word: hedging. I don’t know why the mark of intellection should have become the refusal boldly to advance a claim. The following is a parody, but it gets at what I mean: “Certain discourses of embodiedness can, even if we take into account the various persuasive critiques of the very word ‘embodiedness’ advanced by Theorist, Thinker and Frenchman, be understood as suggesting the possible formulation of spaces in which the body might be thought anew.” Possible. Might. Take into account. The eyes of the non-academic reader glaze over. Why not just say what you think? I don’t mean to mock. I’m an academic myself. I’ve had my own tussles with Theorist, Thinker and Frenchman. But it seems to me that we are now at a point in history when academic critics of culture need to start saying what they mean as clearly as they can. Social media hourly pours its effluent into the river of truth. Most of our rulers no longer bother to pretend they’re not lying. “The zone,” in Steve Bannon’s sinister formulation, is being “flooded” – flooded, that is, with bulls**t intended to distract. Academics, particularly liberal and left-wing academics, can no longer afford to hedge. They need to stop talking to each other and start talking to the world – if it will listen. These thoughts are provoked, somewhat indirectly, by a reading of The Routledge Companion to 21st-century Irish Writing, a huge, various and stimulating anthology of academic essays on contemporary Irish culture assembled by Anne Fogarty (who teaches at UCD) and Eugene O’Brien (who teaches at Mary Immaculate College, Limerick). Editing such a book is a heroic endeavour. There are 35 essays here, each one fearsomely accoutred with endnotes, references, in-line citations. (A parenthetical suggestion to academics: if you want to hedge, hedge in the endnotes. That’s what they’re for.) Getting that many academics to pull together is, proverbially, like herding cats. But Fogarty and O’Brien are expert cat-herders. They have produced an important book. It is not, alas, priced for civilian readers: £215 for the hardback. Academic publishing is badly in need of reform. But that’s another story. The Routledge Companion is important because what has characterised 21st-century Ireland is change and because we need all the help we can muster if we want to think about this change and what it means. I was born in 1981, which means I have lived through radical social transformations that show no sign of stopping: the end of Catholic theocracy, the erosion of Civil War politics, the neoliberalisation of the economy, the growth of the middle class, the ambiguous aftermath of the Troubles, net immigration, housing crisis, climate change, racial diversity, the first ugly shoots of a far-right politics. To live in 21st-century Ireland is to live in uncertainty. What country, friends, is this? Then again, it is hard to think about the present. In their introduction, Fogarty and O’Brien observe that “to read the contemporary is a vexed matter and not as smooth as presupposed”. Well, quite. Kierkegaard is often quoted to the effect that life must be lived forwards, but can only be understood backwards, though he didn’t quite say this. What he did say was that, time-bound as we are, there can be no static point from which to understand your life at all. (Tough break.) [ The 100 best Irish books of the 21st century: how we made the list and what it says about the state of Irish fictionOpens in new window ] The editors know that this applies to history and culture too. Their response is to construe the present as a historical moment like any other – as knowable as the past, and (crucially) as unknowable. “The present may seem to be the area of cultural production that we should know best,” they write, “but, in fact, it is one that faces us with as many questions, problems and conundrums as the study of any other historical eras.” To study the contemporary, they note, is to experience a “sense of estrangement”. But such a sense of estrangement is enormously useful. The estranged mind – that is, the critic’s mind – is like the cow in the Gary Larson Far Side cartoon who looks up suddenly and says, “Hey, wait a minute! This is grass! We’ve been eating grass!” We need that cow. Otherwise, we’re just chewing the cud. So, what kind of grass have we been eating? Note carefully the title: not “21st-century Irish Literature” but “21st-century Irish Writing”. There are four big sections. The first looks at prose, and includes, among other pieces, Liam Lanigan’s essay Counterfactual Geographies on Paul Murray’s The Mark and the Void (2015); Eamon Maher on Representations of Catholicism in Contemporary Irish Fiction; María Amor Barros-del Rio on The Ethics of Care in Sally Rooney’s Novels; and Anne Fogarty on Animals in Short Stories by Contemporary Irish Women Writers. Part Two looks at poetry – it’s called A Poetics of the Unfinished and the Transformative, suggesting two perspectives through which not just contemporary Irish poetry, but contemporary Ireland itself, can be understood. This section includes an illuminating and passionate survey of contemporary Irish queer poetry by Kit Fryatt, and an essay by the always-interesting Eoin Flannery on Contemporary Irish Ecopoetics, which stresses the ethical subversions made possible by an ecopoetic approach. The third section looks at theatre and it reminds us that the stage is generally where we go, in Ireland, when we want to think about class (otherwise our great unspoken subject). There are long reflections on the work of THISISPOPBABY (by Martin Kenny and Miriam Haughton), on ethnotheatre in Northern Ireland (by Lisa Fitzpatrick), and on post-2008 working-class theatre (this is a contribution from an early-career scholar, Clara Mallon, who is to be commended: we need more, we always need more, honest and perceptive writing about class in Ireland). Part four is New Voices, New Forms, New Modes of Material Production. It includes Irish Fantasy Fiction in the 21st-century by that one-man crusade for Irish genre studies, Jack Fennell; Molly Slavin on Global Irish Crime Fiction in the 21st-century; and Claire Lynch on The Personal Essay and life-writing more broadly. The final section also moves beyond the textual to look at how and where texts are published (this is a big trend right now, in literary studies). Thus, a pair of essays on literary journals: Elke D’hoker on The Stinging Fly and its preferred modes of short fiction, and Liam Harrison on the journal scene as such. The last piece in the book is Languages and Publishing in Contemporary Irish Writing by Tim Groenland and Margaret Kelleher, which thinks carefully about the conditions at present influencing translation, publishing initiatives and arts funding in Ireland. To say it’s a mixed bag is to miss the point: it’s supposed to be a mixed bag. The editors are clear about this. What they sought to assemble, they say, was a collection of “critical readings at the coalface of 21st-century writing that reflect on, theorise and tease out current cultural momentums, energies and blockages”. The book was “conceived of as initial soundings in our current moment rather than a sweeping or definitive set of overviews”. One of criticism’s jobs is to do aesthetic triage on the busy waiting room of contemporary art – to attempt to distinguish, in other words, the good from the bad, and the good from the great. The Routledge Companion doesn’t really do this. What I mean is it lets in a lot of bad art and leaves out a lot of good. Its contributors now and then expend their intellects on works that really aren’t worth it. But this is to be expected from a book that is essentially an interim report – a collective dispatch from, as the editors say, “the coalface”. (Putting it this way makes art and culture sound like not much fun, actually. But we’ve all done our bit at the fringe plays and the poetry readings. We get it.) The great value of such a book, produced by diverse hands, is that it allows you to gain precisely what none of its individual contributors pretend to offer: a synoptic, or near-synoptic, overview of Ireland in the 21st century. What’s the “TL;DR”? Catholicism: creeping in again through the back door. (They haven’t gone away, you know.) We need to fund more translators. The exciting emergence of non-white Irish artists. There is a general and rather bewildered sense of destabilisation, of shifting ground. Several contributors cite Zygmunt Bauman’s notion of “liquid modernity”: the idea that a computer-based, financialised global economy has severed us from the old “heavy” ties of community; now we float free, and lost. We are living through a time of (as the title of one essay has it) “epochal change”. Interestingly, the editors note that “older paradigms and theoretical lenses like postcolonialism seem no longer to have purchase”. They mean in universities, but the insight holds good more generally. It must be 10 years or more since I last heard anyone blame our colonial past for some quirk of the Irish psyche. Are we post-postcolonial, at last? Huge, if true. Ah, but what about that other empire, now messily expiring on the other side of the Atlantic? A reckoning with Ireland in the age of US cultural hegemony is conspicuously absent from this book. But it might be too soon to expect any such thing. Also strangely missing from the volume as a whole: the internet. What it’s done to us. What we’ve done with it. Even so, the assembled essays bear out the truth of the editors’ opening assertion: that “Irish writing in the 21st century appears significantly different from that of the 20th century” and “there are distinct areas where these differences can be pinpointed and explored”. A tiny bit of hedging: that “appears”. But we’ll let that slide. Ireland in the 21st century is different. So is its art. Once we were certain, of certain things, at least. Now we are uncertain about almost everything. Art is the great stable vessel in which we can hold that uncertainty for long uncertain moments. Here is a book to help us think about our art, and ourselves, now that we most urgently need to.

Title: BlackRock, NYSE push for staked ETH ETFs – Why it matters

BlackRock and NYSE Arca are advocating for staking-enabled ETH ETFs to enhance investor returns. Regulatory approval remains key. The demand for Ethereum[ETH] staking is rising, fueled by growing institutional interest and regulatory advancements. BlackRock has voiced its support for staked ETH ETFs, emphasizing their potential to enhance returns for investors. Simultaneously, NYSE Arca has submitted a proposal to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow staking for Bitwise’s Ethereum ETF. With Ethereum staking trends shifting, the landscape of ETH investment products is evolving rapidly. BlackRock’s Digital Assets Head, Robbie Mitchnick, recently stated that while the firm’s ETH ETF is a success, it remains “less perfect” without staking capabilities. He highlighted that staking provides additional yield and aligns with Ethereum’s proof-of-stake model. Mitchnick believes that unlocking staking in ETFs could be a game-changer, attracting a broader investor base. However, he also acknowledged the challenges of implementing staking within the ETF structure due to regulatory constraints and operational complexities. NYSE Arca has taken a step forward by filing a request with the SEC to incorporate staking into the Bitwise Ethereum ETF. If approved, this would significantly shift how ETH ETFs function, allowing them to generate staking rewards and potentially enhance investor returns. The SEC’s decision will be closely watched, as it could influence how other crypto-based ETFs are structured in the future. Recent data highlights significant shifts in ETH staking dynamics. According to data from Dune Analytics, Kraken and Blockdaemon have led the growth in staking deposits over the past month, while Coinbase has experienced the most substantial outflows. Source: DuneAnalytics This divergence reflects shifting preferences among institutional and retail investors regarding custodial staking solutions. Meanwhile, platforms like Lido, stakefish, and Upbit have maintained steady inflows, reinforcing their dominance in the staking ecosystem. The second chart provides deeper insights into Ethereum staking flows. Over the past few months, staking deposits have outpaced withdrawals, leading to a net positive flow. Source: DuneAnalytics The black line representing the two-week net flow showcases an upward trend, indicating growing confidence in Ethereum’s staking ecosystem. Notably, principal withdrawals (shown in red) have decreased, suggesting that fewer investors are opting to unstake their ETH despite market fluctuations. This trend signals that long-term holders and institutions are embracing Ethereum staking as a sustainable investment strategy. The growing emphasis on staking carries significant implications for ETH ETFs and their investors. If approved, staking within ETFs could introduce an additional revenue stream through staking rewards, making ETH ETFs more appealing than traditional spot ETFs. Institutional investors may favor staked ETH ETFs, as they provide both price exposure and passive income through staking yields. However, regulatory uncertainty remains a major obstacle, with the SEC historically cautious about crypto-related products, particularly those involving staking. A favorable decision on NYSE Arca’s proposal could set a precedent, paving the way for more advanced Ethereum-based investment products.

(Bloomberg) -- A pro-Beijing newspaper has called on CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. to pull out from an agreement to sell its ports on the Panama Canal to a group led by BlackRock Inc., marking an escalation of a pressure campaign on billionaire Li Ka-shing over the deal. The transaction will damage China’s national security and development interests, which directly violates Hong Kong’s laws on safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests, the Ta Kung Pao paper said in a commentary Friday. The article didn’t identify CK Hutchison as the Hong Kong company in question but did name BlackRock as the buyer. CK Hutchison is expected to sign an agreement on the sale of its two Panama ports by April 2. It’s the key part of a wider deal to offload 43 facilities outside of Hong Kong and mainland China for more than $19 billion in cash proceeds. US President Donald Trump has hailed the sale as winning back control of the waterway from Chinese influence. “Stop the transaction and do not make the wrong calculation,” the paper said in the article. “Those who repeatedly emphasize that this deal is a ‘legal transaction’ under the freedom of contract are too naive and confused.” The paper has blasted CK Hutchison for “spineless groveling” to Trump and “selling out all Chinese people” in previous commentaries, which were reposted by China’s top office on Hong Kong affairs, signaling the criticism reflects the government’s view. Following the move, several prominent politicians, including the city’s leader John Lee, have also weighed in with veiled criticism. The latest article hasn’t been reposted by any Chinese agencies yet. The growing calls on Li to reconsider the port sale highlight the political risks for companies based in Greater China amid rising trade tensions between the world’s two most powerful economies. So far, Chinese officials haven’t explicitly given the 96-year-old Li and his firm any demands or instructions. But if Beijing does decide to take a tougher approach, it could raise concerns that sweeping national security laws imposed on Hong Kong since 2020 might ensnare businesses’ assets and operations. While CK Hutchison is based in Hong Kong, it has limited exposure to both the US and China. The conglomerate is registered in the Cayman Islands and accrues only 12% of its revenue from Hong Kong and the mainland, while Europe, Canada and Australia make up the bulk of the rest. CK Hutchison slumped as much as 4.4% in Hong Kong on Friday after the company reported weaker-than-expected profit and warned in its earnings statement of a deteriorating global business environment due to geopolitical and trade tensions. The Panama Canal is “of great significance to China’s national interests,” Ta Kung Pao said in its latest commentary. As the second largest user of the waterway, China’s foreign trade stability and logistics costs are directly affected by its operation, it said. The sale of the two Panama ports may lead to an increase in the logistics costs of Chinese companies and threaten the long-term development of China’s manufacturing industry and foreign trade, it said. The transaction is a “concrete manifestation” of US attempts to put pressure on China’s supply chain by controlling key ports, it added. “It is not an exaggeration to say that the transaction will cause endless troubles to China’s economy and national interests after it is completed,” the paper said. Several Chinese state agencies have started looking into the deal for any potential national security or antitrust violations, Bloomberg reported earlier this week.

(Michael Siluk/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) Fred Lucas / @FredLucasWH Fred Lucas is chief news correspondent and manager of the Investigative Reporting Project for The Daily Signal. He is the author of “The Myth of Voter Suppression: The Left’s Assault on Clean Elections.” Send an email to Fred. Oklahoma lawmakers advanced legislation that could gut a three-year-old anti-ESG law and leave state taxpayers vulnerable to environmental, social, and governance-based investing, critics contend. The Oklahoma Senate Energy Committee recently advanced SB 714, sponsored by state Sen. Dave Rader, which amends the existing law on state contracts and transfers enforcement authority from the state treasurer to the state attorney general. A House version is sponsored by Speaker Pro Temp Anthony Moore. Both lawmakers are Republicans. “It’s in a lawsuit now and we just want to make some corrections so it’s not in a lawsuit,” Rader told The Daily Signal in a phone interview. “We are being proactive to keep the bill applicable.” The 2022 Energy Discrimination Elimination Act bans state investments with companies that boycott or penalize energy companies for lawful action. Oil and gas companies are key to the Oklahoma economy. In July, Oklahoma District Court Judge Sheila Stinson issued an order to permanently block the law, stemming from a legal challenge by a state pensioner. The case is pending an appeal in the state Supreme Court. Rader argued enforcement of the anti-ESG law should have been with the attorney general in the first place. Under the 2022 law, the Oklahoma state treasurer, currently Todd Russ, keeps a list of financial institutions that boycott oil and gas companies and creates a schedule for state governmental entities to divest from the companies that include BlackRock, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America. BlackRock has been among the largest boosters of ESG pressure on companies. The state Senate bill would transfer enforcement authority to the state attorney general, currently Gentner Drummond. Drummond is handling the appeal. It would also change disclosure and judicial provisions for state governmental entities. Rader was not familiar with this during the call, but he said state agencies have been reluctant to enforce because of the litigation. “Some state agencies are hesitant to do anything with the law because they only want to maximize the investment, and they worry about the legal ambiguity,” Rader said. “That’s why we want the attorney general. It’s not really a treasury matter.” Russ, the state treasurer, opposes the legislation. It would allow “financial firms could continue discriminatory practices under weakened enforcement,” the treasurer’s spokesperson Lara Blubaugh said. “The result could delay accountability, the attorney general’s office lacks the expertise and immediate oversight needed to track and respond to financial discrimination effectively,” Blubaugh continued. “The office has a structured, consistent process for managing state funds, investments, and financial relationships; moving oversight to the attorney general’s office adds uncertainty along with a century’s long-tested constitutional process.” Past comment by Drumond suggests a faceoff between the two GOP officials. In a December statement, after making the appeal to the state’s high court, Drummond faulted the state treasurer’s office for losing in a lower court. “There is a great deal of lost ground to make up on this litigation after the treasurer and his hand-picked legal counsel failed in district court,” said Drummond. “I will not let that failure deter my efforts to protect Oklahoma’s oil and gas industry from discriminatory practices by financial entities kowtowing to a radical environmental agenda.” This story was revised and updated after publication.

The total is spread across 79 DeFi platforms, with the top three RWA protocols accounting for 36% of that total-value locked, according to DeFiLlama. The top three RWA protocols—Maker RWA, BlackRock BUIDL and Ethena USDtb—hold $1.298 billion, $1.232 billion and $1.182 billion in TVL, respectively. Analysts are forecasting an explosion in the real-world asset market as investors flock to tokenized RWA products. Global investment firm VanEck has predicted RWAs will surpass $50 billion in market capitalization by the end of 2025. Total-value locked is a commonly used metric for user demand in DeFi that measures the value of assets deposited on a particular decentralized platform. Real-world asset tokenization refers to the process of creating digital representations of tangible assets, including T-bills, real estate, and gold, on blockchains. Maker's RWA is backed by real estate and digitized traditional RWAs such as treasury bonds, while USDtb is backed by tokenized BlackRock money-market fund shares. BUIDL is a tokenized money market fund built on the Ethereum network. Tokenizing RWAs has gained traction as investors turn to investment vehicles based on treasury bonds, stablecoins and various commodities to hedge against crypto market volatility and diversify their portfolios. Launched early last year, BlackRock’s BUIDL holds $373 million in assets, while other tokenized treasury-backed funds such as Franklin Templeton's BENJI and Ondo Finance's OUSG are also attracting investor dollars. Meanwhile, interest in stablecoin-backed tokenized funds is picking up, with Ethena USDtb's TVL increasing 1,000% over the past month, according to DeFiLlama.

Title: China likely could disable Panama Canal, but not the way you might think

By Virginia Allen, The Daily Signal March 21, 2025 PANAMA CITY, Panama—If China wanted to disable the Panama Canal to stop the flow of military or cargo ships through it, it likely could do so through an attack on the software system, military veteran and “Hot Zone” podcaster Chuck Holton says. Using a Chinese ship to physically block the canal could cause a temporary disruption, but a cyberattack would likely create a much more serious issue, according to Holton, a former U.S. Army Ranger-turned-war correspondent. If China were to “scrambled the software that is used to open and close the locks, or something like that, now you’ve got a bigger problem,” Holton said, adding that it is “very likely” China already has the ability to “scramble” the technology used to operate the Panama Canal. The “software that runs the canal, very likely, is also infected with Chinese hackers,” he said, and if China “wanted to damage or shut down the canal, they could probably do it from Beijing with a few keystrokes. They don’t have to have Chinese troops at the port and they don’t. They don’t need them.” Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! Holton, who serves as a foreign correspondent for Newsmax, lives in Panama and was part of the U.S. military invasion of Panama in 1989 to oust the nation’s corrupt dictator, Manuel Noriega. Standing in the square of Casco Viejo, Panama City’s historic district, Holton told The Daily Signal that China is actively working to gain influence in Panama, but “China is not running the canal.” During his inauguration speech on Jan. 20, President Donald Trump said, “China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.” But Panama President José Raúl Mulino denies China is operating the canal. Trump’s comments on the canal, coupled with a recent large canal port deal between an American-based company and a Hong Kong-based company, have called attention to China’s influence in the region. The Chinese government has been critical of a deal for a Hong Kong conglomerate, CK Hutchison, to sell ports in the Panama Canal to BlackRock, an American global asset manager. Trump has praised the deal, but CK Hutchison says the agreed-upon deal is “purely commercial” and has nothing to do with Trump’s recent comments on the canal. About 10,000 people work at the canal, the majority of whom, according to Holton, are Panamanian. The U.S. built the Panama Canal and operated it for decades, but in 1977, President Jimmy Carter signed a treaty with Panama to begin the gradual transfer of the canal to Panama, with the complete transfer by the end of 1999. The canal connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and operates through a lock system, raising ships above sea level to connect to the Gatun Lake before lowering them back to sea level. On average, 36 to 38 ships pass through the canal each day, according to The Associated Press. About 70% of the ships passing through the canal are coming from or headed for the U.S., though the shipping companies themselves may not be American. U.S. military ships do use the canal, and in the event of a conflict with China, anything China “could do that would complicate the U.S. Navy’s ability to move troops and products … into or out of the war zone, obviously, that’s a strategic issue for the United States,” Holton said. For years, Holton explained, China has been growing its power in Panama through economic and political ties. Panama joined the Belt and Road Initiative, a Chinese-led investment and infrastructure project, in 2017, but announced in February that it would not renew its participation in the Chinese project. China’s presence in Panama is not new, though political and economic ties are more recent. The first groups of Chinese arrived in Panama in the 1850s to help build the trans-Panama railroad. China’s influence is noticeable in the Latin nation through the presence of Chinese cultural centers, architecture, and Chinese-owned businesses. Holton says Panamanians know the nation has “a problem with Chinese influence, and it’s more with our government, it’s more with our economic system,” but, he added, the same cannot be said of the canal. Right now, the relationship between the U.S. and Panama is “confusing,” he said, because “Panama is an ally of the United States. Panamanians love Americans. They’ll say all the time that America’s our big brother … and so they’re a little befuddled by the president’s comments that seem very antithetical to, or negative toward, Panama.” The U.S. has a “long history of being a blessing to Panama,” Holton said, adding, “I don’t see why we need to change that now. That should be, the question is: How can we come and have a win-win situation with Panama and the United States? And there certainly is a path forward for that.” [Editor’s note: This story originally was published by The Daily Signal.] You must be logged in to post a comment.

Title: Make-or-break feel to game between Lansdowne and Terenure

Time Published: 2025-03-21T19:03:14Z
Full Content:
The Energia All-Ireland League enters the homeward straight with the last three rounds of the regular season over the next three weekends, and nowhere is there more of a make-or-break feel to the day’s action than on the Aviva Stadium back pitch. Fifth-placed Lansdowne, Division 1A’s form team, host third place Terenure, who go into the game on 48 points, just above Cork Con on points difference and just two points ahead of their hosts. Lansdowne have won five of their last six games to close in on the top four and the playoffs, their only defeat being in that sequence being a 49-46 loss away to Clontarf when beaten with the last kick of the game. Interestingly, the former Cork Con back three player Rob Hedderman, who scored a try in last season’s final against Terenure, is named for a rare start on the wing. Terenure, themselves beaten with the game’s final kick by Clontarf last time out three weeks ago, have been hit by Leinster dipping into their squad for their trek to South Africa, with outhalf Caspar Gabriel, scrumhalf Fintan Gunne and fullback Henry McIrlean all on duty with their province. Conor McKeon, the former Connacht scrumhalf, starts at outhalf, with Aran Egan remaining at fullback and Alan Bennie at scrumhalf. Lansdowne, perhaps benefiting from not having any players in the Ireland Club side for their win in Portugal, are also seeking revenge for the 28-22 defeat in Lakelands in round three, and quite simply whoever wins this reprise of last season’s semi-final will find themselves in the top four, whereas whoever loses will be outside the playoff picture entering the final two rounds. Young Munster are technically the only team with seemingly nothing tangible to play for in the top flight, yet they have picked a notably strong looking side for the visit of Cork Con. Evan O’Connell, scrumhalf Jake O’Riordan, centre Shay McCarthy and fullback Patrick Campbell have all been released by Munster for this game, and the former Ireland Under-20 and current Munster academy winger Fionn Gibbons is named on the bench for what will be his first game of the season since rupturing his ACL last summer. The champions have seen an eight-game undefeated run come to a halt with successive defeats but retain a settled side featuring a strong midfield of Niall Kenneally and Seán French. After their fifth last-ditch win of the season, leaders Clontarf are now eyeing up a home semi-final and will be strongly fancied to take another stride toward that objective at home to a understrength UCD side who have also been hit by Leinster’s trek to South Africa. Already without key backrower Ronan Waters, St Mary’s have also lost Ethan Baxter after he was injured on Ireland Club duty, so ex-Munster centre Dan Goggin starts at number eight at home to a strong looking Ballynahinch. City of Armagh should take a step towards preserving their 1A status at home to Garryowen, for whom a 15th successive defeat will confirm their relegation. Energia Men’s All-Ireland League (2.30pm unless stated) Division 1A: City of Armagh v Garryowen, Palace Grounds; Clontarf v UCD, Castle Avenue; Lansdowne v Terenure College, Aviva back pitch; St Mary’s College v Ballynahinch, Templeville Road; Young Munster v Cork Constitution, Tom Clifford Park.

Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/applovin-corporation-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=137442&wire=3 APP investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in AppLovin during the relevant time frame, you have until May 5, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.

Send an email to Virginia. PANAMA CITY, Panama—If China wanted to disable the Panama Canal to stop the flow of military or cargo ships through it, it likely could do so through an attack on the software system, military veteran and “Hot Zone” podcaster Chuck Holton says. Using a Chinese ship to physically block the canal could cause a temporary disruption, but a cyberattack would likely create a much more serious issue, according to Holton, a former U.S. Army Ranger-turned-war correspondent. If China were to “scrambled the software that is used to open and close the locks, or something like that, now you’ve got a bigger problem,” Holton said, adding that it is “very likely” China already has the ability to “scramble” the technology used to operate the Panama Canal. The “software that runs the canal, very likely, is also infected with Chinese hackers,” he said, and if China “wanted to damage or shut down the canal, they could probably do it from Beijing with a few keystrokes. They don’t have to have Chinese troops at the port and they don’t. They don’t need them.” Holton, who serves as a foreign correspondent for Newsmax, lives in Panama and was part of the U.S. military invasion of Panama in 1989 to oust the nation’s corrupt dictator, Manuel Noriega. Standing in the square of Casco Viejo, Panama City’s historic district, Holton told The Daily Signal that China is actively working to gain influence in Panama, but “China is not running the canal.” During his inauguration speech on Jan. 20, President Donald Trump said, “China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.” But Panama President José Raúl Mulino denies China is operating the canal. Trump’s comments on the canal, coupled with a recent large canal port deal between an American-based company and a Hong Kong-based company, have called attention to China’s influence in the region. The Chinese government has been critical of a deal for a Hong Kong conglomerate, CK Hutchison, to sell ports in the Panama Canal to BlackRock, an American global asset manager. Trump has praised the deal, but CK Hutchison says the agreed-upon deal is “purely commercial” and has nothing to do with Trump’s recent comments on the canal. About 10,000 people work at the canal, the majority of whom, according to Holton, are Panamanian. The U.S. built the Panama Canal and operated it for decades, but in 1977, President Jimmy Carter signed a treaty with Panama to begin the gradual transfer of the canal to Panama, with the complete transfer by the end of 1999. The canal connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and operates through a lock system, raising ships above sea level to connect to the Gatun Lake before lowering them back to sea level. On average, 36 to 38 ships pass through the canal each day, according to The Associated Press. About 70% of the ships passing through the canal are coming from or headed for the U.S., though the shipping companies themselves may not be American. U.S. military ships do use the canal, and in the event of a conflict with China, anything China “could do that would complicate the U.S. Navy’s ability to move troops and products … into or out of the war zone, obviously, that’s a strategic issue for the United States,” Holton said. For years, Holton explained, China has been growing its power in Panama through economic and political ties. Panama joined the Belt and Road Initiative, a Chinese-led investment and infrastructure project, in 2017, but announced in February that it would not renew its participation in the Chinese project. China’s presence in Panama is not new, though political and economic ties are more recent. The first groups of Chinese arrived in Panama in the 1850s to help build the trans-Panama railroad. China’s influence is noticeable in the Latin nation through the presence of Chinese cultural centers, architecture, and Chinese-owned businesses. Holton says Panamanians know the nation has “a problem with Chinese influence, and it’s more with our government, it’s more with our economic system,” but, he added, the same cannot be said of the canal. Right now, the relationship between the U.S. and Panama is “confusing,” he said, because “Panama is an ally of the United States. Panamanians love Americans. They’ll say all the time that America’s our big brother … and so they’re a little befuddled by the president’s comments that seem very antithetical to, or negative toward, Panama.” The U.S. has a “long history of being a blessing to Panama,” Holton said, adding, “I don’t see why we need to change that now. That should be, the question is: How can we come and have a win-win situation with Panama and the United States? And there certainly is a path forward for that.” Dive into the brilliant mind of Victor Davis Hanson, renowned classicist, historian, and Senior Contributor at The Daily Signal.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says he was wrong about quantum computing. But he might be right

Time Published: 2025-03-21T15:45:00Z
Full Content:
Nvidia (NVDA+3.33%) chief executive Jensen Huang apologized for tanking quantum computing stocks earlier this year when he said the technology’s usefulness is still decades away — but one analyst says he’s actually right. During a Quantum Day session at the company’s annual GTC developer conference, Huang said he didn’t know there were publicly traded quantum computing companies when he made comments in January that led the stocks to fall by more than 40%. “My first reaction was, I didn’t know they were public,” Huang said in remarks reported by Bloomberg. “How can a quantum company be public?” Huang said the event, which included executives from several quantum firms as well as Amazon (AMZN+3.53%) and Microsoft (MSFT+0.31%), was the first “in history where a company CEO invites all of the guests to explain why he was wrong,” according to CNBC. He added that “quantum computing has the potential and all of our hopes that it will deliver extraordinary impact,” but that “the technology is insanely complicated.” Despite the damage control, Huang “was right and all he did in January was point out the obvious fact that quantum computing is very unlikely to be a major economic force for another 15 years at least,” Richard Windsor, founder of research firm Radio Free Mobile, said in a note on Friday. Windsor pointed out that quantum computing stocks continued to fall by double-digits even after Huang’s positive comments on Thursday. Although Huang and other quantum executives made a clear case for the need for quantum — more processing power for cheaper — Windsor said the technology still faces setbacks. “[Q]uantum computers are only suited to doing certain types of tasks and when they are asked to do something else, all of the benefits that they offer evaporate leaving behind only the drawbacks,” Windsor said, adding that despite some current uses for scientific research, it will take years before going mainstream. Windsor addressed another problem with scalability and reliability. “Getting more than a few Qubits on a single chip, keeping the error rate down and making sure that the system is reliable remain huge issues and the industry is far from agreement on how these should be solved,” Windsor said. Google (GOOGL+2.20%), Microsoft, and Amazon have all recently unveiled quantum computing chip prototypes that they claim can solve challenges with qubits — or quantum bits used by quantum computers. Qubits are usually electrons, photons, or another subatomic particle that when connected together have far more processing power than binary 0s and 1s used by classical computers. But the different approaches are indicative of “how far the system has to go,” Windsor said, because there needs to be agreement before being able to reach economies of scale. “This does not mean that quantum is no good or that it won’t take over from silicon eventually,” Windsor said, “but it does mean that it is going to take much longer than anyone thinks.” Meanwhile, Windsor said, “the real problem” is that the publicly listed quantum companies “have absolutely no business being so.” These companies, Windsor said, will have “either gone bust or been purchased by larger companies like Google, Amazon or Microsoft” in the coming years. Nvidia’s quantum event and its investment in a Boston-based quantum research center are good signs for a company with a “history of being ridiculously early when it comes to technology,” Windsor said. But the company is “right” to focus its business more on AI than on quantum for now. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Amid Trump Tariffs, Where Do China-Mexico Ties Stand?

Full Content:
Read The Diplomat, Know The Asia-Pacific Mexico’s government is attempting to downplay its relationship with China to avoid Trump’s ire, but ties continue beneath the surface. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum (left) meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of theG-20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Nov. 18, 2024. In the beginning of March 2025, I traveled to Mexico to speak with a range of officials and experts about activities by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and its companies in the country, among other topics. In the midst of U.S. attention to China’s activities in Mexico and across the region, and in the face of threatened U.S. tariffs against Mexican products, the Mexican government of Claudia Sheinbaum is reportedly attempting to restrain high-profile activities with China that it perceives could antagonize the Trump administration. Nonetheless, beyond a small number of completed or postponed projects with China – such as a BYD hybrid car plant and the Maya tourist train – that have received particular high-level U..S scrutiny, the China-Mexico relationship continues to grow and deepen. Political Relations President Sheinbaum’s caution toward China appears to be reciprocated by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). It’s been over three months since China’s outspoken former ambassador to Mexico, Zhang Run, departed for a post in the Foreign Ministry at the end of 2024, yet the Chinese government has not yet named a new ambassador. That’s particularly unusual in CCP engagement with a country as large and important as Mexico. Beyond the state-to-state relations, China’s engagement in Mexico also extends to the legislative branch and subnational governments. There is a China friendship committee and an Asia committee in the Mexican legislature headed by leftist Workers’ Party (PT) member Yeidckol Polevnsky. Senate President Geraldo Fernandez Noroña, also of the PT and considered more radical than Polevnsky, is a powerful advocate for strengthening Mexico’s relations with China and reportedly has a close relationship with China’s embassy. China also courts Mexico at the state and local level, both through regular business delegations to Mexican states, few of which bear fruit, as well as at least 15 Mexico-China “sister city” relationships. Military and Defense Ties In military affairs, the current and recent Mexican administrations have restricted engagement with China. This year, neither the Mexican Army War College (CODENAL) nor the Navy War College (CESNAV) are hosting People’s Liberation Army (PLA) cadets, although the army has done so previously. In 2024, CESNAV hosted a visit by a sizable contingent from the PLA Superior War College. Also, in September 2023, a delegation of 16 PLA members, as well as a military delegation from Russia, visited and marched in Mexico’s Independence Day parade. Although China has not sold Mexico substantial military equipment, it did participate in an ill-fated joint venture to assemble 6.5 ton First Auto Works (FAW) trucks in Mexico. A China-based company also reportedly sold the Mexican Army uniforms, with the Mexican partner company – which is tied to Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO) ally and former Interior Minister Adan Agosto Lopez – reportedly profiting from a 300 percent markup on the cost paid to the Chinese wholesalers. In addition, the Mexican Navy purchased three Chinese catamarans for $26.7 million for a tourist transit, which it operates from Mazatlán to the island of San Blas. Beyond arms sales and engagements, China has assigned a capable military attaché, Army Colonel Cui Yungmao, seeking to strengthen military engagement and pursue arms sales opportunities. Cui reportedly has excellent Spanish and is a regular visitor at Mexican Army and Navy military institutions. China-based military companies regularly have a substantial presence at the annual Mexican Air Force air show (FAMEX), which they reportedly use to court the Mexican military and the Mexican Space Agency (MSA). Beijing has long courted the MSA. The National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) has reportedly signed agreements with the Technical University of Beijing to bring students to China for graduate-level training on satellites and space sciences. On the other hand, the MSA’s plan to launch a satellite in China was reportedly switched to another provider and another site, possibly to avoid alarming the Trump administration. Chinese Private Security Companies (PSCs), represented in organizations such as the Mexico-Chinese Private Security Council, have sought work in the Mexican market, but have not to date established a substantial presence. Drones from the Chinese firm DJI and Chinese-made military equipment, including body armor used in confrontations against the Mexican military and other adversaries, are reportedly readily available for purchase by criminal organizations in Mexico on the black market. Chinese Investment in Mexico In commerce, driven by nearshoring, Chinese investment in Mexico in recent years has expanded to approximately $2 billion per year. The well-respected commercial consultancy Rhodium Group identified $13 billion in Chinese investment in Mexico in approximately 700 transactions between 2013 and 2023. In the digital space, Huawei has become a leading infrastructure provider, diversifying from telephone equipment to other services. Indeed, by 2024, Huawei had invested an estimated $1.3 billion in Mexican cloud computing infrastructure alone. The company, principally through Telmex, is also reportedly providing such services and infrastructure to the Mexican government, including the presidency, the Secretariat for Communication and Transportation (SCT), and a number of ministries. There are also rumors of a Huawei offer to provide technology and data services to the country’s national intelligence centers. In addition to Huawei, a range of Chinese companies are active in Mexico’s telephone sector, including Oppo, whose Mexico market share has reportedly expanded rapidly in recent years, as well as the China-based companies Honor, Xiaomi, and ZTE. The Chinese company Hikvision, operating in Mexico since 2016, including a research center in Queretaro, continues to be a dominant player in commercial and private security systems, including a number of initiatives to provide cameras for public security for towns around Mexico. Chinese computer and electronics manufacturer Lenovo has made Mexico its largest production and research and development (R&D) hub in Latin America, expanding its sales to the Mexican market by 25 percent in 2023 alone. Reportedly, Lenovo tries to keep out of the public spotlight. This year’s $22.8 billion acquisition by Blackrock of 80 percent of the properties of Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports will dramatically change the Chinese profile in the port sector. Hutchison had previously operated ports in Veracruz, Lazaro Cardenas, Manzanillo, Tijuana, and Ensenada. In the automotive sector, although plans for a factory by the electric car maker BYD remain on hold, Giant Motor Corporation, which represents First Auto Works (FAW) and the Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group Corp (JAC) production facility in Hidalgo, as well as Shanghai Automotive industrial Corporation (SAIC) and Beijing Automotive Industrial Corporation (BAIC), continue to have a substantial presence in the Mexican market. BAIC and Foton are major players in the market for buses. In construction, although the China Communication Construction Corporation (CCCC), in conjunction with the 30 percent CCCC-owned Mota Engil, have completed most of the track work for the Maya tourist train, there is a question of their continuing role. The Mexican Army continues to build train stations and other facilities to make the infrastructure functional. In a similar fashion, although China Railway has completed most of its improvements to Line 1 of the Mexico City Metro, it continues a presence on the line with a long-term maintenance contract. China-based companies have expressed interest in investing in warehousing, logistics, and other facilities in Mexico’s “Trans-Isthmus Corridor,” whose development is a priority for the Sheinbaum government. To date, no concrete projects have yet materialized. In the lithium sector, the Chinese company Ganfeng continues to own the Bacanora lithium field, but its ability to exploit it continues to be paralyzed, following former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s February 2023 initiative to nationalize Mexico’s lithium sector. Ganfeng is now in litigation over the issue. Stores specializing in Chinese merchandise have also expanded notably in Mexico’s retail sector, including not only informal shops in markets such as Tepito, but networks of brick-and-mortar stores such as China Market and Hogar China. These chains are expanding not only in Mexico City but around the country in cities such as Hidalgo, Puebla and Queretaro. Products from China exceeded 20 percent of all imports for the first time in 2024. There are concerns over whether such stores fully operate in conformity with Mexican tax and other laws. In July 2024, the Sheinbaum government symbolically raided and shut down China Mart, a three-story retail outlet for Chinese products in Plaza Izaga 89. China-Mexico commercial collaboration in general is reflected in its business councils. The China-Mexico Chamber (MexCham), under working President Victor Cadera, principally represents Mexican companies working in China, while the China Chamber of Commerce and Technology of Mexico, headed by Amipola Grijalva, is more focused on networking involving Chinese companies and their counterparts in Mexico. Academic and Media Engagement Mexican academic and intellectual engagement with China continues to expand. Mexico’s sixth Confucius Institute, providing Beijing-sanctioned instruction in Chinese language and culture, recently launched in the University of Guadalajara. The University of Veracruz in Jalapa opened a nongovernmental Center for China Studies, complementing others in Mexican public institutions, including in the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), the College of Mexico (one of the country’s oldest), the Autonomous University of Baja California in Tijuana, University of Guadalajara, and the Asia-Pacific (APEC) Studies Center in the University of Colima. China’s government reportedly provides 10-20 scholarships per year for Mexicans to study in China, in addition to countless scholarships for Mexican students coming directly from Chinese universities. China-based companies also provide sponsored training programs for Mexicans to study in China, such as Huawei’s “Seeds for the Future” program. Just within the context of its employment of Mexicans, Huawei may have brought as many as 100 Mexicans to its training center in Shenzhen in the past five years. As in other parts of the region, China also actively courts Mexican media outlets. The left-oriented journal Jornada regularly carries content from Xinhua. The more centrist Reforma reprints content from Chinese media. China’s recently departed ambassador, Zheng Run, was a featured regular columnist in Milenio. Indeed, Milenio reporter Alma Paola Wong, among others, received a sponsored trip to China, and other representatives of Milenio and other respected media outlets were brought to China by Huawei for a media technology demonstration. Conclusion Mexico’s relationship with China will continue to be shaped by the “strategic triangle” involving the Mexico-U.S. and China-U.S. relationships. Despite the caution exercised by the Sheinbaum administration, the multidimensional China-Mexico relationship continues to evolve through its own momentum. China, in practical terms, is not an “alternative” to the United States for Mexico, but for both good and bad, it will continue to be an important part of the dynamics shaping Mexico’s future. R.

On January 24, 2025, a complaint was filed against the Company and certain of its officers, alleging that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo’s projected successful outcome of Novo’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1,” while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (ii) Novo’s repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (iii) the utilization of the “flexible protocol” limited the study’s ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo sought to demonstrate. When investors learned the truth, Novo’s common stock declined precipitously, injuring investors.

Title: Quantum computing stocks try to recover. Nvidia's Jensen Huang is sorry for tanking them last time

Full Content:
Nvidia (NVDA+3.33%) chief executive Jensen Huang tried to do damage control after his doubts about quantum computing tanked the stocks — but they fell again anyway. Despite Huang’s apology during the AI chipmaker’s Quantum Day on Thursday, shares of D-Wave Quantum (QBTS+3.95%), Rigetti Computing (RGTI+6.50%), Quantum Computing (QUBT+17.52%), and IonQ (IONQ+17.41%) all fell — some by double-digit percentages. At the market open on Friday, shares of Quantum Computing were down by about 10%, while Rigetti and D-Wave were down by more than 4% and IonQ was up by less than 1%. Later in the morning, some of the stocks were back on the rise, with IonQ up by more than 5%, D-Wave and Quantum Computing down by less than 1%, and Rigetti down by less than 2%. At the event, which was held during Nvidia’s annual GTC developers conference, Huang said that he didn’t know there were publicly traded quantum computing companies when he made comments in January that led the stocks to fall by more than 40%. “My first reaction was, I didn’t know they were public,” Huang said, in remarks reported by Bloomberg. “How can a quantum company be public?” During Nvidia’s financial analyst day at the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this year, Huang said he thought “useful quantum computers” are still decades away. “If you said 15 years for very useful quantum computers, that would probably be on the early side,” Huang said. “If you said 30, it’s probably on the late side. But if you picked 20, I think a whole bunch of us would believe it.” Huang had added that he expects Nvidia will play “a significant part” in the development of quantum computers, and push it toward getting “there as fast as possible.” “This is the first event in history where a company CEO invites all of the guests to explain why he was wrong,” Huang said Thursday, according to CNBC. Huang added that he thinks “quantum computing has the potential and all of our hopes that it will deliver extraordinary impact,” but that “the technology is insanely complicated.” Meanwhile, Quantum Computing reported fourth-quarter earnings results after the market close on Thursday showing that total revenue fell to $62,000, from $75,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023. “The increase in gross margin is primarily attributed to lower costs of goods sold in the 2024 period,” the company said. At the same time, the company’s operating expenses grew to $8.9 million, from $6.6 million the previous year. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

WHY: A recently filed securities fraud class action complaint has now partially survived defendants’ attempts to dismiss that complaint. The underlying complaint alleges that Mercury Systems, through certain of its officers and directors, used acquisitions and improper revenue recognition practices to mask its inability to grow organically. The complaint further alleges that Defendants repeatedly misled investors to believe that their growth was organic by misrepresenting several elements of Mercury’s business, including by hiding that Mercury had switched from “point-in-time” to “long-term contracts” in order to improperly boost reported revenues and that several of Mercury’s projects were in significant distress, including projects related to Mercury’s acquisition of Physical Optics Corporation. Finally, the Complaint alleges Mercury also lied to investors about its strategic growth initiative, 1MPACT, which was designed to improve profit margins but unbeknownst to investors was used to disguise regular expenses as restructuring costs, enabling Mercury to claim that recurring expenses were one-time costs. On February 20, 2025, a Federal Court determined that certain key allegations in the plaintiff’s underlying securities fraud class action complaint were adequately pleaded to survive defendants attempts to dismiss the complaint.

Stocks fell at the open as the shares of Nike (NKE-0.87%), FedEx (FDX+5.92%) and Micron declined after the companies’ earnings disappointed investors. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both fell about 0.8% as of 9:45 a.m, with the Dow Jones Industrial average shedding 405.6 points, or almost 1%. The shares of some Chinese electric-vehicle makers are falling after Nio’s (NIO-2.33%) net loss unexpectedly widened. Nio stock declined 5.1%, paced by declines of 2.2% in Xpeng (XPEV-1.83%) and of 1.5% in Li Auto (LI-0.89%). Tesla (TSLA+10.93%) gained 2.4%. Here are some stocks to watch on Friday: Carnival’s (CCL+2.28%) stock plunged 5.8% after the company posted earnings. While the results topped expectations, Wall Street Journal (NWSA+1.02%) columnist Spencer Jakab wrote that cruise lines are in good shape — but investors have been nervous about travel demand since Delta Air Lines (DAL+4.06%)’ cut its outlook. FedEx stock plunged 11% after it cut its full-year revenue and profit forecasts due to economic softening and uncertainty in the U.S., as well as severe weather. Micron’s (MU+2.32%) shares fell 7.6% after the company said that margins will miss analysts estimates this quarter, Bloomberg reported. The memory-chip maker’s earnings, released after the close yesterday, exceeded expectations for fiscal second-quarter revenue and profit on AI-related demand. Nike’s stock tumbled 8.8% after the shoemaker reported a tough quarter as it sought to pivot back toward its athletic origins while navigating increased tariffs on China-made goods and a softening U.S. consumer market. Its sales projection for the current period was much worse than expected. Nio’s ADRs fell 5.1% after the Chinese EV-maker’s net loss unexpectedly widened. The shares plunged 8.9% yesterday ahead of the results, and fell 8.8% in Hong Kong on Friday. Nvidia’s (NVDA+3.33%) shares slid 2.1% as its AI conference wraps up on Friday. CEO Jensen Huang said the chipmaker is partnering with quantum computing firms including Quantinuum and QuEra Computing to build a Boston-based research center that will integrate quantum computing with AI supercomputers.

Why Evolution Is True Why Evolution is True is a blog written by Jerry Coyne, centered on evolution and biology but also dealing with diverse topics like politics, culture, and cats. Welcome to the end o’ the week: it’s Friday, March 21, 2025, and National French Bread Day. Here’s a well-known photo by one of my photography heroes, Henri Cartier-Bresson (you can buy the print at Amazon). The kid runs home with a necessary dinner item: It’s also National Crunchy Taco Day, International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, National California Strawberry Day, National Vermouth Day, World Poetry Day, International Day of Forests, National Flower Day, Red Nose Day in the UK, and International Tiramisu Day. For World Poetry Day, I give you “The Lake Isle of Innisfree,” by Yeats (note that it rhymes, almost an essential of good poetry): Readers are welcome to mark notable events, births, or deaths on this day by consulting the March 21 Wikipedia page. Da Nooz: *Heathrow Airport is near a gigantic fire that sprang up today causing a power outage, and the airport will be closed all day. Since Heathrow is a worldwide travel hub, flights all over the globe will be affected. 1300 flights have already been canceled today. Travelers braced for a day of chaos as Heathrow Airport in London was expected to remain shut all of Friday because of a power outage, grinding flights to a halt at one of the world’s busiest airports and disrupting travel across the globe. Officials at Heathrow said the airport would remain closed until 11:59 p.m. local time because of a fire nearby that caused a power outage overnight. Ed Miliband, Britain’s energy secretary, described the blaze to Sky News as a catastrophic fire that had also affected backup systems, complicating the response. Speaking to LBC radio on Friday morning, he said that “there’s no suggestion there is any foul play” having led to the fire, but that it would “take time to unwind the disruption for obvious reasons.” So far, he added, “we don’t yet have a real understanding of what caused the fire.” Around the world, people were starting to see their plans upended, and analysts said it could take several days for airlines to rebook passengers because of the large numbers.While Heathrow is the world’s fourth biggest airport in terms of total scheduled capacity, it is considered the top travel hub as the most connected airport in the world. Many travelers use it as a stepping stone to further destinations. “We expect significant disruption over the coming days and passengers should not travel to the airport under any circumstances until the airport reopens,” a Heathrow representative said in a statement. *Yesterday Trump signed an EO aimed at closing the Department of Education (NYT here and WaPo here). That’s because Republican perceive the Department as an epicenter of wokeness (don’t ask me; I just work here). From the NYT: President Trump on Thursday instructed Education Secretary Linda McMahon to begin shutting down her agency, a task that cannot be completed without congressional approval and sets the stage for a seismic political and legal battle over the federal government’s role in the nation’s schools. Surrounded by schoolchildren seated at desks in the East Room of the White House, Mr. Trump signed a long-awaited executive order that he said would begin dismantling the department “once and for all.” The Trump administration has cited poor test scores as a key justification for the move. “We’re going to shut it down, and shut it down as quickly as possible,” Mr. Trump said. The department, which manages federal loans for college, tracks student achievement and supports programs for students with disabilities, was created by an act of Congress. That means, according to Article I of the Constitution, that only Congress can shut it down. That clear delineation of power, a fundamental component of democracy from the inception of the United States, underscores why no other modern president has tried to unilaterally shutter a federal department. But Mr. Trump has already taken significant steps that have limited the agency’s operations and authority. Since Mr. Trump’s inauguration, his administration has slashed the department’s work force by more than half and eliminated $600 million in grants. The job cuts hit particularly hard at the department’s Office for Civil Rights, which enforces the country’s guarantee that all students have an equal opportunity to an education. That movement, which includes key pro-Trump, grass-roots activists, expanded around opposition to progressive agendas that promoted mandating certain education standards and inclusive policies for L.G.B.T.Q. students. Activists contended that these policies undermined parental rights and values. But the hyper-partisanship around education issues has been present for decades, from progressive-leaning teachers’ unions who organized against President George W. Bush’s “No Child Left Behind” policies to conservative Republican presidential candidates in 2016 who ran against the Common Core standards elevated by President Barack Obama’s “Race to the Top” program. Divisions within the agency that were particularly affected by the layoffs include the Federal Student Aid office, the Office for Civil Rights, and the office responsible for data collection and research, data obtained by The Post shows. Most of the lawyers at the Office of General Counsel were laid off. And just days after the president signed an order declaring English the nation’s official language, nearly The WaPo notes that what the Department did will not be completely eliminated: The Education Department administers federal grant programs, including the $18.4 billion Title I program that provides supplemental funding to high-poverty K-12 schools, as well as the $15.5 billion IDEA program that helps cover the cost of education for students with disabilities. And the department oversees the $1.6 trillion federal student loan program and sets rules for what colleges must do to participate. A senior administration official said Wednesday that these programs, which make up the bulk of the Education Department’s budget and work, “will NOT be touched.” It’s not clear what that means or how the White House expects significant change without touching those programs. McMahon has said she does not support cutting federal spending on Title I or IDEA. This looks a bit harsh, though it’s generally acknowledged that teacher’s unions and schools in progressive states are uber-woke. Can’t they keep the Department but pare away the rotten bits? (And why did “progressive-leaning teachers’ unions” organize against Bush’s “No Child Left Behind” policies? Weren’t those policies designed to create more equity? At any rate, the closure of the Department has to be approved by Congress. *The Free Press has a “Fight Club” article about whether Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University pro-Palestinian activist with a green card, should be deported. There’s both a pro and con. The “pro” is by Hussein Aboubakr Mansour, who argues for deportation on the grounds of what Khalil did, not what he said: Let me be clear: This is not a case about free speech. The heart of the problem lies not in Khalil’s words, but in his actions. He is not some wide-eyed idealist who uttered unpopular opinions or scribbled inflammatory op-eds. In fact, he served as the “negotiator” for Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), a student organization that gleefully cheers for “the total eradication of Western civilization.” CUAD is the primary agent of the chaos that has roiled Columbia since October 7, including assaults on janitorial workers and Jewish students. This is a determined, persistent anarchist enterprise aided by Khalil who, while enjoying the privileges of American residency, helped to spread support for terrorist organizations that have a documented history of kidnapping and killing U.S. citizens. . . . . A green card is a grant of privilege—an invitation to participate in the American project under certain mutually understood terms. The power to revoke that privilege rests with the American public through its constitutional processes precisely because we expect immigrants to respect the foundational principles of our society. If an individual devotes himself to undermining or violently dismantling our culture and institutions, that is a fundamental breach of the agreement he entered into when seeking to live here. And Eli Lake argues against deportation because, he says, this is purely an issue of speech. He thinks Khalil should be punished by Columbia, but not kicked out of the U.S.: . . . . it might surprise you that I also think the Trump administration’s effort to deport Khalil, who is a permanent legal resident of the United States, sets a horrifying precedent for free speech in America. This is because the government’s rationale for deporting him is not that he committed property crimes. It’s not that he provided material support to Hamas. Nor is it that he coordinated his or CUAD’s activities directly with Hamas. The reason Khalil is being deported is because of his speech. Here is how the deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Troy Edgar, explained it earlier this month: “We’ve invited and allowed the student to come into the country, and he’s put himself in the middle of the process of basically pro-Palestinian activity. And at this point, like I said, the Secretary of State can review his visa process at any point and revoke it.” “Pro-Palestinian activity”? That amounts to a kind of thought crime. I agree with Lake; I think this is a free-speech issue, and green-card holders should have that right as well as American citizens. Yes, Khalil’s speech was reprehensible and abhorrent, but I have no evidence that he actually did anything illegal. Apparently, that doesn’t matter to Trump and his people, who think that Khalil endangered American security. Me, I favor free speech within First Amendment boundaries, and I can’t see that Khalil went outside those boundaries. This will be a case for the Supreme Court. *Speaking of which, the WSJ reports that people are being held up and questioned a lot more as they try to enter the U.S. than they were during the Biden administration. It even holds for those who already have visas, and even here for tourism. That’s really no surprise: Immigration officers are employing more aggressive questioning tactics with immigrants and tourists trying to enter the country, scrutinizing their visas and more frequently detaining them in a sharp break from past practice, lawyers and former immigration officials said. In a string of recent cases, border authorities have detained U.S. tourist and work visa holders for lengthy periods after seemingly minor issues with their cases. Among them: a German national with a U.S. green card, who needed to be transported to the hospital after his mother said he was strip-searched during questioning. Another, a tourist who was shackled and chained, was detained after a routine stop driving into the U.S. from Mexico. Immigrants with visa issues more often had been required to come back with additional paperwork to resolve their cases, or else put into deportation proceedings. Generally, it is rare that border authorities detain people with visa issues long-term, especially those with relatively minor violations, the lawyers and former immigration officials said. “I can’t remember anything quite that extreme,” said Gil Kerlikowske, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under former President Barack Obama. The moves come after an executive order, which President Trump issued on his first day in office, called on immigration officials to apply “extreme vetting” measures to visa and green card applicants, including immigrants re-entering the country. Lawyers say the directive appears to have put pressure on them to find more violators, with the goal of tightening restrictions on who is allowed into the country. This is clearly part of Trump’s promise to crack down on immigration and enforce national security. But seriously, a German with a green card has to get strip-searched? Did they have grounds for suspicion? And a tourist from Mexico put in chains and shackles? I wonder if the people who voted for Trump think twice when they hear about stuff like this. Actually, I doubt it. *I already reported that Disney’s live-people remake of “Snow White” was plagued by criticisms before it was even released, criticisms ranging from the pro-Palestinian sentiments of Rachel Zegler to the pro-Israeli sentiments of Gal Gadot, as well as the idea that the Price “stalked” Snow White and kissed her when she was unconscious. Not to mention that instead of using real dwarfs, they used computer-generated dwarfs, whereupon real dwarfs objected that their jobs were being taken away. Apoparently this attempt to clean up and update the old classic wasn’t successful. It has only a 47% critics’ rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and the AP review is also critical: That legacy of “Snow White,” by comparison, doesn’t do any favors to Marc Webb’s inevitably lesser, inert live-action retread. Good intentions, like swirling bluebirds, flutter through this “Snow White”: to give its singing protagonist ( Rachel Zegler ) more agency; to expand that notion of “fair” beyond skin tone; to reframe that problematic prince. But all that updating adds up to a mishmash of a fable, caught in between now and once upon a time. It wouldn’t be an earthshattering observation to note that a 1930s cartoon, let alone a 19th century German folk tale, might not be entirely in line with contemporary culture. Most of these Disney live-action remakes have carried with them more than a few notes of correction and atonement for the past — a laudable goal that means a generation of kids might not need a brief history lesson to go along with an old classic. But it’s a tricky thing reworking a fable that’s been around two centuries, and that’s doubly true when leaping from the two-dimensional fantasy realm of animation to the more complicated land of flesh and bone. Webb’s “Snow White” has been a veritable case study for the headaches that can arise when a window into the real world is cracked open. Everything from Israel’s war in Gaza (Zegler and her co-star Gal Gadot, who plays the wicked stepmother, have differing opinions), the humanity of little people (there’s a reason “and the Seven Dwarfs” has been stripped from the title) and the alleged “woke”-ness of the production have been fuel for what we can gently refer to as online debate. I ain’t gonna see it. If real dwarfs wanted to play the dwarfs, why should they be prohibited? And I could care less about the political opinions of the actors. The important thing is whether the movie is good, watchable, and engaging, and apparently this one isn’t.

It’s reasonable to suspect she is referring to the three “stars” of Harry Potter movies, who rallied against her on trans issues https://www.euronews.com/culture/2025/03/20/three-guesses-jk-rowling-appears-to-take-a-swipe-at-harry-potter-stars-amid-feud Yes, when I wrote this yesterday I truly had no idea. Then later, I suddenly thought, “It must be Emma Watson,” who has gone after JKR after Watson was in the Harry Potter movies. But I decided to leave the original so readers can guess. I think it may also be Daniel Radcliff and Rupert Grint. Hence the “three” guesses. All three of them turned on her. As I think they believed they had to in order to stay in good graces with their public. Which means they wanted to. Joke’s on them. JK is a hero and they are all but forgotten. How pathetic, what sniveling “actors” (I know no better insult). Where’d they all be without her genius? — and how have they done without her? Not well, they peaked young. Ms. Watson… who had a LOT of “pretty privilege” parlayed her fame into 5th or 7th wave feminist lunacy and maximal genderwang. She’s getting on in years now so that priv. will run out kinda soon. And the two boys…..? Not sure. Losers. Coming up many older, more talented people helped me and my career on Wall St and in the law. Even if I disagreed with them I’d never even THINK of doing what these ungrateful little turds have done to JK. At worst just shut your damn trap. Shameful little scorpions. D.A. NYC I was baffled. There is speculation in the German media that JK Rowling’s tweet is directed at Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint because all three have distanced themselves from her because of the allegedly transphobic remarks. In 2024, Rowling said she was unlikely to forgive Radcliffe and Watson for this as they are “celebrities pandering to a movement that seeks to undermine women’s hard-won rights”. Ah – missed this one. My thought also (below). Note her incisive wit – the movie is ruined. That’s what I call British. A THOUGHT FOR TODAY: Among individuals, as among nations, respect for the rights of others is peace. -Benito Juárez, President of Mexico (21 Mar 1806-1872) PEACE : An international affair, a period of cheating between two periods of fighting. -Ambrose Bierce The Devil’s Dictionary (1911) (I just today got an excerpt in a giant book of literature! Might have to buy a hard-copy…) Sigh… The Yates is good. I think Rowling is referring to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. She definitely is! The review of Disney’s new Snow White in The Times regrets that sick bags aren’t provided with each ticket and advises cinamagoers to bring their own. The reviewer notes: Equally problematic, we learn, is calling Dopey (voice by Andrew Barth Feldman) by his name. “Just because his name is Dopey doesn’t mean he’s a dope!” we are warned, like especially slow children. We are told not to laugh at Sleepy (Andy Grotelueschen) because he suffers from the chronic neurological disorder narcolepsy. The headline says it all: “Snow White review — Disney has trashed its crown jewel and its reputation”. https://archive.is/a8n1s Dopey is a subversive weed reference. Actually it’s ‘shrooms, according to The Simpsons; “If Disney sues / We’ll claim fair use / Ho Hi, Ho Hi”. Dope has been slang for injectable heroin since, like, forever, man. Its etymology goes so far back to a Dutch broth that you dip bread in, thence to cooking heroin in a spoon, with detours along the way to a resin you stiffen stretched aircraft canvas with, and to inside information about which horse in a race has been doped, that “dopey” was coined later to describe the mental state from taking dope, not the other way round. So saith Mark Forsyth of The Etymologicon. A movie that should never have been re-made. With all that budget to just do research in how a movie will land with audiences, what were they thinking? What’s next, Song of the South? I’d love to see how they “deproblematize” that one! I could not help but grin when I read the scathing review in the Times. 😆 Informative piece in the New York Post: “It’s absolutely legal to deport hate-monger Mahmoud Khalil”. PBS Newshour headed their broadcast last night with Mr. Khalil’s (long overdue, richly deserved) deportation scandal. Apparently the biggest news of the day! Followed closely by the Joos and Evil Zionists jay walking or littering somewhere, probably Gaza (which their chief newsperson learned to pronounce “properly” in Arabic lately – quite an unintentional comedic gem), thus killing billions of Palestinian babies and surgeons and puppies. What a joke those people are. D.A. NYC At the end of the Post article: ‘Khalil is a guest in our country. Guests do not have a First Amendment “right” to endorse or espouse terrorist activity or incite genocide. They do have a “right” to the first plane out of here.’ May one reasonably take it that Khalil has a right to criticize U.S. foreign policy while standing on U.S. soil, (which does not necessitate endorsing or espousing terrorist activity or inciting genocide)? Several months ago U.S. CITIZEN, U.S. Marine Corps veteran, U.N. arms inspector – and U.S. foreign policy critic – Scott Ritter tried to “take a plane out of here” but – apparently because the U.S. State Department was miffed at his exercising his First Amendment rights – instead had his passport seized, was escorted out of the airport, and soon thereafter had his home raided by the FBI, the probable cause for the warrant apparently being someone’s (contrived, fatuous) suspicion that Ritter had violated the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA). Perhaps were Ritter instead only a green card holder he might have had a better chance of “getting out of here.” I wonder if Khalil has (also) been or will be charged under FARA. Oh Filippo – I saw Ritter giving a Rah Rah speech in Chechnya in service to Russia. He gave the speech in Russian to my surprise – worse Russian than mine I was happy to note – but serviceable. No doubt as to whose side he’s on. He’s a scumbag’s scumbag – a national embarassment. And he is an unabashed traitor. Khalil can’t be a traitor as he isn’t American, he’s a foreign Islamist terrorist – so deportable. Ritter we have to endure until he takes his pro-Russia program ONE STEP too far and he can be charged for that. My popcorn is ordered. 🙂 All the best Filippo, D.A. NYC (moderate – not grand or great Russian speaker) “I wonder if the people who voted for Trump think twice when they hear about stuff like this.” No, I believe most do not. They are too buried in their media feeds which have manipulated them into believing that Russian collusion was a hoax, and that re-electing a man who already tried to overthrow our democracy once was not a concern because eggs are expensive. ‘We deported an innocent man? Someone had to sit in chains? That couldn’t be that bad. Besides, my preacher at church told me that the President is protecting the horribly oppressed Christians in this country!’ By the time these people feel the pain, it will likely be too late. The “Russian collusion” claim was found to be a hoax by R. Mueller. Let me quote from him “The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.”. Don’t worry it get worse. Adam Schiff promoted the “Russian collusion” hoax to the max. Not a hoax. The Russians were definitely pushing Trump. But the investigation couldn’t prove the Trump campaign was in on it. Seeing now how close Trump is to Putin now it seems suspicious. Quote: The investigation concluded in March 2019. The report concluded that the Russian Internet Research Agency’s social media campaign supported Trump’s presidential candidacy while attacking Clinton’s, and Russian intelligence hacked and released damaging material from the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party organizations. The investigation “identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign”, and determined that the Trump campaign “expected it would benefit electorally” from Russian hacking efforts. However, “the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller_special_counsel_investigation The Russian may have been promoting Trump in 2016. However, Mueller found that the Trump campaign did not collude with the Russian. Let me offer a germane quote from J. Toobin. “Certainly the most important thing is the total vindication of the president and his staff on the issue of collusion. There’s just no way around that,” Toobin said on CNN.” Other sources (MSNBC, the Guardian, Rachel Maddow, etc.) all agree that the Trump/Russia claims were a hoax. Should I quote from them? No it wasn’t. Sort of the other way around, if anything. The “no collusion” claim was a hoax perpetrated by Bill Barr. More accurately it was pretty much a straight up lie. A counterfactual meme, if you will, released into the wild by Barr. I recommend reading the Mueller Report. At least what is publicly available. For example, from volume 1, page 2 . . . “The report describes actions and events that the Special Counsel’s Office found to be supported by the evidence collected in our investigation. In some instances, the report points out the absence of evidence or conflicts in the evidence about a particular fact or event. In other instances, when substantial, credible evidence enabled the Office to reach a conclusion with confidence, the report states that the investigation established that certain actions or events occurred. A statement that the investigation did not establish particular facts does not mean there was no evidence of those facts.“ . . . “In evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of “collusion.” In so doing, the Office recognized that the word “collud[e]” was used in communications with the Acting Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation’s scope and that the term has frequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons, the Office’s focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law. In connection with that analysis, we addressed the factual question whether members of the Trump Campaign “coordinat[ed]”—a term that appears in the appointment order—with Russian election interference activities. Like collusion, “coordination” does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood coordination to require an agreement—tacit or express—between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other’s actions or interests. We applied the term coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. I know that’s a bit subtle, but it is pretty clear. The Mueller Report did not exonerate Trump from either collusion, which it didn’t consider at all, or even conspiracy. In fact Mueller bent over backwards to point out, perhaps too delicately, that his investigation found evidence consistent with, but not conclusive of, conspiracy. The Russian may have been promoting Trump in 2016. However, Mueller found that the Trump campaign did not collude with the Russian. Let me offer a germane quote from J. Toobin (not exactly a Trump friendly analyst). “Certainly the most important thing is the total vindication of the president and his staff on the issue of collusion. There’s just no way around that,” Toobin said on CNN.” What does “total vindication” means to you? You can read the source materials or you can believe outlier opinions that fit your prior commitments. I believe that you believe that Trump was totally vindicated. If you think the Russians promoted Trump just because they thought he was a nice guy, you’re pretty naive. Let’s also remember that Clinton campaign money was funneled to at least one Russian national in exchange for fabricated dirt on Trump. Dems were actually doing what they claimed Trump was doing—colluding with Russians to influence the election. Even if that were true, who cares? Weren’t we taught in grade school that two wrongs don’t make a right? In any case, that characterization is not much different from being completely false. You did not quote from the report. You must have typed it from memory. The real quote is “In sum, the investigation established multiple links between Trump Campaign officials and individuals tied to the Russian government. Those links included Russian offers of assistance to the Campaign. In some instances, the Campaign was receptive to the offer, while in other instances the Campaign officials shied away. Ultimately, the investigation did not establish that the Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities.” Not a hoax. The report clearly established Russian election interference. Lots of links from the Russian side. Just not enough evidence that during those discussions (e.g. calls between Flynn and Kislyak, Oknyansky met with Roger Stone, Konstantin Kilimnik working for Paul Manafort ‘assessed by the FBI to have ties to Russian intelligence, Michael Cohen “emailed the Kremlin requesting to speak to (Sergei) Ivanov”, and lots more) that anyone from the Campaign ‘coordinated or conspired’. “Certainly the most important thing is the total vindication of the president and his staff on the issue of collusion. There’s just no way around that,” Toobin said on CNN.” What does “total vindication” means to you? Other sources (MSNBC, the Guardian, Rachel Maddow, etc.) all agree that the Trump/Russia claims were a hoax. Should I quote from them? The hoax was exposed and Trump was cleared. You could try quoting from the Mueller report. But you don’t. Your arguments are the epitome of the word facile. I don’t use the word often, but I love the instance where it stands alone. You made a similar remark yesterday talking about Alito and Thomas corruption; you left a comment that “accepting a gift isn’t a crime” another example of your facile bullshit. The word applies to Trump as well, and his explanations for his actions are somehow beyond facile. WEIT has a lot of MAGAs nowadays…it’s sort of depressing, I must confess. “You did not quote from the report”. I literally quoted from the report. “the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government” is at the top of page 2 of the report (look for the “Introduction to Volume I”). I apologize for confusing two sentences from the Mueller report. I had quoted from page 173. The partial sentence was almost identical and I thought you had added the word ‘Trump’ that was missing from the one on page 173. My unintentional error, which was partly due to search in Adobe. Your quote was, however missing the beginning of the sentence (either on page 2 or 173), which means you quote-mined and ignored the context. To be an accurate partial quote, you must add ‘…’ to the quote. You capitalized ‘The’ instead. I acknowledge the capitalization may have been auto-corrected. But you ignored the first two phrases “Although the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts,” in the sentence you claim to be quoting. Because in my opinion, it clearly contradicts your intended point. I don’t care what Toobin said, Trump was not ‘totally vindicated’. Russian definitely interfered with the election. Trump called for them to do so in public. Mueller didn’t have wiretaps or recordings of what was actually said in those numerous communications and meetings. I can agree that Mueller was unable to demonstrate collusion beyond a reasonable doubt, and therefore did not formerly charge Trump or the campaign (there were other reasons for no formal charges as well). To compare, OJ Simpson was found not guilty, but he was not totally vindicated either. Border guards have very broad powers everywhere. All travellers ought to know this. Harsh vetting gets amplified in the news when the government is controversial. I wouldn’t think ordinary citizens would have much issue with non-citizens being scrutinized closely or harshly. Why should it bother them? Even Canadian citizens returning home to Canada may experience “extreme vetting” if the Border Services Agency personnel suspect they are carrying contraband or have been up to no good while abroad. They don’t need probable cause. They can search everyone in the queue if they want to, and anything they find is admissible as evidence. The Border agents can demand you open your phone for them. If you refuse they will seize it and leave you to worry for the rest of your days that someday our spooks will crack it and tell the Mounties what they found. The body packers having swallowed condoms filled with dope are in for a particularly hard time. We’re not talking one or two. We’re talking dozens. And if one breaks, smuggler is def going to hospital. So you’d want to hear the whole story about the poor German before rushing to judgment. Every Canadian has heard horror stories of retuning citizens having their cars taken apart in the parking lot outside the Customs shack. And these are Canadian citizens, whose right to enter Canada is not contestable. If you don’t have a right to enter (because you’re not a citizen), it’s on you to convince the border agent that you’re going to be worth the risk. Crossing borders is always a bit of a crap shoot, as is travel generally. Visa-free crossing between the U.S. and Canada for each other’s citizens is about as good as it gets but it still goes wrong sometimes, especially after 9/11. I have a funny (really) story about this. I once tried to enter Canada and was held up (at the border) for at least 30 minutes. The Canadian border agents checked my background in every state that I had ever lived in. They had reason to do so. I told the Canadian border agents a story that they knew was not true (I said I was going to Canada to get dinner). They knew that there were no restaurants on the Canadian side of the border. They assumed that I was smuggling guns or drugs (which was not true, I thought that there were restaurants on the Canadian side of the border). Eventually they let me into Canada. I never found any restaurants. It turns out, that I was trying to enter one of the poorest parts of Canada. The U.S. Dept of Ed is really a mixed bag at best. K-12 education in the U.S. is the responsibility of the states and each state is very possessive regarding its authority. So there has always been a pretty large variation in curriculum content between states. Even within states, there was large variation as localities could pretty much roll their own curriculum until the National Governors’ Association (NGA) in the late 80’s asked non-profit, Achieve, Inc, to develop a set of expected curriculum content standards in English Language Arts and math that was internationally normed and could be used as guidance for each of the states. Participation in the resulting standards was a voluntary committment of a state. I believe these standards were later expanded into the Obama Common Core and some money was attached to sweeten the pot for states who participated in that. The NGA also had Achieve, Inc develop the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) published in 2013 which, among other things, rolled engineering design, previously considered to be vocational education in K12, into science preparation. Again participation was voluntary and this was not a U.S. Dept of Education initiative. Some of you may recall PSSC physics or BSCS biology. Neither was a federal initiative, but rather came from university professors who coopted some high school teachers to develop some 20th century science content and textbooks to replace the extant late 19th century content of the 1893 Committee of Ten report under which almost all states still operated into the 1960’s and 70’s. The Advanced Placement (AP) courses came from the College Boards, not the U.S. Dept of Education. What the U.S. Dept of Education does do well is assure that all states support civil rights of all children to participate in education across all states. Thus the various Titled funding and enforcement. But the vast majority of K-12 funding and all curriculum content requirements come from individual states and localities, not the federal government and certainly not the U.S. Dept of Education. On our latest club terrorist: “and green-card holders should have that right (of unfettered free speech) as well as American citizens.” writes WEIT. Maybe they should! Good arguments for exactly that abound. But they don’t. So it is goodbye to Khalil. D.A. NYC *ps Maybe while being deported he’ll be able to pick up some lighter fluid duty free for burning American flags (or humans) at his next stop? Which should be Algeria. There’s debate as to his actual citizenship – details fuzzy as always with terrorists – but seems to be Algeria. I hope it is, few places are worse to be returned to than Algeria. (My thesis studying Middle East politics at Georgetown was about fundamentalism in Algeria and Iran. Trust me – Algeria is not a fun place.) David, I really like the expression “club terrorist” and would like to use it. They actually do, though, don’t they David? A non-citizen alien can’t be charged with a speech crime and fined or jailed because such a speech crime law would itself violate the First Amendment no matter who was charged with breaking it. It’s the law that would fail, irrespective of the status of the person charged under it. Everyone has a right not to be punished for speech in the United States because no law abridging it can be upheld as enforceable even before the first person was charged under it. Anti-Semitic speech is either illegal or it’s not (and it’s almost always not), no matter who utters it. There is no special provision in what laws you do have restricting speech, like libel, incitement, etc., that says it’s legal for citizens to say it but not for aliens. Besides, the Government doesn’t even want to charge Mr. Whatzizname with a crime, with a goal to put him in jail. It just wants to deport him as an undesirable. That’s an administrative process subject to judicial review, not a 1A issue at all. Deportation to Algeria can’t be construed as a punishment. Algeria is not an American penal colony like Guantanamo Bay. It’s a sovereign country with citizens living in it. Once he’s off the plane in Algeria, U.S., law no longer applies to him. He’s a free man. It would only become a 1A issue if the Supreme Court discovered some Constitutional right buried in immigration law that said the (Green-card in this case) alien can’t be deported unless convicted of an actual crime. Then to make deportation stick, the Government would have to first find him guilty of a crime. The only speech crimes that exist are those that apply to everyone (e.g., libel or incitement.) I think we all agree he hasn’t committed any of those. So the Government would have to find something else to charge him with. But I don’t see the Supreme Court wanting to so restrict the power of the Executive to deport aliens. No one who strays into the U.S. from Canada or who is picked up in a sweep has (yet) been convicted of the crime of entering the U.S. illegally. ICE still proceeds with deporting them forthwith unless they claim asylum. They don’t get to stay until found guilty in Court. The beauty of deportation is that it’s an administrative function of the Executive, like the granting or revoking of a motor vehicle registration. If you don’t pay your registration fee and you try to take your unregistered motor vehicle onto the road, the police will impound it. They don’t need to convict you of a crime to hold onto your car in the pound until you come to tow it home. But they can’t fine you unless they charge you with operating an unregistered vehicle (which they will) and they can’t collect the fine until you plead, or are found, guilty. The CGI dwarves in the new Snow White were not the first choice. My understanding is that they originally began filming with seven ordinary-sized actors of various races, sexes, and shapes, with funny clothes and hair. Presumably the idea was to update the dwarves into magical creatures of the forest. When photos and some film got out it was immediately mocked as “Snow White and the Seven Diversity Hires.” It looked pretty ridiculous. People were outraged and Disney backed off, coming up with the idea of using CGI. I suspect the original non-dwarf cast cemented the idea that this version was “woke.” It must have been pretty frustrating to be an actor getting your first big break playing what you hoped would be a well-loved Disney character in a major motion picture, only to be replaced by a really good cartoon. The “Seven Diversity Hires” are still in the film. Now they form a band of robbers who support Snow Whites love interest, the prince gang leader “Robin Hood” Jonathan. I’ve seen the film referred to as “Off-white and the Seven Diversity Hires”, too. +1 HAHHA. Again… killer JezGrove. Or… Snowy-ish and the DEIs. hahhaa D.A. NYC Ceiling Cat: Here is an open letter that may interest you. I’ve signed, as have leaders of CAFH. “Open letter in response to federal funding cuts at Columbia”: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EQ9_FL9psAwt-QohkPZo2BVa5sxj5QSJL44DSFYwYE0/edit?tab=t.0 One of the first actions authoritarians do is to bend institutions to their will or simply destroy them: media, universities, institutions within the government, etc. The Columbia actions are a small part of these efforts. They also understand how easy it is to destroy an institution (USAID comes to mind) than to build one. An institution that has been a part of the US soft power infrastructure since the 60’s was destroyed with a couple key strokes. Ruth Ben-Ghiat is a historian and an expert on authoritarians, how they take power and transform governments. If you want to understand exactly what the Trump administration is doing, I’d suggest following her. Thank you for your reply, Mark. I’ll admit, I’m torn. On one hand, I’m deeply troubled by the infiltration of our institutions by actors who promote the interests of foreign powers. Qatar’s funding of universities, for example, has enabled a great deal of soft power and influence that shapes academic priorities and public discourse in concerning ways. I voted for the “Orange Beast” because I believe that Harris and the current Democratic Party no longer represent the interests of the working class—or the ideals the party once stood for. In my view, they’ve drifted too far, increasingly catering to Iran and enabling narratives that undermine core American values. At the same time, I’m not blind to the threat posed by Putin’s influence. However, after the orchestrated psyops and misinformation campaigns waged by the CIA and certain Democratic factions—particularly regarding “Russian disinformation”—I find it difficult to trust anything emerging from those sources. It’s hard to discern what’s real when so much of the discourse feels manipulated. Perhaps Trump’s personality—his ego and bluster—makes him susceptible to Putin’s manipulation. Or perhaps, despite appearances, he is uniquely positioned to counter Iran’s aggression while keeping Putin in check. I hope the latter is true, though nearly every Democrat I know parrots the former narrative without much critical thought. What concerns me most is the sense that Putin and China are sitting back with popcorn in hand, watching how effortlessly our universities and federal institutions have been radicalized by ideologies hostile to the West. It’s disheartening to witness, and I wonder how far they’ll be able to exploit this ideological capture. That said, I don’t buy into the “Trump is a dictator” hysteria. The more I hear that refrain, the more it reinforces my sympathy for him—if only because the arguments tend to be so hyperbolic and unconvincing. For all that, I remain opposed to Trump’s cuts to university funding. I’ve made that clear, both by signing the Open Letter and in conversations on a Harvard listserv. Defunding biomedical research as a reaction to campus politics is a miscalculation. It’s shortsighted to jeopardize life-saving research in the name of fighting “wokeness” or antisemitism, even though wokeness and antisemitism are very real problems. It’s just that Trump bulldozing academia won’t solve either. When it comes to slashing federal programs like USAID, I have fewer qualms. Agencies like that are bloated, often corrupt, and long overdue for a reckoning. But targeting universities? That’s a misfire. We shouldn’t sacrifice life-saving biomedical research to make a point about campus politics. There’s a world of difference between trimming the fat in Washington and gutting our research institutions. I only wish Trump had drawn that line. At the same time, universities are to blame that DOGE and the public can’t tell the difference between woke, intersectional, DEI nonsense and research that quacks like that but saves lives. Update on Columbia: https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/21/metro/columbia-grants-trump-demands/?event=event25 I asked an AI bot to rename the Seven Dwarfs as woke characters. Part of its response was This exercise highlights the complexities of “woke” reimaginings. It’s a conversation about representation and inclusivity, but it also requires careful consideration to avoid unintended consequences. That’s the problem right there. Even after careful consideration (and does that happen?) unforseen consequences will abound. Sounds like Google Gemini. Very anxious not to offend. You might get better results from ChatGPT or Grok. There is a public garden called Innisfree in Millbrook, NY. It is only open W-Su from 10-5 from late April through mid-Oct. You need a car to get there. It is 4 mi. east of the Taconic Pkwy, or a bit NE of Poughkeepsie, NY. Admin is $10 ($5 seniors & kids). It is a lovely, peaceful, informal garden with a large lake and trails that wander between ‘cup’ gardens. I highly recommend a visit if you are ever in the area at the right time. You can see some images here: https://www.innisfreegarden.org/gardenareas With the Snow White remake, I think they were forced to ‘reimagine’ the dwarf part of the story after Peter Dinklage criticized the notion of a bunch of dwarves living together in a cave. Peter Dinklage being a famous dwarf actor from Game of Thrones. Re why “progressive-leaning teachers’ unions” organised against Bush’s “No Child Left Behind” policies which were designed to create more equity — Partly because they could easily have imagined a likely result: the most (only?) feasible way to directly reduce existing gaps between high and low achievers is to reduce the standards, thus everyone becomes a high achiever, thus equity. The pressure on states and schools to reduce the gaps did indeed result in exactly that. And IMO there’s no way that Bush’s admin didn’t anticipate this; one can reasonably speculate that they would consider this a feature not a bug, since it would reduce support for public education. Say what you will about the Republican party, but it’s hard to disagree that they tend to run a longer con than the Democrats do. Not remotely 3-D chess, but much more than gut-reaction whining and performative outrage. Roe’s gone, proof of your pudding… With the Snow White remake, I think they were forced to ‘reimagine’ the dwarf part of the story after Peter Dinklage criticized the notion of a bunch of dwarves living together in a cave. Peter Dinklage being a famous dwarf actor from Game of Thrones. Before I became acquainted with “Innisfree” as a written poem, I knew it from this setting as sung by Judy Collins. https://youtu.be/QahVf0wL9IU?si=kVI4tBrTQv7sWbc6 (I long thought she had composed the music, but later learned the setting was around and she picked it and sang it. It was not, however, a strange idea that she might have written the music — though not usually listed with the singer/songwriters, she did write several of the songs she sings. I have looked up who the composer was, but don’t remember. Oh, and there is another, entirely distinct, setting by somebody else.) Edit: It appears to be Hamilton Camp.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MARCH 21 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MARCH 21 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world.

Episode 5 – Spending data shows that cloud native databases are disrupting traditional analytic data stores. Snowflake and AWS RedShift stand out as having spending momentum based on ETR survey data – Some cloud native databases have been architected to enable storage and compute resources to be scaled independently. This not only improves economics but also drives increased agility and flexibility for many use cases. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave Vellante explains how this dynamic is eating into traditional enterprise data warehouse markets. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 4 – Storage Spending Outlook 2H ’19 – Pure Leads the Pack – The on-prem storage business has been hurt by: 1) the cloud siphoning away demand; and 2) a massive injection of flash storage that has given data center managers enough performance headroom to minimize the need to buy for performance reasons. Pure Storage is growing faster than the marketshare leaders but from a much smaller installed base. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MARCH 21 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR, who will share fresh data, perspectives and insights from the latest survey data.

For many companies, redomiciling in the U.S. simply isn’t worth it, according to financial and legal advisers on both sides of the border. U.S. and Canada flags are seen on a transport truck trailer at the Pacific Highway Canada-U.S. border crossing in Surrey B.C., on March 4.ETHAN CAIRNS/The Canadian Press Only two months into United States President Donald Trump’s second term, whispers that Canadian companies will keep fleeing to the U.S. are rampant, and there are fears that it will cause economic ruin. Corporate giants such as Brookfield Asset Management Ltd. BAM-T and Shopify Inc. SHOP-T have already either moved their headquarters to New York or opened an executive office there, while remaining incorporated in Canada. Lawyers and tax specialists also say they are fielding calls from companies of all sizes who want to at least consider the idea. The reality: For many companies, redomiciling in the U.S. simply isn’t worth it, according to financial and legal advisers on both sides of the border. Once chief executives dig into the details, they quickly learn the benefits often aren’t all that compelling, and the process of relocating can be both gruelling and expensive. To start, any perceived U.S. tax benefits usually aren’t that great – and can even be punitive. Canadian companies must also pay a departure tax worth roughly 25 per cent of their net assets on their way out. As for Mr. Trump’s promise that U.S.-based companies won’t face tariffs, it’s misguided. The White House has repeatedly ignored the prospect of retaliatory tariffs, and a newly-American company that keeps selling to Canadian clients could end up facing stiff levies from their former home country. There’s also the risk of political backlash, something Quebec-based trucking giant TFI International Inc. TFII-T faced hours after announcing it would move to the U.S. The anger was so acute that chief executive officer Alain Bédard backtracked within four days and chose to stay put. Of course, there can be benefits to redomiciling. For publicly listed companies, it offers the chance to get included in a U.S. stock market index, such as the S&P 500. That can attract more investor and analyst attention, helping to boost a company’s share price. But nothing’s guaranteed. There’s already fierce competition among American companies to get into these indices, and there is also speculation that the rules for inclusion will change in the near future. S&P Global, which manages a number of major indices, might soon allow Canadian and other foreign-based companies to be included in a U.S. index despite being domiciled outside of the U.S. Lachlan Wolfers: Canadian companies must think twice before moving to the United States “If this is the path followed, then there is no need for Canadian companies to even muse about switching to U.S. incorporation as these companies will get the benefit of U.S. index inclusion without the costly and difficult process of reincorporating south of the border,” wrote Peter Haynes, a managing director at TD Securities who specializes in index rules, in an e-mail to The Globe and Mail. On the tax front, CEOs often assume their companies will pay lower rates in the U.S., especially with Mr. Trump bragging about the tax cuts he put in place during his first term. Yet in a number of U.S. states, the corporate tax rate is quite similar to what a Canadian company currently pays once all levels of government are factored in. There are also scores of less obvious tax differences between the two countries. For miners, certain exploration tax credits offered in Canada may not exist in the U.S., and for health care or technology companies, the same can be true for research and development tax credits. While there certainly are instances where a Canadian company will pay lower taxes in the U.S., the corporations that benefit have to consider their geographic mix. For the most part, revenue gets taxed in the country where it is earned. So if a newly-American company still generates half of its sales in Canada, half of its business will be taxed at Canadian rates. “People can redomicile to their heart’s content,” said Lachlan Wolfers, the national leader of KPMG Law in Canada, but corporate taxes are mostly paid wherever a company has a permanent establishment, such as an office, factory or mine. (There are some exceptions, such as technology companies that claim they sell into Canada from the U.S., which is why Canada enforced its digital sales tax.) Tax is a “relevant and important factor,” Mr. Wolfers said, but ultimately, “these decisions should not be tax-driven.” Redomiciling can also be a logistical nightmare – and an expensive one. Few business owners factor Canada’s departure tax into their calculations, and it can be sizable. In a recent case, Carol Sadler, a partner specializing in cross-border taxation at Achen Henderson in Calgary, said the departure tax would wipe out all of her clients’ cash and receivables, and then they’d have to move their equipment to the U.S. and would likely need financing to restart operations there. The departure tax “is one of the typical deal breakers we see,” said Kris Rossignoli, a cross-border tax and financial planner with Cardinal Point Wealth in New York, who works with Canadian clients. And even when it’s manageable, in order to physically move to the U.S long term, business owners need an immigration visa: “That’s not something you can just get overnight,” Mr. Rossignoli said. For some, the benefits can still outweigh the costs, such as when a Canadian company has significant manufacturing and sales in the U.S. But such clients also have to look a few years out. “I think the number of people who will do this in the short-term is really small because we just don’t know how long the tariffs are gonna last,” said Max Reed, a cross-border tax lawyer and principal of Polaris Tax Counsel in Vancouver. (U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently said the reciprocal tariff rate that the U.S. plans to charge each of its trading partners will be announced on April 2.) The same is true for publicly listed corporations who might redomicile for index purposes. In early March, S&P proposed changes to its rules for inclusion in the S&P/TSX Composite Index, permitting U.S. domiciled companies “with significant ties to Canada” to remain listed here. Responding to questions from The Globe, S&P did not say much about its reasoning and also did not discuss the likelihood of future changes to other indices. But Mr. Haynes, the TD analyst, thinks the same thing could happen in the U.S. over the next two years. Country-specific indices, he wrote, “are a bit of a relic.” Often, he added, “these domestic indices bear limited resemblance to a local economy – think about Shell or BP which are part of the FTSE 100 but have only a small percentage of revenue generated in the United Kingdom.” Report an editorial error Report a technical issue Editorial code of conduct Study and track financial data on any traded entity: click to open the full quote page.

Title: Here are 9 cheap but solid names to buy now as AI stocks enter bear market territory

It's hard to believe that AI stocks are now in a bear market since many have fallen by more than 20% from their highs. It comes after a multi-year run that lifted the S&P 500 by about 24% in 2023 and 23% in 2024. The script has flipped, and the index is being held up by the broader market instead of the Magnificent 7. As of Thursday, the two largest stocks, Nvidia and Apple, were down by almost 14% and 12%, respectively this year. Other well-known AI plays followed closely behind. As of Thursday, Broadcom was down by over 17%, Arista Networks by 25%, and Marvell Technology by over 37% this year. DeepSeek's debut, which introduced a software-efficient solution to investors in late January, marked a peak reversal for this sector. A new reality has kicked in: Big Tech isn't immune to market competition, which is causing investors to sober up from their valuation-induced highs. "We've essentially seen the AI stocks on a downward trend ever since then, said Dave Sekera, Morningstar's chief US market strategist. "Most of those stocks have sold off anywhere between 15% to 20%. So pretty close to what would be considered a bear market in AI stocks." Risk-off moves followed the reversal as economic fears mounted from trade wars and slowing GDP growth. The bad news is, if you have heavy exposure to AI, you're portfolio is likely down. The good news is that some of these formerly expensive companies are now in fair-value territory, according to Morningstar's five-star valuation system, which considers a company's fundamentals relative to its trading price. This year, Sekera expects investor attention to move away from Big Tech and toward companies integrating AI into their products and services to drive additional revenue growth, improve customer retention, and boost productivity and efficiency. So, at this point, investors have three options. The first is to chase the crowd into a later phase of the AI trade, where bets are being made on which companies will successfully integrate AI for wider profit margins. Or, stay behind and look for sales on AI's picks and shovel stocks. Finally, they can choose to seek out more speculative opportunities in leading-edge sectors like robotics. Either way, the market could remain choppy, and volatility must be an accepted part of the trade. Stock picks The software sector is a great place to look for AI bargains. Stocks in this corner were dumped in a flight to risk-off trades, including those with solid business models and recurring revenue growth, which brings us to the main point: if you're screening for names here, you'll want to focus on revenue growth above all else because the industry's perk is that it can grow fast, said Dan Romanoff, a senior equity research analyst for technology at Morningstar. "You can just draw a chart that compares software multiples versus revenue growth. And the higher the revenue growth, the higher the multiples will be, even if the company is losing money," Romanoff said. "If you're looking at your portfolio holistically, tech is usually providing the most growth within your portfolio, and so you want to lean into the growth where you can get it." The key is to find the best growth story, he added. And the answer may not always be the company making the widest strides but rather the one that has shown sustainability in its revenue growth. In other words, a bump in revenue could be temporary due to a product release, which could fizzle out in the next quarter, he said. Knowing the difference is key to deciphering between a short-term trade and a long-term investment opportunity. Within software, stocks that are now well-priced include Microsoft. As of Thursday, it was down by almost 7% this year. But it's still a harbor in a storm because of its blue-chip name, he noted. It has a monopoly in desktop operating systems with Windows. It has a near monopoly in productivity software in the office suites. Then, it piled on GenAI tools, which has catapulted it into a leadership spot in the AI race, Romanoff said. Its Azure is also a cloud provider in a three-horse race with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. Romanoff believes cloud providers will be the real winners in GenAI because inference happens on these servers. Adobe is another software firm to bet on. It's not a pure AI play, which is positive because it means the company has a solid, long-running business. The stock is down by over 10% this year. It's being dumped because investors fear GenAI will take over. After all, GenAI is improving at creating images and could circumvent the need for Adobe's platform. But Romanoff believes Adobe's FireFly, which provides AI-based text-to-image and text-to-video options, will remain necessary. "You're still going to need tools to edit the content that is created by a generative AI model," Romanoff said. "If you're in advertising and creating a campaign, the images you create need to be very specifically edited to create, inform, and define the brand image you want." Finally, there's ServiceNow. It's a company that has successfully provided customer service and IT platforms. Its Q4 revenue was up by 21.34% from last year. But the stock is down almost 22% this year. They have a solid, long-running business with only a small part of their revenue coming from GenAI offerings, Romanoff noted. Their annual recurring revenue, which is a key metric for software providers, has been on a solid growth trajectory, he added. If you're curious about where the rest of the Magnificent 7 are trading, some are now well-priced, too. According to Morningstar's five-star rating system, which factors in volatility and uncertainty, these three names are now rated at four-stars: Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META). Additional picks and shovel names that are now well priced and thus four-stars are ASML (ASML), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Marvell International (MRVL). For investors who want to make a more leading-edge bet, cheap or not, robotics is set to take off as automation integrates with AI. The two sectors combined now make up 1% of global GDP. And that's expected to increase to a whopping 35% by 2040, according to VettaFi. Demand will come from manufacturing, healthcare, logistics, and agriculture end users. And that runway creates a trillion-dollar opportunity for investors. However, betting in this sector can be trickier since a company's past fundamentals won't be the best measure of its future success. Here, Zeno Mercer, an investor and researcher in Deep Tech at VettaFi, says companies must be evaluated based on their contribution to relevant AI or robotics subsectors. They also need to be assessed on their technological leadership, their position within the market, such as who they are partnered with, and whether they're making strategic investments that will grow their presence. VettaFi's ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index is one place to look for leading global companies in this arena. The Index's top holdings include names like Harmonic Drive Systems, which makes precision control equipment for robots; Fanuc Corp, a robotics manufacturer; and GEA Group AG, an industrial, pharmaceutical, and chemical equipment manufacturer.

Feedback Thyrocare founder Dr A Velumani has weighed in on the emotional toll of mass layoffs. In a post on X, Velumani reflected on how early career wins at big tech firms often lead to disappointment when job cuts strike unexpectedly. “Imagine how many might have celebrated for getting a campus placement with such brands. Now how many might feel depressed! It is not 10 or 20. 100 or 200. 1000 or 2000. 14000. Do not celebrate too early. Career or business – It's Marathon Race,” Dr A Velumani posted on X. His remarks quickly gained traction, triggering widespread discussion online about job security and long-term career planning. Several users echoed the sentiment, pointing out the need for adaptability in a volatile job market. “Job security is a myth. Skills, adaptability, and financial planning matter more than titles,” one user wrote. Another added, “Reminds me of the funda that never get too comfortable too soon. Whether career or business, it's a marathon, not a sprint. Stay adaptable, keep growing.” A third commented, “In other way, don't give-up early, it's a marathon race. Situations may change anytime.” Imagine how many might have celebrated for getting a campus placement with such brands. Now how many might feel depressed! It is not 10 or 20. 100 or 200 1000 or 2000 14000!!!! Donot celebrate too early. Career or business - It’s Marathon Race. pic.twitter.com/rrcQujB7hN Other users took a broader view of professional growth. “A job is a sprint, but wealth-building is a marathon. Markets, careers, and businesses have cycles—ups and downs are inevitable. Invest like you build a career—steady, patient, and focused on the long run,” one user noted. There were also reflections on the realities of the corporate world. “Everything has a shelf life like a product. Human beings needs to evolve from being commodity to VA product. Orgs have to save their ass when times are bad. Learn this at young age,” said one response. Referencing Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, another user remarked, “As Kalam sir said no need to be loyal to the company, be loyal to your work.” Copyright©2025 Living Media India Limited.

Title: Discussing Lands' End with ChatGPT
URL: https://blog.minethatdata.com/2025/03/discussing-lands-end-with-chatgpt.html
Time Published: 2025-03-21T03:10:00Z

Helping CEOs Understand How Customers Interact With Advertising, Products, Brands, and Channels Y'all realize, of course, that your utter dependence on Facebook/Google for new customers puts the future health of your business at serious risk, right? Here's a discussion I had with ChatGPT. Kevin: Lands' End seems to rely heavily on discounts and promotions as part of its core business strategy for several reasons: Constant discounts create a sense of getting a deal, which encourages customers to buy more. If customers feel like they’re getting high-quality products at a reduced price, they’re more likely to make a purchase — even if the "original" price was inflated to allow for the discount. Over time, Lands' End has trained its customer base to expect discounts. If you know there’s always a sale around the corner, you might hesitate to buy at full price — but you'll jump at a 40% off email. This creates a shopping pattern where customers are almost waiting for the next sale to make a purchase. The apparel industry is highly competitive, especially in the mid-tier, classic, and outdoor clothing markets where Lands' End operates. Competitors like L.L.Bean, Eddie Bauer, and even department stores frequently run sales. Lands' End likely feels the need to match or exceed these offers to stay relevant. Frequent sales help clear out seasonal and excess inventory. Lands' End sells a lot of seasonal clothing (coats, swimsuits, etc.), so offering regular discounts helps prevent stock from piling up and reduces storage costs. Lands' End has always leaned heavily on direct mail and email marketing. Regular discounts give them a reason to send those emails and catalogs ("Get 30% Off Now!") and drive immediate sales spikes. Lands' End likely sets its initial prices higher, knowing that a large percentage of sales will happen at a discount. That way, even after applying a 30%–50% off promo, they can still maintain a healthy profit margin. That depends — what’s your size and fit preference? Lands' End is known for offering a pretty wide range of sizes, including: They’re also known for more relaxed, classic fits rather than slim or trendy cuts. If you prefer a roomy, comfortable fit, you’ll probably have good luck. Plus, they tend to use quality materials (like down, PrimaLoft, and waterproof fabrics) at reasonable prices, especially when you catch one of their sales. What kind of outerwear are you thinking — a winter coat, rain jacket, or something lighter? 👀 Kevin: I need a rain jacket, mens, size = 3x. Got it! Lands' End does carry men's rain jackets in 3X, and their outerwear tends to be pretty size-inclusive. Their Squall® jackets are a popular choice — waterproof, windproof, and lined for extra warmth. They also have some lighter rain shells if you’re looking for something less insulated. Want me to check what’s available right now or help narrow down the options? 🌧️😊 Kevin: Yes, and please recommend cheaper options from competing brands (links and images were provided, FYI). Certainly! Here are some men's rain jacket options in size 3X, including selections from Lands' End and more affordable alternatives from other brands: Lands' End Men's Big Waterproof Rain Jacket This jacket features a wind-and-waterproof 2.5-layer shell with a breathable, moisture-wicking interior membrane. It includes an adjustable hood, front and chest zipper pockets, and underarm zippers for ventilation. Available in size 3X. Portwest US440 Classic Waterproof Rain Jacket An affordable option, this jacket is waterproof with sealed seams and a pack-away hood. It's available in olive color, size 3X. Frogg Toggs Men's Rain Suit This rain suit includes both a jacket and pants, offering waterproof protection. Frogg Toggs is known for lightweight and breathable rainwear. Sizes up to 3X are available. Columbia Men's Rain Jackets Columbia offers a range of waterproof and breathable rain jackets. Some styles are available in extended sizes, including 3X. REI Co-op Men's Rain Jackets REI carries various men's rain jackets from brands like Marmot and The North Face. Some options are available in size 3X. When selecting a rain jacket, consider factors like waterproofing, breathability, and additional features such as adjustable hoods and ventilation options. Lands' End offers quality options, and brands like Portwest and Frogg Toggs provide more budget-friendly alternatives without compromising on essential features. Now, I'm asking questions like a moron, not like a human being. But please pay attention to the judgments that ChatGPT makes about Lands' End and other companies (calling Portwest budget-friendly). Imagine the content that ChatGPT had to "steal" to train itself to make judgments about who Lands' End is, who they compete with, and the give-and-take between catalogs / email / discounts? From a commerce standpoint, Google and Facebook are "dead men walking" ... via their current business model. If you are having conversations with AI and AI is steering you where it wants via judgements made by equations that are easy to create but hard to understand, you won't sit in front of a laptop typing questions on Google then visiting landsend.com, will you? That personal relationship you have with your customers ... either via the community you created, or via your own email/sms marketing program ... are about to become critically important. Ultimately, your email/sms program is going to be replaced by something interactive, but until then that personal relationship is going to be so darn important. Also ... what do you do when AI makes judgments about your brand that you don't like? Gonna be a wild ride. P.S.: This is the point where some of the hounds come after me ... "Kevin, Meta isn't stealing content, they're using readily available information to train AI to be smarter." Well, I searched LibGen to see if Meta used my information, and yes, they used several of my booklets to train their AI. Which, of course, is stealing. And yes, there's nothing I can do about it so complaining is meaningless. I have to adapt and move on. ChatGPT tells me that it makes a distinction between creating new ideas and synthesizing existing ideas. Oh. Great. Also faulty logic.

Here's a customer who just purchased for the fifth time ... via models, the customer is expected to become less responsive with each mon...

Specifically, Defendants allegedly failed to disclose to investors: (1) the Company’s channel management initiatives were not progressing as represented; (2) that, faced with pricing pressure, the Company had made the decision not to compete on prices and instead walk away from sales opportunities; (3) that, as a result, the Company had inflated inventory in the channels in “LATAM, including Brazil, Asia, including India, as well as Canada and Eastern Europe;” and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 28, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Rocket Lab’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

Many workshops, talks, and panels were so packed that people had to lean against walls or sit on the floor — and suffer the wrath of organizers shouting commands to get them to line up properly. Nvidia currently sits at the top of the AI world, with record-breaking financials, sky-high profit margins, and no serious competitors yet. But the coming months also hold unprecedented risk for the company as it faces U.S. tariffs, DeepSeek, and shifting priorities from top AI customers. At GTC 2025, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang attempted to project confidence, unveiling powerful new chips, personal “supercomputers,” and, of course, really cute robots. It was an exhaustive sales pitch — one aimed at investors reeling from Nvidia’s nosediving stock. “The more you buy, the more you save,” Huang said at one point during a keynote on Tuesday. “It’s even better than that. Now, the more you buy, the more you make.” More than anything, Nvidia at this year’s GTC sought to assure attendees — and the rest of the world watching — that demand for its chips won’t slow down anytime soon. During his keynote, Huang claimed that nearly the “entire world got it wrong” on traditional AI scaling falling out of vogue. Chinese AI lab DeepSeek, which earlier this year released a highly efficient “reasoning” model called R1, prompted fears among investors that Nvidia’s monster chips may no longer be necessary for training competitive AI. But Huang has repeatedly insisted that power-hungry reasoning models will, in fact, drive more demand for the company’s chips, not less. That’s why at GTC, Huang showed off Nvidia’s next line of Vera Rubin GPUs, claiming they’ll perform inference (that is, run AI models) at roughly double the rate of Nvidia’s current best Blackwell chip. The threat to Nvidia’s business that Huang spent less time addressing included upstarts like Cerebras, Groq, and other low-cost inference hardware and cloud providers. Nearly every hyperscaler is developing a custom chip for inference, if not training, as well. AWS has Graviton and Inferentia (which it’s reportedly aggressively discounting), Google has TPUs, and Microsoft has Cobalt 100. Along the same vein, tech giants currently extremely reliant on Nvidia chips, including OpenAI and Meta, are looking to reduce those ties via in-house hardware efforts. If they — and the aforementioned other rivals — are successful, it’ll almost assuredly weaken Nvidia’s stranglehold on the AI chips market. That’s perhaps why Nvidia’s share price dipped around 4% following Huang’s keynote. Investors might’ve been holding out hope for “one last thing” — or perhaps an accelerated launch window. In the end, they got neither. Nvidia also sought to allay worries about tariffs at GTC 2025. The U.S. hasn’t imposed any tariffs on Taiwan (where Nvidia gets most of its chips), and Huang claimed tariffs wouldn’t do “significant damage” in the short run. He stopped short of promising that Nvidia would be shielded from the long-term economic impacts, however — whatever form they ultimately take. Nvidia has clearly received the Trump administration’s “America First” message, with Huang pledging at GTC to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on manufacturing in the U.S. While that would help the company diversify its supply chains, it’s also a massive cost for Nvidia, whose multitrillion-dollar valuation depends on healthy profit margins. As it looks to seed and grow businesses other than its core chips line, Nvidia at GTC drew attention to its new investments in quantum, an industry that the company has historically neglected. At GTC’s first Quantum Day, Huang apologized to the CEOs of major quantum companies for causing a minor stock crash in January 2025 after he suggested that the tech wouldn’t be very useful for the next 15 to 30 years. On Tuesday, Nvidia announced that it would open a new center in Boston, NVAQC, to advance quantum computing in collaboration with “leading” hardware and software markers. The center will, of course, be equipped with Nvidia chips, which the company says will enable researchers to simulate quantum systems and the models necessary for quantum error correction. In the more immediate future, Nvidia sees what it’s calling “personal AI supercomputers” as a potential new revenue-maker. At GTC, the company launched DGX Spark (previously called Project Digits) and DGX Station, both of which are designed to allow users to prototype, fine-tune, and run AI models in a range of sizes at the edge. Neither is exactly inexpensive — they retail for thousands of dollars — but Huang boldly proclaimed that they represent the future of the personal PC. “This is the computer of the age of AI,” Huang said during his keynote. “This is what computers should look like, and this is what computers will run in the future.” We’ll soon see if customers agree.

Title: Komoot Acquired: History Says This Won’t End Well

Time Published: 2025-03-20T23:15:25Z
Full Content:
And now things start to make a bit more sense. Earlier this week I posted on the news that Komoot was changing to require a Premium subscription for users to sync routes to 3rd party devices like Garmin, Wahoo, Hammerhead, and others. Komoot did make a carve-out for existing users who bought something previously, effectively grandfathering them in. Still, as I outlined in my piece, the move seemed a bit tone-deaf relative to the rest of the route-planning competitors (which allow it on free accounts). But, now things are becoming a bit more clear. The Komoot policy change actually happened back on February 27th, and today, March 20th, the company has announced that it’s been acquired by Bending Spoons, which bills itself as a technology company (rather than a private equity or other investment apparatus). Though, in reality, history shows otherwise. The press release announcing the acquisition is incredibly light on details (the first sign bad things are to come). There’s no FAQ, no mention of existing staff, no mention of specific ways they plan to leverage each other, etc…No communication to end users, just a single press release filed to the wire service: MILAN–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Technology company Bending Spoons today announced that it has closed the acquisition of komoot, the Germany-based route-planning platform for adventurers and outdoor enthusiasts worldwide. Markus Hallermann, komoot’s CEO and co-founder, said of the acquisition: “For 17 years, we have been on a mission to make outdoor adventures accessible to all. From humble beginnings in our student rooms, we’ve built komoot from the ground up and grown it to 45 million users, making it Europe’s leading outdoor platform. Komoot inspires millions to explore the outdoors, improving both physical and mental well-being, and continues to grow worldwide. However, what got us here won’t take us to the next level. Scaling a company requires a different mindset and skill set than building one. That’s why we believe Bending Spoons, with its unique expertise in driving innovation and scaling platforms, is the perfect partner to lead komoot into the future.” Luca Ferrari, the Bending Spoons CEO and co-founder, said: “We’re deeply impressed by komoot’s achievements over the past seventeen years, and are enthusiastic about its future growth potential. By leveraging the Bending Spoons expertise and platform technologies, we’re confident we can help komoot go from strength to strength for many years to come.” Advisors and investors: Investors that supported the journey of komoot are: KRW Schindler, Outdoor Secondary, MBG Beteiligungsges. Berlin-Brandenburg, and LP Capital (Liquid Partners). Perella Weinberg Partners served as exclusive financial advisor to komoot, and Osborne Clarke served as the company’s legal advisor. Freshfields served as legal advisor to Bending Spoons. EY Advisory S.p.A. provided financial and tax due diligence services. J.P. Morgan and Intesa Sanpaolo served as the company’s financial advisors. About komoot: Komoot is a thriving digital platform for adventurers and outdoor enthusiasts around the world. It’s driven by a simple goal: to help people explore more of the outdoors wherever and however they want. Komoot’s mobile apps and platform provide advanced route planning and navigation tools. At the same time, a content-rich feed of unique stories and adventures inspires its community of over 45 million users to explore and share their outdoor experiences and recommendations. About Bending Spoons: Bending Spoons has served a billion people across the globe through its suite of digital technology businesses, including Brightcove, Evernote, Meetup, Remini, StreamYard, and WeTransfer. Its products are currently used by more than 300 million people each month. Got all that? Yeah, it’s not much. Now, who the heck is ‘Bending Spoons’? Well, the snippet above throws out some well-named brands: Evernote, Meetup, and WeTransfer, for example. However, let’s look at what happened to each of those, according to Wikipedia and various other sources: Evernote: Acquired in January 2023, in July 2023 Bending Spoons laid off all Evernote staff and transferred the operations to Bending Spoons HQ. Mosaic Group: Acquired in January 2024, immediately laid off all 330 staff members, folded operations into Bending Spoons HQ. WeTransfer: Acquired in July 2024, in September 2024 laid off 75% of all staff. MeetUp: Acquired in January 2024, in February 2024 laid off a “significant” portion of the workforce Brightcove: Acquired in November 2024, yesterday, March 19th, laid off 2/3rds of US employees This is in addition to other less-high-profile acquisitions, such as Filmic in 2022 (laid off everyone). In all of these cases, Bending Spoons has simply taken companies that are generally software-as-a-service/platform-based, and then pulled the website into their existing IT infrastructure and laid almost everyone off. Of course, that doesn’t mean innovation stops. If we look at Evernote, for example, there have been plenty of feature improvements since then. But if there’s one thing I know about sports technology companies, is that it takes an unusually high understanding of sports at the IT and development level in order to make a company successful. All the most successful sports tech companies in this industry have people who live and breathe sports on a daily basis. Everything from racing to ultra events, to going deep in the woods on silly adventures. In other words: The core audience of Komoot has to be reflected in the developers of Komoot. To date, those two have been aligned. Whether or not that remains the case going forward, after what history has shown us will be mass layoffs (potentially every single person in the company), remains to be seen. Without any assurances in the press release about those staff, or future features, there’s absolutely zero reason for users to stick around. Astoundingly, if you re-read this press release, both the Komoot side and the Bending Spoon side is very clear about that. In fact, I’d argue that Komoot’s CEO’s quote is the death blow, saying: “However, what got us here won’t take us to the next level. Scaling a company requires a different mindset and skill set than building one.” Seriously? Talk about a slap in the face to your employees (and for that matter, your customers, who filled your platform full of the content that actually makes you successful: routing, collections, and photos ). Let’s be frank, Komoot: What got you here is catering to our audience. Not IT scale. IT scale hasn’t been your issue. But perhaps they aren’t talking IT scale, perhaps they’re talking marketing/commercial scale. But if we look at Bending Spoons’ history, it’s hard to say that any of these acquisitions have resulted in substantial increases in scale/reach/brand awareness. What the future will bring exactly, of course, remains to be seen. But if I were in charge of Komoot, I certainly wouldn’t be putting out bland half-assed press releases, hoping that users stick around and pay more for a Premium subscription. Cause if there’s anything I know about nutcases like myself that use Komoot to plan stupid long adventures into the woods: We ain’t got any time for lack of answers and lack of planning – we’ll simply move on to the next site. How is it that a site that’s literally focused on helping people plan the road ahead, didn’t bother to plan to send out an e-mail to their users notifying them of the acquisition, is beyond me (or, simply, pretty telling).

Agree. They’re expensive but reliable! Actually … reliable YES, expensive NO if you actually value the work that the company puts in to build a great product and what you get back as a consequence. Hmm, let’s not conflate expensive with value-for-money here. Nor ignore the fact that your expensive and others’ expensive might not be the same thing. For cycling that has probably already been the case. But Komoot’s real advantage has been for multiday through hiking and trail running, which RideWithGPS doesn’t do well, if at all. RWGPS doesn’t have any data on the backcountry and side country hiking trails in my area, and definitely won’t route you on them. Komoot does, although in light of the earlier post from Ray I’m not sure how much longer I’m going to stick around. Meh, not awesome for running and hiking. I actually use both. Horses for courses. I use GaiaGPS for hiking. The maps are good. The user interface isn’t the best. I remember the ever increasing prices when Bending Spoons bought the wonderful Evernote. Sad to see them devouring Komoot. Thanks for the update, I’ve been watching enough TV series and listening to many conspiracy theories to make me think this is not just an acquisition (Bending Spoons, aka BS, likes to lay off people and just let their acquisitions fall where they may), but a money laundering scheme. After all, they’re BS. 🤣 RIP komoot. I hate Private equity. Ruining so many companies and lives. Private equity is not where the fault lies, it’s the owner who decides to sell the company, especially if the workforce has not been considered. Bending Spoons is definitely not the type of company that has users first in mind. I have been an Evernote user for about 15 years. Over the course of the 1st 13 years we had pretty moderate and fair price increases. If I remember correctly, we started out for free, then $29.99/y and over the course of more than 10 years it would it would rise to $60.00 a year. Since Bending Spoons took over, the price more than doubled in one year. Now they want $130.00 per year. Up to this point, no improvement has made it worth this much of a price jump. Just the opposite, it is pretty annoying that the program updates almost every day. I am currently and actively looking for a replacement before my current subscription runs out. I was also one of the early adapters of Komoot since they had one of the best routing systems for cyclists finding even the smallest back-alley route in Europe. They weren’t as great in the US but still better than most. Now I will have to start looking for an alternative. This is what private equity does. Extract the maximum amount of income from the company until it dies and then throw it away. Yeah Evernote became Nevernote at that price, I migrated to Google keep, there are tons of good free solutions to notes. I’m not sure that Evernote has ever been profitable. Almost certainly not before the acquisition unless you use some meaningless Silicon Valley financial metrics. There was an article about it somewhere last year where Bending Spoons referenced some figures. As a former Evernote employee of 7 years, I can testify that it was indeed profitable for some time. It just didn’t have the growth trajectory to go IPO (and the market dried up) nor was it an attractive acquisition for larger companies for the same reason. So when the board/original investors got impatient wanting to cash out, they sold to whomever would buy, and left the rest of us in the lurch. Most of the “innovation” Bending Spoons claims was work that was well underway or very nearly completed before the acquisition… I love you Ray! You say it like it is. I am sad to see a platform that allows multi-day backpacking trips without all the issues I have with Gaia disappear. What a shame for the employees and user community who made it a great app. This loyalty has now gone and so hello Ridewithgpss. I’ve deleted so many apps from my phone after BS bought them. RIP Komodo Damn you autocorrect DC Rainmaker supporters can edit messages for up to 5 minutes after posting. Just sayin. Oh, and it supports Ray! Damn you autocarrot. Ow bloody hell. Am and have a premium because i love using Komoot that much. I used them since inception, pretty much the day they launched. Still use them.almost daily. Ugh.. Thats hard world of VC funded startups. Bad news for Komoot stuff bud rather good news for me since I’m building new route planner VeloPlanner.com They didn’t actually raise much money initially. From the sources I can find, only ~$1.5M a number of years ago in two modest rounds, that’s nothing. Just did a quick look at your site, out of curiosity, in one sentence, what’s the key reason you’re unique? Not a negative thing, just don’t see anything obvious/different compared to a sea of route planning apps. Cheers! (Actually, side note, just found a very short German article this morning that mentioned that the original VC investment already paid-out back in 2020, when a German state-backed fund stepped in, resulting in a 20x payday for the VC fund: link to wiwo.de) “Komoot has rarely raised venture capital in its history. A few months after its launch, an investment fund from the state of Brandenburg stepped in. Because the venture capital fund’s term expired in 2020, the investor had to sell his shares. The return at the time was twenty times the investment.” As I noted somewhere else, it’s incredibly difficult to track all of the funding rounds in small startups, especially non-US ones. You can pay a bunch of services (e.g. Crunchbase) to get access to some of that, but it really requires that someone on either side of that transaction actually list it. Which, doesn’t always happen in smaller companies, again, especially non-US ones. I believe in the beginning they didn’t have any VC money. But in Germany there are a lot of grants. They had the office in Potsdam only because the city gave them money. Which is fair enough of course – but also why this is so surprising. They genuinely built a sustainable business – which is so rare these days. Oh you are right. I was under the impression that they raised way more. Probably mixed it with Strava or Alltrails crazy numbers. I need to make a better job showcasing what’s unique :) VeloPlanner stands out by focusing on official, sign-posted cycling routes with interactive maps that show marked routes (ratings and photos will be soon), useful POIs like hotels and campings. Nothing useful if you want to find course for your workout but definiltly worth to check if you want to plan overnight trip. I had a quick look and as a mountain biker who often needs those POI’s, I think they are very interesting and useful. I will reach out to you soon. Dieter I’m not Kacper, but I do like his app. My sense is that it’s more bicycle touring focused. The overlay with camping / hotels, highlighting long distance routes like the EuroVelos, multiday stages, stuff like that. That’s a great-looking site mate. I’m in Canada though, I really hope we get to join the EU :D State grants instead of VC adds yet another angle: those grants come with the implied promise that the receiver tries to build a sustainable business. Selling off to some “cheapest way to keep the lights on” salvage operation the moment it stops being fun isn’t exactly what the grant was given for. I know a lot of people who work at Komoot, and would be devastated for them. Indeed. For those Komoot employees reading things, certainly interested in hearing your perspective. Additionally, if down the road in a few months when Bending Spoons does what it always does (lay everyone off), feel free to give me a poke and let me know. Simply to have some documented record of it out on the internet as (yet another) warning sign to future companies. There’s a few companies on the Bending Spoons acquisitions list that I can’t find any further details on after the acquisition, I suppose small enough that they may have laid off everyone and word never made it to the media. how to “give you a poke” then? I really hope there won’t be much changes. Ride with GPS or any subscription based service is no option for me. I’ve bought the worldmap and only need routing a few times a year. The idea that every company has to grow infinitely until it implodes is a cancer on society. These people don’t want a product to make money, they want money to make more money Well, this is definitely not the news I was hoping to read early in the morning. BendingSpoons at this point is essentially a graveyard (and considering this it’s hilarious that you mention “Evernote” and “innovation” in the same sentence), who acquires the companies for the IP and userbases, not to build a better product. Plus, it the space filled with US-based companies it was nice to see a German one. But, apparently, you can’t live off the good vibes. BendingSpoons is based in Italy, so still not an US-based company Good for outdooractive.com Oh no! I just switched to Komoot from Strava for my route planning. I guess I’m going back. Try ridewithgps – I’m nothing to do with it other than a user for the last 10years and found it good for me Strava is another company that has turned its back on users and partners. I want nothing to do with them ever again. the changes Strava are making aren’t great either. I have a feeling we’ll be paying more soon. Looking at RWGPS myself. Try Locus Map. Its another alternative for some of us nerds. Ah, that’s what it was about. From a certain angle, this even makes sense: Komoot, as a product, is very much finished. There’s nothing they could possibly add without alienating large parts of their user base. They are focused on being “for everybody”, and not just on the subset that would read DCR. No expansion into indoor training, no leaderboards (not even col collector boards), no training analysis (or plans), nothing. Dabbling in any of this would kill the brand they have established (outside of DCR readership). Replace “scale” in the founder’s statement with “maintain” that’s basically what he said. A weird euphemism for sure, but it’s hardly surprising that he wouldn’t openly say “I handed over the reigns because I don’t want to do the firing myself” I do agree there’s an element of ‘completeness’ in Komoot. In fact, I think that may be some of the challenges they’ve had in terms of attracting new (consumer) money: Many of the new features only impacted a tiny sliver of their population (e.g. 1%). That said, there continued to be odd quirks: For example, you can’t navigate purely offline on an Apple Watch. Meaning, you had to have a phone with you for offline maps with the Apple Watch. That seemed like a massive potential opportunity, given how bad offline navigation is on the Apple Watch (highly limited in region, and even more limited in features/planning). Still, if we look back at other fitness platform products that felt complete at the time, it only took a few years for them to become ‘Who?”, examples such as MapMyRide/MapMyRun/MapMyEverything, RunKeeper, etc… Sure, they might still exist – but they’re hardly in the conversation anymore. That offline Apple watch feature is something I’ve played through in my mind once. Not for Apple watch, but for PWA in restricted data roaming environments (yes, talking about Switzerland), but the challenges are similar. You’d essentially want to preload a “worm” of map details for your route. Not a use case catered for by openly available map clients, not without extensive change. (Komoot seems to run maplibre on web and Android, apparently honeymoon is over with mapbox, no idea if that’s viable on Apple watch?). Any project to add that “worm preload” would be at risk of getting its usefulness arbitrarily changed (slashed) by changes to how much storage and transfer volume watch apps are allowed to call dibs on. Not sure I’d be willing to throw much money at a problem like that. Too much risk. It’s too bad that Bending Spoons seems to ruin a lot of platforms, but the basic model seems sound. A lot of really cool products have limited potential for revenue growth but also a very limited need for manpower to keep the thing updated. Ideally they’d be keeping at least some people with a true understanding of the product and its user base. A generic, competent tech staff can probably keep a platform going for a while, but eventually their lack of market knowledge will cause the product to drift from its users needs. Complete? I am still waiting to be able to add a description to my activity ;) Yeah, it’s pretty sad. The “pay once, get everything” approach was really appealing and easy to recommend to casual users. It must be really hard to switch from a growing business to a long-term, self-sustained service in this area. “Choosing” Bended Spoon might be an indicator; they really tried, but didn’t manage to convert users to subscribers for very long. Escape Collective has a great podcast feature on Sufferfest’s challenges and journey. It seems obvious in hindsight, but the process must be really challenging. Which, is a good time to mention that I do appreciate all the DCR Supporter’s in this thread (the little yellow badges)! For those interested: link to dcrainmaker.com And we appreciate you Ray. I’m a subscriber, or was – I’m not sure if it auto resubscribed, but if it didn’t, then I’m going to resubscribe now. Hopefully there’s an option in the account to do so automatically. Let’s find out.. Aaannnd resubbed. Turns out I can click on Auto renew when signing up. Must have missed it before. This explains why Evernote free went downhill. Komoot free is also going downhill. Aquisition companies are investment platforms 1st, service offerings a distant second place. These are bad news indeed. I really hope that there won’t be mass layoffs, but given the history of this company I fear for the worst. Also, as a long-time user (with a premium account) and hundreds of planned routes, I am unsure on how to proceed. Trail view, direct integration of Google StreetView, great maps have been proven to be essential for my planning. For now I will stick to the platform, but I guess it would make sense to experiment with other platforms. Thanks for sharing this! This is really bad news – I recently listened to two (German) podcasts with two of the founders and it seems somewhat surprising to me as they are a) doing well financially and b) still have quite an ambition to grow their premium service. I guess the premium part was too little incremental benefit for most to convert them from initial map buyers to subscribers. At the same time, I think that was also one of the biggest attractions of the platform: you pay once and get a pretty decent base set of features already. In terms of staff, I think it also depends on the employment structure. It is harder to fire people in Germany than in the US due to stricter labor laws – IF they are employed by Komoot on permanent contracts. Many may be freelancers or on temporary contracts, especially if they are not based in Germany. Yeah, that’s what I am thinking.. it’s not easy to fire people in Germany and many other countries in Europe. So hopefully it won’t be as drastic as the US style where you tell people not to come to work the next day. There will, however, always be some loopholes..like saying we are moving the operations abroad and not offering relocation etc.. Generaly speaking, even in Europe, there’s plenty of loopholes they leverage, especially in cases like this. It’s very plausible that on paper, the acquisition might just be for assets (site/branding/etc), and not people. Same goes for moving it out of the company, listing ‘office/location closure’/etc… After all, some of those companies above were European companies as well. You’re overestimating German employment laws. They can lay off everybody, they just can’t fire them on the spot, but have to give advanced notice. How much in advance depends on how long a person was employed at the company. I’m a German and years back I worked at a German company that was acquired. About 90% of the staff (me in included) got their notice within days of the acquisition. It’s far easier for a company to make a profit if you lay off all your employees and move the development work to a low cost country. The play book for private equity is put 5% in and borrow the rest. Then take a massive dividend larger than your 5% initial investment if it fails after a couple of years you don’t really care as the lender is left holding the bag. Rinse and repeat. Actually that is not how PE generally works. 1. The borrowing is not 95%. More like 60-70% for stable mature business, often with real assets. Much less for tech and growing companies. In any case the equity stakes is substantial. 2. The lenders won’t let the PE pay dividends (let alone massive ones) unless the company has substantially de-levered (by paying down the debt and/or significantly growing the business and earnings). 3. Just making the initial investmentback doesn’t help the PE. Between the opportunity cost/their own efforts, the time value of money, fees, operating costs, advisors, etc the PE needs roughly double the initial investment to survive. And that is after interest payments and debt repayments. They finally managed to get a half-decent ConnectIQ-App for Garmin watches and now this… Glad I only paid once for the (discounted) worldwide Map. I was always eyeing the subscription, but life got in the way and I couldn’t afford it anymore. Now I will use mainly Outdooractive (I always switched back and forth between those two anyway). I’ll probably glance at Komoot only to get ideas for some new hiking and biking routes. Strangely though, this announcement doesn’t really surprise me. With so many Apps in the wild, something like this was bound to happen and I imagine, Komoot won’t be the last to be sold (hopefully though, other Apps won’t go the Bending Spoon path…) Now, if only Outdooractive could program a decent ConnectIQ-App… I never understood the popularity of komoot… ridewithgps is so nicht beter and free or Strava. What makes it so much worth? Best in-app route planner. Differentation between gravel, MTB, road, hiking… I bought the world map and could go practically anywhere and plan mountain hiking routes. It has community-sourced highlights to support route planning. I don’t see any of this in RWG. The RWG proposed routes are very few and practically useless (no road/gravel/MTB category split, for example). mapy.cz: routing for roadbike offroad bike hiking and even cross country skiing and waterways never liked komoot, never understood their pricing models, and some of the routes the app came up with were outright stupid Yes, I think Komoot is much better for creating routes in places you don’t already know, especially once you ride off the road. RWGPS has the more usable interface if you know where you want to go. Komoot’s advantage is all thanks to its user base though, so insisting on premium can quickly backfire. In the old days of online bike route planning (bikeroutetoaster was still around), I repeatedly purchased a one-week pass on ridewithgps, while I’m the prices of vacation planning. It wasn’t cheap, but it was *respectful*. As in we’re not trying to lure you into buying much more than you want/need. A shame it disappeared, I guess there aren’t enough sufficiently close to the threshold of pressing a “buy” button for the one-time option but not so far out of control of their financials (or simply rich beyond having to care) that they happily subscribe. And no, I don’t consider “subscribe then immediately unsubscribe” a full substitute, it’s the *attempt* that taints the relationship. PS: this was supposed to go under one of the ridewithgps posts, lucky that I at least mentioned the name once. Oh my, all this talk about the politeness of one-time purchases, I know what this leads to If you look at what they did to Evernote though. They whacked the price up many fold. I left them then. What ever happens it won’t be benefical to the end user. I just feel for the employees, like you said in the article, these people will be “one of us” and deeply into their sports and adventures and you know they’ll have had no prior notice. I am writing this as a long-term paying user of Komoot (several thousand routes created), and as a venture capitalist with 25 years of experience. Komoot had taken money from financial investors. Those investors will, of course, seek liquidity eventually. To me, it is surprising that they have had as much patience as they did. Likewise, it is not uncommon for founders to grow tired; I mean, the founders started this business 17 years ago. Therefore, it is not much of a surprise that the founders and shareholders decided to sell the business. As for Bending Spoons, my business is a paying Evernote subscriber, and I can only say that Bending Spoons taking over Evernote was a godsend. They really improved the platform, and I am finding the product to be operating much more smoothly than before and they are constantly launching new features. As for scale: I am certain the founder had been talking about commercial scale, not IT sclae. If the company had had more commercial success, they would have sold to a different type of commercial buyer (e.g. a strategic). To me, the answer to what is happening here is not black and white. I suggest giving it some time and maybe checking back in six months to see what actually is happening with the product. I do agree, though, that it’s probably bad news for non-paying users of Komoot. So, to me, the jury is out. P.S. Komoot’s history: does serve as a cautionary tale to entrepreneurs to think very carefully about whether their business and business model can deliver the hyper growth and scale required by VC backers. If you’re not entirely convinced that you can build a business (or have the ambition to) that’s worth $500 million or more, do not look to venture capitalists (VCs) to back your company, as this will create pressures that you may come to regret down the road. Today, unfortunately, seeking VC financing seems to be the default option for any type of tech-enabled business, which is regrettable given that there are many alternative options. While these alternatives may seem more challenging at first, they are likely the better choice in the long run for many businesses. Your second paragraph mirrors my experience. I’ve mentioned something similar here recently, at some point there has to be a return or at least a viable option to liquidate your shares. Based on when they were funded even a 10+1+1 year fund must reach the end of its lifetime by now. Out of curiosity, did you check if Komoot shares were available at any of the secondary marketplaces? I didn’t see anything. Doesn’t help that the GmbH partnership agreement most likely includes language that forces investors to first offer shares to the remaining shareholders if they want out. This is what we see in IT though, the owners who started out with all the good intentions get to see the cash potential and it does change. Eventually free or cheap platforms will want to monetize their offerings and we just saw it with TP and Indiegogo. I currently use Intervals.ICU and I have no doubt eventually the owner will sell that out (I pay a year subs hoping he will not). However this is not a closed space unlike say AWS or Azure and someone else will do something that will work for a while. Here in the UK I use cycle.travel for basic route planning and modify after importing into hammerhead. I find the recent changes to Komoot quite concerning. The shift to a Premium subscription for syncing routes with devices like Garmin feels like a money grab. It’s disappointing to see a platform that was once user-friendly take this direction. I hope they reconsider and provide more value to their users without additional costs. Removed app Don’t take this the wrong way, but if you were not a premium or paying user, it doesn’t matter. They killed meetup, I used to go to lots of outdoor activities events on that, then Bending Spoons (BS) bled it dry and organisers abandoned it on mass. If you stay anywhere other than a huge city, it’s now a pointless ghost town. Evernote def. got really bad and really really expensive – and I’m fairly sure some of their policies were against GDPR, such as not allowing downloading of all you data in an easy manner. I had to take up a paid subscription to get my data out, and then wait for a month to get the account deleted. Definitely put me off Bending Spoons forever. A real shame, komoot is the one Navi option that I saw help new runners/cyclists act on their ambition to go further. You didn’t need to be a geek, have a head unit, even have a smartwatch.. just komoot and your phone to start exploring. For many of those people, the gadgets, training plans, event entries and performance goals followed. As did komoot premium. a) this is why we can’t have nice things b) this is why I refuse to pay for/depend such premium services c) I hope someone is smart enough to fork/clone current komoot so we can make a pirate version at some point.. I literally work for komoot and found out about this acquisition on reddit yesterday. I concede that, from what you say, this does not look good for Komoot staff. My only other comment is as a long-time user of Evernote, which was in such a state that I was taking steps to migrate my entire database away, it has seen a transformation with an enormous number of improvements very rapidly implemented and exceptionally good communication with its users. Bending Spoons has a very aggressive acquisition strategy towards other companies: it buys, restructures, incorporates part of the functions, leaves employees at home and raises the prices of services. It is not very interested in the community or the peculiarity of the services offered Critical pieces like this mostly miss the fact that if Bending Spoons is buying you, you’re already on death’s doorstep; otherwise, someone else would have invested or acquired you. Then, what they’re mostly doing is salary arbitrage—they look for US-based tech companies with mostly expensive US-based employees and replace them in Italy—plus, of course, economies of scale in terms of running everything. So your revenue is $1 million a month and your costs are $1 million a month. They’ll raise prices to $2 million a month and cut costs to $400K per month. If you like Komoot and think it should stay alive, this is a great outcome vs the other of going belly up and those jobs gone anyways. I agree with the business model, but I call Bending Spoons on Komoot as dying and in need of an immediate takeover. This is just the owners cashing in, let’s be honest. And this is not a great outcome, neither for the employees nor the product. Look at most of the other products the BS company took over, quality went down, user base abandoned ship. Fingers crossed for Komoot. Pour one out for one of the good ones. 🫗 Komoot really was a solid option for a number of years. link to cyclingnews.com Thanks for sharing this, it does not look very promising, given the track record … Try the far superior cycle.travel for route planning / algorithm stuff. RwGPS as a plotter / library / recorder. So, where could we head to now? What are good and working alternatives to Komoot? I am also devastated that basically everyone today just cares for making even more money, not to just accept the good where there still is good… sad story! TBH, I do not know any platform that offers so many POIs and cool places to visit. Most of the other tools offer a basic map whre you can plan your route, but what I love most about Komoot is the fact that I discovered many fantastic places which I’d never seen without the recomendations by others… So much acquisition in such a short time combining with radical loss of institutional knowledge as they dumb everyone and bring it “home”. Yikes. That is a type of scaling that always leads to a mess eventually. Google for ‘bending spoons’ and ‘Immuni’. A sad moment in the Italian covid crisis. This company heavily leveraged on covid to get publicity. When you mentioned Evernote, I had a, “Whoa, hadn’t thought about them in while since I stopped using it.” Komoot was never in my shortcuts or saved tabs so for me, this is just news. But I am sorry for those adversely effected at the business/employee level. Bending Spoons kills everything it touches. The ultimate milk it and destroy it corp. I was a long-time user (and subscriber) of Evernote, but jumped out after a few months of Bending Spoons ownership. It’s fair to say that Evernote was reaching something of a crisis point before Bending Spoons got involved – in partuicular a move away from native OS apps to using Electron to provide a common cross platform codebase was highly unpopular, with a significant performance degradation and numerous features not working as well. BS (what an appropriate acronym) made matters significanty worse however, with major price increases, making the free tier pretty much useless, all predicated on that there would be improvements “Real Soon Now” – support also got significantly worse after the staff layoffs. Suffice to say that a LOT of people jumped ship at that point, and I wonder how many new users they are getting at the moment. I use Komoot essentially for Cycle Routeplanning (especially when away from my home area) so have already bought the map packs – but I fear what will happen to the service under Bending Spoons. I’ll stick with it for now, but this news alone is enough to make me think about researching other alternatives. Capitalism giveth and capitalism takes away. I’m interested to see what affect this has on Polar. Route planning there is 100% based on using Komoot, so there’s a side impact for sure. I happily use Locus with OSM (openandromaps) & brooter since many years. No online fuss, just very well implemented routing. Wow, looks like nothing good stays ,right? Was lucky enough to buy the live long maps deal eons ago,never understanding why I’d have to upgrade to monthly subscription fees. Now,as you say, may have to look for the next best thing.and yeah, we the users have empowered Komoot,both by paying and contributing this is unlikely going to have a positive outcome i fear. Didn’t realize they had 45 million users. I’d say this opens a big door wide open for RidewithGPS (best ride planning site in North America). Well some Europeans will now think twice before registering and sending amount of their data to another US company, when there are other EU based alternatives. Ben benieuwd war dit voor veranderingen gaat brengen. Elektrische fietsen met het Bosch smartsysteem (en dat zijn er nogal wat) zijn nogal geïntegreerd met Komoot. Je plant een route in Komoot en zijn direct beschikbaar in de Flowapp als je de accounts synchroniseert. Zelf kocht ik jaren geleden de wereldmap. Misschien komt er nu een klein abonnement bovenop? Dan blijf ik het gebruiken. Maar met de nadruk op klein. I wonder what changes this will bring. Electric bikes with the Bosch smart system (and there are quite a few) are quite integrated with Komoot. You plan a route in Komoot and they are immediately available in the Flowapp when you synchronize the accounts. I myself bought the world map years ago. Maybe there will be a small subscription on top of that? Then I will continue to use it. But with the emphasis on small. Ray, it is clear that you are quite unhappy with this development and you criticize the acquiring company on many aspects. The lack of communication to users, the fact that in your eyes they don’t qualify as a tech company, the way they phrased their press release, but above all the fact that they laid off employees in the past. And although you don’t phrase it directly, the article can be read as a call to action to leave the platform (in the future). Respectfully disagree with your opinion. First, it is highly unusual to communicate to consumers about changes in company ownership. The vast majority of Komoot users did not know who owned the company before the acquisition anyway. Second, this is a free-market development that likely should have happened many years ago. Why is the state of Brandenburg investing tax money in a route-planning platform to begin with? Based on limited information available, Komoot was not being run very well and has about 10x more employees than a competitor like Ride with GPS. Was it fair for RWGPS to compete with a government-backed company that likely inflated its operations unrealistically? Should even more tax money be used to guarantee these jobs going forward? Komoot’s CEO justifiably seems to acknowledge that the current path is unsustainable. P.S. I have no stake or involvement in any of these companies. “First, it is highly unusual to communicate to consumers about changes in company ownership.” Hard disagree. Every single acquisition I’ve seen in the sports tech landscape has had end-user e-mails go out at the time it’s announced. Heck, every tech related acquisition I’ve seen does the same. This isn’t 1978 anymore, consumers know the instant it’s announced. After all, Bending Spoons themselves announced it. In fact, it’s highly unusual to not communicate to end users. The purpose of these e-mails/notices is to reassure customers not to bail. Bending Spoons stuck their head in the ground, because they know what’s about to happen. It’s already happened: Layoffs began last Thursday night (more on specific numbers soon). “Why is the state of Brandenburg investing tax money in a route-planning platform to begin with?” Because most countries/governments have investment funds, often to work with startups. Done correctly, these can reap big rewards. Perhaps they did here. Usually, the amounts are small (as it was here too). The Netherlands does this too: link to nationaalgroeifonds.nl (and countless other countries: link to en.wikipedia.org) “Based on limited information available, Komoot was not being run very well and has about 10x more employees than a competitor like Ride with GPS.” People keep bringing up RideWithGPS, which is fine, but RideWithGPS isn’t anywhere near the same ballpark as Komoot is in terms of user volume, sports types, collections, etc… Per their own claims, RideWithGPS has roughly 3m users, compared to 45m for Komoot (aka 15x more users). Like any fast growing company, I’m sure Komoot could have probably used a bit of internal trimming, but everything I’m hearing from people inside the company and out, say this was about the founders cashing out. And that’s a perfectly fine thing to do, though, I’d argue they did a poor job of executing that. I agree 100% with Ray. The whole process was highly unprofessional. Also the fact that they told their staff that there will be lay offs shows that this was planned long ago. I ask myself if BS was the only company that was willing to pay the high price?! There are many other companies and some with a better track record. BS is for me the worst option. Had a hard time understanding the arguments, until it hit me that this is the perspective of disgruntled employees. Acquiring companies send out messages to consumers to rebrand or cross-sell, which is not happening here. But the communication and its distribution list is not the main issue (‘consumers know the instant it’s announced’). This is about fear of losing jobs and change resistance. About remaining loyal to the guy who built the company, had a compelling vision, hired good people, and eventually sold out to the highest bidder. So the anger is directed towards the acquiring company instead. Umm, no. It’s the consumer perspective of knowing when you get rid of most (if not all) of the staff of a company, especially an endurance-focused sports tech company, that the product soon falls apart and the prices are hiked. This isn’t rocket science. It’s a historical-backed reality. Honestly, Komoot doesn’t really offer much more than Strava. For 99% use-cases, Strava’s route builder is far superior, easier to use and way less hassle. Instead of giving your money to a faceless greedy corporation, why not just pay for Strava premium? You call Komoot a faceless corporation? But Strava who charges many times more is not? You’re trolling so hard it’s not even funny. Well, Evernote has got much better after takeover. We’ll see, I guess. Komoot komooted themselves. There’s no fiber in my body that doubts this will be the end. Thanks for giving us this fair warning. It won’t come crashing down right away but I refuse to support a big corporate piranha with a move like this. I just cancelled my premium subscription. I’ve been a komoot user since even before I got my first MTB and rode my dad’s! It’s been a wonderful 10 years and I supported komoot financially as soon as I could afford to, and I was happy to do so (which is rare for me!). I am grateful for komoot guiding me over the Alps in 2016, a DIY 24h cycling challenge, countless bikepacking trips and Orbit360s, and more recently tile hunting. Pretty much every bike trip I went on was planned and navigated with komoot on my phone. Now an era ends. I’m glad I purchased a Garmin cycling computer last summer that’ll hopefully fill in these big footsteps komoot is leaving in my sports history. So, thanks again, for a hell of a ride, komoot.

At GTC 2025 in San Jose, Calif. today (Mar. 20), Nvidia (NVDA) hosted its first ever Quantum Day, an event to explore how quantum technology could impact industries. It featured a panel discussion led by CEO Jensen Huang, alongside executives from leading quantum computing companies like Atom Computing, D-Wave, Infleqtion, QuEra, IonQ, Pasqal and Quantinuum. Huang took the stage to clarify his statement in January that practical quantum computers were still 15 to 30 years away—which caused the stock prices of several quantum computing companies to plummet. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. “I said it will take years to achieve was always because of the sheer complexity of the technology. When stocks went down, I didn’t even realize these companies were public,” said Jensen. “Today, I am here to invite every quantum company CEO to prove me wrong. This panel is a therapy session for me,” he added jokingly. But more importantly, Huang announced that Nvidia is investing in a new Boston-based research facility to accelerate quantum computing innovations. The Nvidia Accelerated Quantum Research Center (NVAQC) will focus on integrating A.I. supercomputing with quantum systems, particularly emphasizing quantum error correction—a critical hurdle in making quantum computing practical. The new center will collaborate with Harvard’s Quantum Initiative and MIT’s Engineering Quantum Systems group and quantum companies including Quantinuum, Quantum Machines and QuEra Computing. Huang first welcomed Alan Baratz, CEO of D-Wave, with a smile and a handshake. During the panel discussion, Baratz pointed to scientific applications where quantum computing is already playing a vital role. “There are problems in the world today that classical computing, or even A.I. alone, can’t solve,” said Baratz. “Think about accurate weather forecasting or drug discovery. Quantum computing can also help A.I. models become more power-efficient.” The panelists largely agreed that quantum technology has made major progress in recent months—but full-scale practicality is still in development. “We’ve achieved 99.5 percent accuracy in qubit fidelity,” said Subodh Kulkarni, CEO of Rigetti Computing. “But yes, [quantum computers] haven’t reached full practicality yet.” Qubits are fundamental units of data in quantum computers, that can exist in multiple states at once, enabling computers to process complex calculations more efficiently. For quantum computing to become truly practical and surpass the capabilities of classical computers or A.I., qubits must be scaled into the thousands, said Ben Bloom, CEO of Atom Computing. Meanwhile, Loïc Henriet, CEO of Pasqal, a Paris-based startup specializing in neutral atoms quantum computing, said his company is already set to deliver four to six fully functional quantum machines over the next few months to the French government and other clients. Unlike Microsoft and Google, which are actively developing quantum hardware, Nvidia has so far focused on software solutions. However, the chipmaker’s increasing involvement in quantum suggests it now sees the technology as a complement, not a competitor, to A.I. and classical computers. “Quantum computing will augment A.I. supercomputers to tackle some of the world’s most important problems, from drug discovery to materials development,” Huang said in a statement earlier this week. Huang closed the session with a challenge to the industry: quantum computing must prove its real-world value. He also urged realism in the industry’s expectations. “The quantum industry has to find markets where this technology delivers real impact,” he said. “We need to lower our expectations for the present and focus on how to build these systems for the greater good. It seems like next year we’re going to have some quantum demos at GTC.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience. But advertising revenue helps support our journalism.

Title: HCA Healthcare Is One Healthy Business

ByDavid Trainer ByDavid Trainer , Contributor. CHINA - 2024/06/23: In this photo illustration, the American healthcare business HCA Healthcare ... More (NYSE: HCA) logo seen displayed on a smartphone with an economic stock exchange index graph in the background. (Photo Illustration by Budrul Chukrut/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) One of the biggest losers from the Mag 7 during earnings season was Nvidia (NVDA). I called a top for NVDA back in August 2024 and am not surprised to see it fall precipitously after reporting excellent earnings. The narrative that valuation does not matter is being disproved before our very eyes – along with many other false narratives that have plagued our society. If you’ve been following my reports on the company’s stock, you would know that the recent drop in price is still not nearly enough to make the stock attractive. NVDA is not alone. Crowded trades and overvalued stocks are everywhere. Good stocks are harder and harder to find as the market was hitting new highs. Accordingly, I see opportunity in market pull backs. I see a golden era for stocks over the next couple of years as markets exorcise more false narratives (remember NFTs…haha) and embrace fundamentals again. Meanwhile, my firm’s proven-superior research continues to give an edge in finding good stocks. I work harder and smarter with my firm’s Robo-Analyst AI to scour the markets and the data to identify the stocks, ETFs and mutual funds with the best risk/reward. I previously made HCA Healthcare Inc (HCA) a Long Idea in June 2020, and have reiterated my bullish view on the stock many times. Since my original report, HCA has outperformed as a Long Idea by 137%, rising 224% while the S&P is up 87%. Even after outpacing the overall market, HCA Healthcare remains a strong business and very attractive stock. HCA Healthcare has steadily grown its top- and bottom-line since 2007. HCA Healthcare has grown revenue by 6% and net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) by 8% compounded annually since 2007. See Figure 1. The company has improved its NOPAT margin from 10.2% in 2007 to 11.9% in 2024 while increasing invested capital turns from 1.32 to 1.48 over the same time. Rising operational and capital efficiency drive return on invested capital (ROIC) from 13% in 2007 to 18% in 2024. Figure 1: HCA Healthcare’s Revenue and NOPAT Since 2007 HCA Revenue & NOPAT 2007-2024 Year-over-year (YoY) in 2024, HCA Healthcare’s: Longer-term, the company has grown its admissions (general measure of inpatient volume) YoY in 8 out of the last 10 years. HCA Healthcare’s total admissions grew from 1.8 million in 2014 to 2.2 million in 2024, or 2% compounded annually. Over the same time, the company has expanded the number of hospitals it operates from 166 to 190. See Figure 2. Figure 2: HCA Healthcare’s Number of Admissions and Hospitals: 2014 – 2024 HCA Admissions & Hospitals 2014-2024 Hospital operators, such as HCA Healthcare, benefit from consistent, and long-term, tailwinds of an aging population and rising healthcare costs. In 2022, 17% of the U.S population was 65 years or older. That percentage is expected to increase to 22% by 2040. The population of those aged 85+ is also expected to double from 2022 to 2040. As populations age, healthcare spending increases. In fact, per capita healthcare spending for those aged 65-84 is 1.6x higher than those aged 45-64 and 3.1x higher than those aged 19-44. Rising spend from an aging population drives projections for continued growth in hospital spending. According to the Peterson KFF Health System Tracker, the annual hospital spending is expected to grow: With its industry leading position and superior profitability (more on that below), HCA Healthcare is well-positioned to capitalize on steady growth in healthcare spending for years to come. Since 2018, HCA Healthcare has paid $3.8 billion (5% of market cap) in cumulative dividends and has increased its quarterly dividends from $0.35/share in February 2018 to $0.72/share in March 2025. The company’s current dividend, when annualized, provides a 0.8% yield. HCA also returns capital to shareholders through share repurchases. From 2018 through 2024, the company repurchased $28.1 billion (34% of market cap) of shares. $16.9 billion of this repurchase activity occurred from 2022-2024. In January 2025, HCA Healthcare’s board of directors authorized a new $10 billion share repurchase program. Management noted in the 4Q24 earnings call that they “anticipate completing a significant portion in 2025.” Should the company repurchase shares at its 2024 rate, it would repurchase $6.0 billion of shares in 2025, which equals 7.3% of the current market cap. When combined, the dividend and share repurchase yield could reach 8.1%. HCA generates enough free cash flow (FCF) to cover both its share repurchases and regular dividend payments. From 2018 to 2024, HCA generated $30.9 billion in FCF while paying $3.8 billion in dividends and $28.1 billion in repurchases, for total capital return of $31.9 billion. I like companies that choose to return so much capital to shareholders instead of spending it on executive bonuses or acquisitions. See Figure 3. Figure 3: HCA Healthcare’s Free Cash Flow Vs. Cash Dividends Paid: 2018 Through 2024 HCA FCF and Dividends 2018-2024 HCA Healthcare has generated positive free cash flow (FCF) in every year of my model on an annual basis. On a quarterly basis, the company has generated positive FCF in 46 of the past 52 quarters. Since 2018, HCA Healthcare generated $30.9 billion (23% of enterprise value) in FCF. See Figure 4. Figure 4: HCA Healthcare’s Cumulative FCF Since 2018 HCA Free Cash Flow 2018-2024 HCA Healthcare was the most profitable healthcare company amongst its peers when I originally wrote my Long Idea report, and it remains #1 today. It is also the largest hospital operator by revenue and number of locations. HCA Healthcare’s ROIC and invested capital turns are higher than all peers, while the company’s NOPAT margin surpasses all but one of its publicly traded competitors. Competitors in this analysis include Encompass Health (EHC), Tenet Healthcare (THC), Universal Health Services (UHS), and more, per Figure 5. Figure 5: HCA Healthcare’s Profitability Vs. Peers: Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) HCA Profitability vs Competitors Skilled labor in the healthcare industry remains in short supply. Job satisfaction for Registered Nurses (RN) and Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRN) remains low since COVID-19 due to increased levels of stress and excessive work hours. Many nurses also left the workforce after Covid. Worse yet, a significant segment of the nursing workforce is nearing retirement age, while too few new nurses are entering the workforce. According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN), nursing enrollment is not growing fast enough to meet the projected demand for RN and APRN services. Hiring enough labor continues to be a headwind for the whole healthcare industry, including HCA. However, the company is taking steps to recruit and retain quality employees. In the 4Q24 earnings call, management noted that employee engagement is “at an all-time high”, which has allowed the company to “reduce turnover and improve the capabilities of our facilities with having continuity and staffing…” Furthermore, the company continues to hire nurses from Galen College, one of the largest nursing schools in the U.S., in which HCA Healthcare acquired a majority stake in 2020. The cost of goods is rising, and the potential for newly administered tariffs to drive costs even higher remains a risk for many companies. In the 4Q24 earnings call, HCA Healthcare management noted that they’ve been working on tariff mitigation strategies for years to manage the cost of supplies needed to operate its hospitals. Importantly, management noted that in 2025, 70% of its supplies are already contracted with firm pricing, which could help mitigate any increased supply cost when and if mass tariffs are enacted. Importantly, HCA Healthcare is already priced as if tariffs and labor costs will hurt the business and result in deteriorating profitability. Management’s ability to mitigate these challenges creates increased upside in shares, as I’ll show below. Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to analyze expectations for different stock price scenarios for HCA. At its current price, HCA’s price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio is 1.0, which means the market expects its NOPAT to never grow from current levels. For context, HCA has grown its NOPAT by 8% compounded annually since 2014 and 7% compounded annually since 2007. In the first scenario, I quantify the expectations baked into the current price. If I assume: the stock is worth $319/share today – nearly equal to the current stock price. For reference, the revenue growth in this scenario would be below consensus expectations of 5.7% growth in 2025 and 5.1% growth in 2026. In this scenario, HCA’s NOPAT grows just 1% compounded annually from 2025 – 2034, which is well below historical growth rates. If I instead assume: the stock is worth $435/share today – a 36% upside to the current price. In this scenario, HCA’s NOPAT would grow 4% compounded annually from 2025 to 2034. Should the company’s NOPAT grow more in line with historical levels, the stock has even more upside.

Economists, consumers, and business leaders are antsy. Wall Street analysts are bullish. Of the 12,320 analyst ratings on S&P 500 stocks, 55.7% of them are Buy ratings, according to a recent report from FactSet Research. If that holds through the end of the month, it will represent the highest month-end percentage of Buy ratings since August 2022. Another read: The share of Buy ratings is currently above its 5-year average (55%), according to FactSet, while the shares of Hold and Sell ratings are below their 5-year averages (39.1% and 5.9%, respectively). The S&P 500 fell into a correction last week amid growing concerns about the Trump administration’s tariff policies and the potential they’ll raise prices and slow economic growth. President Trump and his deputies have fueled the market’s anxiety by repeatedly acknowledging that tariffs might cause economic pain, but that they’ll go through with them anyway. Big tech stocks have been hit particularly hard this year: The Magnificent Seven, for example, fell into a correction weeks before the S&P 500. Yet they remain among the stocks analysts are the most bullish on. Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Nvidia (NVDA) are the S&P 500’s fourth, fifth, and sixth highest-rated stocks, respectively. Ninety-five percent of the analyst ratings on Microsoft and Amazon stocks are Buys, just slightly higher than Nvidia’s share (93%). Not a single Wall Street analyst recommends selling those stocks, according to FactSet's calculations. The tech sector is the second-highest rated sector—63% of ratings are Buys—bested only by energy, with 65%. Meanwhile consumer staples, a traditionally defensive sector that tends to outperform when investors expect a recession, has the lowest share of Buy ratings (41%). That discrepancy tracks with a recent report from Bank of America suggesting investors bought up cyclical stocks and sold defensives during last week’s sell-off.

March 20, 2025 16:40 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, March 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Nvidia bets on quantum computing with new Boston research center

Nvidia (NVDA+3.33%) is partnering with quantum computing companies Quantinuum, QuEra Computing, and more to build a Boston-based research center that will integrate quantum computing with AI supercomputers. The Nvidia Accelerated Research Quantum Center, or NVAQC for short, will strive to make large-scale, useful, accelerated quantum supercomputers. “Quantum computing will augment AI supercomputers to tackle some of the world’s most important problems, from drug discovery to materials development,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a press release. Major quantum companies will provide researchers from Harvard and MIT with “unprecedented access to the technologies and expertise needed to solve the challenges of useful quantum computing,” MIT professor of electrical engineering and computer science William Oliver said in a prepared statement. The move might come as a surprise to some, considering the Nvidia chief’s comments voicing uncertainty in the near-term applicability of quantum computing mere months ago. Earlier this year, Huang made headlines and tanked quantum stocks with his assessment that useful quantum computers were at least 15 to 30 years away. But he seems to have regretted his words as he hosted a league of quantum computing executives on Thursday at the first “quantum day” as part of the company’s GPU tech conference (GTC). Huang started the panel on Thursday by apologizing for his comments, going on to say that this was “the first event in history where a company CEO invites all of the guests to explain why he was wrong.” It’s uncertain if investors are convinced, though: Quantum computing stocks IonQ (IONQ+17.41%) and Rigetti Computing (RGTI+6.50%) ended the day down more than 9% on Thursday following the panel. The center will be operational later this year, but the “plumbing for this has been in place for a while,” according to Rajeeb Hazra, CEO of Quantinuum — a founding partner of the center and a privately held company born through a merger of U.S.-based Honeywell (HON+0.76%) quantum solutions and U.K.-based Cambrige Quantum. Quantinuum’s technology has been integrated with Nvidia’s open-source quantum development platform CUDA-Q since 2022, the same system that will be used at the research center. The center will be accelerating research in two areas, according to Hazra: making quantum computers better and more error resilient, and developing specific use-cases for these computers in fields such as pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and carbon sequestration technology. While he acknowledges that there is more work to be done, Hazra is more optimistic than Huang on the timeline for quantum-computing usability. “I think Jensen’s postulate was getting useful work out is a long time away. We disagree, because we are getting useful work out today, and particularly with the combination of classical and quantum computers,” Hazra said. Quantinuum says that the company’s trapped-ion quantum computers are doing work that cannot be simulated on classical computers as of 2024. “So by running a quantum computer, you are now generating unique data you could have never had before,” he said. Hazra also expects to use the center as a “premier test bed to accelerate” generative AI systems that use quantum computing. Hazra and a slew of other tech executives, like IBM (IBM+1.63%) CEO Arvind Krishna, are bullish about the potential for discovery that comes from “turbocharging AI with quantum data.” Quantum computers work on the subatomic level and are probabilistic models. They not only are significantly faster than classical computers in some circumstances, they also have the potential to go beyond already produced knowledge, to then give artificial intelligence agents insights about nature on a subatomic level.

Micron Technology (MU) reported quarterly results that topped analysts’ estimates and issued a better-than-expected outlook, sending shares higher in extended trading Thursday. The memory chip maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner saw its fiscal second-quarter revenue jump 38% year-over-year to $8.05 billion, above the analyst consensus from Visible Alpha. Adjusted earnings of $1.78 billion, or $1.56 per share, rose from $476 million, or 42 cents per share, a year earlier, also beating projections. The gains came as data center sales tripled year-over-year, CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said, driven by strong demand for artificial intelligence. In the current quarter, Micron expects revenue of $8.6 billion to $9 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.47 to $1.67. By comparison, analysts called for revenue of $8.53 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.51 per share. Micron shares surged over 5% in extended trading Thursday following the release. They've gained 22% in 2025 through the closing bell.

March 20, 2025 16:30 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, March 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege the pharmaceutical giant misled them about the prospects of its experimental obesity drug, CagriSema. Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 2, 2022 – Dec. 19, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo Contact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action: The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug’s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1. The plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a “false impression” of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that the company’s “repeated optimistic claims” about CagriSema’s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study’s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss. The complaint highlights the company’s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared. Following this announcement, Novo Nordisk’s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint’s allegations. “We’re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial’s design and potential tolerability issues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

Title: Fewer NVIDIA AI GPUs Needed After DeepSeek, Says $600 Billion Chinese Tech Firm’s Strategy Head

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Despite mega cap US firms allocating billions of dollars in capital expenditure spending for AI GPUs, Chinese multinational technology firm Tencent's chief strategy officer James Mitchell believes that DeepSeek's AI breakthroughs demonstrate that such spending might not be needed. DeepSeek's claims of having developed its AI models similar in capabilities to some American counterparts but at a fraction of a cost appear to have permanently altered the stock market. Their biggest victim was NVIDIA's stock, which has yet to recover nearly $600 billion in losses during January's selloff. NVIDIA's GTC conference earlier this week failed to impress investors either, and the stock has remained flat despite CEO Jensen Huang pointing out multiple trillion dollar markets for his firm's products. In a recent talk, Tencent CSO James Mitchell shared that one use case his firm had for spending money on NVIDIA's AI GPUs was to train large language models or LLMs. Tencent released its Hunyuan Turbo S AI model a little over a month after DeepSeek's products gained popularity in January. The firm aimed at the Chinese startup with its products as it claimed that its model could respond to queries in less than a second. However, while competing with DeepSeek to develop the fastest AI models, Tencent also believes that the startup's training breakthroughs significantly reduce AI development costs. DeepSeek claims to have reduced AI development costs by using advanced software engineering, which allowed it to access a GPU's core functions. Typically, engineers rely on NVIDIA's CUDA software to use the chips, but the convenience comes at the expense of tighter control over the products. Commenting on capital spending for AI GPUs, Mitchell shared that "A second use of CapEx was GPUs for large language model training," This use case was important before DeepSeek shared its model development process. The Tencent CSO added that "there was a period of time last year when there was a belief that every new generation of large language model required an order of magnitude more GPUs." However, according to him, DeepSeek changed this perception, at least among Chinese firms. "That period of time ended with the breakthroughs that DeepSeek demonstrated," Mitchell said. While he didn't share how, Mitchell outlined that after the breakthroughs, "the industry and we within the industry are getting much higher productivity on a large language model training from existing GPUs without needing to add additional GPUs at the pace previously expected." Chinese firms are restricted from buying NVIDIA's latest AI GPUs, such as its Blackwell and Hopper products. The restrictions have forced them to rely on older chips or large GPU clusters to overcome the limitations of limited computing power. Tencent has claimed that its Turbo S model has beaten DeepSeek's products in math, reasoning and other AI capabilities. Industry sources believe Chinese firms are interested in working with Huawei and its Ascend AI chips as they navigate the chip blockade. Like NVIDIA, Huawei also offers its chip customers with software to control the chips. However, purportedly, DeepSeek has tested the software and found it lagging to NVIDIA's products. NVIDIA's shares, on the other hand, are yet to recover their pre-January selloff highs. The stock is down by 14% year-to-date as investors wait for more data for its demand to materialize. Mitchell's firm trades on the OTC markets and has a market cap of $601 billion. James Mitchell of Tencent quite clearly laying out the bear case for $NVDA - DeepSeek's innovations mean fewer GPUs needed vs. what Tencent previously thought, despite the explosion in AI usage. @doodlestein "There was a period of time last year when there was a belief that… pic.twitter.com/f80UXyQ8Ny — Timothy Liu (@timothyhliu5) March 20, 2025 Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Appointment as lead plaintiff is not required to partake in any recovery. CONTACT US HERE: https://securitiesclasslaw.com/securities/applovin-corporation-loss-submission-form/?id=137132&from=3 CLASS PERIOD: May 10, 2023 to February 25, 2025 ALLEGATIONS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) and reminds investors of the May 5, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding AppLovin’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the AppLovin class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/APP or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Title: All part of the plan: Apple TV+ loses $1 billion a year
URL: https://www.cultofmac.com/news/apple-tv-loses-money
Time Published: 2025-03-20T15:30:31Z

By David Snow • 8:30 am, March 20, 2025 As Apple TV+’s subscriber base continues to grow and the streamer enjoys lots of attention on Friday’s Severance season 2 finale, a new report Thursday suggests the streaming service remains a financial loser for the iPhone giant — to the tune of $1 billion in losses annually. And yet it should come as no surprise Apple TV+ bleeds money. A fat billion a year in the red sounds bad, but it’s pretty much in line with the plan for losses of up to $20 billion over a decade for the still-nascent streaming service. Launched in 2019, Apple TV+ gives subscribers access to an ever-growing catalog of exclusive TV shows and movies. Still, that catalog remains quite small relative to other streaming services. Apple consistently ranks high when it comes to quality over quantity, but that focus isn’t necessarily paying off — at least in the short term. Despite reaching about 45 million subscribers last year, Apple TV+ remains the only unprofitable service in Apple’s expanding services portfolio, according to The Information. The report indicates Apple invested more than $5 billion annually on content since the service’s 2019 launch. But subsequent pressure from CEO Tim Cook and other executives reportedly trimmed that budget by $500 million in 2024. This financial scrutiny appears to have intensified in recent years. The Information reports that Cook personally questioned several movie deals, including the spy action-comedy Argylle starring Henry Cavill and Dua Lipa. The $200 million production apparently drew Cook’s criticism for failing to attract a significant audience or generate substantial new subscribers. Apple’s streaming service continues to represent a small fraction of the U.S. streaming market, accounting for less than 1% of total viewing time. By comparison, Netflix and Amazon captured 8.2% and 3.5% of total viewing time in February, respectively. Despite these worrisome figures, Apple’s initial business plan for the streaming service anticipated losses between $15 billion and $20 billion over its first decade. Such losses are not unusual in the streaming industry, though they represent a departure from Apple’s typically disciplined fiscal approach. Services chief Eddy Cue initially sheltered Apple TV+ executives from budget scrutiny. He even rejected proposals for increased oversight of programming costs. However, following successes like CODA winning the Oscar for Best Picture, Cook reportedly began more closely monitoring the service’s financial performance starting in 2022. One area that faced particular scrutiny was the use of private jets for talent, which reportedly cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per flight. This scrutiny led Apple to seek better deals with flight-chartering companies. The report suggests Apple’s services division faces wider challenges beyond Apple TV+. Despite services being Apple’s fastest-growing and most profitable category — with gross margins exceeding 75%, compared to just under 40% for hardware — several offerings appear to struggle. For example, Apple Music reportedly saw growth stagnate recently. It remains “only marginally profitable,” with single-digit-percentage gross margins, because Apple pays more than 70% of revenue to artists and labels. Cue reportedly expressed doubts privately about the service ever reaching 100 million paying subscribers. The report suggests Apple News+, Apple Fitness+ and Apple Arcade struggle, too. Apple Arcade reportedly had only 2 million users during its first year, with roughly 25% on free trials, while News+ purportedly has monthly active users in the “low single-digit millions.” (Other reports showed fast growth for Apple’s news aggregation service.) In addition, Apple Books and Apple News+ reportedly faced layoffs in 2024 due to weak performance. The reports revealed another interesting factor: Apple One bundles might mask the performance of individual services. Many subscribers apparently choose Apple One primarily for iCloud+ storage, not for the other included services. The report suggests that without Apple One, services like Apple Arcade and Fitness+ might fall short of profitability. But despite these challenges, Apple’s astronomical corporate profits easily absorb streaming service losses. Last quarter alone, Apple reported $124 billion in revenue with $36 billion in profit, putting the annual $1 billion Apple TV+ loss in perspective. As Severance concludes its critically acclaimed second season, the show’s success might help boost subscriber numbers beyond the reported 45 million. A recent Antenna report suggested Apple TV+ added 2 million new subscribers in a single month during this period. That substantial growth could help improve the service’s financial outlook. For Apple users invested in the company’s growing services ecosystem, the report highlights the challenges of building sustainable subscription services — even for one of the world’s most valuable companies. Apple TV+ is available by subscription for $9.99 with a seven-day free trial. You can also get it via any tier of the Apple One subscription bundle. Customers who buy a new iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Mac or iPod touch can enjoy three months of Apple TV+ for free. After launching in November 2019, “Apple TV+ became the first all-original streaming service to launch around the world, and has premiered more original hits and received more award recognitions faster than any other streaming service. To date, Apple Original films, documentaries and series have been honored with 471 wins and 2,090 award nominations and counting,” the service said. Apple TV+ is home to more than 200 exclusive movies and TV shows (including breakout soccer comedy Ted Lasso). The service also offers documentaries, dramas, comedies, kids shows and more.

Apple TV+ is hemorrhaging money amid a broader stall in Apple's services, according to a new report from The Information's Wayne Ma. The paywalled report reveals that ‌Apple TV‌+ is the only Apple subscription service that is not profitable. While its subscriptions grew to around 45 million last year, it is still losing more than $1 billion annually. The company has spent more than $5 billion a year on content since the service launched in 2019, but this was reduced by $500 million in 2024 in response to a push for cutbacks from Apple CEO Tim Cook and other executives. Cook apparently raised questions last year about several movie deals with ‌Apple TV‌+ executives, including for the spy action-comedy film "Argylle." The movie stars Henry Cavill and Dua Lipa, and cost $200 million to produce. Cook reportedly complained that the movie had not found a significant audience or generated more subscribers for ‌Apple TV‌+. The report explains that "the audience for ‌Apple TV‌+ remains relatively small," constituting less than 1% of total U.S. streaming service viewing. Netflix and Amazon represented 8.2% and 3.5% of total viewing in February. Apple's initial business plan for ‌Apple TV‌+ predicted losses of between $15 billion and $20 billion over its first decade. While major losses are normal in the streaming industry, it represents a major departure for Apple which normally exercises fiscal discipline. Executives such as Eddy Cue initially shielded ‌Apple TV‌+ executives from budget scrutiny and rejected a proposal to increase oversight of programming costs. Apple did not have internal data on whether ‌Apple TV‌+ would tempt customers to buy Apple devices. Despite successes such as "CODA" winning an Oscar for best picture, Cook began closely scrutinizing ‌Apple TV‌+'s financial performance from 2022 and advocated more oversight. The use of private jet travel for stars at the cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars per flight came under particular scrutiny, and led Apple to ask executives to negotiate better deals with flight-chartering companies. Apple's overall corporate profits are so significant that it can easily absorb the losses from its streaming service, but it continues to forgo widespread appeal. Services is Apple's fastest and most profitable category, with gross margins exceeding 75%, compared to just under 40% for hardware. In its most recent fiscal year, services revenue rose 13% to more than $96 billion. However, other than iCloud+, Apple's other services are said to be in poor health. Apple Music's growth has reportedly virtually stopped and it remains "only marginally profitable." Since it pays artists and labels more than 70% of its revenues, it has a single-digit–percentage gross margin. Cue apparently told some colleagues privately that he doesn't believe the service will ever reach 100 million paying subscribers. Moreover, overall iTunes Store sales are now actively shrinking. Apple News+, Fitness+ and Apple Arcade are said to be struggling with low usage and profits. ‌Apple Arcade‌ only had two million users during its first year of operation, with roughly 25% of them on free trials. Similarly, ‌Apple News‌+ purportedly suffers with low engagement and the number of monthly active users is in the low single-digit millions. Apple Books and ‌Apple News‌+ was subject to layoffs in 2024 due to weak performance. Longtime Apple services executive Peter Stern, who oversaw platforms including ‌Apple TV‌+, abruptly departed the company in early 2023, claiming he was unable to run the streaming service in the way he needed to amid pressure to increase subscriber numbers. Apple subsequently reshuffled his former group, separating ‌Apple TV‌+, ‌Apple Music‌, and international content from News+, Fitness+, Apple Books, and ‌iCloud‌+. The report adds that most users do not sign up directly for Apple's services, instead opting for an Apple One bundle, which inflates the perceived interest in each service. Many who sign up to ‌Apple One‌ are motivated to subscribe so primarily because of ‌iCloud‌+ rather than other services. Without ‌Apple One‌, ‌Apple Arcade‌ and Apple Fitness+ would not be profitable. Get weekly top MacRumors stories in your inbox.

Title: 'Job security is dead...': Viral post exposes grim future for Big Tech employees as firms slash jobs without rehiring

Feedback Recent layoffs in the IT sector are sending shockwaves through the industry, challenging long-held beliefs about job security in top tech firms. Driven by economic uncertainties, automation, and a push for efficiency, companies are aggressively cutting costs — often at the expense of their workforce. A viral Reddit post has further fueled discussions, shedding light on the harsh realities faced by professionals across Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon. “Job security in Big Tech is a thing of the past,” the user wrote. “The days when working for top tech companies meant long-term stability are over. AI is reshaping the workforce, making several roles redundant, and mid-career professionals are particularly vulnerable. People in their late 30s and early 40s are at a crossroads—too senior for entry-level jobs but not yet in executive roles.” The post also highlighted the growing trend of companies eliminating roles permanently, with no intention of rehiring. “Amazon’s workforce reductions are more aggressive than before. While the company used to trim around 7-8% of employees annually due to performance reviews, that number has now surged into double digits. Layoffs are being carried out with ruthless efficiency, with little regard for employee well-being.” While global tech hubs like London, Silicon Valley, and Dubai face severe slowdowns, the post noted that India's job market appears slightly more stable. However, the broader outlook remains grim, with professionals around the world struggling to find employment amid an oversaturated job market. The discussion sparked widespread engagement, with users sharing their own experiences. “Finding a job has become significantly harder worldwide over the past 1.5 to 2 years,” one commenter noted. “Companies overhired after the pandemic, and now the market is flooded with job seekers. Even senior professionals struggle for months to secure employment.” AI’s role in job displacement was another major concern. “I would estimate AI makes me 30% more efficient. A better engineer could get to 100% efficiency increase. That means fewer jobs. If you have four people on a team and three become significantly more productive, you can pretty much fire the fourth,” another user wrote. Beyond AI, outsourcing is emerging as a key disruptor. “A bigger immediate threat than AI or work visas is offshoring. Companies are sending entry-level IT jobs to Latin America and India, eliminating opportunities for new graduates. Even mid-tier roles are being offshored, making it harder to climb the career ladder,” one commenter warned. Copyright©2025 Living Media India Limited.

Thyrocare founder Dr A Velumani recently took to X to highlight the emotional impact of mass layoffs, particularly in big tech companies like Amazon, Meta and Google. In his post, Mr Velumani reflected on how many individuals celebrate securing jobs with major brands, only to face unexpected job losses later. His post came in response to reports that Amazon is planning to lay off 14,000 employees to save $3.5 billion per year in costs. "Imagine how many might have celebrated for getting a campus placement with such brands. Now how many might feel depressed! It is not 10 or 20. 100 or 200. 1000 or 2000. 14000. Do not celebrate too early. Career or business - It's Marathon Race," the Thyrocare founder wrote.

Career or business - It's Marathon Race. pic.twitter.com/rrcQujB7hN Mr Velumani's post quickly caught the internet's attention. However, in a statement, Amazon clarified that the reports of mass layoff plans are "false". "This claim is false and based on inaccurate assumptions. In September 2024, we shared with employees that we set a goal to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by 15% across our organizations because it was the right time to bring us closer to customers and reinforce our culture of ownership. There are a number of ways to achieve that increase without eliminating roles. We've now reached that goal, which we believe will allow our teams to move even faster as they innovate for customers," Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser said in a statement. Meanwhile, Mr Veluman's post sparked a discussion online, with many users emphasising the importance of adaptability in today's job market. While some users said that job security is a myth, others compared career growth to a marathon rather than a sprint. "Job security is a myth. Skills, adaptability, and financial planning matter more than titles," wrote one user. "Reminds me of the funda that never get too comfortable too soon. Whether career or business, it's a marathon, not a sprint. Stay adaptable, keep growing," commented another. Also Read | Finland Is World's Happiest Country For 8th Year Straight, India Stands At... "In other way, don't give-up early, its a marathon race. Situations may change anytime," remarked a third user. "A job is a sprint, but wealth-building is a marathon. Markets, careers, and businesses have cycles-ups and downs are inevitable. Invest like you build a career-steady, patient, and focused on the long run. Survival isn't about speed; it's about endurance," explained another. "Everything has a shelf life like a product. Human beings needs to evolve from being commodity to VA product. Orgs have to save their ass when times are bad. Learn this at young age," one user said. "As Kalam sir said no need to be loyal to the company be loyal to your work," expressed another.

Stocks changed direction and rose after existing-home sales unexpectedly picked up in February to an annualized rate of 4.26 million. Weekly jobless claims didn’t increase by as much as expected, and the Philadelphia Fed index dropped by less than estimated, to 12.5 in March from 18.1 last month. The S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average all advanced. Here are some stocks to watch today: Accenture’s (ACN+0.77%) shares fell 9.8% after the consulting firm said the Trump Administration is delaying and canceling new contracts amid its push to cut government spending. Darden Restaurants’ (DRI+4.33%) stock jumped 6.9% as investors remained confident in the company’s prospects despite fiscal third-quarter numbers that missed expectations by some measures. Same-store sales growth of 0.7% fell short of the consensus estimate of 1.7%, as Olive Garden and LongHorn SteakHouse both missed expectations. FedEx (FDX+5.92%) stock gained about 0.5%. The delivery service is scheduled to report earnings after the close today. Both earnings per share and revenue are expected to increase year over year, according to a Zacks consensus estimate. Micron’s shares (MU+2.32%) gained 1.8%. The chipmaker is scheduled to report quarterly earnings after the market closes today, with analysts estimate that per-share earnings and revenue will be in the middle of the forecast range. Nike’s (NKE-0.87%) stock edged higher. The shoemaker is scheduled to publish quarterly earnings after the market closes today. Bank of America (BAC+1.44%) analysts said the results matter less than the company’s message about its product reset and evidence its new offerings are resonating with consumers. Nvidia (NVDA+3.33%) will spend hundreds of billions of dollars on chips and other electronics manufactured in the U.S. over the next four years, out of about $500 billion of total electronics procurement, CEO Jensen Huang told the FT. The stock gained 0.8%. QXO’s shares gained about 4% after the Wall Street Journal reported that the building products distributor had reached an agreement to buy Beacon Roofing Supply (BECN+0.02%) for $124.35 a share. Beacon gained 1.9% to $123.83. PDD Holdings’ ADRs gained 1.9% even after the Temu (PDD+1.44%) owner’s quarterly revenue missed expectations Tesla (TSLA+10.93%) swung between gains and losses after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick recommended investors buy stock in Elon Musk’s EV-maker, saying in a Fox News interview on Wednesday evening that “it’ll never be this cheap again.” And an analyst has some advice for Musk. Zeekr’s (ZK) stock fell about 8.1% even after the Geely Auto EV unit reported fourth-quarter revenue that exceeded expectations as vehicle deliveries doubled year-over-year.

Title: Gold Surges, Bitcoin Rallies, Stocks Down Since Trump's Electoral Win — What’s Driving the Chaos?

Pro-crypto Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election over four months ago, and since then, the period has been characterized by financial market turbulence and global uncertainties surrounding tariffs, geopolitical tensions, and ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and between Ukraine and Russia. Bitcoin (BTC) has surged over 23% since the Nov. 5 election, reaching an all-time high of over $109K at the end of January. Despite a subsequent 30% decline from its peak, it remains one of the best-performing assets. Strategy (MSTR), often considered a bitcoin proxy, has gained 34%, recovering well under the Trump administration despite previously dropping around 60% from its November highs. Ethereum's ether token (ETH) has fallen by as much as 18%, alongside disappointing action in the broader crypto market. The Valkyrie Bitcoin Mining ETF has also struggled, dropping almost 30%. Meanwhile, investors have rotated money into BTC, pushing its dominance rate higher by 2% to over 61. European equities have done well, outshining their U.S. counterparts. The German DAX index is up 20%, and the UK’s FTSE 100 has gained 6%, alongside weaker performances in the U.S. stock market, where the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are both down approximately 2%. A recent report from Bank of America highlights a record drop in U.S. stock allocations. Gold, benefiting from uncertainty, has continued to set new all-time highs, surpassing $3,030—an 11% increase. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the dollar's strength against a basket of major currencies, remains flat. However, under Trump, the dollar has weakened significantly, providing some relief to risk assets and major currencies such as the Euro and the Great British Pound. Meanwhile, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield has slightly declined to 4.2%, a key metric the administration is closely monitoring. Oil prices have plummeted by around 7% as the U.S. maintains its stance on energy dominance to reduce energy costs. Notably, some of the so-called "Magnificent 7" stocks have struggled, with NVIDIA (NVDA) down 16% and Tesla (TSLA) declining 6%. Recent losses on Wall Street and in the crypto market have ignited hopes for the "Trump put," or potential policy support. However, the administration appears willing to endure short-term pain for long-term benefits, believing that this approach will cleanse the markets of the fiscal spending excesses of the Biden era. This reset is expected to be characterized lower inflation, improved energy security, and a lower 10-year Treasury yield. "Scott Bessent’s talk of a “detox period” suggests a controlled downturn might be ahead. If that’s the case, Trump’s playbook seems clear: blame the recession on Biden, use tariffs and crypto narratives to manage costs, and push for lower interest rates to fuel tech and AI growth. Short-term pain, long-term gain—that’s the strategy," Gracy Chen, CEO of Bitget, said in an email to CoinDesk this week. "Regardless, I don't see BTC falling below 70k, possibly 73-78k which is a solid time to enter for any buyers on the fence. In the next 1-2 years, BTC at 200k isn’t as far-fetched as most would think," Chen added.

Title: Managers Have Won the War on Remote Work. Now Where Does Everybody Sit?

This article was featured in One Great Story, New York’s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly. In 2020, at the height of the COVID pandemic, the global advertising conglomerate WPP started to slash almost one-third of its New York office space. Different WPP agencies maintained separate Manhattan headquarters: Ogilvy was on 11th Avenue, Grey on lower Fifth, VML in Columbus Circle. But those buildings were all empty, and there was no telling when or if the thousands of employees who had once worked in them would return. WPP’s corporate leadership had long been trying to break down the walls between its subsidiaries by putting them together on corporate campuses, and a five-year strategic plan, developed with the consultants at McKinsey & Company and announced in late 2020, estimated it could reduce its global real-estate costs by consolidating offices. “COVID really supports the space agenda we’ve had for years,” the executive who then managed WPP’s American real estate told a New York trade publication in December 2020. “People don’t need a desk just to put pictures on it.” Remote work appeared, at first, to be that rare thing in corporate America: an efficiency measure that made both management and employees happy. Mark Read, WPP’s chief executive, says it “amazed everybody” to discover the business of advertising could be done from home. Based on preliminary evidence, both sides made permanent decisions. Some workers bought houses far outside the city, or left the New York area completely. WPP gradually moved most of its New York agencies into an airy “vertical campus” occupying 13 stories in 3 World Trade Center, which it had originally opened in 2018 as a headquarters for two of its firms. They would all have less space but more flexibility. The company’s “hybrid work” policy gave employees latitude to come in rarely, or not at all. By last year, though, Read says he came to believe that remote work was no longer working. “I just don’t believe you can do our job on the end of a video screen,” Read says. “I think people’s attention wanes, and they’re not fully present.” When he visited WPP’s offices around the world, he perceived that “those offices that were doing best were also those offices that were the busiest.” When he examined the data, he says he saw that in-person attendance appeared to correlate with employee satisfaction, as measured by internal survey results, and also financial performance. But attendance varied across the more than 100 companies that WPP owns. “The challenge was that without a mandate, it was very hard,” Read says. “People weren’t coming in, and if people weren’t coming in, people didn’t see the benefit of being together.” Read’s realization came at a moment of atmospheric change in office culture. For the first few years after the pandemic, a period of fast economic recovery and labor scarcity, workers had leverage to demand a great deal from their employers. Companies pledged to respect work-life balance, personal growth, and mental wellness, and offered perks like online meditation sessions. They also liberated workers from the bonds of the office. Some bosses embraced remote work wholeheartedly as a transformational (and economical) change; others allowed it grudgingly, issuing unenforced attendance guidelines and turning a blind eye to Zoom backgrounds. Across sectors, though, CEOs are now getting tough and reclaiming their authority by imposing mandatory return-to-office policies. At WPP, the summons came down in a January memo entitled “Winning Together,” in which Read extolled the intangible benefits of “human connection, creativity, and relationships,” before laying down the new law to his more than 100,000 employees worldwide: Come in at least four days a week, starting in April. “The initial response was quite polarizing,” Read says, with considerable understatement. Decrying the “mental and social effects” of “rigid work regimes,” a group of WPP employees started an online petition, which has collected more than 20,000 signatures. “I’ve yet to speak to a single colleague who is happy with the four-day return-to-office,” one executive told the marketing industry website the Drum. Another said: “It has left us reeling.” A similar dynamic has played out in workplaces across New York City: at banks, at media organizations, and even at formerly footloose tech firms. In January, JP Morgan and Amazon announced or implemented five-day return-to-office policies, putting an end to the remote-work experiment. The law firm Sullivan & Cromwell reportedly instructed its associates to be in the office from at least 9:30 to 5:30, Monday through Friday. Companies large and small have been quietly upping the number of days they require their employees to be in — a phenomenon known as “RTO creep.” RTO creep is reflected in a variety of statistical measures of the city’s business — and busyness. The Real Estate Board of New York’s monthly office-visitation report, which draws on mobile-device tracking data, hit a post-pandemic high last December, surpassing 80 percent of what it was in 2019 if you exclude the final holiday week. New Jersey Transit reports that its regional rail-system ridership is about 75 percent of what it was before COVID, with peak midweek trains carrying as many passengers as before. The MTA’s commuter trains report comparable ridership figures. For the past few months, office leasing activity has been as consistently strong as New York has seen since the pandemic-era commercial real-estate crash. Beyond the numbers, you can see evidence of RTO creep in the desultory line at the salad bar, the quiet that has descended on the gym on a Monday morning, and an uptick in desperate group-chat pleas for after-school carpools. Office work is not all the way back to what it once was, but the trend is moving in one direction with disorienting speed, without much regard for life or balance. The most extreme return-to-office mandates can, in some cases, leave employees with less permission to work from home than they enjoyed before the pandemic. Tonally, if the first half of the 2020s brought out the human side of human resources, the back end may belong to Elon Musk, the billionaire and return-to-office zealot who has used mandates as a blunt instrument to purge workforces, first at Twitter and now within the federal bureaucracy. C-suite executives, unleashing their inner Elons, are feeling emboldened to bark: Get back to work! And they are sending messages that they really mean it this time, letting their employees know they are keeping track of turnstile badge swipes and using other surveillance measures to track compliance. Workers can complain — and they do, loudly — but the hard truth is, they have little room to resist the reversal. Now that the job market has cooled and a recession is looming, power has shifted back to employers, who are showing who’s boss. Like all utopian experiments, work-from-anywhere was never as universally beneficial as advertised. The phenomenon was terrible for New York City, which lost tax revenue, small businesses, and tens of thousands of residents it has yet to recover. Many of the city’s top executives were quick to return to work in person after the lockdown, and were confronted each day with the sight of many empty desks. “We have a lot of space,” says Brad Karp, the chair of the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, which rents 675,000 square feet in a skyscraper on Sixth Avenue and resisted incentives to downsize. “When it was unoccupied during COVID, it was very, very jarring.” In February, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan, gave voice to the long-festering frustration of many of his peers. At a company town hall at a satellite office in Ohio, a JP Morgan IT worker asked Dimon if he might allow managers some flexibility to make exceptions to his new five-day office mandate. “I’m going to give you a complete answer,” Dimon replied. “There is no chance that I would leave that up to managers. Zero chance. The abuse that took place was extraordinary.” Then Dimon let loose a profane rant. “We also had — and you know I’m right about this one — a lot of you were on the fucking Zoom and you were doing the following: looking at your mail, sending texts to each other about what an asshole the other person is, not paying attention, not reading your stuff, and if you don’t think that slows down efficiency, creativity, creates rudeness — it does.” Dimon railed against unofficial three-day weekends — “I call a lot of people on Fridays, and there’s not a goddamn person you can get ahold of” — and said that anyone who disagreed with his new policy could find other employment. “You don’t have to work at JPMorgan,” Dimon said. “It’s a free country, you can walk with your feet. But this company is going to set our own standards and do it our own way. I’ve had it with this kind of stuff. I’ve been working seven days a goddamn week since COVID, and I come in, and — where is everybody else?” Audio of Dimon’s tirade went viral, inspiring a predictable uproar on social media and secret delight among the many bosses who shared his cynical assumptions about what their subordinates really were up to on their remote days. David Solomon, Dimon’s counterpart at Goldman Sachs, liked to tell the story of the time he ran into a group of junior bankers lunching at a Hamptons restaurant one COVID summer workday, at a time when Goldman’s offices were mostly closed for social distancing. Goldman was one of the first New York companies to summon employees back in 2021, overriding work-life balance complaints from its younger employees. Even a notoriously demanding boss like Solomon, however, has run into problems enforcing his mandate, forcing the bank to periodically circulate unfriendly reminders to its staff. It’s a common issue: A 2024 office-tenant survey by the commercial real-estate firm CBRE found that only 17 percent of organizations have a policy that they actively enforce. Inconsistency in both expectations and compliance has created an uneven state of affairs in New York. Firms in some industries, like finance and real estate, issued RTO edicts years ago, and are now more or less back to their pre-pandemic routines. (Even before Dimon’s mandate, around 70 percent of JP Morgan employees were coming in five days.) In the realm of big law, attitudes surrounding office work were slower to revert and still vary from firm to firm, in part because they were run by committees of partners, some of whom have very much enjoyed their independence. (A recent survey of more than 1,000 law firm partners conducted by the BTI Consulting Group found that 50 percent were adamantly opposed to return-to-office mandates.) Creative sectors that embraced the work-from-anywhere ethos, like software design, media, and advertising, have been slowest to junk the hybrid model. Some in this realm, like the book publisher Random House and Vox Media — this publication’s parent company — still have no uniform company-wide attendance requirement. But increasingly, they are outliers. The Atlantic told its staff in January that they would soon be required to be in the office three days a week. The magazine company Condé Nast imposed a four-day office mandate that took effect earlier this month. The Washington Post has ordered its reporters to be back in the newsroom five days a week in June. Remote workers will often say they find they get more done at home. “I don’t think personal productivity is the only metric of success in our business,” Read replies. “How many emails you answer, how many Teams calls you do — business is more than that. It is also mentoring, training, coaching, motivating, and all those things are much easier to do, and in some cases you can only do them, if you are together.” Managers are also aware that some percentage of their employees abused their lack of supervision. Some took on side gigs. Some just checked out. Ironically, autonomy also seemed to make workers more discontented. Vanessa Akhtar, a managing director at the consulting firm Kotter who specializes in workplace performance, says that many companies have been alarmed to see scores on their internal workplace engagement surveys plummet, with respondents indicating they are isolated and mistrustful of leadership. Forcing employees to return to offices, she says, “is one way to almost coerce personal engagement.” “I believe it is nearly impossible to develop a culture remotely,” says Karp, who announced a four-day-a-week policy for Paul Weiss in early March. Other big law firms — Skadden, Weil Gotshal, Davis Polk, Vinson & Elkins — have implemented similar four-day mandates, and each time it’s happened, the industry website Above the Law has published a post in which anonymous tipsters bitch about the decision. “Associates are furious, many are looking into quitting,” one source at Sullivan & Cromwell told the blog after news leaked on Reddit that the firm was now requiring junior attorneys to be in five days a week, absent extraordinary circumstances. But Karp says that, in the case of Paul Weiss, his push to return to an office was supported by a committee of the firm’s associates, who recognized that interaction with their superiors created more opportunities for mentorship and advancement. For that to occur, senior people also have to be present. “It really only works effectively if the partners are there,” Karp says. And that is why a universal mandate was necessary. In the first years after the pandemic, anecdotal evidence suggested there was a generational gap in attitudes about the necessity of the office, with younger workers taking the fullest advantage of the freedom of remote work. If anything, employers now say, that dynamic has reversed. Zoomers who had little previous experience of the office have realized it is easier to be recognized for your work if your boss recognizes your face. “It was clear that the people who weren’t coming in were not advancing,” says the managing partner of a large New York architecture firm. “As promotions came through, I think they saw that the people who were there were more successful.” Now the people who are more resistant to recalibrating their routines, in this manager’s experience, were the mid-career employees. “People with smaller kids, that’s where it’s tricky.” Bosses recognize that many of their employees — particularly ones with families — rebuilt their lives around the expectation that they would be able to continue working remotely. Those who bought houses far outside the city are now looking at long daily commutes. Those who got used to being able to schedule their work around their kids’ school days and sports practices are now having to think about finding expensive child care. In prior years, they might have been able to keep telecommuting on the down-low, hoping that management wasn’t really serious, but the newest mandates have often come accompanied by a draconian message to holdouts: Conform or quit. Akhtar says that while most employers are not trying to inspire mass attrition, à la Musk, they are aware that presenting a return-to-office ultimatum may cause some employees to consider resignation. In certain circumstances, she says, they may desire such self-selecting attrition. “I’ve had employers be honest and say, ‘Yes that is part of it,’” Akhtar told me. Forcing employees to recommit to coming to work at the office on a daily basis, she says, gives management ”an opportunity to see who is onboard.” To many people who returned to the office voluntarily years ago, such demands can seem insulting. Office workers grew accustomed to thinking that they were adults who could be trusted to choose where they could perform best on any given day. When they feel like management is treating them like children, Akhtar said, they are apt to rebel. Even in typically conformist workplaces like JPMorgan and Amazon, the new mandates have inspired Slack uprisings, murmurs of unionization and disobedience. Employees in some heavy-handed companies have devised sneaky ways to work around the system, for instance by swiping into the office, getting themselves a free coffee, and heading home. (This strategy is so common that management consultants have coined a name for it: “coffee badging.”) A couple weeks ago, on Reddit, a person posting under the username No-Refrigerator7245, who said they were a New York–based WPP remote worker, asked for feedback about whether they could stay “under the radar” and avoid consequences. (A leaked WPP internal memo advised that noncompliance could result in “disciplinary action up to and including termination.”) The question sparked a vigorous discussion about corporate surveillance in the advertising industry. A commenter who said they worked at another ad company, one of WPP’s competitors, reported there was gossip that the company pinged its employees’ VPNs three times a day to confirm their locations. Another commenter noted what happened last year at Publicis, another competitor, which reportedly fired nearly 100 employees in the U.S. for “egregious” noncompliance with its three-day office policy. “Yep, they’ll fire OP in a heartbeat,” another commenter concluded, referring to the original poster. “At this point the industry is in shambles so better to suck it up and comply than to rock the boat.” The discussion took note of WPP’s disappointing recent financial performance; its stock is down by more than 25 percent since early December. Last year, at a conference on remote work held at Stanford University, a pair of business-school researchers from the University of Pittsburgh presented a paper that drew a connection between return-to-office mandates and poor financial results, finding that in the case of many companies — UPS, Amazon, Boeing, Nike — policies were toughened immediately after stock-price crashes. The professors hypothesized the outcome was consistent with management deciding to “reassert control over employees,” blaming them as “a scapegoat for bad firm performance.” It makes intuitive sense: Bosses get stressed and they punish their lazy workers. On the other hand, those bosses might reply, bad financial performance might be a sign that flexible policies are not as productive as workers may think. That was the message that Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google, recently sent to the Silicon Valley engineers assigned to work on Gemini, its artificial-intelligence product. “I recommend being in the office at least every weekday,” Brin told his employees in a memo that was promptly leaked to the Times. A 60-hour work week, he suggested, was “the sweet spot of productivity.” Brin is probably not wrong to think that, as his search-engine business faces an existential competitive threat from AI start-ups, his coders ought to be working overtime. (Google’s thousands of employees in New York are only required to be in the office three days a week.) A similar catchup effort has been playing out at Rockstar Games. It called its employees back five days a week last year, Bloomberg reported, as it labored to finish the development of Grand Theft Auto VI, which has been hampered by footage leaks and delays. The fact that these mandates are coming down in the tech industry just shows how much the workplace conversation has shifted. You can’t blame workers for feeling whipsawed. Even Zoom now mandates that employees who live within 50 miles of one its offices come in at least two days a week. Last December, just before a round of layoffs, Condé Nast chief executive Roger Lynch announced a new four-day office mandate to his remaining employees. Staffers wondered: Working where? Inside Condé’s offices at One World Trade Center, unassigned “hot desks” were already in short supply. Lynch’s memo promised there would soon be “more information on space,” but satisfying explanations never came. In February, as the mandate loomed, the Condé Nast union staged an unusual labor action. Instead of striking, magazine staffers came to work simultaneously, to demonstrate how cramped they would be. “We wait in line for phone pods,” the union posted on X. “We hold meetings while Avicii blasts over the speakers & people eat sandwiches in the background of our Zooms.” An accompanying photo displayed a group of young workers, laptops open, sitting five to a booth in the cafeteria. While it did not exactly resemble a coal mine, the scene did foreshadow the unproductive discomfort that Condé’s clumsily implemented policy would inflict when it started in March. “It’s just a shitshow,” says one employee, who described a weeks-long competition for scarce desks. “Everyone is miffed, even the top brass.” The annoyance of overcrowding has been exacerbated by the unforgiving rigidity of the policy. In briefings given by human resources, managers were told that employees were required to be present Monday through Thursday. It didn’t count if you worked from home because your child had a fever, or you were getting a cough that might be something worse — you would have to take one of your ten allotted remote work days per year, or else call in sick. Working on a Friday also didn’t count toward your four-day requirement, which was maddening to employees who had to work in the office on Fridays, doing things like finishing up a magazine that has to go to the printer. Upper management let it be known that it was tracking badge swipes. A briefing slide titled “Non-Compliance With Policy,” illustrated with a stock photo of a pair of very serious looking models, indicated there were two options for dealing with truants: • Voluntary Resignation• Involuntary Separation To some employees, it all seemed very reminiscent of the chainsaw-wielding tactics of Musk. “Overall, we see the RTO push as a way to coerce members to quit without severance,” says Jess Lane, an organizer of the Condé Nast union protest. “This is another way of culling the herd.” The space constraints Condé Nast’s employees were feeling were the product of management’s previous cost-saving decisions. As the magazine business contracted, so had its office space inside One World Trade Center. Publications like The New Yorker and Vanity Fair were forced to downsize their space. At one point in 2021, Condé’s ownership stopped paying rent to its landlord in an unsuccessful attempt to spring itself from its decades-long lease in the building. The two sides settled their dispute, but Conde has continued to attempt to unload space on the sublease market. At least five of its floors that it leases are currently listed as available to sublet, according to the CoStar Group’s commercial real-estate data. Lane says that in response to the overcrowding issue, Condé Nast recently moved some workers to the building’s 27th floor, which was one of the spaces it had been trying to sublease. Many companies took an opportunistic approach to their office space during the pandemic, reducing their square footage when their leases came up for renegotiation or subleasing unused floors. Now, that tide of vacancy is starting to roll back in. According to figures from CBRE, since the beginning of last year, around 3 million square feet has been taken off the sublease market by companies that say they plan to reoccupy it. Shifting to hybrid or all-remote work policies not only saved on rent, it also allowed companies to quickly expand their workforces, because they were no longer limited by geography when it came to hiring talent. It has turned out, though, that dispersal creates its own limits. Altruist, a financial technology company founded in 2018, used a work-from-home policy to quickly staff up by hiring people all over the country, only to decide as it grew more established that it needed offices for managerial and regulatory reasons. “All we knew is that the longer we waited, the more difficult this would be,” says Katherine Starros, the company’s head of human resources. In 2023, after health concerns related to COVID relaxed, it told its employees they would have to work in an office in Dallas or Los Angeles, and gave them around six months to relocate within commuting distance, if necessary. Starros said 13 percent of its 250 employees quit, a little less than the opt-out rate the company expected. Altruist has since filled all those positions and more. It is expanding its two offices and has opened an outpost in San Francisco. A New York location is also in the works. “We are really excited about our first ever real internship program this summer,” Starros said. In some cases, corporate decisions made based on the presumption of continuing low office attendance have had expensive consequences. During the pandemic, some New York office tenants decided to make an upgrade in quality, vacating their old buildings when their leases expired and taking smaller but pricier office space in new construction in developments like One Vanderbilt or at Hudson Yards. “Some companies that did that transaction — less space, higher rent — thought they could shimmy down,” says Peter Turchin, a commercial broker at the firm CBRE. “And then they ended up needing more space.” As workers return, companies have had to squeeze in or rent more space. Turchin said that happened to IBM, which in 2022 decided to consolidate its multiple New York office locations in a new building at One Madison Avenue. In January, just a few months after it moved into the completed building, it signed a lease for an additional 93,000 square feet. (An IBM spokesperson said the recent lease decision was “in no way a result of not having enough space for employees currently.”) Last year, Amazon announced it would soon begin requiring full-time attendance from all of its 350,000 corporate employees. “If it’s not for you, then that’s okay. You can go and find another company if you want to,” an unsympathetic Amazon executive said at an industry conference as the company rolled out the corporate decision. Then the unforgiving policy ran up against the laws of physics. When it took effect nationwide, in January, it turned out there were not enough desks, chairs, and parking spaces to go around, creating chaos and embarrassing headlines for corporate America’s supposed logistics experts. In New York, Amazon has been rushing to find additional office space beyond what it has inside its new hub in the Lord & Taylor building, signing leases in three other buildings in the last few months. One of those new Amazon leases, completed just this month, is at 237 Park Avenue, where it is reportedly taking over a 193,000 square foot space that was put on the sublease market in 2022. The former occupant of the space was a subsidiary of WPP, which was relocated into the conglomerate’s headquarters at 3 World Trade Center. When WPP opened its World Trade Center campus in 2018, around 4,000 of its employees worked in the building. After WPP’s consolidation, the office now has a headcount of around 6,500 on paper. Although WPP has leased some additional space over the years, a former WPP employee told me the World Trade Center offices were already short on desks, conference rooms, and anyplace to make a private phone call, and had no idea how the company was possibly going to fit in everyone who is supposed to work there now that Read has told them all to come back 4 days a week. The CEO conceded he wasn’t sure himself. “If everybody follows the rules on day one, we’ll probably have some challenges,” Read told me. Although the current World Trade Center office capacity is considerably smaller than its overall headcount, in reality some percentage of employees will still not use the space. Some are assigned to be embedded with their clients. Some remote workers have been grandfathered in or have been able to negotiate waivers. Still, the office will certainly be more crowded. A WPP spokesman says that the company is not currently looking to sign new leases, but it has directed its individual companies to reassess and if necessary reconfigure their interior spaces. Five years after drawing up its strategic plan, WPP has come to the realization that desks are, in fact, essential to work. Read anticipates WPP will be stronger once its office returns to normal. “When we get through to the other side, it’s going to be better for our culture,” he says. “Our ideas will be better. And actually, our workforce, our people, will be happier.” Now they all just need a place to sit.

Title: Will the "big six" become the "big three"?

Gideon Spanier explains the likely impact of the impending Omnicom takeover of Interpublic. by Gideon Spanier March 20 2025 Omnicom’s takeover of Interpublic passed an “important milestone” in the words of John Wren, the chief executive of Omnicom, when shareholders of both companies voted to approve the deal at simultaneous meetings just after 9am New York time on Tuesday. The votes passed easily, with more than 90% in favor, although the takeover still requires regulatory approvals around the world to complete, likely in the second half of 2025. Now, as momentum appears to be building, the ad industry’s thoughts are turning to the impact of the merger that will create the world’s biggest agency group — with more than $25bn of global revenues, including nearly $15bn or 57% coming from the US. This deal promises a long-awaited consolidation among the big six groups, which will now become a big five, and, arguably, a big three as Omnicom, Publicis and WPP open up a gap on Dentsu and Havas, especially in the US, in terms of media-buying scale. It is a landmark moment for Interpublic, in particular. The first advertising agency holding company of the modern era launched in 1930 as McCann-Erickson, becoming Interpublic in 1961, and can trace its roots back to the founding of Erickson in 1902 and McCann in 1911. Now it is one step closer to being swallowed by Omnicom, founded in 1986. Yet there was little sense of occasion at this week’s shareholder meetings. Both were virtual events, not in-person. There was only an audio feed, not even video. In theory, shareholders could have quizzed the directors about the deal but when Krakowsky opened up the floor for questions at IPG, there was no response. “There appear to be no questions,” he said, allowing him to move swiftly to the vote. Similarly, Wren faced no questions at Omnicom’s meeting. Both events ended within ten minutes. If shareholders have doubts about the all-stock deal — Omnicom offered a 21% premium, valuing IPG at $13.3bn, in December but Omnicom’s own share price has fallen more than 20% since then, and IPG is now forecasting revenue decline this year — they chose not to air them in a public setting. The reality is that shareholder approval looked to be a fait accompli after two influential advisory groups, ISS and Glass Lewis, recommended it. The Omnicom-IPG deal is set to reshape the agency sector globally, and the US will be key. “If you think about where perceptions are formed inside large enterprises, the US has got more important, not less important, in the last five or ten years,” Rob Norman, the former chief executive of Group M North America, said. However, there is also a sense of déjà vu and a changed landscape, after the excitement of the Omnicom-Publicis $35bn mega-merger that failed to complete more than a decade ago. “There is something about this deal that feels less seismic than if it had happened 10 or 15 years ago,” Norman said. “I wonder if that speaks to a macro-diminishment of the sector as the concentration of power on the sell side with Google, Meta and Amazon has changed the power dynamic.” While Omnicom has talked about the benefits of scale from the takeover, it has also said it wants to make $750m in annual “synergies”, which is likely to mean thousands of job losses. Regulatory approvalOmnicom needs to win regulatory approval in as many as 19 jurisdictions, including from the US, UK and European Union, according to the latest update from the company. The deal has already won consent in Brazil, Colombia and Saudi Arabia.Winning the backing of the Federal Trade Commission, now led by Andrew Ferguson, a Donald Trump appointee, in the US is the priority and the regulator made a second request for information last week. “A second request can be noteworthy because most organizations make adjustments to their submission in order to address the additional questions or clarify their original submission,” Jay Pattisall, vice-president and principal analyst at Forrester and a long-time agency expert, said, although he does not see it as a likely obstacle to approval. Another industry source warned it is hard to be sure about the “pro-business” intentions of the new Trump administration, which has been shaking up the FTC, even in recent days. However, the FTC and regulators in all other key markets, except China, approved the planned Omnicom-Publicis tie-up in 2014, before the two companies walked away.While Omnicom and IPG say planning for their integration is “underway,” they “continue to operate as separate companies” as they await regulatory approval. The mood music internally suggests significant integration is likely to be several months away. Media scaleOmnicom and IPG have talked about the importance of leveraging scale in media-buying — particularly in principal-based media, which involves buying inventory in bulk to get better deals — and combining their data assets, including Omni, Flywheel and Acxiom. IPG admitted it was struggling to compete in media after losing big accounts, including Amazon, last year. In terms of media billings, the enlarged Omnicom Media Group would have 36.9% market share among the big five in the US, when it adds its existing 21.7% to IPG Mediabrands’ 15.2%, based on COMvergence estimates for media spend in 2024.

(Figures have been approximated in the chart below.)Globally, OMG would have 32% share by adding its 20% to IPG’s 12%.

So the significance of the merger is shifting from the big six to the big five.”Greg Paull, senior principal at R3 Worldwide, a pitch consultancy, said there may be a shift towards a “big three” for large media agency reviews but noted there are many other agency services apart from media where scale matters less. Clients still put a premium on “great, creative ideas” and “I think we will see a bifurcation between media and creative,” Paull suggested.Last year’s General Motors creative review was a “wake-up call” as the US automotive giant looked beyond incumbent agencies from IPG and Publicis in favor of smaller players such as Stagwell’s 72andSunny and Anomaly and S4 Capital’s Monks, he said. Winning over clients and staffOmnicom and IPG’s biggest concerns during the current limbo period are to win and retain clients and reassure staff. Jerry Buhlmann, the former chief executive of Dentsu Aegis Group, who led the sale of Aegis to Dentsu and the subsequent integration in 2013, said: “You’ve got to be very clear about what the vision is for the new business, the combination, and why is that relevant for everyone involved and why is it better? You have to position it as different and better.”Buhlmann, who is now chair of independent agencies Dept and Croud, added it was vital to “massively over-communicate internally” during a merger process. “The senior leadership has to be unbelievably visible to everybody in that organisation. Communicate even if there isn’t anything to communicate. Communicate energy, communicate belief.” He said the message during the wait for regulatory approval should be: “Don’t worry, we’re dealing with it, this will get approved, we do have a great future. Until we can execute the plan, you’re operating individually, everyone call up your clients, tell them you love them and over-service them.”Wren and Krakowsky have co-hosted in-person meetings with staff and pitch consultants in New York and London since the start of the year. The companies were “positive and transparent,” according to Paull, but he warned clients still have concerns. “Clients are a combination of frustrated and interested at the same time,” Paull said. “This [deal] is moving like molasses for some of them. We’ve been in a number of holdco reviews recently where we’ve been told by the holdcos to treat them separately but there’s still a mindset from the clients of, ‘If this is likely to happen, what’s going to be the impact for them?’”Pattisall said client relations were key: “The two areas to watch during integration are conflicts between clients or industries and distractions. The former is known and each company is in discussion with their clients to resolve conflict concerns. The latter is a more significant issue in that a sluggish integration could distract from client delivery.” Omnicom and IPG have been cutting US jobs ahead of mergerOmnicom and IPG employed about 74,900 and 53,300 respectively, or just over 128,000 in total globally, at the end of 2024. Their combined headcount dropped by about 5,000 during last year, including the impact of acquisitions and disposals. Their US employee base was especially hard hit as both companies looked for savings. Omnicom’s staff fell by 2,800 to 21,900 in its home market, partly as it moved roles to lower-cost centers in Latin America. IPG’s domestic headcount dropped by 2,700 to 21,100, partly because of disposals, including Huge, and client losses such as Pfizer.The companies have talked about the combined group having only “over 100,000 practitioners.” Wren and Krakowsky have stressed they are looking to protect “revenue-generating” and “client-facing” roles but they have also signaled they expect to “offshore” more jobs to cheaper locations.Buhlmann warned against what he called a “drawn-out, slow rationalization” and said it was important to move “quickly” to make major changes to ensure a successful integration.Norman added the merger would allow the new Omnicom to reshape the business and use its greater scale to attract talent as well as invest in technology. “They’ve got the opportunity to downsize and upskill,” he said, speculating that the company might look to find closer to $1bn in efficiencies and then invest $250m in new talent and recruiting from rivals. Importance of executionUltimately, the success of the Omnicom-IPG deal will depend on execution. Wren, the CEO since 1997, previously told Campaign at the time of the deal announcement in December that he expects to stay in the role for three years — with Krakowksy, who has been CEO of IPG since 2021, moving to be co-chief operating officer, alongside Omnicom’s COO, Daryl Simm.Buhlmann said: “They’re in a perfect position to define a strategy that can change the market.” But relying on scale alone is not enough. “If you don’t do anything, you remain a super-tanker, and if you tie two super-tankers together, you don’t get a speedboat.”Omnicom will need to leverage its new scale — whether in talent, media, creative, technology or artificial intelligence. “If you have that scale of resource, people and media and you work out how you leverage it to your competitive advantage, you have a real proposition you can take to market,” Buhlmann said, adding rivals will also be looking to exploit the upheaval.“Disruption in the advertising sector, largely through technology, has always enabled new players to grow, innovative businesses to take market share and independents to penetrate the holdcos, who are often slower and suffer from inertia. Disruption is a big leveller. ”Perhaps the greatest challenge for both Omnicom and the wider agency sector is to find more stable and recurring sources of revenue and rely less on classic advertising agency services — an area where Publicis has been leading the market, especially in the US, where it generates close to 60% of its revenues.“The marketing agency industry is mature and primarily follows a service model for commercial relationships,” Pattisall said. “The prevalence of technology and investments in agency tech creates the opportunity to craft a new commercial model that includes software as a service [SaaS] and other services. This shift will be slow but an important one for an industry mired in single-digit growth.”The real hard work for Omnicom may only begin after the takeover of IPG completes. Regulatory approval Omnicom needs to win regulatory approval in as many as 19 jurisdictions, including from the US, UK and European Union, according to the latest update from the company. The deal has already won consent in Brazil, Colombia and Saudi Arabia. Winning the backing of the Federal Trade Commission, now led by Andrew Ferguson, a Donald Trump appointee, in the US is the priority and the regulator made a second request for information last week. “A second request can be noteworthy because most organizations make adjustments to their submission in order to address the additional questions or clarify their original submission,” Jay Pattisall, vice-president and principal analyst at Forrester and a long-time agency expert, said, although he does not see it as a likely obstacle to approval. Another industry source warned it is hard to be sure about the “pro-business” intentions of the new Trump administration, which has been shaking up the FTC, even in recent days. However, the FTC and regulators in all other key markets, except China, approved the planned Omnicom-Publicis tie-up in 2014, before the two companies walked away. While Omnicom and IPG say planning for their integration is “underway,” they “continue to operate as separate companies” as they await regulatory approval. The mood music internally suggests significant integration is likely to be several months away. Media scaleOmnicom and IPG have talked about the importance of leveraging scale in media-buying — particularly in principal-based media, which involves buying inventory in bulk to get better deals — and combining their data assets, including Omni, Flywheel and Acxiom. IPG admitted it was struggling to compete in media after losing big accounts, including Amazon, last year. In terms of media billings, the enlarged Omnicom Media Group would have 36.9% market share among the big five in the US, when it adds its existing 21.7% to IPG Mediabrands’ 15.2%, based on COMvergence estimates for media spend in 2024. That would put OMG well ahead of Publicis Media on 30.6% and WPP’s Group M on 18.5% — with Dentsu Media on 11.3% and Havas Media on 2.7%.

Buhlmann said: “They’re in a perfect position to define a strategy that can change the market.” But relying on scale alone is not enough. “If you don’t do anything, you remain a super-tanker, and if you tie two super-tankers together, you don’t get a speedboat.” Omnicom will need to leverage its new scale — whether in talent, media, creative, technology or artificial intelligence. “If you have that scale of resource, people and media and you work out how you leverage it to your competitive advantage, you have a real proposition you can take to market,” Buhlmann said, adding rivals will also be looking to exploit the upheaval. “Disruption in the advertising sector, largely through technology, has always enabled new players to grow, innovative businesses to take market share and independents to penetrate the holdcos, who are often slower and suffer from inertia. Disruption is a big leveller. ” Perhaps the greatest challenge for both Omnicom and the wider agency sector is to find more stable and recurring sources of revenue and rely less on classic advertising agency services — an area where Publicis has been leading the market, especially in the US, where it generates close to 60% of its revenues. “The marketing agency industry is mature and primarily follows a service model for commercial relationships,” Pattisall said. “The prevalence of technology and investments in agency tech creates the opportunity to craft a new commercial model that includes software as a service [SaaS] and other services. This shift will be slow but an important one for an industry mired in single-digit growth.” The real hard work for Omnicom may only begin after the takeover of IPG completes. US-based Omnicom still requires consent of regulators in 17 markets to acquire IPG. Analysis of Nielsen billings reveals how creative and media agencies fared in 2024, with more than half in both sectors reporting increases.

March 19, 2025 21:14 ET | Source: PRIMEBIOME® PRIMEBIOME® BOSTON, March 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In a world obsessed with gut health and skincare, Prime Biome has rapidly become one of the most talked-about supplements of 2025. Touted as a gut-skin breakthrough, this probiotic formula claims to do what no traditional skincare or digestive aid can—transform your skin and digestion from the inside out. But does it really work, or is it just another overhyped supplement riding the wellness trend? With over 50,000+ users already trying Prime Biome (source), social media platforms, Reddit discussions, and health forums are buzzing with before-and-after transformations. Some users swear by its ability to clear up stubborn breakouts, reduce bloating, and restore digestive harmony, while others remain skeptical, questioning whether it's backed by real science or just clever marketing. So, what makes Prime Biome different from every other probiotic on the market? Is it the powerful blend of gut-friendly bacteria, plant-based compounds, and antioxidant-rich ingredients? Or is it the dermatologist-approved formulation that sets it apart from traditional supplements? More importantly—should you believe the hype? In this investigative report, we’ll dive deep into Prime Biome reviews, real user testimonials, and scientific explanations to uncover the truth. If you’re wondering whether this supplement can truly transform your gut and skin health, keep reading. >> Click here to see why thousands are switching to Prime Biome!

But what exactly is this formula, and why has it become the hottest gut-skin supplement of 2025? At its core, Prime Biome is a clinically designed probiotic gummy that supports skin cell renewal and gut microbiome balance. Unlike traditional probiotics or collagen supplements that only target one aspect of health, Prime Biome works through the gut-skin axis—a scientifically recognized connection between gut bacteria and skin health. This two-in-one approach is what’s making people rush to order it before it sells out from the official website. What Makes Prime Biome Special? As demand for Prime Biome skyrockets, stocks are running low. If you want to experience clearer skin, improved digestion, and better gut health, now’s the time to act. >> Don’t wait – Order Prime Biome today before it sells out! Prime Biome Reviews – What Real Customers Are Saying (52,437+ Success Stories) With tens of thousands of users sharing their transformations, Prime Biome has taken the wellness industry by storm. From gut relief to glowing skin, customers are raving about their results. But what’s causing this massive trend? The answer lies in the real, life-changing transformations that users are experiencing. Unlike cheap probiotics or collagen powders that promise results but fail to deliver, Prime Biome users are seeing noticeable improvements in digestion, skin texture, and bloating within weeks. So, what do real people have to say about Prime Biome? Below, we’ve gathered six in-depth testimonials from users across the U.S. who have experienced real, visible changes. 1. Olivia S., 32 – Los Angeles, CA "For years, I struggled with breakouts and gut issues. No probiotic ever helped me the way Prime Biome has. Within three weeks, my digestion was noticeably better—no more bloating or stomach cramps. But the biggest surprise? My skin! It started clearing up, and my complexion is now smoother and brighter. I will never go a day without Prime Biome again." 2. Daniel R., 45 – Austin, TX "As someone in my 40s, I noticed my skin aging faster and constantly bloating after meals. I read about Prime Biome and decided to give it a shot. Within weeks, I felt lighter, more energized, and—shockingly—my skin actually looked better. My wife even commented that my face looked ‘refreshed.’" 3. Jessica T., 27 – Miami, FL "I was tired of using expensive skincare products that never worked. I saw a friend raving about Prime Biome on Instagram and took the plunge. BEST DECISION EVER. My skin is no longer irritated, and my gut feels incredible. I don’t wake up with bloating anymore, and my digestion is finally normal." 4. Mark L., 52 – New York, NY "I tried everything—digestive enzymes, probiotics, detox teas. Nothing gave me lasting results until Prime Biome. My stomach problems have disappeared, my skin looks healthier, and I feel like I’ve rewound the clock 10 years." 5. Emily C., 41 – Denver, CO "Within two weeks of taking Prime Biome, my stubborn acne completely disappeared. I was shocked. I never thought a probiotic could affect my skin, but now I understand the gut-skin connection. This stuff is magic!" 6. Noah W., 37 – Seattle, WA "I originally bought Prime Biome for gut health, but the bonus was my skin looking the best it has in YEARS. My digestion is perfect, no more bloating, and my wife says my skin has a new glow. It’s now a non-negotiable part of my routine." These aren’t just random success stories—they’re proof that Prime Biome is changing lives. If you’ve been struggling with gut issues, skin problems, or both, this probiotic formula might be the breakthrough you need. How Does Prime Biome Work? The Science Behind Its Powerful Effects The secret behind Prime Biome’s success isn’t just about probiotics—it’s about the gut-skin axis and how a balanced microbiome plays a direct role in skin cell regeneration, digestion, and inflammation control. This supplement is formulated to target the underlying causes of digestive discomfort, poor nutrient absorption, and premature skin aging, rather than just masking symptoms like conventional probiotics or skincare products. By combining clinically-backed probiotic strains with powerful botanicals, Prime Biome delivers a multi-faceted approach to gut and skin health, ensuring that your body isn’t just looking better but actually functioning optimally from the inside out. Here’s a deep dive into how this supplement works at a cellular level. 1. Rebuilding the Gut Microbiome for Lasting Balance At the heart of Prime Biome’s effectiveness is its ability to restore and maintain a thriving gut microbiome. Your gut is home to trillions of bacteria, and when the balance is thrown off—due to diet, stress, medications, or environmental toxins—it leads to digestive distress, chronic inflammation, and even skin problems like acne, dullness, and premature aging. One of the key probiotic strains in Prime Biome, Bacillus Coagulans, has been clinically studied for its ability to survive stomach acid and reach the intestines alive. Unlike traditional probiotics, which often get destroyed by the harsh stomach environment, Bacillus Coagulans form protective spores, allowing them to colonize the gut and repopulate good bacteria effectively. Study Spotlight:A 2022 study published in the Journal of Gastrointestinal Microbiology found that Bacillus Coagulans supplementation led to a 48% reduction in bloating, a 39% improvement in digestion, and a 41% decrease in skin inflammation within eight weeks of use. >>Warning: Avoid Fake Sellers! Get the Authentic Product Only from the Official Website – 75% Off Here. By feeding the gut with beneficial bacteria, Prime Biome helps to: ✔ Reduce bloating and indigestion by improving food breakdown and absorption. ✔ Eliminate toxins that contribute to inflammation and skin irritation. ✔ Balance gut bacteria, ensuring a stronger immune system and a healthier skin barrier. 2. Enhancing Skin Cell Turnover for a Youthful Glow The gut-skin connection is one of the most overlooked factors in skincare. Most people rely on topical creams and serums, but the truth is, healthy skin starts from within. Prime Biome’s formula is designed to accelerate skin cell renewal by supporting collagen production and reducing oxidative stress, leading to firmer, clearer, and more resilient skin. One of the standout ingredients is Babchi (Bakuchiol)—a plant-derived compound often called “Nature’s Retinol” for its ability to stimulate collagen, reduce hyperpigmentation, and smooth out fine lines. Unlike traditional retinol, Babchi doesn’t cause irritation, dryness, or sensitivity—making it a perfect ingredient for gentle but effective skin renewal. Study Spotlight:A 2023 clinical trial conducted by the American Dermatological Society found that Babchi extract increased skin elasticity by 36% and improved hydration levels by 47% after six weeks of consistent use. By stimulating collagen and cellular repair, Prime Biome helps: ✔ Reduce fine lines and wrinkles by promoting faster cell turnover. ✔ Even out skin tone by minimizing hyperpigmentation and redness. ✔ Strengthen the skin barrier, protecting against environmental damage and premature aging. >>Big Savings Alert: Buy Direct & Save! Get 75% Off + $300 Discount from the Official Site. 3. Reducing Inflammation for Gut and Skin Harmony Chronic inflammation is one of the biggest contributors to digestive distress, acne breakouts, and premature aging. When your gut microbiome is out of balance, it triggers systemic inflammation, leading to poor digestion, increased breakouts, and even conditions like rosacea and eczema. To combat this, Prime Biome includes Lemon Balm and Organic Ceylon Ginger, two powerhouse anti-inflammatory ingredients known for their ability to soothe gut irritation, reduce oxidative stress, and calm the nervous system. Study Spotlight:A 2024 meta-analysis published in the International Journal of Inflammatory Diseases found that Lemon Balm extract reduced systemic inflammation markers by 42% in individuals with gut dysbiosis and inflammatory skin conditions. By targeting the root causes of inflammation, Prime Biome: ✔ Soothes gut lining irritation, preventing bloating and acid reflux. ✔ Reduces skin redness and sensitivity, calming acne and eczema flare-ups. ✔ Lowers oxidative stress, protecting cells from damage that leads to premature aging. 4. Optimizing Nutrient Absorption for Full-Body Benefits Even if you’re eating a healthy diet, your body might not be absorbing the full spectrum of nutrients due to gut imbalances. A damaged gut lining reduces nutrient uptake, meaning your body isn’t getting the vitamins and minerals it needs for energy, skin repair, and overall wellness. This is why Prime Biome includes Slippery Elm Bark and Inulin—two prebiotic-rich ingredients that strengthen gut lining integrity and optimize nutrient absorption. These plant-based compounds feed the beneficial bacteria in your gut, ensuring that they flourish and support better digestion, increased hydration, and a more resilient immune system. Study Spotlight: A 2025 study published in the Journal of Nutritional Sciences reported that participants supplementing with Inulin and Slippery Elm Bark showed a 58% increase in nutrient absorption and a 33% improvement in digestive efficiency. By improving nutrient bioavailability, Prime Biome helps to: ✔ Enhance energy levels, reducing brain fog and chronic fatigue. ✔ Boost skin hydration, making your complexion more radiant and plump. ✔ Support immunity, giving your body the strength to fight off inflammation and toxins. >>MUST-SEE: Shocking New Report Reveals the Truth About Prime Biome – Does It Work? Prime Biome Pricing – Does It Offer Real Value for a Science-Based Formula? When it comes to investing in health and wellness, consumers are increasingly skeptical of overpriced supplements that promise miracles but deliver little.

Understanding the Prime Biome Pricing Tiers Prime Biome is available in three purchasing options, catering to different budgets and commitment levels. A single bottle costs $69, which provides a 30-day supply. Those looking for a longer commitment can opt for the three-bottle bundle at $177 ($59 per bottle), ensuring a 90-day supply. However, the best value lies in the six-bottle package, which is available for $294 ($49 per bottle). This package also includes free shipping and two exclusive bonus eBooks that provide additional guidance on skin and gut health. When comparing Prime Biome to other probiotic and skin health supplements on the market, the pricing is not only competitive but also reflects the high-quality ingredients and cutting-edge formulation.

Final Verdict – Is Prime Biome Worth the Price? Considering its high-quality probiotic strains, potent plant extracts, and scientifically-backed formulation, Prime Biome delivers real value at a price that reflects its superior ingredients and effectiveness. While cheaper probiotic gummies exist, most lack clinical research, proper dosing, or high-quality sourcing—resulting in weak or ineffective formulas. With bulk discounts, bonus materials, and a 60-day money-back guarantee, Prime Biome is a risk-free investment for those who truly care about their gut health, digestion, and youthful skin. Rather than wasting money on ineffective solutions, consumers can secure real, long-term benefits by choosing a formula that actually works. Why Experts Are Raving About Prime Biome Unlike traditional probiotics that only focus on digestion, Prime Biome takes a multi-layered approach—restoring gut health, optimizing skin function, and reducing inflammation all at once. By incorporating clinically validated probiotics, skin-supporting botanicals, and inflammation-fighting compounds, this formula is proving to be more than just a trend—it’s a science-backed solution for long-term gut and skin wellness. If you’re tired of dealing with digestive discomfort, stubborn skin issues, or lack of energy, Prime Biome could be the missing link to your health transformation. >> Find out why experts are raving about Prime Biome – Learn more here. Prime Biome Ingredients – What’s Inside and Why It Works The carefully selected ingredients in Prime Biome make it one of the most powerful gut-skin health supplements available today. Each component is backed by scientific research, ensuring that every gummy delivers maximum benefits for digestion, microbiome balance, and skin renewal. Unlike other probiotic supplements that simply introduce bacteria, Prime Biome goes further by ensuring that those bacteria thrive, repairing the gut barrier, reducing inflammation, and promoting healthy skin cell turnover. Bacillus Coagulans is a unique spore-forming probiotic that survives the acidic environment of the stomach. Many probiotics die before they reach the intestines, but Bacillus Coagulans remains stable and activates exactly where it's needed. This probiotic supports a healthy gut microbiome, improves nutrient absorption, and strengthens the connection between gut and skin health. A 2025 clinical study found that people supplementing with Bacillus Coagulans saw a 49% improvement in digestion and a 35% reduction in skin irritation within eight weeks. Babchi is a rare botanical known for its skin-rejuvenating properties. Unlike harsh retinoids that cause irritation, Babchi provides natural collagen-boosting effects, helping to maintain skin elasticity. Its antioxidant-rich profile also neutralizes free radicals that contribute to premature aging, breakouts, and inflammation. Research suggests that regular use of Babchi may enhance skin firmness by 31% within three months. Dandelion is an underrated detoxifying herb that helps the liver and digestive system eliminate waste and excess toxins. Poor digestion often leads to toxic buildup in the bloodstream, which manifests as dull, acne-prone skin and bloating. Dandelion extract works by stimulating bile production, supporting digestion, and reducing gut inflammation, making it a critical component in restoring gut-skin harmony. Fennel is a potent digestive aid that helps reduce bloating, gas, and discomfort. It is particularly beneficial for people suffering from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic digestive distress. By soothing the gut lining and promoting the movement of food through the intestines, fennel ensures a smooth digestive process, leading to clearer, healthier skin. Inulin is a prebiotic fiber that acts as fuel for probiotics, ensuring that the beneficial bacteria in Prime Biome can flourish. Without prebiotics, probiotics struggle to colonize the gut, reducing their effectiveness. Inulin helps stabilize blood sugar levels, improves digestion, and supports immune function, making it an essential component in long-term gut health. >>FLASH SALE: Secure Your 75% Discount Now – Limited Stock! Fenugreek is known for its ability to balance blood sugar, reduce inflammation, and support gut microbiome diversity. Unstable blood sugar levels often lead to hormonal imbalances that trigger acne and skin irritation. By keeping blood sugar steady, Fenugreek helps regulate oil production, reducing breakouts and promoting a clear, even complexion. A clinical trial published in 2024 found that Fenugreek supplementation led to a 41% reduction in inflammatory skin conditions and improved digestive function in participants. Lemon Balm is a powerful stress-reducing adaptogen that plays a critical role in supporting the gut-brain axis. Chronic stress is one of the leading causes of gut imbalances and skin issues, as elevated cortisol levels disrupt digestion and increase inflammation. Lemon Balm helps lower stress hormones, allowing the gut microbiome to rebalance naturally, leading to better digestion, reduced bloating, and a calmer, healthier complexion. Organic Ceylon Ginger is one of the most potent anti-inflammatory ingredients in Prime Biome. Unlike regular ginger, Ceylon Ginger contains higher concentrations of gingerol, which reduces gut inflammation, supports circulation, and improves digestion efficiency. Better circulation means more oxygen and nutrients reach skin cells, improving hydration and elasticity while reducing puffiness and dark spots. Organic Lion’s Mane is a rare medicinal mushroom that enhances cognitive function, gut health, and immune system strength. One of its lesser-known benefits is its ability to promote gut barrier integrity, reducing the risk of leaky gut syndrome. This, in turn, leads to clearer skin, reduced inflammation, and better overall wellness. A 2025 study found that individuals taking Lion’s Mane experienced a 38% improvement in gut microbiome diversity and a significant reduction in oxidative stress levels. Slippery Elm Bark is a well-documented gut-healing botanical that soothes intestinal irritation, reduces bloating, and enhances nutrient absorption. It forms a protective layer over the digestive lining, preventing toxins from leaking into the bloodstream, a common issue that contributes to chronic inflammation, acne, and dull skin. This natural protective effect makes it one of the most powerful gut-soothing ingredients in Prime Biome. Why the Combination of These Ingredients Makes Prime Biome So Effective The true power of Prime Biome lies in its formulation. Each ingredient was chosen to create a synergistic effect, meaning that the combination delivers results that are far more powerful than using any single ingredient alone. Many probiotic supplements fail because they lack prebiotics, anti-inflammatory agents, and skin-supporting botanicals. Prime Biome’s formulation solves this by ensuring that every ingredient works together to target gut health, inflammation control, and skin regeneration simultaneously. The balance of probiotics, prebiotics, and gut-supporting botanicals ensures a thriving microbiome, better digestion, and more radiant skin over time.

The Life-Changing Benefits of Prime Biome It’s not just a probiotic. It’s not just a skin supplement. Prime Biome is a complete transformation system, designed to revive digestion, restore microbiome balance, and enhance skin health from within. If you’ve been dealing with bloating, gut discomfort, unpredictable digestion, dull skin, or premature aging, ignoring Prime Biome might be the biggest mistake you didn’t know you were making. Most supplements promise short-term, surface-level benefits. Prime Biome, on the other hand, gets to the root cause of your problems—poor gut health, inflammation, and microbial imbalance—fixing them from within. When your microbiome is optimized, your digestion works effortlessly, your skin glows, your energy levels skyrocket, and your immune system becomes stronger than ever. 1. Revives Digestion and Eliminates Bloating Like Nothing Else Anyone who has suffered from bloating, indigestion, constipation, or food sensitivities knows how frustrating it is to feel like your gut is constantly working against you. The problem? Most digestion supplements fail because they only mask symptoms rather than addressing the root cause—a poorly functioning gut microbiome. Prime Biome is different. It restores balance from within, using a powerful blend of probiotics, prebiotics, and gut-healing botanicals that optimize digestion long-term. This isn’t just another "gut health" product that gives you temporary relief. Prime Biome reshapes your digestion permanently, allowing you to enjoy food without discomfort, bloating, or unpredictability. >> See how Prime Biome can transform your digestion – Learn more. 2. Turns Back the Clock on Aging Skin—From the Inside Out Think your skincare routine is enough? Think again. Your gut controls how your skin ages. You can spend hundreds of dollars on creams, retinoids, and serums, but if your microbiome is imbalanced, your skin will continue aging prematurely. Prime Biome does what no topical skin care product can—rebuilds healthy skin at the cellular level. No other supplement combines these skin-enhancing benefits with deep gut healing. That’s why people who use Prime Biome report visibly younger, clearer, and more radiant skin within weeks. >> See how Prime Biome can revitalize your skin from within – Click here. 3. Balances Hormones and Boosts Metabolism If you’ve been struggling with unexplained weight gain, sluggish energy, or mood swings, your gut is likely out of balance. A poorly functioning gut leads to hormonal chaos, making it harder for your body to burn fat, control cravings, and sustain high energy levels.

Are There Any Prime Biome Complaints? What You Should Know With over 15,000+ verified users, Prime Biome has built a reputation as one of the most effective gut-skin health supplements available today. But like any highly popular product, it has attracted its share of misinformation, fake reviews, and misconceptions. 1. The Truth About Fake Prime Biome Products One of the biggest issues is counterfeit supplements being sold on unauthorized platforms like Amazon, eBay, and third-party sellers. These fake products look identical to Prime Biome but contain low-quality, ineffective ingredients, leading to negative experiences and false complaints. Many customers who unknowingly purchased fake versions have reported zero results, not realizing they were not taking the real, clinically-backed Prime Biome formula. >> Avoid fakes! Order Prime Biome directly from the official website. 2. Are Competitors Trying to Sabotage Prime Biome? As Prime Biome’s popularity exploded, some competitors have resorted to unethical tactics to discredit it. There have been reports of: The reality? Prime Biome is disrupting the market, and companies that sell overpriced, ineffective supplements are losing customers fast. 3. Customers Who Give Up Too Soon Some negative reviews come from users who expect instant results. Unlike stimulant-based products that give you a temporary high, Prime Biome works by rebuilding gut health gradually. For best results, users should take Prime Biome consistently for at least 4-6 weeks to allow full microbiome restoration, improved digestion, and visible skin improvements. 4. Is Prime Biome a Scam? Absolutely Not. Prime Biome is backed by verified scientific research, real user success stories, and a 60-day money-back guarantee. Every bottle is produced in FDA-inspected, GMP-certified facilities, ensuring that customers receive only the highest-quality formula.

Side Effects, Medical Backing & FDA Compliance When it comes to health supplements, safety is the number one concern—and for good reason. People are tired of hidden additives, artificial fillers, and sketchy products that claim to be “natural” but lead to unexpected side effects. Prime Biome is different. It’s not just another probiotic—it’s a science-backed, doctor-formulated supplement designed for long-term safety and effectiveness. But with so many gut health products on the market, does Prime Biome truly stand out as a safe, risk-free choice? That’s exactly what we’ll uncover here. Does Prime Biome Have Side Effects? Here’s the Truth The reality is that Prime Biome is extremely well-tolerated, with no serious reported side effects from real users. However, like any probiotic or gut-supporting supplement, there can be temporary adjustments as your microbiome rebalances. Some new users experience mild bloating or gas in the first few days, which is actually a sign that the probiotics are working. When beneficial bacteria begin repopulating the gut, they start to outcompete harmful bacteria, which can lead to a brief period of digestive adjustment. This is completely normal and should subside within a few days as your body adjusts to a healthier gut environment. Most users find that after a short period, their digestion becomes smoother than ever—with reduced bloating, better regularity, and improved overall comfort. Another important factor to consider is allergies. Prime Biome is free from common allergies like gluten, dairy, and soy, making it a safe choice for those with sensitivities. However, if you have specific plant allergies, it’s always a good idea to check with your doctor before starting. >> See why Prime Biome is trusted by thousands for gut and skin health – Learn more. The Scientific Testing Behind Prime Biome’s Ingredients Every single ingredient in Prime Biome has been carefully selected and clinically tested for safety and effectiveness. Unlike many “mystery blend” supplements that don’t disclose their full ingredient list, Prime Biome is completely transparent—so you know exactly what’s going into your body. Every batch of Prime Biome is lab-tested for purity and potency, ensuring each gummy contains the optimal amount of these clinically supported ingredients. >> Discover the scientifically backed formula of Prime Biome – Click here. How GMP Certification and FDA Compliance Ensure 100% Safety Prime Biome is manufactured in a state-of-the-art, FDA-inspected facility that follows strict Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). What does this mean for you? Absolute safety, quality, and consistency. Many supplements on the market cut corners during manufacturing, using cheap fillers, unverified ingredients, or low-quality processing. That’s never the case with Prime Biome. Every bottle undergoes rigorous third-party testing to confirm purity, potency, and safety. Here’s why this matters: These strict safety measures separate Prime Biome from other supplements that lack proper regulation. If a product is not made in a GMP-certified facility, you should be questioning its safety. Debunking the Myth: “Natural Ingredients Can Still Be Dangerous” There’s a common misconception that just because something is “natural,” it’s automatically safe. While some herbal supplements do have risks, Prime Biome was specifically formulated by medical professionals to be both effective AND safe. Here’s why Prime Biome’s formula is different from unregulated, “natural” supplements that could pose risks: The problem with many supplements is poor-quality sourcing—some companies use low-grade, contaminated, or improperly dosed ingredients, leading to potential safety concerns. Prime Biome avoids these issues by using only premium, carefully sourced botanicals and probiotics. Long-Term Use: Is Prime Biome Safe Over Months or Years? Unlike stimulant-based weight loss pills or harsh detox supplements that can cause issues with long-term use, Prime Biome is designed to be taken daily for lasting benefits. Gut health isn’t something you fix overnight—it’s a lifelong commitment. The longer you take Prime Biome, the stronger your microbiome becomes, leading to: Because Prime Biome is free from additives, artificial chemicals, and stimulants, there is zero risk of dependency, withdrawal, or long-term damage. Users who have taken it for months report sustained improvements in digestion, energy, and skin clarity—without any negative effects. Why No Serious Side Effect Complaints Exist It’s rare for a supplement to have thousands of satisfied customers and no widespread complaints—but Prime Biome is one of those rare products. Most “side effects” reported are mild, short-lived, and linked to the gut adjustment phase, which resolves itself within a few days. Unlike synthetic supplements that lead to jitteriness, dependency, or digestive distress, Prime Biome works with your body, not against it. Additionally, because Prime Biome is only sold through the official website, customers receive fresh, verified bottles that are properly stored and handled. This prevents issues that occur with fake supplements sold through third-party retailers. With a 60-day money-back guarantee, GMP certification, FDA compliance, and real scientific backing, Prime Biome sets the gold standard for probiotic safety. >>Don’t take risks with your health—choose the safest gut-skin supplement today. Why Prime Biome Works Better Than Traditional Probiotic Supplements The probiotic supplement market is flooded with products that promise to restore gut balance, but very few deliver real, measurable benefits. Most probiotics are either too weak, unstable, or incapable of surviving the harsh environment of the digestive tract. This is where Prime Biome sets itself apart. Unlike generic probiotic pills that contain a few bacterial strains with questionable survival rates, Prime Biome’s advanced gut-skin formulation ensures that beneficial bacteria reach the intestines and provide real, lasting results. Most probiotic supplements suffer from a low bioavailability problem—the bacteria they contain often fail to survive stomach acid and bile. This means that by the time they reach the intestines, where they are needed most, only a fraction of the probiotics remain active. Prime Biome’s unique blend of probiotics, prebiotics, and skin-supporting botanicals ensures that its beneficial bacteria are delivered in a stable, bioavailable form. Ingredients like B. Coagulans, a robust probiotic strain, form protective spores that allow them to withstand stomach acid, ensuring that they reach the gut intact. Another major flaw of traditional probiotics is that they often lack prebiotic fibers, which are essential for feeding and sustaining beneficial bacteria. Without these nutrients, probiotics can struggle to colonize the gut effectively. Prime Biome includes high-quality prebiotics such as Inulin and Fenugreek to nourish the good bacteria, allowing them to multiply and thrive. This powerful synergy between prebiotics and probiotics leads to better digestion, reduced bloating, and enhanced skin clarity. Additionally, Prime Biome doesn’t just stop at gut health—it directly supports skin regeneration and cellular renewal. Many probiotic supplements fail to consider the gut-skin axis, which plays a crucial role in overall health and appearance. By including herbal extracts like Babchi, Lemon Balm, and Organic Lion’s Mane, Prime Biome ensures that the gut microbiome remains balanced while also promoting a clearer, more youthful complexion. >> Want to see why Prime Biome is outperforming traditional probiotics?

How Prime Biome Supports Weight Loss Through Gut Health Optimization Many people struggle with stubborn weight gain, bloating, and digestive sluggishness without realizing that an imbalanced gut microbiome is one of the biggest hidden obstacles to fat loss. Prime Biome works by restoring gut health, which in turn optimizes metabolism, reduces inflammation, and enhances nutrient absorption—all of which play a direct role in weight management. Scientific research has shown that the composition of gut bacteria significantly affects how the body stores fat and regulates appetite. When harmful bacteria outnumber beneficial bacteria, it can lead to increased fat storage, insulin resistance, and an inability to efficiently break down and absorb nutrients. Prime Biome counteracts this by replenishing the gut with beneficial strains like B. Coagulans, which help break down food more efficiently and support a healthier metabolic rate. Inflammation is another major contributor to slow metabolism and stubborn fat retention. Chronic inflammation disrupts hormonal balance, increases cravings, and makes weight loss an uphill battle. The anti-inflammatory properties of Organic Ceylon Ginger and Lemon Balm in Prime Biome help to soothe the digestive system, reduce bloating, and promote better metabolic function. By calming gut inflammation, these ingredients allow the body to burn fat more efficiently while keeping energy levels stable. Another overlooked factor in weight gain is poor digestion leading to bloating and water retention. Many people mistake digestive bloating for weight gain when, in reality, their gut is simply struggling to break down food properly. Prime Biome contains powerful digestive-supporting herbs like Slippery Elm Bark and Fennel, which improve gut motility, reduce water retention, and ensure that nutrients are absorbed efficiently rather than being stored as excess fat. The Little-Known Link Between Gut Health and Hormonal Balance While most people associate gut health with digestion, very few realize just how deeply the gut microbiome impacts hormonal balance. The microbiome plays a critical role in regulating cortisol (stress hormone), insulin (blood sugar regulation), and estrogen (reproductive health)—all of which influence metabolism, mood, and even skin clarity. Prime Biome’s carefully formulated blend of probiotics and herbal adaptogens directly supports hormonal balance, leading to improved metabolic function, reduced stress, and clearer skin. One of the most damaging effects of an imbalanced gut is elevated cortisol levels, which can lead to stress-induced weight gain, poor digestion, and breakouts. When stress hormones spike, they trigger inflammation throughout the body, including the gut and skin. Prime Biome helps regulate cortisol by including adaptogenic herbs like Lemon Balm and Organic Lion’s Mane, which promote relaxation, reduce stress-related inflammation, and support a stable gut environment. Insulin resistance is another major consequence of poor gut health, often leading to blood sugar spikes, cravings, and increased fat storage. Beneficial bacteria are responsible for breaking down dietary fibers into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which help regulate insulin sensitivity and prevent glucose spikes. Prime Biome’s combination of prebiotics and probiotics ensures that the gut microbiome is functioning optimally, preventing insulin resistance and promoting better blood sugar control. For women, hormonal imbalances related to estrogen metabolism can significantly impact skin, weight, and mood. The gut plays a crucial role in processing and eliminating excess estrogen, and when the microbiome is disrupted, it can lead to estrogen dominance—causing bloating, acne, mood swings, and stubborn fat accumulation. By restoring microbial balance, Prime Biome helps the body regulate estrogen naturally, reducing these symptoms and promoting a healthier hormonal environment. What Makes Prime Biome’s Ingredients So Powerful? A Deep Dive Into the Science Unlike generic probiotic supplements that rely on a limited number of bacterial strains, Prime Biome is formulated with a comprehensive blend of probiotics, prebiotics, and botanical extracts—each chosen for its scientifically backed ability to promote gut and skin health. This multi-layered approach ensures that every ingredient works in synergy to optimize digestion, enhance nutrient absorption, and support overall well-being. B. Coagulans, the probiotic powerhouse, is one of the most resilient bacterial strains, capable of surviving stomach acid and colonizing the gut effectively. Studies have shown that B. Coagulans reduces bloating, supports immune function, and enhances nutrient digestion. Unlike many probiotic strains that require refrigeration, B. Coagulans remains stable at room temperature, making it more effective in supplement form. Babchi, the plant-based collagen booster, is a powerful antioxidant known for promoting skin elasticity, reducing inflammation, and supporting cellular regeneration. This ingredient enhances collagen production, which is essential for maintaining firm, youthful skin. Organic Ceylon Ginger and Lemon Balm play a dual role in reducing inflammation and supporting digestion. These ingredients improve gut motility, prevent bloating, and help break down food more efficiently, ensuring that the gut microbiome remains balanced and thriving. Slippery Elm Bark and Inulin act as natural prebiotics that fuel the growth of beneficial bacteria. They enhance gut barrier function, preventing toxins and harmful bacteria from entering the bloodstream, which is a major contributor to inflammation, acne, and digestive discomfort. By formulating Prime Biome with highly bioavailable, scientifically backed ingredients, the supplement delivers far superior results than standard probiotic capsules. Rather than simply replenishing bacteria, it creates an optimal gut environment where beneficial bacteria can thrive, repair gut lining, and restore digestive health—leading to better metabolism, clearer skin, and overall vitality. Final Verdict – Is Prime Biome the Missing Piece to Your Health? After analyzing the science, real customer experiences, and the unique formulation of Prime Biome, it’s clear that this isn’t just another probiotic supplement—it’s a complete gut and skin health solution designed to target the root cause of digestive imbalance, inflammation, and premature aging. Unlike traditional probiotics that focus solely on gut bacteria, Prime Biome goes further by integrating powerful botanicals, prebiotics, and clinically studied probiotics to restore the gut microbiome, support cellular renewal, and enhance skin clarity. With thousands of satisfied users, scientific backing, and a commitment to high-quality, non-GMO, GMP-certified ingredients, it’s no surprise that Prime Biome is quickly becoming the go-to choice for those looking to improve their digestion, energy levels, and overall well-being. If you’ve been struggling with bloating, sluggish digestion, persistent skin issues, or even stubborn weight gain, it’s likely that your gut microbiome is out of balance. Prime Biome offers a simple, scientifically backed way to correct these issues at their source, leading to long-term health improvements that extend beyond just digestion. With its doctor-formulated blend, positive customer feedback, and a risk-free 60-day money-back guarantee, there’s no reason to settle for less when it comes to your gut and skin health.

On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve announced its decision to keep the policy rate in the 4.25%-4.50% range. In his speech, Fed Chair Jerome Powell mentioned that former U.S. President Donald Trump’s initial policies, such as import tariffs, have contributed to slower economic growth and may have had a temporary impact on inflation. Policymakers anticipate two rate cuts in 2025, with economic growth projected at 1.7% and inflation at 2.7% for the year. Additionally, the Fed plans to slow the pace of balance sheet reduction by adjusting the monthly redemption cap on Treasury securities by April.

Additionally, economic uncertainty in the U.S. could contribute to market volatility. However, a stronger dollar may impact global commodity prices.

While the Fed has multiple things to consider in its risk matrix, the Fed is charged with the twin goals of maintaining full employment and low prices. In the wake of heightened global uncertainty and increased business complexities stemming from President Donald Trump’s significant policy changes, the Fed held the rates steady. This was fully anticipated because “uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased”. But “the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.” In this disconcerting overarching environment, some analysts fear the dreaded specter of stagflation, which could be the worst of both worlds. The US Fed held the rates steady for a second straight meeting because of decelerating growth and persistently sticky inflation. Accordingly, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted on March 19, 2025, to keep the benchmark federal funds rate in a range of 4.25%-4.5%. The Fed announced a further scaling back of its “quantitative tightening” program in which it is slowly reducing the bonds it holds on its balance sheet. Governor Christopher Waller, who supported steady rates, dissented from the balance sheet decision. Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that tariff impacts are not amenable to prescient forecasts. Hence, there was a need for greater clarity on the impact of those policies on the economy before acting. The Fed forecasted two rate cuts for this year and expected the core personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation forecast, to rise to 2.8% in 2025, up from a prior forecast of 2.5%. It also expected GDP at 1.7% this year, down from the earlier forecast of 2.1%.

Additionally, the forecasts for both overall PCE inflation and core PCE inflation have been increased to 2.7% and 2.8%, respectively, up from 2.5%. These weakened macro projections suggest a more cautious economic outlook, which could influence monetary policy decisions moving forward. The market is reacting, with futures indicating a 62.1% probability that the Fed will resume rate cuts in the upcoming June meeting, reflecting a slight increase from the previous 57%. This shift signals trader sentiment that the Fed may need to take more accommodative steps to support the economy amid lower growth expectations and rising inflation concerns. The implications of these developments could lead to increased volatility in financial markets as investors recalibrate their strategies in response to the Fed’s evolving outlook.” Marksans Pharma announced that its manufacturing facility located at Plot A-1, Phase 1-A, Verna Industrial Estate, Verna, Goa has been approved by Australian TGA for manufacture of pharmaceutical formulations in Solid Dosage Forms of Tablets and hard Capsules for Australian markets.

This comes amid stagflation risks surged by US President Donald Trump’s tariff hikes, which escalated a global trade war. On other hand they expect Inflation to bounce back a little this year from a current rate of 2.5 % to 2.7 %, above the central bank’s 2 % target. By keeping rates unchanged, the Fed is balancing the need to combat inflation versus concerns about growth. This framework signals the Fed’s determination to achieve price stability as well as the flexibility it wishes to have to respond to future developments in the economy. HCL Tech (+1.63%), Wipro (+1.60%), TCS (+1.59%), Infosys (+1.43%) Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company Ltd (“KMAMC” / “Kotak Mutual Fund”) today announced the launch of the “Choti SIP” facility, available for all eligible schemes of Kotak Mahindra Mutual Fund. SEBI and AMFI recently introduced the Choti SIP (Small Ticket SIP), offering an opportunity to bring more Indians into the wealth creation journey. This initiative enables new investors to invest via SIP with a minimum amount of Rs. 250. The rationale behind “Choti SIP” (small Systematic Investment Plan) is to make mutual fund investments more accessible to a wider audience, particularly first-time investors, by lowering the entry barrier. The investor must not have previously invested in mutual funds (SIP or Lumpsum) at the industry level. The investor must invest in the Growth Option and commit to a minimum of 60 instalments on a monthly basis. The payment of instalments should be made through NACH or UPI auto-pay only. Nilesh Shah, Managing Director, KMAMC, said, “Only about 5.4 crore unique investors of India’s population are mutual fund investors—leaving a massive, untapped opportunity for penetration and bringing the Indian saver closer to financial freedom. Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) have been an excellent way to bring new investors and kick-start their mutual fund journey. With the launch of Choti SIP, a new investor can begin their wealth creation journey with a minimum amount of Rs. 250. We can call it ‘Choti Rakam – Bada Kadam’.” PTC India has received the amount of ₹254 crores from ONGC Green Ltd. (OGL) as part of the adjustments to bid price as per Share Purchase Agreement.

Turkish Lira depreciates, potential risk for Jubilant Just the facts The Turkish Lira has depreciated 5% today with 8.5% depreciation YTD vs the USD. We note JUBI had acquire DP Eurasia in early 2024. DP Eurasia operates in in Turkey, Azerbaijan and Georgia and contributed 31% of group system sales in 3QFY25. We note Jubilant Foodworks’ debt is Rs12.3bn as of Sep’24, of which we estimate about 80% is payable from Turkish cashflow. Analyst opinion We believe the depreciation of the Lira would lead to additional interest cost burden for JUBI in repayment of debt taken to acquire DP Eurasia. We believe the 5% Turkish Lira today could have a 2-2.5% impact on FY25 consolidated PAT estimates. The YTD Turkish Lira depreciation of 8.5% could have c.3.5-4% impact (including today’s impact) on FY25 consolidated PAT. This depreciation in Turkish Lira could also impact dividend payments by DP Eurasia.

The proposed incentive aims to address this by both enabling wider adoption and subsidizing the cost of payment systems.

At the outset, growth projections have been lowered and inflation has been falling, and therefore rate cuts by the Fed remain a continued possibility, despite the 1% reduction done last year. However, Mr Powel’s conundrum would be the same as everyone else:- the impact of President Trump’s unpredictable tariff moves.

The central bank kept its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged in the 4.25%-4.50% range, and indicated that two quarter-point interest-rate cuts were likely later this year, the same median forecast as three months ago. The Fed also forecast slower economic growth and higher inflation. Policymakers disagreed about the path forward, pointing to uncertainty among members about how to handle the effects of Trump’s plans. - Reuters Gold soared to a record high on Thursday, as the Federal Reserve hinted at a possible easing of interest rates by half a percentage point by year-end, which further fostered bullion’s appeal amid ongoing geopolitical and economic woes.

We present a series of charts under six sections: Growth/consumption, Investments, Financial Markets, Global Macros, Inflation/Employment, and External Sector. We wrap this up with a monthly tracker. ■ Barring a few outliers, we do not see signs of a meaningful growth/consumption recovery. Some data points like tractors and Port Cargo are improving, but major concurrent indicators like loan growth and auto sales continue to be weak. ■ Financial markets are mixed. Pressure on the rupee and forex is easing, with reserves stabilizing, the rupee weakness paused (at least for now), and the DXY having significantly corrected from the peak. Domestic liquidity however remains weak despite aggressive measures from the RBI – we see this as seasonal, and expect a recovery from Apr-25. ■ Our outlook is unchanged. We see an economic recovery in FY26 led by consumption – this will be enabled by a recovery in white collar employment and acceleration in retail lending. The investment cycle should moderate more toward normal levels, keeping pace with nominal GDP growth. We see the liquidity situation improving rapidly, leading to lower interest rates and better deposit growth. Interesting read of the week – Tokenization of private assets John Crabb discusses the possibilities of tokenization of private asset classes in Institutional Investor (link). This, he argues, will allow greater retail access to private markets, including alternate assets like art through fractionalization. Of course, this will need regulation changes from the SEC. Our view: giving retail investors access to illiquid private assets carries several unknown risks. The broader issue that resonates with India is that the options for domestic investors are now limited to the two ends of the spectrum – low-risk debt assets or equities/gold/real estate. There is a need for more products with intermediate risks that bridge this gap, as we discussed in our report on household savings in Dec-24 (link). Market view The market is showing signs of stability. As we mentioned last week (link), much of the valuation froth has subsided and most indices, including SMIDs, are trading below LTA P/Es. FPI selling has also abated. The sustainability of this rally will be determined by how well FY26 earnings forecasts hold up during the Apr-25 earning season. We believe that the Nifty EPSg forecast of 13.6% has little downside risk to it, fueled by a discretionary consumption recovery. In the short term, BFSI should outperform as liquidity easing and investors bottom-fish. In the medium term, however, we prefer consumer discretionary, healthcare and real estate. Capital markets regulator Sebi on Wednesday barred former TV anchor Hemant Ghai and his family members from the securities markets for five years for violating regulatory norms. Apart from the ban, Sebi has directed Hemant Ghai and his wife Jaya Ghai to disgorge the unlawful gains worth Rs 6.16 crore, along with 12 per cent interest per annum to be calculated from March 31, 2020, till the date of the interim order. It has also slapped a penalty of Rs 50 lakh each on Hemant Ghai and Jaya Ghai, Rs 30 lakh on MAS Consultancy Service, and Rs 5 lakh on financial services company Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd (MOFSL). The regulator had concluded that Hemant Ghai used his position as a TV anchor to influence stock prices, while his family members executed trades in advance to profit from the recommendations. “...Hemant Ghai had a huge following on social media and was closely followed on CNBC. The recommendations made by him influenced the investment decisions made by his viewers and impacted the price and volume of the recommended scrips. “However, he unfairly used this privilege to his own advantage,” Sebi’s whole-time member Ashwani Bhatia said in the order. In the final order, the regulator said, “A majority of trades and profits in the accounts of Jaya Ghai and Shyam Mohini Ghai stemmed from trades synchronised with stock recommendations made on CNBC by Hemant Ghai, husband and son, respectively, of the individuals in whose accounts the trades were executed”. Also, Sebi pointed out that Hemant has exercised operational control over these accounts, with his email, phone number, and bank credentials linked to them. - PTI Zinc futures outlook positive with resistance at ₹282, potential rally to ₹293; trade strategy suggests long positions. bl.portfolio Star Track Mutual Fund Ratings: A guide to achieving better returns in mutual funds Get intraday support, resistance levels, and trade recommendations for Nifty Futures and popular stocks with Day Trading Guide.
