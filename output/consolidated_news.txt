US stock market futures today surged as optimism built over Washington’s progress on ending the record 2025 government shutdown. Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures climbed sharply after the Senate cleared a 60–40 procedural vote on a short-term funding deal through January 2026. The move boosted risk appetite and sent global markets higher, with KOSPI up 3%, Nikkei 1.3%, and Hang Seng 1.5%. Tech rebounded, led by Nvidia, while energy and financial stocks gained. The 10-year Treasury yield edged up to 4.13% as investors rotated back into equities.

Δ Maybe an innovation saved a lot of our time. Or it made us live longer. Made us more productive workers who could command a higher premium on our time. Or enabled us to pack more things into the limited time we have. Some innovations have done most of the above. Innovations in time have massively improved and extended our lives over the last several centuries. And there’s no letting up. The next wave of disruption will come from those who deliberately innovate around time. Those who see time not as the tick of fixed seconds, but as a human asset whose value has almost unlimited potential. To find inspiration for the next breakthrough, decacorn, and more, catalysts should study time. No asset is more valuable, or more limited, than time. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Each day, we get just so much. Twenty-four hours, 1,440 minutes, 86,400 seconds. If we don’t use it, we lose it. So, we try to make the most of it. To do that, we trade it, swap it and compress it, each day and over our lifetimes. We can use some of our time endowment to work and make money to buy things. By using our time to learn when we are young, we can earn more money and enjoy our time more when we are older. Just like people value their houses and businesses value their capital stocks, people value their time. In the U.S., economic studies find that the average person values their time on earth at around $13 million. That is based on looking at how much people must be paid to take risks that could end their lives. The government uses that figure to evaluate benefits and costs involving lives. That makes the value of the stock of time for the U.S. population of 340 million people around $4.5 quadrillion (340.1 million people times $13.1 million per life). By comparison, the U.S. housing stock is worth a measly $55 trillion according to Zillow; the total fixed capital stock was worth $87 trillion in 2024 according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis; and the total value of companies on public exchanges in the U.S. was $68 trillion at the end of September. A more precise estimate of the value of time would account for the fact that the value of life and life expectancy vary with age. But when you get to quadrillions, who’s really counting? Governments, businesses and innovators should treat time as what it truly is. A national and global asset. And like every other great asset, its value can grow through disruptive innovation. The better we use it, the richer the world becomes. Almost 90% of American farms didn’t have electricity as late as 1935. Robert Caro’s famous biography of Lyndon Johnson, “The Path to Power,” shows what that meant to the people living in Hill Country, Texas. A typical farm family used 40 gallons of water a day. To get it, they had to walk to a well located about 250 feet away with a bucket and carry it back to the house. A federal study found the average family spent about 500 hours a year and walked about 1,750 miles just to get water. The family devoted even more hours to hauling wood and washing clothes by hand. Tasks that consumed time and strength, especially for women who, literally, carried the heaviest load. More than half suffered physical injuries from the strain of constant standing and physical labor involved in doing both. Without electricity, there wasn’t much else to do. “No radio; no movies; limited reading—little diversion from the hard day just past and the hard day ahead,” according to Caro. “Living was just drudgery,” one person reminisced. Electrification changed all that, not just in Hill Country, but throughout the U.S. and eventually most of the world. People had more time. And more to do with that time. They could also expect to live longer as electrification reduced infant and adult mortality. Disruptive innovations can make time far more valuable. Entrepreneurs, innovators, businesses and governments have nine levers to find the next big thing in time. 1. Saving Time: Spending less time on one thing so you can spend it on another. Millennia ago, people learned to domesticate horses, which reduced the time spent traveling. Running water from electric pumps likely saved all 500 of those family hours fetching water. The invention of the washing machine reduced the amount of homemaker time to do a load of laundry from 4 hours to 41 minutes. E-commerce companies, from online retailers to meal delivery services, save people the time from traveling to and from physical locations or from cooking their own meals. 2. Making Time. Delaying the Grim Reaper’s visit as long as possible. Innovations like indoor plumbing created cleaner water and prevented the spread of disease. Vaccines largely ended many deadly diseases. The development of antibiotics saved lives. Surgical advances, imaging innovations, and drug development do too. Saving lives means extending the amount of time people have. Globally, average life expectancy increased from 32 years in 1900 to 73 years in 2023, more than doubling the amount of time people have. In the U.S., life expectancy increased from about 50 to almost 80. A perfect human specimen, with the best circumstances and the greatest luck, could make it until 125 based on the upper range for demographic studies. Using that data, in the U.S., we’ve reached only 64% of our potential. 3. Enriching Time. Packing more into the time you have. Electrification expanded the portion of the day people had light. That gave them more time to read and do things that are impossible to do in the dark. The printing press, and communication technologies from the telegraph to radio to broadband, have expanded the ability to benefit from our auditory and visual senses. Smartphones, powered by fast cellular, make those experiences on the go and on demand. Today we can listen to an audiobook, a podcast, or the radio while we’re driving, taking the subway or vacuuming the floors. 4. Monetizing Time. Using time to work to make money for people and their families. Innovations can change the amount of time people work. The time people spend working depends on whether they participate in the labor force, how many hours they work, and when they decide to retire. People can then use that money to buy goods and services, which they combine with their time (think about eating) to create value. The labor force participation of women has increased in the last century in part because household chores, which disproportionately fell on them, took up less time. People can work later in life because they are healthier and have more years available to them. Platforms make it possible for people to pick up gig jobs, participate in side hustles and work-from-home using their available time. Innovations often result in people being paid more because they are more productive. With higher incomes and savings, people can decide to work less and retire earlier, with greater incomes and more wealth. 5. Enjoying Time. Spending more time on leisure activities. The disruptive innovations for time saving and improving innovations have made leisure cheaper, because less time is needed for household chores, and more valuable, because sensory-related innovations provide better ways to spend their time. In 2024, the average American, age 15 and over, spent an average of 5.5 hours a day “in some sort of leisure and sport activity, such as watching TV, socializing, or exercising.” That’s about 37% of waking hours (the average number of hours sleeping was 9.0 hours). An economic study found that adults spent 6.75 more fewer hours a week working for pay or at home, and instead on leisure activities, between 1965 and 2003. This time was worth roughly 8% to 9% of GDP based on how much people could have made from paid work 6. Trading Time. Giving people things for free, or at a discount, in return for them giving some of their attention. Since newspapers were first invented, advertisers have been paying for people to pay attention to them. The idea is simple: advertisers buy space in media, hoping that audiences will notice their ads. People might not enjoy the ads, but they do enjoy the content. In exchange for free or cheaper access to that content, they let advertisers try to capture some of their attention. New media innovations have always created huge value by making leisure more enjoyable. Families in places like Hill Country, for instance, could spend hours listening to the radio or watching TV, paying nothing beyond the cost of the equipment and electricity. My 2020 paper on attention markets estimated that Americans spent about 500 billion hours consuming ad-supported content in 2019. That made the content they were consuming worth roughly $7 trillion, given the opportunity cost of their time. 7. Investing Time. Using time to learn and thereby increasing the value of time later in life. People, in most developed countries, invest a large part of their time through their teens, and often beyond, learning. This increases the value of their time, for working and themselves, later in their lives. A 2020 U.S. study by Fed economists found that kids, from kindergarten through high school, spent 36% of their waking hours over the week on class time and enrichment activities, including homework. (The data are from 1997, 2002, and 2007.) Investing in time differs in two main ways from the other levers of innovation. It’s not like choosing to watch TV, clean the house, or pick up hours with side hustles. In the U.S., and many countries, kids are compelled to invest time in learning by the government and by their parents. The logic is that it’s good for the kids and good for the country. Education hasn’t had a true disruption in centuries. Public schooling and standardized curricula were the last big innovations, and online learning has yet to deliver on its promise, with the exception of foreign languages. In 2024, grade 12 reading scores in the U.S. were the worst in three decades and math scores the lowest since 2005. 8. Accelerating Time. Shortening the time between the generation and delivery of information. People can make more and better decisions when they get information more quickly. Disruptive innovations have sharply decreased the time needed to convey information and, therefore, the choices people can make at any moment in time. Cheaper paper helped transmit information easily over long distances. The speed increased with the development of horse-based delivery services. In the U.S., sending mail on the stagecoach took weeks. The short-lived specialty Pony Express could move mail in days. It was replaced with the telegraph, which was nearly instantaneous aside from going to telegraph offices to send and retrieve messages. Economists have examined the value of faster time in commerce. Before the successful launch of the transatlantic telegraph on July 28, 1866, it took 7 to 16 days to send information between the U.S. and Great Britain. It was almost immediate after that. The faster transmittal times reduced the price spread for cotton between New York and Liverpool by 35%. By reducing price distortions, it resulted in economic efficiencies that were worth about 8.4% of the value of the exports. Of course, the internet and related communication technologies have massively accelerated time. Now it can take just a few seconds to buy from sellers around the world, to take just one example. 9. Multiplying Time. Increasing the total of the collective hours of everyone’s time, including their working time. Setting the warm and fuzzies aside, societies depend on the collective hours people spend working, creating, and paying taxes. People make the goods and services we consume or trade with other countries. People come up with the ideas that power innovation. And workers ultimately pay most of the taxes to finance everything from national defense to basic research to social welfare. Europe now faces an “existential crisis” in part because people work fewer hours and have fewer children, who will supply working time in the future. Most developed countries have increasingly severe time shortages and will eventually face crises too. Countries can multiply time by encouraging later retirement, higher workforce participation, longer hours, and immigration. The eight other innovations in time are important drivers. Countries can also try to encourage families to have more babies, but there’s not much evidence that works. Advanced applications of artificial intelligence might be the disruptive innovation we need to solve the great time shortage: it could create human substitutes and increase the productivity of human working time. We’re not ready to count humans out, though. Entrepreneurs, innovators and investors searching for their next breakthrough should treat time as a resource class: measurable, improvable and ripe for disruption. That goes for governments, too. The addressable market isn’t literally $4.5 quadrillion. But that is a proxy for the enormous potential of the nine levers to innovate time. And how even small gains in how we create, extend, or enhance it can generate enormous economic returns. Economists have developed clever data-driven methods for estimating the value that people place on their time that can help size investment opportunities and ROIs. We have put rigor into the old saying that “time is money.” Economists look at how much people have to be paid to give up time, say, for work. Or how much people will pay to save time, like for a faster commute. These aren’t ivory-tower exercises. They drive federal cost-benefit analysis of proposed investments. The simplest approach is based on wages. A person could go to the beach or do some chores around the house instead of working another hour. If they are willing to take $20 to work an extra hour for a gig job, then that must be more than the value of an hour doing something else. The wage-hour tradeoff is hard to pin down in practice because many people have fixed salaries or must work a set number of hours. But the after-average after-tax wage, about $17.83 now, turns out to be a good proxy for the value of time for the average person. Instacart claimed it saved people more than 700 million hours between 2012 and 2023 because they didn’t have to go to the grocery store. At $17.83 an hour, it saved people more than $1.2B. The value of time depends on the situation. An hour of work may be more or less pleasant. The time spent on a subway ride isn’t as costly if a person can listen to music on their smartphone. People hate standing in line at checkout, which is why many opt not to and order things online. To get context-specific estimates, economists conduct surveys that try to get people to reveal how much they value time spent in various activities. The U.S. Department of Transportation used these surveys to value savings in local personal travel at about $12.50 an hour. Recent studies estimate the value of spending time using social media. They find that you would have to pay people a lot to go without. Economists have also developed data-driven methods for putting a dollar value on extending life. People make many decisions that result in small changes in the probability of their dying. Many involve making tradeoffs between money and risk: paying extra for a safe car with lower fatality rates in crashes or taking a job that pays more but poses a great risk of a fatal accident. People don’t act as if their lives are worth an infinite amount of money. Most of the studies, and the most robust, look at job decisions. A review, based on 2017 data, found that an employer would have to pay a typical worker another $100 a year to take a job where 1 in 100,000 workers die from a work-related injury. To summarize these results, economists calculate the “value of a statistical life” as the total amount of money that a group of people would pay to avoid one death: 100,000 people would pay $10 million to save one life. The federal government uses this approach to estimate the benefit of investments in activities that could save or cost lives. They currently adopt the $13.1 million per life figure I used earlier. Economists have found that this figure varies across ages. Younger people have more years to value than older people. Economists also use this approach to value innovations in healthcare. A seminal economic study found that the increase in life expectancy between 1970 and 2000 “added about $3.2 trillion to national wealth per year, an uncounted value equal to half of average annual GDP over the period.” Not surprisingly, AI innovators are chasing improvements in healthcare. The real frontier of time isn’t just looking at a clock. It’s looking inside the brain, too. If you buy the Audible version, you can listen to my book, “Matchmakers,” with Richard Schmalensee. It will take you 6 hours and 53 minutes. We were surprised at how many people chose to do that. But the thing about audiobooks is that you can do lots of other things while you are listening. One survey found that 70% of listeners multitasked. A different survey found that 74% of audiobook listeners listen while driving. People also listen while engaging in lots of other activities, like running or doing household chores. They are packing more things into their heads at the same time. Lots of other time innovations do the same. When we talk about people’s time, we’re really talking about the mental processes that happen within a unit of time. What people do with their brains to consume media, work, learn, view ads and more. Economists and psychologists call these processes “attention.” That term covers what regular people call attention, but much more. (An excellent recent survey has the details.) Like money, attention is limited. Using it for one thing means giving it up for another. But unlike money, it’s powered by cognition and choice, and we can decide to engage in more mental activity. We decide what to do with our brains and senses and then do it. We can think of human time along two dimensions. One is clock time, the steady march of seconds. The other is attention per unit of time, which is the variable flow of mental energy that determines how much we accomplish within those seconds. (This is a simplification since attention has many dimensions itself.) Brain time is the flow of attention through the flow of time. This is where the nine levers of time innovation create immense value. Some of those levers give us more clock time, while others enrich attention. Often, they do both. And the beauty of brain time is that multiple levers can be processed during the same unit of time. Clever innovators can make a lot of money from brain time. Google search saved people clock time from going to the library and on other resources to get information. People could even listen to loud music or talk to their colleagues without getting yelled at by the librarian, which enriched their attention. People ended up spending a lot of time doing search queries and looking at search results pages. And they didn’t have to pay a penny. Google built its business on selling slivers of brain time to advertisers. Advertisers can put an ad on the page and have a chance that some people will pay attention. With Facebook and a smartphone, people could interact with friends anywhere anytime, including while watching TV or on the treadmill. Alphabet and Meta are worth about $5 trillion. They make almost all their revenue from the small percentage of visitors who divert brain time to ads. Focusing on time as an improvable asset, and the nine levers for increasing its value, gives entrepreneurs, innovators and businesses a rigorous, disciplined way to identify and size opportunities. It also hands governments a guide to make investments that will maximize the value of human time. The economics of brain time provides a new lens to help shape the innovations and value their potential. Some economists say the era of unprecedented growth has come to an end. After all, it’s hard to top indoor plumbing. I don’t think it’s over. The potential to improve and extend human time is enormous. The financial incentives are powerful. And AI and other new technologies provide the foundation for new leaps forward. It’s about time. David S.

Title: George Will Says Migrants -- Not Generation Z -- Will Revive America
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/11/10/george-will-says-migrants-not-young-americans-rejuvenate-america/
Time Published: 2025-11-10T08:58:31Z
Full Content:
Op-ed writer George Will, a pillar of the old-guard GOP establishment, is disgusted with Congress’s refusal to enforce more migration and used the Washington Post to air his grievances. Migrants “could improve the nation’s dynamism, and its understanding of itself. … [but] neither political party will seize the moment for immigration reform,” wrote Will, who was born in 1941, five years before the first Baby Boomers arrived in 1946, and 24 years before Congress restarted mass immigration in 1965 after a fifty-year shutdown. Will’s endorsement of more migration comes amid the growing public recognition of the economic damage caused by President Joe Biden’s inflow of illegal migrants and visa workers, including H-1Bs from India. The damage has exacerbated the widening optimism gap between older Americans and the younger Generation Z, of adults younger than forty. “Went to an event tonight, talked to three different people with zoomer kids,” said a Nov. 9 tweet from Rasmussen Reports pollster Mark Pitchell. “They’re demoralized.” “My friend group from high school, all graduated, great degrees from great schools,” recent graduate Nalin Haley told UnHerd, adding: It’s been a year and a half, and not one of them has a job — not one. So I’m angry at that, because I’m having to try and help my friends get jobs when their parents got jobs immediately — not just after graduating college, but out of high school. “I see Boomers are trying to make their counter-argument” towards younger Americans, said Rich Baris, director at Big Data Poll, and the chairman of the National Association of Independent Pollsters. He continued: It’s pretty damned insulting to listen to people in older generations act as if these younger generations have all the options and opportunities they did. They do not. Boomers made sure of it. It’s even more insulting to see fools quote “Locke” in some ridiculous attempt to threaten them for not submitting to their way of thinking. “In 10 years, there won’t even be an argument, and the younger generations will make sure history remembers you as the generation who inherited it all, and left nothing to be inherited,” Baris wrote. Older Americans gained housing values and stock-market wealth from the huge technological advances since the 1940s, and from the vast economic stimulus provided by Congress’s policy of stimulating the economy with vast waves of legal and illegal migrants. But young Americans have seen their wages flatline, their debts grow, and their housing costs spike amid the Boomers’ imported population of roughly 50 million legalized, quasi-legal, or illegal migrants. RELATED: Sean Duffy — Gavin Newsom’s California Is Ignoring the Law on Illegal Alien Truck Drivers Yet columnist Will, aged 84, is all-in for more migration, saying migrants can rejuvenate the economy by forcing Americans out of low-wage jobs: Immigrants who fill jobs as domestic helpers, cleaners, waiters, car-wash attendants, meatpackers and other low-skill jobs drive productivity and social dynamism by allowing, even compelling, other workers to advance to more-skilled work. Migrants can also act as servants to free up better-educated Americans for commerce and possible childbirth, says Will, who was 29 when migrants were just 5 percent of the population in 1970 Regarding America’s sagging birth rate, research finds that low-skill immigrants (nannies, housekeepers, meal-preparers) “substantially” reduce hesitation about having children. The flood of migrants — presumably including clan migrants from Somalia, casteist migrants from India, and Jew-hating Muslims from Syria — can replace complacent Americans because it will “improve the nation’s dynamism, and its understanding of itself,” said Will, who has an estimated net worth of $4 million and who voted for Vice President Kalama harris in 2024. The main danger, Will argues, is that economic growth might be somewhat curbed by reduced migration: Three economists writing for the American Enterprise Institute have estimated that net U.S. migration might be negative this year — for the first time in history — by more than 200,000. Most economists think the question is not whether but how much this will subtract from economic growth. Will was referring to a report from a business-backed advocacy center, which concluded that “We find that the large drop in net migration in 2025 compared with 2024 will result in significantly slower labor force growth, slower employment growth, and a decrease in GDP growth of around 0.3–0.4 percentage points.” Mass migration is good for the stock market, but less migration is better for per-capita wealth, according to an investor-funded study described by Breitbart News in October. “At medium and low immigration levels, labor-based [skilled professional] immigration, characterized by fewer but more skilled population, produces higher GDP [Gross Domestic Product] per capita [emphasis added] growth,” compared to mass inflow of migrants and their extended families, says the September study published by Springer, titled “Demographic and Economic Implications of Alternative U.S. Immigration Policies.” “That should be a no-brainer because we know we could annex Mexico and our GDP would be enormously higher, but our per capita income would drop,” Rosemary Jenks, cofounder of the Immigration Accountability Project, told Breitbart News. “That’s just ‘Duh!’” The study is useful because “you have the advocates [for mass migration] themselves saying immigration is not a good deal for the average American,” Stephen Camarota, the research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, told Breitbart News. “It may be good for Wall Street, it’s not good for Main Street, ” he added. The study matches reality in Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, where the estimated quality of life is declining and productivity is stalling because elites are importing consumers, renters, and workers to grow the nation’s real-estate prices and stock values. In contrast, President Trump and his deputies are pushing for greater productivity and automation instead of the mass migration favored by Will, progressives, and investors. We’re going to need robots … to make our economy run because we do not have enough people,” Trump told Breitbart News in August, adding: We don’t have enough people to do it. So we have to get efficient … we’ll probably add to [the existing workforce] through robotically—it’s going to be robotically. The promise of cheap labor is ” a drug that too many American firms got addicted to … [and] globalization’s hunger for cheap labor is a problem precisely because it’s been bad for innovation,” Vice President JD Vance told an audience of Silicon Valley investors in May. He added: And whether we’re offshoring factories to cheap labor economies, or importing cheap labor through our immigration system, cheap labor became the drug of Western economies. And I’d say that if you look in nearly every country, from Canada to the UK that imported large amounts of cheap labor, you’ve seen productivity stagnate. That’s not a total happenstance. I think that the connection is very direct. “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a 2024 pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … “If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard of living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations,” Fink added.

Changing Times Brewery, which was founded by the families behind some of Dublin’s best known pubs, is expecting sales to double next year with total keg sales of about 10,000, the group has said. The €2 million brewery, based in Glasnevin along the banks of the Royal Canal, is celebrating one year in operation this week. The brewery said it expects to see further growth in demand for its products, and that the increased sales will be driven by rising customer demand for its beers, expansion of the number of venues stocking their products and a further widening of their product range. A new product, called Bleedin Red Ale, becomes the fourth draft product offered by the brewery. Changing Times believes it will sell 3,000 kegs of Bleedin Red Ale by the end of 2027. A fifth beer is expected to be introduced in the first half of 2026. Changing Times products are now available in 33 venues across the country, up from the initial 15 pubs which stocked its products. The new venues include The Storyteller Pub on Grand Canal Street, Bill Ahernes on Aston Quay, The Oval on Abbey Street, Lock 13 in Sallins, Thomas Connollys in Sligo as well as Paul Flannerys, Jerry Flannerys, Patsy Flannerys and Phil Flannerys all in Limerick. The brewery’s backers include Dublin publicans Willie Aherne and Paul Sheehan of The Palace Bar on Fleet Street and Sheehans Pub on Chatham Street respectively, as well as Benny McCabe, who owns a number of bars in Cork, and brewer Shane Long. [ Changing Times Brewery beers to be stocked in nine new premises as it moves outside DublinOpens in new window ] Other backers include the publican families behind venues such as Arthur Mayne’s in Donnybrook, The Bank on College Green, The Blackrock, The Bridge 1859, Devitt’s, Doheny and Nesbitt, The Ferryman, The Long Hall, McSorley’s and The Swan. Pat Rigney, owner of The Shed Distillery, which is home of Drumshanbo Gunpowder Irish Gin, is another backer of Changing Times Brewery and also the group’s chairman. David Chawke, chief executive of Changing Times and owner of The Bank Bar and Restaurant on College Green, said: “We expect to see the number of keg sales double next year. “Practically since the day we launched we have had requests from customers for a red ale and thankfully we now are able to offer them a product we believe is as good as any other red ale on the market. “We see this product launch as another key marker for us. Adding a fourth product tap also further highlights the growing strength of our range on pub counters, creating more brand visibility for our brewery and for our existing strong line-up of beers. “It has been a really positive first year of operation for Changing Times and we are very happy with how everything has progressed. Launching a new brewery in this market was always going to be a risk, but we are very pleased with how our brewery has been received.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Bringing in a new generation of hardware wallets: An interview with Adam Budínský

Time Published: 2025-11-10T05:55:34Z
Full Content:
Most people don’t realize how deeply hardware wallets have influenced traditional industries. These devices proved a critical point: protecting digital identity, whether it’s a private key, a certificate of origin, or machine credentials, demands uncompromising hardware-based security. No shortcuts. No partial fixes. That idea of no compromise is key. For years, industries like industrial IoT, critical infrastructure, and manufacturing treated security as a checkbox. Think of PLCs controlling factory lines, smart meters on utility grids, or remote maintenance modules in power plants, threats seemed distant. Systems stayed offline. Security was someone else’s problem. But the landscape has shifted. Today, attacks are accelerating not just in volume, but in sophistication. And while attackers level up, the cost of launching an attack drops. This isn’t theory. It’s exactly what Trezor experienced when dealing with closed secure elements, and why Tropic Square was founded: to expose and address the hidden risks in hardware. The core issue is trust, or the lack of it. Can you trust the devices you operate? The machines that manufacture your products? In many cases, the answer is no. Most embedded systems weren’t built with serious security in mind. And that’s a problem, because low-assurance hardware is easy to hijack and repurpose by attackers. Now we’re seeing a shift: the same principles that drove the evolution of hardware wallets are being applied to industrial systems. Devices that look like wallets are appearing in factories and field deployments, anchoring machine identity, securing communication, and enforcing hardware-level trust. In an interview with Adam Budínský, Head of Hardware Product at Trezor, we discussed the technical challenges the team aimed to solve, and how the device reflects broader shifts in usability, transparency, and long-term crypto security. The crypto market is clearly maturing. We’re witnessing a major shift toward institutional adoption — from the launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs to large asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity adding significant crypto exposure to their portfolios. Global Bitcoin ETF assets under management have already surpassed $170 billion in 2025, which shows how mainstream digital assets are becoming. At the same time, retail participation hasn’t returned to the levels we saw in previous bull markets. Institutional flows are now shaping the market more than retail sentiment, and that’s one reason why we haven’t experienced the same kind of retail-driven frenzy this cycle. Many newcomers prefer the simpler path of owning crypto through ETFs or custodial platforms instead of holding it themselves. But that convenience comes at a cost. The fundamental truth still applies — “Not your keys, not your coins.” True ownership means self-custody, and hardware wallets remain the only secure and transparent way to actually control your digital assets. At Trezor, our mission is to make that level of security accessible and intuitive for everyone, so users can enjoy the same confidence and independence as institutions — without relying on third parties. Trezor Safe 7 was shaped by a clear signal from our users: they wanted a hardware wallet that delivers not just security, but also modern convenience and premium quality. As our lives have become increasingly wireless and intuitive, people have begun to expect the same from their self-custody tools. This device brings those expectations to life — with secure Bluetooth connectivity, wireless charging, a seamless aluminum unibody, and a larger high-res display. At the same time, it introduces the world’s first transparent secure element, TROPIC01, built specifically to bring verifiability into the heart of hardware security. Each decision was guided by user feedback — and by our belief that the safest wallet should also be the easiest to use. Everything in our digital lives has become seamless and wireless — and we believe self-custody should be no exception. For too long, hardware wallets have lagged behind the level of convenience, durability, and premium design we expect from modern devices. With Trezor Safe 7, we set out to close that gap. From its aluminum unibody to encrypted Bluetooth connectivity and wireless charging, every detail was designed to make secure self-custody feel intuitive and sophisticated. But that seamless experience rests on a rock-solid foundation. We pioneered a new security model: the world’s first transparent secure element working in tandem with a trusted industry-grade chip — offering users both verifiability and resilience. That commitment to innovation is reflected across the hardware, from the safer, long-lasting LiFePO₄ battery to the fully auditable Trezor Host Protocol. This is what the new standard for hardware wallets should look and feel like — not someday, but today. We focused on solving two key issues: convenience and the trade-off between usability and verifiable security. Many users felt that hardware wallets lacked modern ease of use. We addressed that by introducing Bluetooth connectivity, Qi2 wireless charging, a larger color touchscreen with haptic feedback, and a durable aluminum unibody. We also designed a long-lasting LiFePO4 battery — built to endure years of use and deep discharge — so users can trust their wallet to stay ready whenever they need it. These improvements make self-custody feel intuitive, reliable, and accessible for everyday use. At the same time, we tackled long-standing concerns around secure element transparency. Trezor Safe 7 is the first wallet to pair a fully auditable secure element (TROPIC01) with an industry-trusted chip. This dual architecture offers both physical resilience and cryptographic transparency — giving users security they can verify, not just trust.” Trezor Safe 7 reinforces what Trezor has always stood for: open-source, user-first security. But with this release, we’ve taken that commitment to a new level. By giving users a device that’s both transparent and elegant — built with verifiable components like the TROPIC01 chip and backed by years of trusted engineering — we’re showing that we listen, we evolve, and we lead. This device isn’t just an upgrade in specs; it’s a statement of our long-term promise to the community. Every design choice, from the secure Bluetooth protocol to the unibody aluminum shell, was made to deepen user confidence. We want people to feel proud to use Trezor — and to trust that we’ll always put their needs and safety first. The goal was to create a device that feels reassuring from the first moment — precise, robust, and thoughtfully engineered. Trezor Safe 7 is milled from a single block of aluminum, giving it a clean and durable form. The Gorilla Glass 3 screen adds both clarity and protection, supporting long-term daily use. It’s compact and lightweight, but built to handle the responsibility of securing your crypto. We wanted the physical design to reflect the same principles as our software: security, transparency, and simplicity. The future of wallets will be defined by a convergence of strong security principles with the usability standards of modern consumer technology. As digital assets become more embedded in daily life, users will expect wallets to offer the same level of simplicity, portability, and design sophistication as other smart devices — without sacrificing transparency or control. This means moving beyond purely utilitarian designs toward tools that are both secure and accessible to a broader audience. At Trezor, we believe that true security starts with open-source — especially at the hardware level. You can’t prepare for the future if your most critical component, the secure element, is closed and unverifiable. That’s why Tropic Square committed to developing open-source secure elements like TROPIC01. It allows independent experts to inspect and verify how the hardware protects private keys, ensuring real trust rather than blind faith. Equally important, every true hardware wallet must have a screen. It’s the only way for users to independently verify what they are signing. Any product that claims to be a hardware wallet without a display is simply giving users a false sense of security. The ability to see and confirm transaction details directly on the device — not on a potentially compromised computer or phone — is the foundation of secure self-custody. Ultimately, the wallets of the future won’t just protect coins — they’ll embody a philosophy of verifiable trust and transparency. Open hardware, open firmware, and open cryptography are the only sustainable path toward long-term, quantum-resistant security. Disclaimer: This article may be in collaboration with a valued partner.

Title: AI bubble about to pop as returns on investment fall short?

Billions have poured into AI, helping stock valuations soar. But the cracks are starting to show. Slowing adoption, surging costs and elusive profits are fueling warnings that the boom may be headed for a hard reset. The artificial intelligence (AI) party is still in full swing, with tens of billions globally pouring into infrastructure, startups and attracting the best talent. Among the headline announcements this year: ChatGPT parent company Open AI, Softbank and Oracle pledged to invest $500 billion (€433 billion) in AI supercomputers, Open AI and chip giant Nvidia announced a $100 billion fund to maintain the United States' dominance in advanced chips, while Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Tencent hiked investments to help speed up China's ambition to lead AI by 2030. Since ChatGPT’s debut in November 2022, AI-related stocks have added an estimated $17.5 trillion in market value, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, driving around 75% of the S&P 500’s gains and propelling companies like Nvidia and Microsoft to record-breaking valuations. But signs of a hangover are getting harder to ignore. AI usage by corporations is slipping, spending is tightening and the machine learning hype has massively outpaced the profits. Many economists think usage concerns, barely three years into AI going mainstream, dropkick the prevailing narrative that AI would revolutionize how businesses operate by streamlining repetitive tasks and improving forecasting. "The vast bet on AI infrastructure assumes surging usage, yet multiple US surveys show adoption has actually declined since the summer," Carl-Benedikt Frey, professor of AI & work at the UK's University of Oxford, told DW. "Unless new, durable use cases emerge quickly, something will give — and the bubble could burst." The US Census Bureau, which surveys 1.2 million US companies every fortnight, found that AI-tool usage at firms with more than 250 employees dropped from nearly 14% in June to under 12% in August. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video AI’s biggest challenge remains its tendency to hallucinate — generating plausible but false information. Other weaknesses are inconsistent reliability and the poor performance of autonomous agents, which complete tasks successfully only about a third of the time. "Unlike an intern who learns on the job, today’s pretrained [AI] systems don’t improve through experience. We need continual learning and models that adapt to changing circumstances," said Frey. As the gap widens between sky-high expectations and commercial reality, investor enthusiasm for AI is starting to fade. In the third quarter of the year, venture-capital deals with private AI firms dropped by 22% quarter on quarter to 1,295, although funding levels remained above $45 billion for the fourth consecutive quarter, market intelligence firm CB Insights wrote last month. "What perturbs me is the scale of the money being invested compared to the amount of revenue flowing from AI," economist Stuart Mills, a senior fellow at the London School of Economics, told DW. Market leader OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft, generated $3.7 billion in revenue last year, versus total operating expenses of $8-9 billion. The company says it is on course to make $13 billion this year but is still expected to burn through $129 billion before 2029, news site The Information calculated in September. Mills thinks generative AI companies like Elon Musk's Grok and ChatGPT are "charging far less than they need to make a profit" and should raise subscription prices. Few have quantified the AI bubble more starkly than Julien Garran, partner at UK-based research firm MacroStrategy Partnership. He argues that the sheer volume of capital flowing into AI — despite little evidence of sustainable returns — dwarfs previous speculative frenzies. "We estimate a misallocation of capital equivalent to 65% of US GDP — four times bigger than the housing buildup before the 2008/9 financial crisis and 17 times bigger than the dot-com bust," Garran told DW. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Recent earnings from Big Tech have sparked cautious optimism, but also fresh doubts about AI’s staying power. Data analytics and intelligence platform Palantir's Q3 revenue surged 63% year-over-year, but its stock price fell by up to 7% on the news. AMD and Meta also saw their strong AI-related earnings overshadowed by market concerns about sustainability. That disconnect between soaring valuations and shaky fundamentals is exactly what worries Mills, who sees a widening gap between what AI promises and what it actually delivers to businesses. "The data suggests that AI is not penetrating high enough up the value chain. Loads of people are using it, but it's not being used for tasks that directly contribute to value production," he told DW. Nvidia's upcoming earnings on November 19 may prove a key test of whether the AI boom still has legs. In the second quarter, Nvidia's data center sales alone made up 88% of total revenue, which hit a record $46.7 billion. For Q3, the company has guided $54 billion, projecting 54% year-on-year growth, which would equate to a full-year total of more than $200 billion. "With the exception of Nvidia, which is selling shovels in a gold rush, most generative AI companies are both wildly overvalued and wildly overhyped," Gary Marcus, Emeritus Professor of Psychology and Neural Science at New York University, told DW. "My guess is that it will all fall apart, possibly soon. The fundamentals, technical and economic, make no sense." Garran, meanwhile, believes the era of rapid progress in large language models (LLMs) is drawing to a close, not because of technical limits, but because the economics no longer stack up. "They [AI platforms] have already hit the wall," Garran said, adding that the cost of training new models is "skyrocketing, and the improvements aren’t much better." Striking a more positive tone, Sarah Hoffman, director of AI Thought Leadership at the New York-based market intelligence firm AlphaSense, predicted a "market correction" in AI, rather than a "cataclysmic 'bubble bursting.'" After an extended period of extraordinary hype, enterprise investment in AI will become far more discerning, Hoffmann told DW in an emailed statement, with the focus "shifting from big promises to clear proof of impact." "More companies will begin formally tracking AI ROI [return on investment] to ensure projects deliver measurable returns," she added. Edited by: Uwe Hessler

The network is fast becoming the home of real-world finance. PayPal’s PYUSD hit $18.6B in transfer volume and tokenized fund AUM jumped 2,000%. ETH remains range-bound below $3,500, with weak momentum and neutral derivatives data. Ethereum’s [ETH] on-chain economy is entering a new phase. PayPal’s stablecoin volume keeps climbing, and major financial institutions are now moving real funds on-chain. Tokenization isn’t just an idea anymore. It’s quickly becoming one of Ethereum’s strongest growth engines. PayPal’s stablecoin, PYUSD, hit its strongest quarter yet: $18.6 billion in transfer volume on Ethereum. This is a massive 260% jump year-over-year. The chart showed a steady climb across every quarter since early 2024, showing growing usage among both retail and institutional users. Source: X What’s driving this surge is simple: PayPal’s integration with onchain payments is turning PYUSD into one of Ethereum’s most active stablecoins. Tokenized funds on Ethereum have exploded, up nearly 2,000% since January 2024. The chart showed a clear inflection point earlier this year, driven by traditional giants like BlackRock and Fidelity launching on-chain versions of their funds. Source: X What started as a niche experiment in tokenized treasuries has turned into a multi-billion-dollar ecosystem. Simply put, the world’s biggest asset managers are validating Ethereum as the base layer for real-world finance. Ethereum was struggling to regain strength above the $3,500 mark at press time. The chart showed price action consolidating below the 9-day EMA, so short-term momentum was muted. RSI was at 37.7, indicating weak buying pressure, while the CMF at -0.10 indicates capital outflows from the market. Source: TradingView Trading volumes were subdued, which proves a lack of conviction among bulls. Source: Coinalyze Derivatives data support this caution. ETH’s Open Interest (OI) has slipped to around $17.6 billion, while Funding Rates remain near neutral at 0.0098%. ETH is seeing low leveraged activity. With volumes thinning and sentiment cooling, ETH remains range-bound unless a decisive breakout above $3,500 restores bullish conviction.

Title: AI factories face a long payback period but trillions in upside
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/11/09/ai-factories-face-long-payback-period-trillions-upside/

UPDATED 22:49 EST / NOVEMBER 09 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by David Vellante, David Floyer, Jackie McGuire, Scott Hebner and Christophe Bertrand Our latest forecast indicates that it will take a decade or more for artificial intelligence factory operators and model builders to reach breakeven on their massive capital outlays. Our projections call for nearly $4 trillion in cumulative capital spending outlays by 2030, with just under $2 trillion in cumulative AI revenue generated in that timeframe. We have the crossover point occurring early next decade (2032 on a run-rate basis) then gains far surpassing initial investments by the middle part of the 2030s. Though such projections are invariably subject to constant revision, we believe the size and speed of the initial investments, combined with the challenges of profitably monetizing AI at scale, will require patient capital and long-term thinking to realize durable business results. A short time after we published our first AI factories revenue outlook, OpenAI Group PBC Chief Executive Sam Altman and Microsoft Corp. CEO Satya Nadella introduced new data on the BG2 Pod. As well, on Nov. 4, The Information published projections from Anthropic in an article that also included financial projections on OpenAI based on multiple unnamed sources. This fresh information gives us an opportunity to revisit our figures and do so in the context of economist Erik Brynjolfsson’s productivity J-curve, which explains why new general purpose technologies, like electricity, the steam engine, computing and AI, often experience limited productivity growth at first, because organizations must learn, adapt and reorganize in order to realize benefits. Over time, these innovations tend to outperform expectations. Importantly, our forecasts focus on the business case for AI factory operators currently funding the massive AI buildout – specifically, the big CapEx spenders, including hyperscalers, neoclouds and AI research labs building today’s large language models. We do not attempt in this exercise to go down the “rabbit hole” of forecasting the investment and productivity output from enterprises consuming AI services. These are, however, related as the pace of both consumer and enterprise AI adoptiion will ultimately fuel monetization that AI factory operators will realize. In this Breaking analysis, we analyze these new data points and debate the shape of the AI factories economic curve. We’ll briefly introduce the productivity J-curve, share snippets from the Sam and Satya statements that in many ways speak to the AI productivity paradox. We’ll then revisit our AI factories forecast and assumptions; discuss some of the headwinds the industry must overcome to reach our projections and close with a vision of the future of AI and service as software. The productivity J-curve is a phenomenon where traditional measures of productivity growth initially dip before rising after the adoption of a new general-purpose technology or GPT. This occurs because a novel technology, such as AI, requires significant, but hard-to-measure, intangible investments in areas like employee training and business process redesign. These initial investments can cause temporary negative productivity impacts, but once organizations learn to productively apply the technology, full benefits are realized and productivity growth appears, often in quite dramatic fashion. The concept of the productivity J-curve was developed and modeled by the economists Erik Brynjolfsson, Daniel Rock and Chad Syverson. Recently, on theCUBE at UiPath Fusion, we asked Erik Brynjolfsson to explain the productivity J-curve in the context of today’s AI boom: [Watch Stanford economist Erik Brynjolfsson describe the productivity J-curve and how it relates to AI] Back when I was a young student in Boston, where I guess, I think we first met over there, I was working with Bob Solow, the Nobel Prize winner, and he pointed out that the computer age was everywhere, except the productivity statistics. So he asked me to look into this, and one of the things we saw was that all these companies were investing in these really amazing technologies, but nothing very valuable was coming out. And then later, as we know, in 1995, things started really taking off. And so I did some research, and the same pattern happened with lots of earlier technologies. With electricity, it was like 30 years, in fact, before you had a big boom. The steam engine. And so when I analyzed it, what we see is that these cool technologies, to really get the benefit of them, you have to rethink your business processes. You have to invest in human capital training, and so forth, and all that takes time and energy. And while you’re doing that, there’s not a lot of new output. So you’ve got more input, not a lot of output. By definition, that’s lower productivity. But then once you figure that out, things really take off. So to me, it kind of looks like a J, and we plot it. We did a paper in the American Economic Journal about that, to kind of work out the math of it. And now we’re seeing, I think, the same thing with AI. In our view, the productivity J-curve, at least in part, explains today’s AI return-on-investment paradox. Early adoption of general-purpose technologies is messy, utilization is uneven, workflows and data aren’t ready, and traditional measures of productivity often show dips before durable gains appear in the macro. The latest MIT and recent Enterprise Technology Research data points suggest only modest near-term ROI impact – single digits to low teens of enterprises seeing sustained ROI at scale. We’ve often said that agentic AI will take most of a decade to mature and permeate enterprises broadly. If we count inputs as AI CapEx and outputs as AI factory revenue, current productivity is negative, which helps explain market jitters and bubble talk. We believe near-term skepticism is unsurprising and the payoff depends on raising utilization, improving data quality and putting governed and secure agents into operation so that spend translates to tokens, and token production converts to revenue. Industry consensus had OpenAI revenues at about $13 billion. In a conversation with Altman, Brad Gerstner asked the obvious question: “How can a company with $13 billion in revenue make $1.4 trillion in spend commitments?” This raised Altman’s ire to the point where he spilled some revenue estimates that hadn’t been previously shared. [Watch Altman bristle at the criticisms] Specifically Altman said: Our further research indicates that both of these estimates are run-rate revenue projections. As such, we put OpenAI 2025 revenue at $15 billion. Moreover, in the clip above, Nadella lends credibility to Altman’s statements by claiming he’s never seen a business plan from OpenAI that the company hasn’t met or exceeded. Jackie McGuire of theCUBE Research had the following takeaways on Altman’s and Nadella’s comments: I think their tone tells you a lot about the message. To me, Sam actually sounded a little bit defensive in the “We’re doing well more than 13 billion.” It sounded to me like on one side that we’re doing way better than that. And on the other side, “I’m telling you guys, this is a sure bet. Take the Dodgers in the World Series. I’ve never seen them not lose a game.” There was an article last week in Wired that was called AI is the Bubble to Burst Them All. And it was talking about what the different things are that characterize a bubble, how people talk about it as one of them. And yeah, I don’t know. I just found the tone to be very more defensive than I would expect for somebody that feels really, really secure in the amount of revenue they’re doing. This narrative, as the Wired article reminds us, echoes the hype around RCA in the 1920s. Andrew Ross Sorkin in promoting his new book, “1929,” makes similar comparisons, with OpenAI as today’s analog. But it has faster execution, a bigger installed base and a much more mature communications infrastructure in its favor. Pulling OpenAI’s revenue projections forward suggests a meaningfully higher trajectory for the company. Nadella’s commentary frames OpenAI as an “execution machine” and is encouraging. Coupled with about 800 million monthly active users and what the company claims is 1 million enterprise API customers, demonstrates a blistering cadence and a glimpse of what the next great software company may look like. In the graphic below, we update our earlier AI factory forecast which reframes the datacenter buildout at an accelerated pace. The relevance is this represents the CapEx that ultimately foots the AI bill. Datacenter investments require land, power, water, distribution, thermal systems, and the accelerated stack itself – compute, storage and networking. The AI piece of the forecast (dark brown bars) is astounding and forcing a stack flip to extreme parallelism. The following key additional points are notable: The pace of the buildout steepens relative to our April forecast reflecting disclosures from recent earnings prints and deal signings that indicate OpenAI has secured a disproportionate share of advanced package/graphics processing unit capacity, while Google LLC has stepped up commitments, along with other hyperscalers and Meta Platforms Inc. Taken together, these inputs justify pulling forward AI-factory outlays. As we’ll show below, revenue ramp lags in the model when assessing cumulative spend vs. cumulative revenue. The most recent forecast implies that although hyperscalers, neoclouds and specialist providers will operate much of the capacity, enterprises will ultimately need to underwrite a majority of the economics over time via consumption. This will happen extensively through cloud, neoclouds and colo channels as well as selective on-premises deployments, especially as edge AI matures. While Wall Street rightly notes the hyperscaler and neocloud GPU estates are “lit up,” enterprises running clusters of 1,000-plus GPUs often sit below 30% utilization because of thin parallel-computing muscle memory, immature workflows and data friction. That underutilization is stressed by rapid hardware depreciation; unlike dark fiber in 2000, GPUs lose value fast. In our view, if enterprises cannot translate capacity to tokens and productivity, ROI will accrue elsewhere in the value chain until operating discipline catches up. Endpoints are a potential tailwind as an AI PC refresh cycle will push more inference to the edge, and a return to pragmatic hybrid is likely as organizations balance economics, latency, privacy and the practical limits of data movement. The operational reality is we live in a 12- to 18-month replacement cycle with e-waste and labor challenges implying a perpetual “paint-the-Golden-Gate-Bridge” refresh cadence applied to rows and racks of infrastructure. Hybrid AI will also be deployed by enterprises. As such, choice and flexibility across on-prem/colo/public will matter and upgrade timelines will vary, which argues for architectures that let teams “tap the public” while local capacity evolves (the labor and talent constraints are visible in the workforce data we present later). Data gravity and storage economics are also at play. We expects a meaningful share of cost to sit in storage and data management, not just GPUs. We will likely see renewed interest in deep, economical tiers (including tape) and a storage-vendor arms race to live closer to the accelerators, because data readiness, lineage and metadata for agentic workflows are gating factors to scale. The net is the spend is real and earlier, but breakeven will stretch beyond a decade with improvements in utilization, fabric efficiency and governed data pipelines taking time. In our opinion, the operating agenda is raise money, do deals, build fast, secure power and GPUs, increase utilization, compress network latency, harden governed data planes and sequence hybrid capacity so depreciation curves don’t outrun value realization. The data below represents revenue output from AI factory operators. It does not represent the value created by mainstream enterprises driving productivity and contributing to the macro gross domestic product uplift. Forecasting that impact is a separate exercise that requires assumptions about firm level productivity impacts. Rather this forecast is meant to help us model the revenue return on the massive CapEx buildup happening with AI, which will power a massive productivity boom in our view. The following five key messages are conveyed in the data: Our updated revenue forecast reflects a steeper commercialization curve for AI factories, with OpenAI’s trajectory set higher based on the new information. The near-term ~$20 billion run rate this year and a path to ~$100 billion by 2027, is based on growth initially fueled by consumer/prosumer demand and then accelerated by a rapid cadence of APIs and software that connect to enterprise data. We group Google and Anthropic as a combined partnership because TPU capacity and tight technical alignment make joint scaling plausible even as each maintains distinct channels; and Anthropic has a close partnership with AWS. We assume China’s block rises on restricted access to U.S. technology, which concentrates domestic investment and demand. A core debate from theCUBE Research team is whether a vertically integrated, more “closed” approach can sustain leadership versus an “open grid” that standardizes inter-factory integration. On one side, we argue that without open standards and protocols, multicompany business-to-business workflows risk fragmenting into a patchwork of proprietary adapters, repeating early cloud pain and slowing the “intelligence economy.” Trust requirements (transparency, accountability) and the cost of data movement and governance reinforce the case for openness; unified enterprise data will be the gating factor and creates room for data mobility vendors to grab a piece of the market. On the other side, we note that de facto standards have repeatedly led markets – IBM/360, Windows on commodity PCs, AWS primitives, iPhone, CUDA and the like – where proprietary control plus ecosystem gravity created the interoperability that matter in practice. In that view, surviving factories will define interfaces bilaterally and at scale, then formal standards follow. Key assumption: Enterprises will mostly consume AI via APIs; interoperability will improve through a mix of de facto interfaces and selective open standards; unified, governed data is the real prerequisite to value capture. Netting it out, the forecast supports OpenAI as the current favorite in the race. Advantaged by funding, compute access, fast software/API velocity and deep partnerships, we see this compounding into share gains even if the posture is more closed than purists would like. We acknowledge the risk that openness wins the long game; however, history suggests that de facto standards often dominate first, with formal openness catching up later. Our base case therefore keeps OpenAI in the lead, while watching for evidence of durable open protocols that would shift share toward more open operators. The chart below shows our cumulative CapEx forecast required to build AI factories (orange line) and the token revenue from those factories green line. As you can see, this business is not for the faint of heart, as described by the points below. We believe the cumulative-spend vs. cumulative-revenue forecast underscores the AI productivity paradox in that a multitrillion-dollar CapEx wave begins in 2024, but revenue trails for a decade-plus, yielding an early J-curve where measured productivity looks low or even negative. The spend line reflects the full factory build – land, power, water, distribution, thermal and accelerated stacks – while the revenue line captures commercialization that starts slowly and steepens only after end-to-end solutions mature. In our analysis, three inhibitors dominate the early years: 1) Weak data quality – web data is noisy and enterprise data is also challenging – requiring time-consuming cleanup, harmonization and policy controls; 2) The need for the industry to package and ship a unified, trustworthy agentic software layer that enterprises can adopt without bespoke integration; and 3) The sheer denominator problem – so much CapEx goes out up front that catching up takes time even as utilization improves. There is broad agreement that value creation ultimately skyrockets as the operating leverage kicks in; the open question is pace. Some argue the crossover could come sooner for targeted, high-value workflows rather than blanket enterprise adoption, while others maintain that the scale of CapEx alone pushes breakeven out ~11 years. Headwinds we see: Land/power/water constraints; skilled labor and operational cadence; poor/fragmented data and governance; evolving regulations (and geopolitical frictions) that complicate data movement; and the learning curve to stand up agentic control planes. Netting it out, the forecast dovetails with our key takeaways – a large near-term gap, a long breakeven, early J-curve headwinds, heavy physical/operational constraints and a path to compress the gap by securing energy, lifting utilization, tightening fabrics and hardening governed data pipelines. We believe Deloitte’s “Can US infrastructure keep up with the AI economy?” report articulates a central constraint to our thesis: Energy and water availability – and the speed of grid expansion – will set the pace of the buildout. AI racks run hotter and denser than legacy estates, pushing a structural shift from evaporative to liquid/mechanical cooling and forcing operators to site facilities where dual utility feeds are feasible for redundancy. That is driving builds toward inland markets with favorable land and interconnects but limited local talent pools, while creating visible, localized electricity price inflation in the two to three years following large deployments. In the near term, backup generation remains largely diesel and the grid mix still leans on fossil sources; corporate power purchase agreements and new renewables help, but lead times are long. Nuclear is re-entering the conversation as one of the few scalable, round-the-clock options capable of matching multigigawatt AI clusters over the decade. In our view, this energy reality dovetails with the J-curve economics in that even if capital is available, the tempo of power procurement, water rights and cooling retrofits slows time-to-tokens and represents a headwind to revenue realization. The practical takeaway is that breakeven moves with infrastructure, not just silicon. Implications: Operators will prioritize sites with dual-feed capacity and water sources; lock long-dated PPAs while exploring nuclear options; expect localized utility rate pressure; plan for liquid cooling skills and supply chains; treat energy procurement as a first-class program office alongside networking and data governance. The Deloitte study lays out many challenges and solutions to building out AI infrastructure. Perhaps one that is most underappreciated is skilled labor. We believe a key blocker after power is people. Deloitte’s survey shows competition for skilled labor and a shortage of data-center-specific skills as the top workforce challenges. Building and operating AI factories requires niche trades – nuclear engineers, diesel-gen technicians, high-capacity chiller mechanics and specialized welders – not generic information technology staff. These workers are scarce, unevenly distributed and often unwilling to relocate to inland locations where dual-feed power and water are available, pressuring wage inflation and scheduling risk. The data underscores the point in that respondents cite competition with other sectors (~53%), a shortage of data-center–related skilled labor (~51%), geographic limits on talent (~43%), and high turnover (~42%) as primary obstacles. Labor regulation adds friction as well; notably, power-company executives flag regulation as a challenge far more often than data-center builders, reflecting state-by-state and EU-style variability. Against that backdrop, hyperscalers, neoclouds and well-funded operators will pay up for the best people, while governments are also in the hunt – tightening the market further. In our view, solving the talent gap requires a multiyear effort – national and regional programs to retrain displaced workers; vocational pipelines starting in high school for advanced welding, mechanical and electrical trades, fluid engineers that understand advanced plumbing; and increased use of robotics to service multibuilding campuses measured in football fields. Without this workforce ramp, the CapEx-revenue crossover slips, regardless of how fast silicon ships. Satya Nadella made the following statement: So the new SaaS applications, as you rightfully said, are intelligent applications that are optimized for a set of evals and a set of outcomes that then know how to use the token factories output most efficiently. Sometimes latency matters, sometimes performance matters. And knowing how to do that trade in a smart way is where the SaaS application value is. But overall, it is going to be true that there is a real marginal cost to software this time around. It was there in the cloud era too. When we were doing CD-ROMs, there wasn’t much of a marginal cost. With the cloud, there was. And this time around, it’s a lot more. And so therefore, the business models have to adjust and you have to do these optimizations for the agent factory and the token factory separately. AI is shifting the margin math again. The CD-ROM era drove marginal cost toward the price of plastic; SaaS reintroduced a cloud OpEx tax; AI adds the heaviest burden yet – rapidly depreciating GPUs, power and specialized labor – so headline gross margins compress even as volume potential explodes. Those dynamics align with recent comments about marginal cost pressure and sets the stage for what we view as the more important transition – George Gilbert’s service-as-software or SaSo thesis. In SaSo, factories expose agentic capabilities as programmable services, enterprises consume them through APIs and lightweight local runtimes, and the “software-like” economics accrue disproportionately to buyers (productivity) and to a handful of sellers that achieve scale, utilization, and distribution. We see three forces accelerating SaSo despite near-term cost gravity. First, algorithmic and systems efficiency will complement brute-force scaling – better data selection, sparsity, compilation, and workload shaping can cut compute costs materially. Second, distributed AI will split work sensibly: pre- and post-processing at the edge (including on devices) with factory inference and training behind APIs; storage tiers (including tape) and robotics will lower the cost of operating massive campuses. Third, the factories with the deepest ecosystems will ship the systems of intelligence or SoI agentic control planes, software development kits and adapters that enterprises adopt “as-is,” rather than building bespoke stacks. In our view, this means most organizations will prioritize owning and governing their data while sourcing intelligence from a few high-volume factories that improve fastest. Bottom line: The AI factory buildout is real, front-loaded, and subject to a decade-long J-curve. Power, talent and data quality/governance pace the crossover point. Revenue capture accrues to operators that 1) Drive utilization, 2) Win the networking and systems efficiency game, 3) Support the delivery of trustworthy agentic platforms as services, 4) mobilize developer ecosystems, and 5) Relentlessly work the supply chain. Buyers of AI will see software-like marginal economics. That sets up a a winner-takes-most market. Today, the momentum and evidence place OpenAI and Nvidia Corp. in the lead, with hyperscalers and select partners close behind, fed by a supply chain ecosystem that is mobilizing for massive returns in the 2030s.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St Shares of NVIDIA (Nasdaq: NVDA) dropped 7.1% this week, sinking sharply after hitting a high of $211.34 on Monday morning. Yet, even with the losses, NVIDIA shares had quickly plummeted into correction territory midday Friday. Shares sank to a low of $178.91 before rebounding to close the day at $188.15, a slight gain from Thursday’s close. So, the big question facing NVIDIA investors is whether last week’s losses were the result of ‘market noise’ or were a signal of something larger and more troubling. Let’s dive into 3 catalysts that led to this week’s sell-off. The Nasdaq Composite fell more than 3% last week. Tech stocks in particular were under pressure with the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLK) down 4.2% NVIDIA may have fallen 7.1%, but other semiconductor stocks also fell. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) fell 5.5% while AMD (Nasdaq: AMD) plunged 8.8%. The biggest news among this group of companies at the forefront of producing AI accelerators was AMD’s earnings. Overall, the earnings were a positive piece of news for the industry. AMD forecast outlook of $9.6 billion next quarter, far ahead of Wall Street estimates of about $9.2 billion. Looking further out, AMD projects ‘tens of billions’ in revenue from their data center business from 2027. If you’re an ‘AI bull’ who believes the cycle is far from slowing down, AMD’s earnings generally supported that idea. If you’re looking for reasons the broader market took a nose dive this week, it appeared to be a broader ‘risk-off.’ Most days, technology stocks fell, more defensive industries like Financials, Healthcare, and Consumer Staples rose. Macroeconomic headlines like consumer confidence plummeting amidst the continuing government shutdown also rattled markets. Another key reason technology stocks fell this week was OpenAI ‘spooking’ the market. Earlier in the week, comments from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman were widely shared across both social media and within money management circles. In the video (embedded in the X post below), you can see Altman get very defensive about a very reasonable question about the company’s ability to finance aggressive spending plans from venture capitalist Brad Gerstner. Apparently, if you ask @sama how his $13 billion money-losing for profit not-for-profit can support $1.4 TRILLION of spend commitments, he gets very defensive and starts to attack non-existent short sellers.I cannot wait for @OpenAI to be a public company. pic.twitter.com/DTPVJJf86x Another key OpenAI storyline was the Wall Street Journal reporting the company was seeking a government backstop on its data center investments. The comments were made by CFO Sarah Friar in an interview with the paper, and OpenAI tried walking them back as ‘poor wording.’ Yet the damage was done. Investors are quickly reversing course and viewing OpenAI as less of a catalyst in the AI space and more of a risk. The company has been on a barnstorming PR tour for more than a month, announcing major deal after major deal and the longer the PR tour goes, the more ‘bubble talk’ grows. There were other headlines this week that captured the media’s attention, such as Jensen Huang stating ‘China is going to win the AI race’ (another statement that has been walked back). But beyond all the noise, the bottom line for NVIDIA investors is that the actual earnings news was very positive last week. Earlier, we detailed how AMD’s guidance for next quarter was very positive and the company also forecast massive scale into 2027. Another bright spot was optics companies. Lumentum, Fabrinet, and Coherent all forecast extremely strong sales. That’s an important indicator for other AI infrastructure companies, as a surge in optics is just one more datapoint in a major acceleration in data center builds. Overall, NVIDIA saw a big decline this week, but the actual news flow around the company was fairly positive this week, thanks to earnings. Their losses are mostly attributable to investors selling off risk this week and comments from OpenAI leading to added selling pressure on AI stocks.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing rapidly, but it faces significant constraints in power availability and physical space for data centers. While there are abundant graphics processing units (GPUs) available from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the real bottleneck lies in securing affordable, reliable energy to power them and the infrastructure to house them efficiently. This creates opportunities for companies that specialize in converting low-cost power into high-utilization compute resources for AI workloads. Three stocks stand out for their ability to address these issues: Nebius Group (NASDAQ:NBIS), IREN (NASDAQ:IREN), and Cipher Mining (NASDAQ:CIFR). By focusing on efficient data centers, vertical integration, and leased infrastructure, these firms position themselves as key enablers in the AI ecosystem, potentially driving growth as demand for compute surges. Nebius Group leads as a comprehensive AI utility provider, emphasizing pre-sold capacity that generates revenue before construction even starts. This approach minimizes risks and ensures steady cash flow, as its recent five-year, $17 billion deal with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) underscores, as it locks in multi-year contracts. The company’s data centers operate about 20% more power-efficiently than standard cloud facilities, reducing operational costs where energy can account for over 40% of expenses. This efficiency allows Nebius to undercut competitors like Amazon‘s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS or even Microsoft’s Azure while preserving higher margins. What sets Nebius apart is its software integration, offering tools like ClickHouse for data management and MLOps pipelines alongside compute resources. This creates a sticky platform where developers face high switching costs once deployed. The result is a synergistic model: affordable energy, optimized hardware, and embedded software tools reinforce one another, blending energy-like stability with software growth potential. As AI demands escalate, Nebius’s full-stack strategy could capture a larger share of the market by delivering reliable, scalable compute that keeps facilities running at peak capacity. IREN excels by controlling the entire chain from power generation to AI compute delivery, making it one of the most integrated players in the space. With renewable energy costs averaging around $0.035 cents per kilowatt-hour — among North America’s lowest — IREN owns the land, substations, and cooling systems needed for rapid expansion. This ownership enables quick deployment of GPU clusters, with thousands already operational and plans for tens of thousands more in Canada and Texas. The company’s edge comes from eliminating intermediary costs, achieving gross margins over 70% on GPU compute rentals. Management targets 60,000 GPUs by 2026, potentially generating $2.5 billion in cloud revenue as utilization ramps up. Microsoft clearly sees the benefit of farming out the operations and just agreed to a massive $10 billion deal with IREN to provide it with high-performance GPU cloud computing. By owning the power and infrastructure outright, IREN avoids splitting profits with vendors, turning cheap energy into a direct competitive advantage. In an era where space and power limit AI growth, IREN’s model accelerates the conversion of underutilized resources into fully operational compute, helping bridge the gap between abundant GPUs and insufficient energized capacity. Cipher Mining functions as a strategic landlord in the AI buildout, providing powered space to major tenants through long-term leases. Its Barber Lake campus, built for high-density operations and gigawatt-scale expansion, has secured a multi-billion-dollar, decade-long agreement with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), ensuring stable revenue and low counterparty risk. It also just signed another major pact with Amazon to support AI workloads over a 15-year lease agreement, valued at around $5.5 billion. This fixed-rent model offers predictability, though it caps upside from fluctuating GPU prices. Unlike Nebius or IREN, Cipher focuses on the physical layer — land, power, and facilities — without owning the compute hardware. Growth relies on capital raises to develop new sites, resembling an industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) with consistent cash flows. In a market tight on capacity, this positions Cipher well, but it may shift to a more defensive stance as supply increases. Still, by renting out ready-to-use space, Cipher directly tackles AI’s space constraints, enabling hyperscalers to deploy GPUs without the delays of building from scratch.

Title: The modernization mandate: Inside Dell and AMD’s new playbook

UPDATED 13:05 EST / NOVEMBER 09 2025 by Victoria Gayton The modernization mandate is clear: Enterprise IT can no longer wait. Disruptive workloads and brittle legacy systems are forcing companies to act fast, with many now searching for tools that can support a next-generation AI architecture and redefine the data center. The nearly 20-year alliance between Dell Technologies Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. has become a key architectural answer to this shift. Once foundational, the partnership now centers on next-generation AI architecture and private cloud strategy — areas where modernization is no longer optional. The stakes are binary, according to Juan Martinez (pictured), senior director of OEM/ODM enterprise and HPC at AMD. TheCUBE Research’s Rob Strechay talks about the Dell and AMD partnership during the “5 Steps to a Smarter Private Cloud” event. “Our customers, regardless of the industry … are facing two potential outcomes,” Martinez told theCUBE. “One outcome is [to] be a disruptor in their industry, which will be great for them, or be disrupted by someone else.” Dell and AMD’s shared focus on efficiency and cost resonates with enterprise buyers. Their integrated approach offers a stable alternative to unpredictable public cloud expenses and tackles core pain points, according to Rob Strechay, principal analyst at theCUBE. “I think that one of the things that’s really interesting is … that not only helps from a density perspective, power and cooling, but also licensing costs when you’re looking at software that are licensed that way,” Strechay said during the recent “5 Steps to a Smarter Private Cloud” event. “We see it from the … organizations we talk to on a daily basis.” This feature is part of SiliconANGLE Media’s ongoing exploration into enterprise modernization and next-generation infrastructure ecosystems. (* Disclosure below.) While AI’s growing influence drives enterprise modernization, Dell and AMD’s real-world impact is already visible in the budget. Their joint solutions are delivering measurable cost relief to IT teams today. Dell’s broader approach to silicon optionality — offering customers a choice between AMD, Intel Corp. and Nvidia Corp. — allows organizations to match the right performance and price-per-watt profile to each unique workload, according to theCUBE’s Dave Vellante. AMD’s Juan Martinez talks with theCUBE about the AMD-Dell partnership. The joint engineering between Dell PowerEdge and AMD’s EPYC processor line is designed to tackle two major pressures: rising AI compute demands and the need to extend the value of existing infrastructure, thereby enabling the next-generation AI architecture, according to Martinez. The strategy is especially effective in virtualized environments, where maximizing server output is key to reducing overall infrastructure sprawl. “When we look into what we are offering between Dell PowerEdge and our AMD EPYC portfolio, basically we are getting that customers are able to run a larger number of virtual machines per server versus what they used to do in the past,” Martinez told theCUBE. “They are able to get up to 192 cores of performance, high memory bandwidth, and on top of that, we are able to bring a comprehensive path for migration.” This emphasis on efficiency isn’t just theory. Dell and AMD currently hold two world records for VMware performance per socket, highlighting their ability to drive greater density, smarter power management and stronger cost efficiency, according to Martinez. Early customer results back it up: Some have reduced hardware usage by as much as 90%, unlocking the budgetary freedom to focus more on innovation. “AMD EPYC is basically putting all the higher core count, the high memory bandwidth, and that is putting all the comprehensive path to manage all the transition in a way that is making sense from a technical standpoint and AMD standpoint,” Martinez said. “We’re working with Dell very actively to have co-engineering tools that help them to have a comprehensive path to maximize their private clouds and the solutions that they’re running in those private clouds.” As AI workloads become more varied and distributed, system designers are shifting away from monolithic architectures toward balanced, co-engineered infrastructure to support next-generation AI architecture. Dell and AMD’s collaborative approach to building PowerEdge systems with AMD’s Turin family tailors configurations to support AI deployments of all sizes — not just the largest hyperscale use cases, according to David Schmidt, senior director of PowerEdge product management at Dell, and Derek Dicker, corporate vice president, enterprise and HPC business groups at AMD. Dell’s Alyson Langon and Alison Briers talk with theCUBE about the Dell and AMD partnership. “When we sat down and first started discussing Turin with AMD, we recognized that there’s different sizes for different parts of customer journeys, what they need to deploy in their data center,” Schmidt told theCUBE. ”We looked at how AMD was laying out Turin, the Turin stack from top to bottom, and we really challenged each other on what we needed to provide. We were bringing system design ideas to the table of serving customers that need eight cores, 16 cores. It’s not all about the highest core counts possible; it’s about providing the right range.” As hardware density and core counts increase, the pressure on power and cooling infrastructure becomes a key design constraint. This demand is driving a shift back to on-premises control, with customers seeking to avoid high variable costs and gain predictable total cost of ownership, according to Alyson Langon, director of product marketing at Dell, and Alison Biers, global marketing senior director for server, networking and vertical industries at Dell. “[Customers] need predictable [total cost of ownership] so that they can have better budget control,” Briers told theCUBE. “They also want to avoid vendor lock-in with a modular, open infrastructure that can provide that ease of portability, as well as flexibility, and they really want to keep control of their data. They need to keep that data local and secure for stronger compliance and security … they need visibility to the future costs, and they want to … have that across their organization, whether it comes from departments within their organizations or from IT.” Dell’s updated AI Factory architecture is designed to meet enterprises where they are — whether starting small with device-level AI or scaling into full multi-rack deployments. With support for multiple accelerator vendors, the platform enables organizations to choose the right hardware configuration for their workloads without lock-in. This flexibility allows enterprises to evolve from early pilots to mature, production-scale AI faster and with lower risk, according to Adam Glick, senior director of AI portfolio marketing at Dell. Dell’s Adam Glick talks with theCUBE about the Dell AI Factory. “The AI transformation that we’re seeing is really a Cambrian explosion,” Glick told theCUBE. “You’re talking about the people who are on the forefront or not. You need to avoid being left behind because what you can do with AI is just amazing.” The platform’s modular design is backed by a rigorously tested stack of hardware, networking and software components, including Dell’s Application Catalog, support for Hugging Face Inc.’s open-weight models and optimized on-premises deployment workflows. For companies managing infrastructure complexity and resource constraints, Dell’s emphasis on validated, full-stack solutions — in collaboration with partners such as AMD and Red Hat Inc. — simplifies rollouts and accelerates time-to-value for the next-generation AI architecture. “There’s a lot of work that’s gone together to integrate these two pieces,” Glick said. “It’s not just the hardware pieces and the machines that go together, but it’s also the networking and the software stack, [which is] tested, integrated [and] optimized to be able to deploy that and deploy it fast and at scale to deliver solutions that our customers are looking for.” The operational reality of running an AI Factory hinges on addressing siloed, fragmented data, which Dell solves with its AI Data Platform. A critical feature of this platform is the architectural decoupling of data storage (leveraging Dell PowerScale and ObjectScale) from data processing engines, eliminating bottlenecks and providing the essential flexibility for advanced AI workloads such as retrieval-augmented generation and next-generation AI architecture. This modular, open-architecture approach empowers organizations to move from AI pilots to full production faster and with reduced risk, according to Travis Vigil, senior vice president of ISC product management at Dell. “With our Dell AI Data Platform, storage engines and data engines are each optimized for what they do best, working together, but independently,” Travis said during an interview with theCUBE. That means no bottlenecks, no lock-in — just the freedom to innovate on your terms. By separating data processing from storage, we eliminate friction and reduce solution costs.” Together, Dell and AMD are proving that modernization isn’t just about new technology — it’s about giving enterprises the architectural freedom to innovate at their own pace, according to Strechay.

Title: Southern California’s Main Street economy rattled by inflation, ICE raids and tariffs

Evidence of economic pain is rippling across Southern California, hitting businesses big and small. Until last month, Simon Yoon ran a popular sushi restaurant tucked away in a Diamond Bar strip center where commuters often stopped to pick up a bite to eat while waiting out the rush hour congestion at the nearby 57 and 60 freeway interchange. Yoon shuttered his restaurant, Fusion 2 Any 1, because he could no longer make ends meet due to a wave of policy decisions to remake the economy by President Donald Trump, who’s just under a year in office now. Yoon said he could no longer afford the $14,000 monthly rent and rising expenses caused by tariffs that tripled the price of everything from a box of chopsticks and a bag of garlic to plastic knives, forks and avocados. “I couldn’t raise my prices to the consumers,” said Yoon, who didn’t want to push away his regulars. “I cut lots of labor.” Also see: Economy shows ‘resilience’ despite ‘thorny issues,’ CSUF economists say He also blamed the drop-off in customers on raids and tactics used in recent weeks by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in Diamond Bar, which created a climate of fear in the community. “It’s hurting a lot of business,” Yoon said. “Catching criminals is great, but not everyone is a criminal. There are a lot of hard-working people that are having their families broken up. That’s sad to see.” The 48-year-old Yoon voted for Trump a year ago but now regrets it. “I’m hoping for the best, but nobody comes out to eat,” he said. Yoon isn’t the only business owner barely making ends meet these days. Businesses across Southern California have shed thousands of workers amid a slowing economy, many citing similar reasons to Yoon’s — stretching from Anaheim to Ontario and Pasadena. On Thursday, global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported that last month was the worst October for layoff announcements since 2003. California saw 158,734 people laid off from Jan. 1-Oct. 31, up 16% over last year’s 136,661 — the second-largest employment cuts nationwide, according to the outplacement firm. Cuts in federal funding — fueled by the longest-running federal government shutdown, now at 40 days — also are having their effects. Tariff wars with foreign nations over imports have rattled local businesses, as some are struggling with inflation and labor issues. Cal State University Fullerton economists Anil Puri and Mira Farka and other economists with UCLA Anderson and Beacon Economics recently delivered cautionary forecasts on the state of the economy. Underscoring the concerns, the CSUF economists said that inflation is expected to likely continue to “edge higher into the first quarter of next year,” though they do not expect it to get out of hand, anticipating a peak of around 3.5%.” They added that inflation has “yet to crest,” and “the labor market has yet to find its floor — though neither is expected to inflict as much pain as once feared.” The current annual inflation rate for the U.S. was 3% for the year period ending in September. New inflation statistics published by the regional Consumer Price Indexes for September show an 3.5% inflation rate for Los Angeles and Orange counties. That’s the biggest cost-of-living bump in 16 months. The economists said they wouldn’t be surprised if the remainder of the year is marked by “a few more bumps, with payrolls weakening further as firms await clarity on trade deals, the government shutdown and overall consumer demand.” Layoffs in the region have picked up from a year ago, according to the government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, the official federal agency that keeps track of jobs data. The BLS paused updates during the government’s shutdown that began Oct. 1. In August, the unemployment rate in Orange County stood at 4.6%, down from a revised 4.8% in July 2025, but above the year-ago estimate of 4.5%. Similar unemployment trends were reported in Los Angeles County (6.3% in August), Riverside County (6.1%) and San Bernardino County (6.1%). Puri and Farka said people should brace for sticker shock when the government reopens, revising figures on job losses and “alarming” hiring conditions. In the past month, Anaheim theme park Disneyland laid off 100 salaried employees as Orange County’s largest employer recalibrates its business ahead of the busy Christmas holiday season. Amazon also is cutting 760 jobs in Southern California — 333 in Irvine — beginning in January as part of a shakeup driven by artificial intelligence, and Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino Counties laid off 81 people as it shutters Melody Health, its primary care practice, due to federal budget cuts. Other layoffs in October: Some companies even feel the time is ripe to sell. In August, Las Vegas-based Silver State HVAC, Refrigeration & Plumbing acquired The Whitman Co. in Anaheim. “We wanted to avoid a fire sale,” said Linda Whitman, manager of the business and married to owner Fred Whitman, who pointed to the rising cost of doing business in California and plans to retire while the going was good. She said profit margins were shrinking due to the rising prices of commercial-grade heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems since the pandemic when supplies tightened, plus challenges emerging in the past year with tariffs. “We sold primarily for retirement purposes, but it also was driven by what you’ve heard a million times. It’s getting impossible to run a business in California,” Whitman said. “It’s hard to sustain that when costs for workers’ compensation and liability insurance are going up 25% year-over-year, in addition to labor costs and everything else. “One of our big customers is a chain restaurant, and they have been struggling, and that of course affects us,” said Whitman, whose company has avoided layoffs by cutting back hours during certain times of the year. “If we weren’t going to be retiring, it would have been for all the other reasons that we might sell. Our sales have been increasing, but our profitability has not.” In Ontario, local shopkeepers are also worried about the economy. In May 2024, Javier Barajas and his wife, Tania Mangas, took over the Tortas Ahogadas Chapala restaurant in downtown Ontario along G Street. It’s located in a strip center across the street from the popular El Pescador Mexican restaurant along Euclid Avenue — which was packed on Tuesday with a lunchtime crowd of city probation officers and office workers. “People are scared,” said Barajas of the ICE raids. Also see: Inland Empire ICE detainees include gardeners, students, fathers Recent ICE operations in Ontario have dampened dining out and shopping. Business owners interviewed cited high-profile incidents like a landscaper being detained inside a surgical center in July, and a shooting during a vehicle stop in October. Other incidents include the taking into custody of at least three people at a Stater Bros. Markets along Holt Boulevard and arrests of gardeners. Tariffs have not treated Barajas very well, as the price for meats added to Mexican dishes have doubled. On Tuesday, there were a handful of customers eating at the restaurant — which he says was busier before the raids began in the community this past summer. For instance, he said, a chuck roll — a large boneless cut of beef from the shoulder of the cow — shot to $7.50 from $3.80 a pound last year, while a pound of ranchera meat — a higher premium type of beef cut, most commonly used in Mexican dishes like carne asada — jumped to $10.50 from $7 a pound. He says beef prices are up because tariffs have led to higher overhead costs for feed, fuel and labor that have contributed to higher prices consumers see at the grocery store and in their bills at restaurants — like at his. “It’s super hard to make money. I spend all of my money on the restaurant,” said Barajas, who has posted a “help wanted” sign on his restaurant’s front door to fill a cook opening. At the JROD Insurance Agency just south of El Pescador, owner Jesse Rodriguez said that his business is barely getting by. “We used to get walk-in business every time the Route 66 car show was held in Ontario. I didn’t get one customer this time,” said Rodriguez of the 12th annual Route 66 Cruisin’ Reunion that roared into downtown Ontario on Sept. 19. “There’s a slowdown everywhere here in town.” Andres Torres, co-owner of Mission Furniture along Euclid, said that he saw furniture sales climb in the early days of the pandemic when everyone was locked down in their homes and shopping online. Sales have since tapered off, and profits have narrowed in line with a slowing economy he saw before Trump’s election. But another slowdown has emerged with Trump administration-imposed tariffs on Vietnam and China, causing furniture prices to edge up 5-10%, Torres said. “It’s tough, but I’m looking to the future to get ahead of the curve,” said Torres of development projects for housing and more potential shoppers coming in Ontario’s downtown area. “Our intention is to survive this, but the ICE raids don’t help.” Diamond Bar’s Yoon might be temporarily down, but he’s come up with a survival plan for his business. He recently took an offer from a business colleague to open his restaurant in a section of the Gangnam Korean BBQ along Golden Springs Drive, across the street from the Diamond Bar Golf Course. If Yoon can turn his sushi-take out spot profitable, he may end up owning the new restaurant within Gangnam, and begin paying rent to its owner. For now, however, he’s content with managing the bar and restaurant in half the space of his old one a mile away. “I don’t want to leave at the bottom because I did so much for the community,” he said. “I want to go on for a few more years.”

Title: Why BlackRock remains bullish on Bitcoin despite recent price slowdown

BlackRock frames Bitcoin's adoption, liquidity depth, and legacy system decline as drivers of long-term strategic value. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin’s recent struggle to hold the $100,000 level has revived familiar doubts about whether institutional demand is durable. However, in a new filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, BlackRock signals the opposite conclusion, saying its conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term relevance remains intact despite short-term market weakness. The firm frames Bitcoin as a decades-long structural theme shaped by adoption curves, liquidity depth, and the declining credibility of legacy monetary systems. While this view acknowledges volatility, it argues that Bitcoin’s strategic value is accelerating faster than its price suggests. That tone contrasts with a market where each pullback often renews questions about institutional endurance. A central pillar of BlackRock’s argument is Bitcoin’s network-growth profile, which it describes as one of the fastest seen in any modern technology cycle. The filing cites adoption estimates showing that Bitcoin surpassed 300 million global users roughly 12 years after launch, outpacing both mobile phones and the early internet, which each took significantly longer to reach similar thresholds. For BlackRock, this curve is more than a data point. It reframes Bitcoin as a long-duration asset whose value reflects cumulative network participation rather than month-to-month price moves. The firm also includes a decade-long performance matrix showing that, despite wild swings in individual years, which often place Bitcoin at either the top or bottom of annual return tables, its cumulative and annualized performance still exceeds that of equities, gold, commodities, and bonds. That framing positions volatility as a built-in cost of exposure rather than a structural flaw. For an asset manager whose products are designed for multi-decade allocations rather than short-cycle momentum trades, temporary stagnation appears less like a warning and more like a familiar feature of Bitcoin’s cyclical rhythm. The filing also emphasizes that the asset’s current slowdown has not dented institutional participation. If anything, BlackRock argues, Bitcoin’s underlying fundamentals of digital adoption, macroeconomic uncertainty, and the expansion of regulated market infrastructure continue to strengthen even as spot prices cool. A second theme in the filing is the argument that BlackRock’s own product, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has reshaped access to the asset in ways that support deeper institutional involvement. The firm highlights three areas, including simplified exposure, enhanced liquidity, and the integration of regulated custody and pricing rails. BlackRock stated that IBIT reduces operational frictions by allowing institutions to hold Bitcoin through a structure they already understand. According to the firm, custody risks, key-management issues, and technical onboarding, which have historically been barriers for institutions, are abstracted away in favor of traditional settlement channels. At the same time, BlackRock also highlighted liquidity as one of the most significant impacts IBIT has had on the market. Since its launch, the product has become the most actively traded Bitcoin ETF, contributing to tighter spreads and deeper order books. For large allocators, execution quality acts as a form of validation: the more liquid the product, the more institutionally acceptable the underlying asset becomes. Moreover, BlackRock also highlighted its multi-year infrastructure work with Coinbase Prime, regulated price benchmarks, and strict audit frameworks as evidence that Bitcoin exposure can now be delivered with standards comparable to equities or fixed income. Because of that design, the firm has processed more than $3 billion in in-kind transfers — a sign, it says, of institutional and whale confidence in its custody architecture. Notably, IBIT flows reinforce all of the points above. Since its launch, IBIT has emerged as the dominant Bitcoin ETF product in the market, with cumulative net inflows of $64.45 billion and over $80 billion in assets under management. In fact, IBIT’s inflows for this year have outpaced all of the combined flows recorded by the other 10 Bitcoin products in the market, according to K33 Research data. The most assertive section of the filing is labeled “global monetary alternative.” BlackRock describes Bitcoin as a scarce, decentralized asset positioned to benefit from persistent geopolitical disorder, rising debt burdens, and long-term erosion in fiat credibility. The firm does not frame Bitcoin as a direct replacement for sovereign currencies, but the implication is clear: the asset’s relevance increases as traditional monetary systems face stress. BlackRock also situates Bitcoin within a broader technological transition. As the most widely adopted cryptocurrency, Bitcoin functions as a proxy bet on the mainstreaming of digital-asset infrastructure, including blockchain-based payments, settlement systems, and financial market rails. In this context, Bitcoin has two intertwined identities as a monetary hedge and a technological exposure. This dual narrative helps explain BlackRock’s sustained bullishness. One pillar of the thesis is macroeconomic, tied to inflation dynamics, fiscal trajectory, and geopolitical fragmentation. The other is structural, tied to the ongoing global expansion of blockchain networks. Considering this, the recent slow price action does not meaningfully disrupt either thesis.

Title: Elizabeth Warren’s Forked Tongue: Leftism for Thee, But Not for Me

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. (Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty Images) Paul Sperry / @paulsperry_ Paul Sperry is an investigative reporter for RealClearInvestigations. When Sen. Elizabeth A. Warren recently traveled to the Big Apple to endorse New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, she was asked if overt socialism is really the best model for Democrats to adopt. “You bet,” she replied in her signature folksy style. The Boston lawmaker wasn’t just jumping on the sudden trendiness of socialism three-and-a-half decades after its near-extinction. With Senate fellow traveler Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Warren has been a catalyst for moving her party to the left since her first campaign in 2012. She and Sanders are, in many ways, the godparents of the self-avowed democratic socialists such as Mamdani and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who are providing the youthful energy for the Democrats in the Trump era. As Warren’s attacks on Wall Street and the wealthy are gaining even wider traction among liberals—a recent Gallup poll found 66% of Democrats have a positive view of socialism—the apparent contradictions between her public economic positions and private financial decisions are receiving new scrutiny, particularly as the onetime presidential candidate appears to be testing those waters again. Financial records examined by RealClearInvestigations show that Warren has hardly followed the path of socialism in her personal finances. Start with the redistribution of wealth. Warren tirelessly bashes the “selfish” and “greedy” rich for not paying their “fair share,” and demands the government step in and redistribute their income to the poor. But charity does not always begin in the Warren home. While Warren hauls in nearly $1 million a year, she donated less than 3% of her household income to charity in 2024, according to her tax returns. This is much less than the charity of the Obamas, for instance, who typically donate more than 20% of their earnings to the needy and philanthropic causes, and low for the average American in her income bracket, studies show. The average millionaire donates more than twice her share. It also appears that Warren opens her pocketbook wider when she’s running for national office and under a bigger media microscope. The $26,669 in charitable deductions Warren reported on her tax returns last year pales in comparison to the $81,858, or 9% of income, she reported as she launched her campaign for the White House in 2020. And the outspoken Democratic leader keeps her own tax burden down while calling for higher taxes on “millionaires and billionaires.” Records show Warren is not averse to taking maximum advantage of provisions in a tax code she denounces as unfair. She has, for example, written off used articles of clothing on her taxes and has had to correct past returns for inflating the value of those items. She’s also written off thousands of dollars in used books—and even in-flight Wi-Fi—to expense down business income. And she would exempt herself from her proposed “Ultra-Millionaire Tax,” which levies a surtax on those with a net worth above $50 million. With a net worth of at least $8 million (with estimates as high as $12 million), Warren has benefited handsomely from free market capitalism—even as she has spent most of her career in the public and educational sectors. Despite her frequent complaints that “the wealthiest 10% of U.S. households own 84% of American-held shares” of stock, she has invested the bulk of her money in stocks and bonds managed by Wall Street investment funds. These accounts are valued at between $1.9 million and $6.8 million, according to her most recent Senate financial disclosures, filed in April. (Values are given as ranges in the disclosure reports that members of Congress are required to file each year.) Although Warren has rarely traded individual stocks, records show the mutual funds where she has parked her millions—Vanguard and TIAA-CREF—hold a number of companies in industries that Warren has demonized, including Big Oil, Big Tech, and Big Pharma. Through these funds, for example, Warren has invested in Apple, Amazon, and NVIDIA; Exxon and Shell; Wells Fargo; Goldman Sachs; Monsanto; Johnson & Johnson; and even NewsCorp.—the owner of conservative Fox News and the New York Post. Nevertheless, Warren has ripped “fat cat bankers” at Wells Fargo for preying on minority homebuyers and customers with “predatory” rates and “junk” fees, and also for “screwing” their own employees. She even demanded the Federal Reserve revoke Wells Fargo’s status as a financial holding company over “abusive and unlawful” practices. Warren has called for regulators to break up tech giants Amazon and Apple, which she claims are running monopolies. “I’m sick of freeloading [tech] billionaires” who “roll over everyone,” she said recently. Warren has described Exxon as a “bad actor” that contributes to global warming. She’s even accused the energy giant of “corporate perjury” by publicly denying its alleged role in warming and producing “fake research” to “mislead the American people about climate change.” The senator has also slammed Exxon for “imposing massive price increases on Americans [sic] families,” arguing “this corporate greed is inexcusable.” Environmental activist groups have called on her chosen retirement fund, TIAA, to divest from Exxon, along with the rest of its more than $78 billion in oil, gas, and coal assets, according to a recent estimate by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. They argue the fund is using contributions from investors like Warren to “destroy communities and the environment.” Last year, Warren bashed Donald Trump for capitulating to the oil industry. “Donald Trump has a deal for Big Oil: if they raise $1 billion and send him back to the White House, he’ll gut environmental protections and roll back Joe Biden’s progress in fighting climate change,” she asserted on the social media platform X. “It’s corruption, pure and simple. And it would be a disaster for our planet.” Slamming the president’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill” earlier this year, Warren complained, “Trump’s tax cuts stand to benefit [the] highest-income earners.” She would know: She’s one of them. The $919,583 in household income Warren reported on her 2024 tax return she filed jointly with her husband puts her in the top 1% of highest-earning Americans. The year before she entered the Senate, Warren reported earning $616,181. The lawmaker’s base Senate salary of $174,000 accounts for just one-fifth of the total income she reported to the IRS. The rest comes from book royalties, dividends, capital gains, earned interest, retirement income, and husband Bruce Mann’s salary as a tenured Harvard professor. The Senate is often described as a Millionaire’s Club, and she fits right in: Her $8 million net worth would rank her as the 18th wealthiest member of the Senate, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Warren’s net worth has risen each year since she was first elected to the Senate in 2012, while the median wealth of senators overall has declined, according to the think tank. Although Warren is just one of many millionaires in Congress, government watchdogs note her wealth is at odds with the stridency of her class-warfare rhetoric. “Elizabeth Warren poses as the champion of the underdog, but her policies strip middle- and lower-income Americans of opportunities to advance their lot and build wealth,” said John Berlau, director of finance policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington, referring to her calls for more taxes and financial red tape. “By pursuing policies that keep others from moving up, Sen. Warren has emerged as an unlikely champion of the existing 1%.” Warren did not reply to requests for comment. Critics note that several of Warren’s former staff members have moved on to positions in the sectors she decries. In 2023, she declared, “The abuse of the revolving door is appalling,” particularly in the financial sector, which she claims is “rigged to help the wealthy and well-connected.” But records show her own office has served as a revolving door for the banks. For example, Wally Adeyemo, who served as her chief of staff when she was standing up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, went on to work as a senior adviser at investment giant BlackRock. At least six other Warren staffers who worked in her Senate office have worked as lobbyists, records show. In addition, several of her senior campaign aides have worked on K Street. “There is a history of a revolving door of Warren staffers and protégés at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau taking jobs at big Wall Street firms, such as BlackRock,” Berlau said. Homeownership is also key to wealth-building, but zoning restrictions often price the working class out of homes. Warren has fought against so-called NIMBY (“not in my backyard”) rules and has fiercely advocated for building more affordable housing in cities. She even backs Mamdani’s “social housing” proposal to let the New York state government seize private properties and convert them into public housing. However, Warren has chosen to live in affluent neighborhoods in Boston and in Washington, D.C., that are heavily zoned to exclude the construction of new housing units and price out the average homebuyer. Public financial statements do not disclose the 76-year-old legislator’s real estate holdings, but other records show she owns at least two homes valued at more than $5 million. Her primary residence is located in the leafy Avon Hill section of Cambridge, Mass., which has enforced a century-old zoning system of minimum lot sizes, minimum parking requirements, floor area ratios, limits on units per building, and height restrictions. The restrictions have yielded a housing shortage in the city that has driven up the value of existing homes—including Warren’s 1876 Victorian mansion, which has risen eightfold to an estimated $4 million since she bought it in 1995. Records show she and her husband owe no mortgage on their nearly 4,000-square-foot home, which features three stories, high ceilings, marble mantels, hardwood floors, and a four-car garage. The median price for a home in Cambridge now tops $2.2 million. “The astronomical increase in the value of Warren’s home, and home prices in Cambridge more generally, has not happened in a vacuum,” said Scott Van Voorhis, a Boston real estate analyst. “The city’s special blend of upscale NIMBYism and restrictive zoning laws and regulations kept new house, condo, and apartment construction to a trickle at best, even as demand for living in the city increased leaps and bounds.” Though the Cambridge City Council earlier this year loosened its zoning ordinances to permit more housing across the city, Warren’s neighborhood remains largely exempt from reforms. That’s because Avon Hill is a conservation district further regulated by the Cambridge Historical Commission. Records show Warren’s street and home are located within the historic district, which protects old Victorians from being torn down for multifamily housing. That makes her neighborhood the ultimate safe NIMBY zone. “Nothing has been built [in her neighborhood] for decades beyond the occasional mansion upgrade,” Van Voorhis noted. Warren clearly understands there is a housing supply problem in Boston. In July, she helped shepherd the ROAD to Housing Act through the Senate, which, among other things, would provide grants to communities that change their land-use rules to make it easier to build new housing units. “We have a real problem here in Massachusetts that we simply don’t have enough housing,” Warren explained to The Boston Globe, noting the state is about 200,000 units short of what is needed. “If we don’t start building more housing here, the housing crisis will continue to intensify.” But when it comes to her own neighborhood—one of the least affordable in the state—she remains silent. Cambridge City Council members noted they didn’t hear “a peep” from Warren when they were recently debating zoning reforms to deal with the city’s growing housing affordability crisis. In 2013, when Warren bought her home in Washington, D.C., she also happened to select an area of the capital city where zoning restrictions have entrenched the status quo. Valued at more than $1 million, her condo is in the trendy Penn Quarter section of the District of Columbia, which is a historic area protected by land-use rules. Most famously, Warren’s personal decisions seem at odds with the Left’s leavening of traditional socialist positions with identity politics. Before moving to the Senate, Warren was a tenured professor at Harvard with a lucrative salary. Although the school denies that her claims to Native American ancestry influenced their decision to hire her, she and the administration trumpeted her diverse background. Warren also listed herself as a racial minority in a legal directory distributed by the Association of American Law Schools and was listed as a Native American in federal forms filed by Harvard Law School. When she launched her political career in 2012 and released a memoir, “A Fighting Chance,” Warren described her alleged “Native American roots” as a Cherokee. Henry Holt & Company paid her a $525,000 advance for the book, which became a national bestseller that still earns her royalties. She also helped publish a cookbook, “Pow Wow Chow,” exploiting the myth of her Native American lineage. Warren took in $430,000 a year as a tenured Harvard Law professor by claiming a Native American heritage—even as she has railed against whites appropriating minority culture or pretending to understand minority experiences. But, as she ramped up her run for the White House, Warren responded to persistent challenges of this claim by taking a DNA test. In late 2018, her campaign maintained it showed “strong evidence” of Native American ancestry dating back generations. When that failed to quiet her critics, Warren basically had to acknowledge that the test revealed that she is as little as 1/1,024th Native American, making her less of that ancestry than the average white American. She also eventually apologized to the Cherokee Nation in 2019. The year before that admission, however, she lectured others during her Senate campaign about stolen valor: “It is wrong and cowardly for people to make fraudulent statements in order to receive distinctions that they have not earned. We need to ensure that no one can benefit from making false claims and steal the true valor of the courageous.” “If there ever were a genuine case of cultural appropriation, Sen. Warren is guilty of it,” said Gad Saad, a business professor at Concordia University, adding: She literally appropriated Native American culture as her own by constructing a false narrative about her ancestry. “And yet,” he added, “she benefited for several decades from this false narrative, both in her academic and political career.” Saad and others who have closely followed her career suggest the progressive senator appears to have a “good for me, but not for thee” ethic when it comes to her own personal ambitions. Though she’s carefully groomed a reputation as a fighter for the “have-nots” against the “haves,” the record shows that, outside the spotlight, she has often pursued her own interests and followed the path of the haves.

Title: Home debut a 'pretty special' experience for O'Brien

Neil Treacy RTÉ Sport Journalist After his short international career to date had taken him through Tbilisi, Lisbon and Chicago, Tommy O'Brien was finally able to enjoy the real deal at home. The 27-year-old Dubliner won his fourth Irish cap in Saturday's 41-10 win against Japan, but his first in front of an Aviva audience. Friends and family in the crowd, Amhrán na bhFiann, and a different kind of nervous excitement. "That was pretty special," he said of the experience. "I had some family out. My grandparents came out; they haven’t been to a game since I was probably 18. They’re proper glory supporters, they came out for the Irish game. No, I’m only messing. "I was having a look during the anthems to see if I could spot anyone but I didn’t, which was probably a good thing. It might have sent me over the edge. But it was good, really special." The Leinster wing (below) was the standout player in an otherwise forgettable game of rugby, earning the man of the match award for a performance that saw him run for 143 metres off 12 carries, while making four clean breaks and winning two turnovers. He capped the day off with a try right at the end, but it was a score that capped off an excellent individual display rather than one which defined it. Drifting inside Sam Prendergast off a turnover, O’Brien steamed onto a delicate offload from the out-half before stepping on the gas to score his fifth international try, and first at Lansdowne Road. "Me and Sammy were on the same page, I could see he was going across but he didn’t have the wheels to take it the whole way so I dropped under him and he knew what I was going to do. It was nice to be on the same page like that. "I gave a nice little fist pump into the crowd afterwards, which was cool, but I was blowing hard getting back. "Sammy gave me a nice 50-metre run-in so I had to give it my all. I couldn’t get caught there!" The Blackrock man has taken to international rugby excellently after injuries forced his career to stutter during his mid-20s. He dipped his toe into the Test game during the summer versus Georgia and Portugal, scoring two tries in each of those games, and with Mack Hansen out injured, he was retained in the 14 shirt for the first two matches of this Quilter Nations Series block. "Obviously the summer tour was great to get in and get a taste of it, and then the last few weeks were a step up in terms of the level," he said. "The All Blacks game was very physical but I felt like I belonged at that level. I didn’t feel like I was shocked or anything like that but it’s just the margins are very small and you’ve got to nail every little small moment." FT: Ireland 41-10 Japan Much better from Ireland in the second half with Tommy O'Brien with their final try in their win over Japan at the Aviva Stadium. 📺 RTÉ2 🖥️ https://t.co/b2OI4OoWVJ ✍️ https://t.co/x26q4bjNM0 pic.twitter.com/B3s3dgkVmz It has taken O'Brien longer than he would have liked to become an Ireland international, but that isn't necessarily a negative as he reflects on the player he is today. "I'm also probably a lot more mature than I would have been, maybe if I was 22 or 23 or whatever. "So that probably helps me in terms of not being as nervous coming into the games. "I feel like I've worked very hard. I've had so many downs, so I just enjoy these kind of experiences, in these days. "I guess when you’re in [the game] it’s another rugby game, you’ve been doing it your whole life. I’ve been playing it since I was four years old. It’s kind of what I’ve been telling myself before I go out, 'it’s just another game of rugby’. "Obviously, you want to be able to feed off the crowd and the magnitude of everything and allow yourself to go to another level in terms of finding stuff within you physically that you didn’t realise you had, and using the crowd in that capacity. "But in terms of weighing on you and nervousness, I’ve actually been okay thankfully. Yeah really enjoying myself so far." © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Liberal Elites Kicked the Door Wide Open for Trump’s Flagrant Corruption

© THE INTERCEPT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED The president’s corruption is audaciously out in the open, but decades of letting the wealthy play by their own rules enabled him. Dylan is a senior researcher at the Revolving Door Project, where she leads RDP’s Economic Media Project. In his first term, Donald Trump appeared to be gunning for the title of most corrupt president in U.S. history. But after taking advantage of four years on the sidelines to ruminate about how to do better, he’s blown all competition completely out of the water in the nine months since retaking the Oval Office. Trump set off a media firestorm in 2017 by breaking from tradition and not placing his assets in a blind trust, instead choosing to entrust them to his children. The conflicts of interest invited by this farce were met with lawsuits, and #Resistance activists spoke about the emoluments clause of the Constitution as though they were constitutional law professors. Some reporting called this a “halfway blind” trust, which is sort of like a halfway-cooked chicken in that, for practical purposes, it’s a nonstarter. But after Trump left office in 2021, the Supreme Court dismissed the lawsuits, and Merrick Garland, Biden’s spineless attorney general, slow-rolled any investigations into the former president. Faced with few consequences for this first round of graft, Trump and company have flouted even the appearance of adhering to ethical guidelines since his reelection in November. The presidential transition process was delayed by the Trump campaign not filing internal ethics guidance for the transition team, and the inauguration fund’s coffers were filled with many millions of dollars from donors eager to get on the president’s good side. That panhandling set the tone for the administration. In October, a Trump benefactor gave $130 million to stave off what would have been a major political liability and cover the paychecks for service members during the government shutdown. The office space Eleanor Roosevelt once occupied has been unceremoniously bulldozed to make way for a gargantuan ballroom, also being funded by corporate “donations” from the likes of BlackRock, Booz Allen Hamilton, and tech giants like Apple and Amazon. The sticker price of the project has soared from $200 million to $350 million. To add insult to injury, the donors will likely write off their bribes to the latest Trump event venue as charitable contributions, as economist Dean Baker laid out. The president is working to intervene in negotiations around the sale of Warner Brothers–Discovery to ensure that his longtime supporters, the Ellisons, are able to add on to their growing media empire. And that’s just the past couple of weeks! It’s not for nothing that my colleagues at the Revolving Door Project have had more than enough material for a biweekly rundown in our Corruption Calendar. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington also recently published a timeline tracking national and state corruption since January 20. While Trumpian corruption is striking in frequency, scale, and just how routine it is starting to feel, this administration was the logical endpoint of the long-standing tradition of elite impunity. The second Trump administration is a striking monument to governmental misconduct, but the ground was broken long ago, with both parties laying the foundation. For the past half century, corporate and white-collar crime have gone largely unenforced. This was the result of both a widespread shift in views of governance (à la the Reagan Revolution) and a coordinated plan orchestrated to enable private wealth to hijack our democracy, as David Sirota and Jared Jacang Maher documented in their new book “Master Plan,” building on a podcast of the same name. Trump himself is a byproduct of the wealthy being empowered to violate the law. Seemingly his entire pre-government career was predicated on getting away with gaming bankruptcy law, committing widespread financial fraud, and racial discrimination. Now, in government, he is employing the “blitzscaling” model pioneered by firms like Uber to break the law faster than anyone can keep up with. The relentlessness of the Trump administration’s criminality is the point; it becomes borderline impossible to tackle any single instance of corruption if two more spring up by the time you finish reading up on it. This “flood the zone” strategy has been the hallmark of Trump 2.0. Original reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?

Calls for Democrats to find their way back from the wilderness by forcefully rebuking corporate influence and corruption, something we at the Revolving Door Project have been urging as the cornerstone of progressive politics for years, are multiplying. Politicians, notably Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff and Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, both Democrats, are emerging as anti-corruption champions. To mount a real anti-corruption agenda, though, Democrats must go farther than just condemning the sundry glad-handing of Trump world. There is no appetite for going back to the halcyon days when everyone knew the legal code was merely a suggestion for corporate titans and the ultra-rich, even as they masqueraded as law-abiding citizens. “ Since 2008, it has only become more apparent that the wealthy play by an entirely different set of rules.” The Great Recession was a turning point; the extent of corporate lawbreaking in the financial sector was laid bare. And, famously, hardly anyone ever went to jail. Obama-era regulators, in many ways the acme of our last half-century of the hands-off approach to ruling-class misconduct, earned rebuke and scorn as “the chickenshit club,” afraid to square up against the powerful, if not overtly committed to serve elite interests. Since 2008, it has only become more apparent that the wealthy play by an entirely different set of rules. Trump’s first election was, in part, built on the argument that he knew “how to play the game.” In this telling, his ability to break the rules was actually an asset because he would break them for you rather than just for the powerful. It was always a dubious pitch, but it’s understandable why — faced with the choice between someone trying to convince you the game that’s obviously been fixed is actually not rigged, and someone who tells you how they cheat and promise to help you get ahead a little bit — people would gravitate toward the latter. Part of the early MAGA mythos was built on resignation to the fact that our rule of law is fundamentally perverted to create two parallel tracks of justice: an unforgiving, punitive, carceral system for most people, and a cushy, consequence-free dinner party circuit for the ruling class. The answer isn’t simply to go back to electing more reasonable politicians. As long as the two tracks of our justice system diverge, the game stays rigged. Dethroning Trump will not be enough to restore real rule of law; the Biden administration is proof enough of that. Donald Trump was excised from the White House with historically bad public sentiment in the immediate aftermath of a failed coup. Under Biden, the Garland Justice Department tried to wind the clock back to 2016 and resume operating the way establishment politicians did in the 1990s and 2000s. It failed spectacularly, allowing bad actors like Elon Musk to grow ever more powerful while continuing to flout the law with impunity. The result was an embittered Trump who faced no real repercussions for his corruption — the worst-case scenario. If and when Democrats control the executive branch again, they will have an even more daunting task after the second Trump term than they did the first, and their existing body of work does not inspire confidence. Business-as-usual enforcement did not fail to rein in corruption over the last four years because of strategic missteps. It failed because it is incapable of rooting out undue elite influence that’s baked into the very essence of the way we became accustomed to enforcing the law. Trump is an extreme example, but he is the logical extreme. As Trump pardons business associates, sets up meetings for his children’s business interests with foreign leaders, and grows his personal wealth, the consequences of failing to hold the powerful to account are more obvious than ever. The answer isn’t simply to go back to electing more reasonable politicians. As long as the two tracks of our justice system diverge, the game stays rigged and the Trumpian appeal to America’s id will stay firmly entrenched. To dislodge the hold that corruption has on our government and restore the rule of law, Democrats will need to decide who they really are — and who they’ll fight for. IT’S EVEN WORSE THAN WE THOUGHT. What we’re seeing right now from Donald Trump is a full-on authoritarian takeover of the U.S. government. This is not hyperbole. Court orders are being ignored. MAGA loyalists have been put in charge of the military and federal law enforcement agencies. The Department of Government Efficiency has stripped Congress of its power of the purse. News outlets that challenge Trump have been banished or put under investigation. Yet far too many are still covering Trump’s assault on democracy like politics as usual, with flattering headlines describing Trump as “unconventional,” “testing the boundaries,” and “aggressively flexing power.” The Intercept has long covered authoritarian governments, billionaire oligarchs, and backsliding democracies around the world. We understand the challenge we face in Trump and the vital importance of press freedom in defending democracy. Jessica Washington Sen. Dick Durbin said the fight proved “Republicans are not sensitive to health care insurance premiums and we are.” That won’t keep costs down.

Get ready for a four-day trading week—if you trade bonds. With several key economic reports expected to be delayed by the government shutdown, investors will this week focus largely on corporate earnings reports. And some will get a short break: Bond markets, banks and government offices will close Tuesday for the Veterans Day holiday, though stock markets will remain open. Earnings from Walt Disney, CoreWeave, Sony, Cisco, and Applied Materials highlight this week’s corporate calendar. The small business optimism survey for October comes as market watchers are paying attention to how economic pressures are impacting small firms. The monthly federal budget report from the Treasury Department is expected to show how much revenue is coming from tariffs. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing. Earnings from artificial intelligence data center firm CoreWeave on Monday will likely keep investors' focus on the technology that has helped drive markets higher over the past few years. After going public earlier this year, CoreWeave shares have more than doubled. Deals with chipmaker Nvidia and social media giant Meta are driving optimism in the firm's business. Nuclear power provider Oklo's report on Tuesday is expected to show growth tied to the electricity needs for AI data centers. Network infrastructure provider Cisco's report on Wednesday comes after it nearly doubled its AI sales target in the prior quarter. On Thursday, Applied Materials is due to report as the chipmaking equipment supplier faces restrictions on its sales to China. Walt Disney’s report on Thursday follows the company’s recent launch of its ESPN sports app and plans to purchase the NFL network. Other noteworthy earnings this week include stablecoin provider Circle Internet Group, FanDuel-parent Flutter Entertainment, satellite launch firm Rocket Lab, and sneaker maker On Holdings. But there's more on tap than earnings, and that includes Tuesday, when chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices is set to hold an analyst day at which CEO Lisa Su is expected to offer more details on the company’s artificial intelligence roadmap.

Title: JPMorgan Discloses 64% Increase In BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Holdings In 2025 Q3 — Details

Time Published: 2025-11-09T06:00:13Z
Full Content:
Global banking behemoth JPMorgan Chase has disclosed its increased exposure to the world’s largest cryptocurrency through BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). In the latest 13-F filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), JPMorgan disclosed its holding of 5,284,190 IBIT shares, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, as of September 30. This third-quarter figure represents a sharp 64% increase in the firm’s exposure to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. JPMorgan’s IBIT holdings, which were worth about $333 million as of September 30, are now valued at around $312 million. While the bank’s expanded position places it amongst one of the major institutional holders of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, it still sits behind other firms, like Goldman Sachs, with significantly larger holdings. Goldman Sachs disclosed that it held 30.8 million shares of IBIT in the first quarter of 2025. Furthermore, the filing with the SEC shows that JPMorgan held IBIT call options worth $68 million and put options worth $133 million as of September 30. The increased investment in spot Bitcoin ETFs is consistent with the bank’s price expectations for the flagship cryptocurrency. In a recent report, strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou and his team shared that deleveraging in the crypto derivatives market, especially Bitcoin perpetual futures, appears to be mostly over. The JPMorgan analysts revealed that the recent rise in gold volatility has made BTC a more attractive investment option on a risk-adjusted basis. Using this gold-based model, the pundits argued that Bitcoin is fairly undervalued compared to gold and could see a significant upward movement to around $170,00 over the next 6 to 12 months. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands around $102,900, reflecting an over 1% jump in the past 24 hours. However, the premier cryptocurrency is still deep in the red on medium-term timeframes. According to data from CoinGecko, the BTC price is down by more than 6% in the last seven days. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has somewhat struggled over the past few weeks, registering significant withdrawals in the last two. According to data from SoSoValue, the exchange-traded fund posted a weekly net outflow of over $403 million in the previous week. Excluding its performance on Friday, November 7, BlackRock’s IBIT looks set to record a weekly net outflow of roughly $450 million. Nevertheless, the iShares Bitcoin Trust still ranks as the largest spot BTC exchange-traded fund with a net asset of $80.58 billion under management.

Title: Ian O’Riordan: Booming club numbers is not all good news

Rian Farrell was likely caught unawares this week when carving his name into the long annals of Irish athletics history. In registering with North Sligo AC, Farrell helped grow the Athletics Ireland club membership to 75,000 and it’s already tipped beyond that. November registration – when annual membership is counted – has now peaked at 75,078. It may have been a small gesture to name Farrell as their 75,000th member, but this is a big deal for Athletics Ireland, the governing body of the sport which has existed under various guises going back to the Irish Champions Athletic Club (ICAC) founded in 1873. It marks a 7 per cent increase on last November’s registration figure of 70,320 (the first to surpass the 70,000-mark), which in turn was a 9 per cent increase on the peak 2023 registration. All indications are the only way is up. Athletics, like many sports, also suffered a significant drop off in club membership during Covid-19. Registration more than halved in the first 12-month period during the pandemic, from 45,306 at the end of February 2020 to 19,702 at the end of February 2021. Growing that number above 75,000 is certainly impressive, and can be attributed to a variety of factors – not least in seeing Irish athletes enjoy their most successful ever year on the international stage. From the World Championships down to the European Youth Olympics, 21 medals were won, seven more than the previous best of 14 in 2019. In 2016, the international medal tally was three. [ Sonia O’Sullivan: With awards season upon us, Kate O’Connor should pick and chooseOpens in new window ] Role models and inspirations like this will help boost any sport and membership numbers are soaring across all ages and competitive levels. There is also a return of the running boom, the global phenomenon witnessed again last Sunday when there were 59,266 finishers in the New York City Marathon – breaking the previous record of 56,640 which finished the London Marathon last April. Athletics Ireland also pointed to the increased engagement at schools and community level and the rise in the number of athletics coaches trained through its education programmes. Until recent decades, Athletics Ireland and its many predecessors – including the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) and Bord Lúthchleas na hÉireann (BLE) - were only concerned with the competitive end of the sport. As, in turn, were most of the athletics clubs. Not anymore. It’s not the winning that matters, it’s the taking part, and that goes for the roughly 360 clubs throughout all 32 counties. [ Ireland’s Fionnuala McCormack finishes 10th in New York City MarathonOpens in new window ] Yet, behind these numbers, many clubs are struggling to meet the demand for new membership. Particularly at juvenile level, with significant waiting lists now being the norm, especially among the biggest clubs in the country. That’s not good news, not if any young aspiring athletes are ultimately lost to other sports. Dundrum South-Dublin AC, better known as DSD, is a case in point. It’s far from the oldest club in Dublin – and positively modern compared to the likes of Clonliffe Harriers, founded in 1886, and Donore Harriers, founded in 1893. With 1,200 members, DSD is now the biggest athletics club in Ireland, but not alone in turning away younger members because there simply isn’t enough room. The club was founded 40 years ago, with the merging of Dundrum AC and South Dublin AC, and for lifelong DSD member Gerry McGrath, the first decade or two was about maintaining club membership at around 150. Enough to keep everyone happy, even if there was a struggle sometimes to find that critical fourth man on the club cross-country team. The 1,200 members are now perfectly split between a 50:50 gender balance, all the way up from under-8s to over-70s, and an even half of which, around 600, are juveniles (under-18). There is also that waiting list, which averages about 200. [ ‘Setting big dreams’: Where Ava Crean, Ireland’s newest marathon sensation, might go nextOpens in new window ] “It’s a pity we can’t take everyone,” says McGrath, “but that primary school age is quite intensive, in that you need one coach for every 10 kids. A kid at that age could also be on the waiting list for a few different athletics clubs. Because most of the Dublin clubs do have a waiting list at those ages. “We did have a strategic plan, a few years ago, to grow the club to 2,500 members. But we’re not actively recruiting in any area at the moment, we stalled all that last year, until we could get more of a grip on it. That might change, but we still have physical limitations. Even though we’re one of the best served clubs in terms of our own track and our own running trails.” It’s just three years since DSD opened its own home track and trails off Tibradden Road, just up the hill from its former natural training ground at Marlay Park. That project continues to expand with the addition of new indoor running straight and club hall, set to open next year. As well as the surge in demand for juvenile membership, McGrath also points to the growth in DSD’s training group – now rebranded as the Meet, Train & Race. “That started 15 years ago, with maybe three or four guys, maybe in their late 40s, who wanted to run a marathon for the first time. “Now our Meet & Train is well over 200 members, attracting a few new members every week. We had 80 members in the Dublin Marathon last month. The sport is surging at all levels like that. “The problem isn’t getting volunteer coaches. We have 130 volunteers, some who would do seven days a week, all voluntary, to maybe a mother or father, who helps out for an hour. But it still takes tremendous coordination.” Blackrock AC is another southside Dublin club that is booming, with a celebratory dinner in January to mark its 1,000 members for the first time. On the northside, Raheny Shamrock is developing its first home facility at St Assam’s Church, again to help meet the growing demand for membership. It all makes for healthy reading for Athletics Ireland, as long as waiting lists for juveniles don’t come at the cost of kids being lost to the sport.

Title: Bitcoin fell from 2025’s ‘hottest trade,’ but attention will return: Alex Thorn

Bitcoin is entering a much more “mature era” that is healthy for the asset and will see attention returning, according to Galaxy Digital’s Alex Thorn. Optimism around Bitcoin (BTC) was far stronger at the start of the year, but it may not be long before the cryptocurrency regains that same level of hype, according to Galaxy Digital’s head of research, Alex Thorn. “Attention will come back to Bitcoin, it always does,” Thorn said during an interview with CNBC on Friday, emphasizing that “Bitcoin was the hottest trade of the year at the start of the year” after Donald Trump’s win in the US presidential election. Thorn said investors have turned their attention toward areas like AI, nuclear energy, quantum technology, and gold. “There were a lot of other places to get gains this year that impeded the allocation to Bitcoin,” he said. “We’re entering a much more mature era, where distribution from old hands to new is incredibly healthy for distributing the ownership of Bitcoin,” Thorn added. While Thorn remains long-term bullish on Bitcoin, he reduced Galaxy Digital’s year-end price target to $120,000 from $185,000. A move to $120,000 represents an increase of around 17% from Bitcoin’s current price of $102,080, according to CoinMarketCap. Many of the sectors Thorn said are pulling investor attention away from Bitcoin, especially gold, are the same ones it’s often compared to. JPMorgan analysts recently said that the rise in gold volatility during its rally to all-time highs in October makes the precious metal riskier and Bitcoin “more attractive to investors,” based on the Bitcoin-to-gold volatility ratio falling to 1.8, meaning BTC carries 1.8 times the risk of gold. As for AI, it was reported on Oct. 10 that Bitcoin and Nvidia stock (NVDA) are now moving more in sync than at any point in the past year. That has some market watchers worried about a looming crash similar to the dot-com bubble era in the late 1990s. Related: Arthur Hayes says Zcash has become his family office’s second-largest holding after Bitcoin Meanwhile, the ongoing debate over the potential threat of quantum computing to Bitcoin continues to divide experts. Borderless Capital’s Amit Mehra recently said quantum computing remains years away from threatening Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Charles Edwards, founder of quantitative Bitcoin and digital asset fund Capriole, said the situation is far more urgent and argues that the industry must implement solutions as soon as possible before it is too late.

Title: ‘Unusual’ Paul Henry coastal landscape bought by taoiseach John A Costello could fetch €150,000 at auction

Paul Henry’s Coastal Landscape with Galway Hookers Late taoiseach John A Costello is believed to have bought the painting directly from Henry A painting believed to have been bought directly from Irish artist Paul Henry by the late taois­each John A Costello will be offered for sale at auction later this month. Coastal Landscape with Galway Hookers, which is estimated to be worth €150,000, is one of two Henry paintings Costello left to his children. He died in 1976, aged 85. Dubliner Costello was also a barr­ister, attorney general and Fine Gael TD. He was taoiseach twice, from 1948 to 1951 and 1954 to 1957. James O’Halloran, director of ­Adam’s auction house in Dublin, said they sold one of the paintings “almost a decade ago and now we have been consigned the second”. The previous painting was sold for €115,000. Mr O’Halloran said it “is thought by his family that John A purchased the two paintings directly from the artist as there is no record of them being in any exhibition. The painting is unusual as it has two Irish traditional sailing boats, known as hookers, in it”. It has remained in the family since. Costello’s son Declan was also attorney general, and president of the High Court. He died in 2011 at the age of 84. Other works of interest in the upcoming auction is an oil painting by Jack B Yeats, dated to 1912 and entitled In a Dublin Waxworks, with an estimate of €70,000. Previously belonging to Guinness heir Garech Browne, it hung for many years in Luggala Estate in Co Wicklow. Late taoiseach John A Costello is believed to have bought the painting directly from Henry Yeats visited the old Dublin Waxworks in Henry Street in 1905 and made a sketch that he used as the basis for the work. It has a historical significance as a glimpse of a lost Dublin institution, which burnt down two years after the painting was completed. Sculpture is prominent in the sale, with works in bronze by Melanie Le Brocquy, John Behan, Imogen Stuart and Rowan Gillespie. Adam’s pre-Christmas sale of Important Irish Art will take place on November 26 in their St Stephen’s Green rooms at 6pm, and includes about 150 lots. Last week, deVeres auction house on Kildare Street in Dublin saw demand for Eileen Gray-designed items soar. Her famous Transat chair was sold for €10,500. It had an estimate of between €4,000 and €6,000. A blue leather bar stool designed by the renowned architect sold for €4,200; it had an estimate of €1,200. A Jumo lamp designed by Gray was valued at between €600 and €900 but went for €2,800. A set of six rosewood dining chairs by Danish designer Neils Moller made €10,500 - more than three times the asking price. A Svend Ge Madsen-designed Rosewood desk went for €7,000, more than double its estimate of between €2,000 and €3,000. Elsewhere, Adams Blackrock has an exclusive one-off jewellery auction featuring more than 750 pieces consigned by a long-established Irish jeweller that is closing its doors. Elena McCrory, senior associate with Adams Blackrock, said there has been an increase of “younger people interested in vintage jewellery due to sustainability and price. The price of gold has increased substantially, so nine-carat gold pieces garner a lot of interest”. The selection showcases a wide range of contemporary gold jewellery set with precious gemstones. The auction will take place online on Thursday.

Title: The forgotten Irish artist: How does an artist make thousands of artworks, then just disappear?

Great work tends to announce itself even without the benefit of hype. Many moons ago, when Paul Finucane was involved in setting up the medical school at the University of Limerick, in 2007, he and his colleagues decided to establish a collection of medicine-related art for the benefit of students at the college. “I came across a painting called Embryo with Gas Mask at an auction house,” Finucane says. A provocative piece, the work had been used, with its artist’s permission, on an anti-nuclear-power poster in the 1970s. “It’s the notion of an embryo needing to be protected from the environment by having a gas mask,” Finucane says. “While it’s a challenging image, there’s no question about the quality of the draughtsmanship.” Its creator’s name was Donal O’Sullivan. Finucane, a keen collector as well as founding dean of the school of medicine, embarked on a little detective work to learn more about him. This obscure artist, he discovered, had been prolific in the 1970s and 1980s. Based in Dublin, he had gone against the expressionism that was fashionable in Irish art circles at the time, trading instead in powerful, elegant and melancholy figurative art that often discomfited its viewers. A prize winner and college activist, O’Sullivan had been a mover and shaker in his early life; at one point he appeared in the front row of the audience of The Late Late Show to protest against inadequate facilities at the National College of Art, resulting in important reforms. Then mental-health frailties set in. O’Sullivan died by suicide in 1991, aged just 46. In subsequent decades, he was largely forgotten by the art world, his work left to gather dust. It was, Finucane says, an unfortunate lack of recognition. That oversight is being addressed in a handsome book about O’Sullivan’s life and work, which gathers together his creations with reminiscences from Robert Ballagh, Vincent Browne, Annie West, Una Sealy and Cóilín Murray, among other well-known names, along with deeply felt reflections from family and other friends. Finucane and Brendan Lyons of Red Barn Publishing, in west Co Cork, who suggested the book to mark what would have been O’Sullivan’s 80th birthday this year, hope to establish him as an important artist. “We tend to gravitate to stories around people who have not received the attention they deserve,” Finucane says. “Donal was someone who was able to argue for a cause but unable to do the same for his own work and career,” Lyons says. “He was a conundrum.” Ballagh, who wrote the foreword to the book, knew O’Sullivan as a young man – he had been friends with his brother – and appreciated his hard-won skill as a figurative artist. “My studio is in Stoneybatter, and opposite where I am there’s a rather large house which he had a flat in,” Ballagh says. “I used to bump into him. To develop the kind of skills that Donal had takes years and years of endeavour and commitment. Anyone who had an interesting face interested Donal. He was fascinated with Samuel Beckett’s face, with Alberto Giacometti’s face.” Born in 1945 in Dublin, O’Sullivan was, Ballagh says, a shy man who was “also quite convinced of what he was doing”. When he was growing up, his parents, Mary and Patrick, ran a grocery in Ranelagh called Lily’s Dairy. Donal was the fifth of six children, a dreamy character who loved playing with his toy soldiers and drawing constantly, taking the greaseproof paper that separated the layers of Coconut Cream biscuits and working faces into the stains left on the paper. [ How did a small Irish architectural firm come to design one of the world’s biggest museums?Opens in new window ] “He enjoyed a bit of craic – as family we’d all have a loud laugh, and we’d sit together and the craic would bounce back and forth – but he was anxious nearly all of the time,” says his sister Marie O’Sullivan, a fellow artist, who also contributes to the book. “Even to go out the door it took effort.” After studying architecture for a year at Bolton Street College of Technology, in an effort to do something sensible, O’Sullivan switched to the National College of Art, then based on Kildare Street. It wasn’t long before his talents were noticed. He won the Taylor Prize twice, in 1967 and 1968, while at the college. Gerald Davis, of the Davis Gallery on Capel Street, offered him an exhibition while he was still a student, and Suzanne MacDougald showed his work at her Lad Lane Gallery. A distinctive presence dressed in black, with a helmet of hair and a Crombie coat, O’Sullivan had a painstaking working method that relied on sometimes frowned-upon techniques. He drew from images ripped from newspapers – a practice forbidden at art college – and would etch on bread paper, the thin tissue used to wrap loaves. He wasn’t a natural agitator, but he’d had the benefit of a good education as a student at Blackrock College, in South Dublin, and was dismayed by the deficiencies he found at the National College of Art, which was using outmoded methods of teaching, and in any case had inadequate premises. After months of peaceful protest, O’Sullivan, a charismatic spokesman for the student body, decided enough was enough. The students staged a sleep-in from April 22nd until May 28th, 1969. “If you want to protest about a situation, after everything else has failed, you just bring it to a halt, you have a work-in. If you want to stop something happening in a college, you occupy it,” he told The Irish Times on June 19th that year. The protests succeeded. In 1971 the college moved to its current location, on Thomas Street in the Liberties. “He’d be shy and anxious and on edge,” Marie O’Sullivan says of her brother. “But he wouldn’t let that stop him protesting. He would force himself to go in and talk to Brian Lenihan” – minister for education at the time – “and be that public if he felt strongly about something”. Donal’s work was very lyrical, romantic, meticulously drawn, at a time when people were painting brutal commentaries After graduating with an honours diploma, O’Sullivan set himself up in a chaotic studio in an old henhouse in the garden of his family home, on the corner of Ranelagh Road and Sallymount Avenue. A few chickens that remained would cluck over the work he discarded, leaving deposits to which he paid little heed. The hens weren’t his only challenge. The climate at the time was harsh on artists. O’Sullivan was prolific: his studio was crammed with discarded drawings in charcoal and pencil, some of famous names, such as Sinéad O’Connor. Over his lifetime he would make thousands of artworks. But they didn’t seem to offer a vital critique of Ireland in the manner of work by other artists of the day, and he struggled to promote himself, failing to turn up even to his own exhibition launches. He found his main employment as a teacher at Dún Laoghaire School of Art and Design. “Dublin was a grim city,” says Una Sealy, an artist and former student of O’Sullivan’s. “A lot of it was falling down. A lot of the Georgian buildings were either being demolished or held up with girders. There was massive unemployment. Donal’s work was very lyrical, romantic, meticulously drawn, at a time when people were painting brutal commentaries.” Figures such as Patrick Graham and Brian Maguire drove a particular creative vision. “They would have been the artists that people looked up to in the late 1970s and 1980s. Donal’s work was of a high standard, and it has held that quality. But there was a couple of decades when that would not have been in fashion.” Persuading people to buy art was itself quite a feat. “I grew up in the 1960s and 1970s,” Paul Finucane says, “and about the only thing you’d ever see in somebody’s house was a Sacred Heart lamp and a photograph of the pope and maybe John F Kennedy. To have any kind of original art would have been considered a gross waste of money.” A notice from the Evening Press in 1981 carps that O’Sullivan is “too shy to attend his own exhibition but has no handicap when it comes to putting a price on the tag. It’s a pity, really, that people of undoubted talent gain their exclusivity by putting their work out of reach of the many who have vacant places on their walls.” [ A Syrian artist who took refuge in Dublin: ‘Picasso came to this life to open a door. I hope I can open a door’Opens in new window ] Then there was the melancholy aspect to his work that sometimes put people off. “There’s a sadness to his work,” his sister says. “That’s what hits people. People see a kind of darkness. If I was to show his work to someone who has never seen it before, they would nearly always come back and say there’s a darkness or sadness to it.” At certain times in his life O’Sullivan was on medication for anxiety and depression. He became a heavy drinker. He had lengthy stays in hospital, where he seemed to have undergone electroconvulsive therapy: a handwritten poem reflects on the experience. There is great pain in Marie O’Sullivan’s voice when she talks about those periods. A section of the book is devoted to recollections of the Ana Liffey Drug Project, the addiction-aid service where O’Sullivan gave some art-therapy and counselling time. “It was amazing for him to put himself forward to try and help while he was still struggling,” she says. “He was involved in so many things.” By the time the artist died, in 1991, he had fallen out of touch with many of his old friends. When Brendan Lyons began tracking them down, many were delighted to have the opportunity to talk about O’Sullivan and his effect on them. At the book’s recent launch at Cnoc Buí Arts Centre, in Union Hall in west Cork, where Mel Mercier performed an original composition set to O’Sullivan’s poetry, several contributors spoke about their relationship with O’Sullivan, reflecting on his many gifts as a listener, encourager and friend. “I learned so much from him,” Joan Cronin, his former girlfriend, said. “He was generous with his knowledge. I enjoyed the arts, but he gave me the confidence to be critically thinking about it.” For Marie O’Sullivan, who has spent years seeking to re-energise interest in her brother’s art, the attention has been hugely gratifying. “There were so many stories. At the launch, things came up that I didn’t realise. Each person had their own little story of the time they spent with him. I didn’t actually break down – I was afraid I would – but I was very close to tears.” The contributors hope that the book will go some way towards restoring O’Sullivan to his rightful place in Irish art and that curators might pay more attention to his work. “I’d be much more interested in some of the institutions taking an interest in him than the auction houses,” Ballagh says. For Sealy, it’s important that a younger generation of artists become acquainted with him. “Younger artists won’t know who he is,” she says. “He was a very important part of Irish art. What he has done has contributed to what people are doing now. It’s important that this record of his life has been compiled by Brendan and Paul. It’s cementing his legacy.” In a life cut short, the work still speaks, even now. “I’m optimistic,” Marie O’Sullivan says of the future. “Very optimistic.” Donal O’Sullivan: An Artist Remembered, by Paul Finucane and Brendan Lyons, is published by Red Barn; it is available from cnocbuiarts.ie/publications and selected bookshops Sign up to the Irish Times books newsletter for features, podcasts and more © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Ethereum: How $10B short squeeze could fuel ETH past $4,500

Here are top three factors that increased the odds of a short squeeze on Ethereum. Massive shorts above price on top of buyer activity and bullish sentiment increased the chances of a short squeeze. Only if the current momentum persists, breaking all resistances below the mark, can Ethereum reach $4,500. Ethereum[ETH] surged by only 5% in the recent market bounce after liquidating shorts that came in at the bottom. The market was showing signs of a reversal, with massive shorts at risk of liquidation. The addition of buy orders from whales and institutions on top of shifting sentiment all set the altcoin up for a run toward $4,500. As of press time, Ethereum price liquidated late short orders that came in below the $3,600 mark after dropping to $3,200. Massive shorts were building above the $3,600 zone, while those of latecomers were disappearing. Over $10 billion in Ethereum liquidity was stacked between $3,600 and $4,500, just above the current prices. Source: CoinGlass Based on current market patterns, Ethereum’s price may be approaching a key breakout zone. If buy orders push past the $3,600 level, it could trigger a rapid short squeeze, potentially driving the price beyond $4,500. Because liquidity is tightly clustered near these levels, short sellers may not have time to react. Whales and institutions were capitalizing on the dip as they were accumulating between $3,000 and $3,400. For instance, a Bitcoin insider whale who had shorted BTC just before the tariff crash took a long position on Ethereum. The whale placed a 5x leverage long on Ethereum, with the position amounting to 40,000 ETH valued at $138 million. His closure of the BTC long position was a hint that ETH could rise faster than Bitcoin in the current conditions. Source: Mister Crypto/X That was not the only buy on ETH. BlackRock also bought $35 million worth of Ethereum, as per CryptoGoos. This further supported a potential comeback for ETH price amid shifting market sentiment. Speaking of market sentiment, the crowd and smart money were all bullish on Ethereum. In fact, the informed money was more convinced than the retailers, as the sentiment gauge read 0.23 against 0.21. Source: Market Prophit This was reflected across the entire crypto market, which rose by 1.35%, at press time. All these observations pointed to a looming short squeeze that could take the price past $4,500. However, the charts indicated that for this price to be hit, short-term levels at $3,460, $3,900, and $4,200 had to be cleared. Source: TradingView Therefore, breaking these zones could push the price past $4,500, as all factors were aligning for such an undertaking.

Title: Amazon's AI comeback: Inside the cloud king’s race to close the Big Tech gap

For years, markets saw Amazon and Apple as laggards in the artificial intelligence race dominated by Microsoft, Google, and Meta. Though Amazon had a huge cloud infrastructure through Amazon Web Services (AWS), investors weren’t excited about the company. However, the narrative shifted when the company posted strong September quarter earnings. A deal with OpenAI and a ramp-up in its capital expenditure signalled that Amazon was back in the AI race. AI is just one of Amazon’s many concerns. How it manages its mammoth retail operations amid regulatory pressures matters too. Market catch-upIn the past few years, post-covid and during the AI boom, Amazon was an outlier among the Big Five tech companies, but for the wrong reasons. In the past five years, Amazon shares gained 51%, while its peers doubled or tripled their market value. As Nvidia boomed on the demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) and Microsoft captured headlines with its OpenAI tie-up, investors were concerned that AWS, a cloud leader and Amazon's key division, was struggling to scale. Amazon was spending heavily on AI infrastructure but was losing share to Microsoft and Google. In the second quarter of 2025, AWS’s profit margins fell sharply. The picture changed after Amazon's third-quarter earnings on 30 October 2025. Results exceeded expectations, and shares jumped 13% in after-hours trading. "There was definitely concern about AWS losing market share to Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud," Argent Capital's Jed Ellerbroek told Reuters. “But now AWS is aboard the train as well." In the past five days, Amazon was the only Big Five stock to post gains, while the others declined. AWS revivalIn the September quarter, AWS reported revenues of $33 billion, up 20.2% from $27.5 billion in Q3 2024. It outpaced the segment's 19% growth in Q3 2024 and exceeded Wall Street's 18.1% forecast. The results lifted AWS’s annualized run rate to $132 billion. During the earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy highlighted that the division was "growing at a pace we haven’t seen since 2022," attributing this to "strong demand in AI and machine learning." It addressed investors’ concerns that AWS—which holds about 31% of global cloud infrastructure, according to recent Synergy Research data—might be struggling to manage scale.

It could also leverage other changes in the market, such as the friction between Microsoft and its long-standing partner OpenAI. Earlier this week, Amazon signed a $38 billion cloud agreement with OpenAI. The deal could increase its $200 billion backlog by about 20% in the fourth quarter, according to BMO Capital Markets. It also gave AWS a clearer path to recover market share lost to Microsoft and Alphabet. Capital pushTo sustain growth, Amazon has to sustain capital spending. In Q3 2025, its capex hit $35.1 billion, or 19.5% of revenue, up from 14.8% in Q4 2024. This ratio has climbed steadily: 16.1% in Q1 2025 and 19.2% in Q2. It raised full-year capital expenditure guidance to about $125 billion, with most of the funds going to AWS data centres that support AI workloads. Spending is expected to rise further in 2026. That level of investment places Amazon among the largest spenders in the technology sector. However, higher investments in AI infrastructure add to financial strain. Throughout its history, Amazon has pursued growth through efficiency, reflected in its founder’s philosophy: Your margin is my opportunity. A substantial share of its budget is directed toward in-house technologies like Trainium chips, reducing reliance on third-party GPUs. Amazon says its own chips provide 30–40% better price-performance than comparable GPUs. Customers like Anthropic are deploying hundreds of thousands of Trainium2 chips for models like Claude. Adoption is growing, but it still trails Nvidia. Also Read | Artificial intelligence’s next home: your eyes Labour rebalanceIn the recent quarter, Amazon reported a $1.8 billion pre-tax charge for severance related to planned job cuts, reflecting one of its largest corporate restructurings in years. The layoffs, affecting about 14,000 employees, were announced shortly before the earnings release. During the earnings call, Jassy said the cuts were not AI-driven. “If you grow as fast as we did for several years, the size of businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers," he said. “Sometimes, without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people doing the actual work. And it can slow you down." While Jassy has emphasized culture, the broader context is a shift toward automation across Amazon’s operations. The company aims to automate 75% of its fulfillment network and has deployed more than one million robots globally. These investments suggest a gradual substitution of capital for labour. Amazon’s workforce totalled 1.56 million in 2024, roughly unchanged from two years earlier despite higher sales and output, but down from 1.6 million in the covid-hit 2021.

The focus is shifting to Whole Foods, where Amazon plans to expand locations and pilot a smaller ‘daily shop’ format designed for urban markets. It is also redirecting grocery efforts toward logistics, emphasizing same-day perishables delivery through Amazon.com. That service now reaches 1,000 US cities and is expected to double coverage by the end of 2025. Physical store revenue has remained steady at about $5.6 billion per quarter. As it experiments and expands its business, Amazon is also regularly facing regulatory and legal hurdles. It settled a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) complaint over Prime subscriptions with a $2.5 billion charge, which includes $1 billion in penalties and $1.5 billion in refunds. A separate antitrust lawsuit from the FTC and 18 states remains pending, with a trial expected in 2027.

It raised full-year capital expenditure guidance to about $125 billion, with most of the funds going to AWS data centres that support AI workloads. Spending is expected to rise further in 2026.

A substantial share of its budget is directed toward in-house technologies like Trainium chips, reducing reliance on third-party GPUs.

Adoption is growing, but it still trails Nvidia. Labour rebalanceIn the recent quarter, Amazon reported a $1.8 billion pre-tax charge for severance related to planned job cuts, reflecting one of its largest corporate restructurings in years. The layoffs, affecting about 14,000 employees, were announced shortly before the earnings release. During the earnings call, Jassy said the cuts were not AI-driven. “If you grow as fast as we did for several years, the size of businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers," he said. “Sometimes, without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people doing the actual work. And it can slow you down." While Jassy has emphasized culture, the broader context is a shift toward automation across Amazon’s operations. The company aims to automate 75% of its fulfillment network and has deployed more than one million robots globally. These investments suggest a gradual substitution of capital for labour.

For years, markets saw Amazon and Apple as laggards in the artificial intelligence race dominated by Microsoft, Google, and Meta. Though Amazon had a huge cloud infrastructure through Amazon Web Services (AWS), investors weren’t excited about the company. However, the narrative shifted when the company posted strong September quarter earnings. A deal with OpenAI and a ramp-up in its capital expenditure signalled that Amazon was back in the AI race. AI is just one of Amazon’s many concerns. How it manages its mammoth retail operations amid regulatory pressures matters too. Market catch-upIn the past few years, post-covid and during the AI boom, Amazon was an outlier among the Big Five tech companies, but for the wrong reasons. In the past five years, Amazon shares gained 51%, while its peers doubled or tripled their market value. As Nvidia boomed on the demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) and Microsoft captured headlines with its OpenAI tie-up, investors were concerned that AWS, a cloud leader and Amazon's key division, was struggling to scale. Amazon was spending heavily on AI infrastructure but was losing share to Microsoft and Google. In the second quarter of 2025, AWS’s profit margins fell sharply. The picture changed after Amazon's third-quarter earnings on 30 October 2025. Results exceeded expectations, and shares jumped 13% in after-hours trading. "There was definitely concern about AWS losing market share to Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud," Argent Capital's Jed Ellerbroek told Reuters. “But now AWS is aboard the train as well." In the past five days, Amazon was the only Big Five stock to post gains, while the others declined. AWS revivalIn the September quarter, AWS reported revenues of $33 billion, up 20.2% from $27.5 billion in Q3 2024. It outpaced the segment's 19% growth in Q3 2024 and exceeded Wall Street's 18.1% forecast. The results lifted AWS’s annualized run rate to $132 billion. During the earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy highlighted that the division was "growing at a pace we haven’t seen since 2022," attributing this to "strong demand in AI and machine learning." It addressed investors’ concerns that AWS—which holds about 31% of global cloud infrastructure, according to recent Synergy Research data—might be struggling to manage scale.

It could also leverage other changes in the market, such as the friction between Microsoft and its long-standing partner OpenAI. Earlier this week, Amazon signed a $38 billion cloud agreement with OpenAI. The deal could increase its $200 billion backlog by about 20% in the fourth quarter, according to BMO Capital Markets. It also gave AWS a clearer path to recover market share lost to Microsoft and Alphabet. Capital pushTo sustain growth, Amazon has to sustain capital spending.

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. ZCash (ZEC) has been one of the highlight performers in the cryptocurrency market over the past few months. Although the general digital asset market has faltered in recent weeks, the privacy-focused cryptocurrency has continued to ascend to new price highs. While the large-cap assets have been waxing and waning in terms of market value, the price of ZCash has been on a tear in the past week, breaking into the list of the top-20 largest cryptocurrencies in the sector. Now, the latest on-chain data suggests that euphoria is setting in the ZEC market. In a November 7 post on social media platform X, Alphractal CEO and founder Joao Wedson revealed that the ZCash market might be overheating after weeks of significant upward price movement. According to the on-chain expert, the sentiment surrounding the coin seems to have finally reached the euphoria stage. Wedson noted that the group of network participants mostly behind this euphoria is the ZEC miners. This on-chain observation revolves around two primary metrics, including the Puell Multiple and the Hash Rate. For context, the Puell Multiple is a metric that correlates the issuance value of an asset to its 365-day moving average. This metric measures miners’ profitability on an annualized basis, signaling potential market tops or bottoms. According to the highlighted data from Alphractal, the ZCash Puell Multiple just hit an all-time high, indicating significantly high profitability for the miners. This on-chain signal also suggests that the ZEC price could still have more room for upside movement. Furthermore, Wedson revealed that the ZCash Hash Rate is on a rapid ascent, meaning that miners are devoting more computational resources to the privacy-focused network. As seen with the premier cryptocurrency, a rising Hash Rate often coincides with extended price rallies. Ultimately, the increasing Puell Multiple and rising Hash Rate signals strong network fundamentals for ZCash, which suggests that the price growth seen so far is not solely market speculation. As of this writing, the price of ZCash stands at around $714, reflecting an over 30% jump in the past 24 hours. Price action data shows that the ZEC coin is having the second-strongest annual performance in its history, having soared roughly 1,500% in the past year. In an earlier post on X, Wedson projected an extreme upside of around $1,650 for the price of ZCash. While the current ZEC price already suggests elevated risk for investors, reaching as high as $1,650 would represent full-on market euphoria.

Now, Opeyemi takes pride in creating unique pieces unraveling the complexities of blockchain technology and sharing insights on the latest trends in the world of cryptocurrencies. Opeyemi savors his attraction to the crypto market, which explains why he spends the better parts of his day looking through different price charts. “Looking” is a rather simple way to describe analyzing and interpreting various price patterns and chart formations. However, it appears that is not Opeyemi’s favorite part - in fact, far from it. Being able to connect what happens on a price chart to on-chain movements and blockchain activities is what keeps Opeyemi ticking. “This emphasizes the intricacies of blockchain technology and the cryptocurrency market,” he would say. Most importantly, Opeyemi thinks of any market insights as the gospel, while recognizing that he is only a messenger. When he is not clicking away at his keyboard, Opeyemi is most definitely listening to music, playing games, reading a book, or scrolling through X. He likes to think he is not loyal to a particular genre of music, which can be true on many days. However, the fast-rising Afrobeats genre is a staple in Opeyemi’s Spotify Daily Mix. Meanwhile, Opeyemi is a voracious reader who enjoys a wide category of books - ranging from science fiction, fantasy, and historical, to even romance. He believes that authors like George R. R. Martin and J. K. Rowling are the greatest of all time when it comes to putting pen to paper. Opeyemi believes his reading of the Harry Potter series twice is proof of that. Indeed, Opeyemi enjoys spending most of his time within the four walls of his home. However, he also sometimes finds solace in the company of his friends at a bar, a restaurant, or even on a stroll. In essence, Opeyemi’s ambivert (haha! been searching for an opportunity to use the word to describe myself) nature makes him a social chameleon who is able to quickly adapt to different settings. Opeyemi recognizes the need to constantly develop oneself in order to stay afloat in a competitive and ever-evolving market like crypto. For this reason, he is always in learning mode, ready to pick up the slightest lesson from every situation. Opeyemi is efficient and likes to deliver all that is required of him in time - he believes that “whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well.” Hence, you will always find him striving to be better. Ultimately, Opeyemi is a good writer and an even better person who is trying to shed light on an exciting world phenomenon - cryptocurrency. He goes to bed every day with a smile of satisfaction on his face, knowing that he has done his bit of the holy assignment - spreading the crypto gospel to the rest of the world.

The Wall Street Journal reports that the Nasdaq Composite Index was down 3% — making this its worst week since President Donald Trump announced his sweeping tariff plan in April. Tech companies that have otherwise performed well this year were among those hardest hit, with Palantir’s stock price falling 11% this week, Oracle declining by 9%, and Nvidia losing 7%. These drops also come after earnings reports in which Meta and Microsoft indicated that they plan to continue spending heavily on AI (both companies were down about 4%). “Valuations are stretched,” Cresset Capital’s Jack Ablin told the WSJ. “Just the slightest bit of bad news gets exaggerated … and good news is just not enough to move the needle because expectations are already pretty high.” Economic factors like the ongoing government shutdown, declining consumer sentiment, and widespread layoffs are also likely dragging down the stock market. But the less tech-heavy S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average didn’t do quite as badly, with declines of 1.6% and 1.2%, respectively.

Title: Here’s Why The Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Prices Are Down

Time Published: 2025-11-08T19:30:34Z
Full Content:
The Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices are down today after a brief rebound yesterday. Crypto pundit Nobler has suggested that these price declines are due to price manipulation rather than a wave of sell-offs among investors. CoinMarketCap data shows that the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices are on the decline today, following significant gains yesterday. In an X post, Nobler stated that Binance, Wintermute, and BlackRock were all selling Bitcoin ahead of the Federal Reserve’s announcement. This explains the DOGE and SHIB decline given the meme coins’ correlation with the flagship crypto. Nobler alleged that these firms have sold over $1.5 billion in Bitcoin and continue to sell more. The pundit added that there was too much market manipulation. Bitcoin is currently struggling to hold above the $100,000 level, which has sparked a bearish sentiment towards the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices. The Dogecoin price is currently trading way below the psychological $0.2 level, while the Shiba Inu price continues to underperform, down over 53% since the start of the year. The foremost meme coins are also at risk of a further decline, with speculations that the crypto market might already be in a bear market. Market maker Wintermute recently claimed that liquidity has stopped flowing into the crypto market, which is why the bull market has halted while the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices decline. The market maker further noted that momentum in stablecoins, ETFs, and digital asset treasuries (DATs) has slowed, highlighting a liquidity drain in the market. Notably, companies such as CleanCore and Bit Origin had accumulated DOGE earlier in the year but have since slowed their purchase of the foremost meme coin. Meanwhile, Santiment data also showed that there has been a drop in DOGE and SHIB whale transactions, which also explained the decline in the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices. Despite the recent decline in the Dogecoin price, crypto analyst XForce stated that the macro target for DOGE remains between $1 and $2, which would mark new all-time highs (ATHs) for the foremost meme coin. He noted that DOGE has arguably been one of the best idealized Elliot wave 5-wave structures on the macro up to the wave 4 termination point. Furthermore, XForce remarked that the only bullish option left will be observed as an Expanding Ending Diagonal, as impulsive options are now off the table. Meanwhile, crypto pundit SHIB Booster stated that the Shiba Inu price could rally soon as tokens from last bull season are now recording significant gains. The pundit added that a small wave of momentum could send the SHIB price back toward the mid-range, around $0.00001603. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: New Mass Effect Game to Feature Krogan Civil War

Yesterday was N7 Day, the yearly franchise appreciation day that Mass Effect developer BioWare has held every November 7 since 2012. In the game, N7 is a vocational code in the Systems Alliance military, where the N designates special forces and the 7 refers to the highest level of proficiency, thus referring to the main character, Shepard, and his strike team. N7 Day 2025 delivered confirmation that the studio, despite the layoffs, is still working on the next Mass Effect game. In the blog post, long-time Executive Producer Mike Gamble inserted a secret message that the fans eventually decoded, revealing a new artwork from the upcoming game. The art depicts Krogan characters and features the subtitle 'Civil War'. This hints at one of the themes we may discover in the game: a major division within the Krogan race between at least two factions. Those who have played previous Mass Effect games are certainly familiar with the Krogan, a species of large, reptilian bipeds native to the planet Tuchanka. They famously survived despite the harsh environment of their home world, only to destroy it themselves in a nuclear war. The survivors split into tribes that were constantly at war with one another. Indeed, they are considered a warrior race, but some of them do not necessarily wish to perpetuate the seemingly endless cycle of fighting that has characterized the Krogans. This may be the primary source of the disagreement, though it's only speculation at this point, of course. The next Mass Effect is at least three to four years away, and fans may have to make do with just art teasers in the near future. There is, however, the Amazon TV series in development, and BioWare confirmed that it will be an original story (written by Daniel Casey and directed by Doug Jung) set after the original Mass Effect trilogy. We'll keep you updated once there are casting news on the show.

Title: Tech Workers Are in Deep, Deep Trouble

By Joe Wilkins Published Nov 8, 2025 12:45 PM EST For years, any American kid eying a stable, future-proof job was told to “learn to code.” Now in 2025, anyone who followed that advice faces a painful reckoning: a decade of booming computer science enrollments has created a massive pile-up of graduates entering an abysmal job market. A new report by the analyst firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which tracks layoffs across various industries, found that the US tech industry had the highest number of layoffs in October of any sector, with a whopping 33,281 tech workers out of the job. That’s an awfully high number for one month, and it looks even worse in context — just a month earlier, the number of tech industry layoffs was only 5,639. Tech companies are planning to lay off 141,159 jobs this year so far, per the report, up from 120,470 over the same period in 2024. And it likely may not look much better in the near future, either. “It’s possible with rate cuts and a strong showing in November, companies may make a late-season push for employees,” the report reads, “but at this point, we do not expect a strong seasonal hiring environment in 2025.” The analysis was spotted by SF Gate, which reported that tech company job cuts in the US are at their highest levels since 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic ushered in a short-lived recession. For the month of October, however, the analyst report notes that total layoffs haven’t been this high since 2003 — in other words, not even the global financial crisis was this much of a bloodbath. While it’s easy to blame AI for the tech industry layoffs, CG&C highlights some other factors contributing to the dismal labor news. “October’s pace of job cutting was much higher than average for the month,” the firm wrote. “Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes.” Across all industries, “those laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market,” the report commentary read. The depressing economic news comes as tech companies look to be some of the first adopters of their own AI systems, a proving ground of sorts for the software they hope will bring about a new stage of human civilization. Last week, Amazon cut some 14,000 jobs within its corporate offices, with thousands more likely on the way. Over the summer, when Microsoft sacked 9,000 employees, its CEO suggested freshly-unemployed workers turn to AI chatbots to help “reduce the emotional and cognitive load that comes with job loss.” Meanwhile, there’s plenty of reason to doubt that AI is actually capable of replacing thousands of employees — a narrative tech executives have a material interest in maintaining. While some companies like Amazon were surely over-bloated following pandemic hiring sprees, AI is mostly failing when used to improve revenue streams, the reason companies execute these layoffs in the first place. The question, then, is how much deeper the layoffs are going to go — something only some of the most powerful corporate executives can answer.

Title: T Rowe Price’s Calculated Bet: Why the Quintessential “Singles Hitter” Is Swinging for Crypto
URL: https://www.mutualfundobserver.com/2025/11/t-rowe-prices-calculated-bet-why-the-quintessential-singles-hitter-is-swinging-for-crypto/

In the buttoned-down world of institutional asset management, T Rowe Price has long been the firm that makes boring look brilliant. While competitors chased hot trends and flashy returns, the Baltimore-based firm built its reputation as the quintessential “singles hitter,” compounding modest, steady gains into industry-leading long-term performance through disciplined, research-driven processes. Which makes the 87-year-old firm’s October 2025 filing for the T Rowe Price Active Crypto ETF seem, at first glance, utterly out of character. Cryptocurrencies? The asset class synonymous with wild volatility, 70%+ drawdowns, and a $6.2 million banana duct-taped to a wall? For a firm that has weathered every market cycle since 1937 by staying boringly sensible? Yet for those who understand T Rowe Price’s culture, the move is precisely in character. Because when Price’s research leads somewhere, the firm follows, even when it means moving ahead of the crowd into uncomfortable territory. Price is decidedly not an early mover. The filing comes nearly two years after the SEC’s watershed January 2024 approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which triggered what one analysis called “a 400% acceleration in institutional investment flows” and have since attracted over $150 billion in assets. BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, VanEck, and ARK dominated that first wave, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) becoming the third-largest ETF by inflows in 2024—trailing only broad S&P 500 index funds and accumulating over $50 billion in assets in less than a year. By late 2025, the landscape will have exploded into what Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas describes as an impending reality where there will be “more crypto ETF filings than stocks.” Over 92 cryptocurrency ETF applications now await SEC review, covering everything from single-asset Solana and XRP funds to multi-crypto index products, staking-enabled ETFs, and even proposals for memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. (sigh) Price’s filing, which Balchunas called a “semi-shock” from a “top 5 active manager,” sits frozen with dozens of others during a federal government shutdown that has left the SEC with skeleton staffing and no clear timeline for approvals. Yet Price’s approach differs fundamentally from the herd. While most applications target passive index tracking or single-coin exposure, Price is proposing an actively managed multi-asset fund (holding 5-15 cryptocurrencies) that applies its core competency – fundamental research, valuation analysis, and active portfolio management – to the crypto space. This isn’t about being first to market. It’s about being right. “If you don’t start out as a crypto skeptic, there’s something wrong with you,” writes Blue Macellari, T Rowe Price’s head of digital assets, in one of three recent research papers on cryptocurrencies the firm shared with us. It’s a revealing admission that captures Price’s approach: start with skepticism, follow the data, and let the conclusions emerge. Price hired Macellari, a former crypto hedge fund executive, in 2022, not to chase trends but to build genuine expertise. The firm has spent years “monitoring developments in the digital assets space closely and developing the ability to trade digital assets,” according to company statements. Those conclusions, detailed in research by Justin Thomson (Head of the T Rowe Price Investment Institute) and Stefan Hubrich (Head of Global Multi-Asset Research), suggest that digital assets have reached an inflection point. They’re not just speculative toys anymore; they’re potentially evolving into a legitimate asset class. The key insight: while Bitcoin has endured four drawdowns exceeding 70%, each near-death experience has been followed by stronger recoveries. Despite extreme volatility (daily price swings of 5-10% remain common), the asset class refuses to disappear. More importantly, Price’s analysts have identified a potential path from “risk-on” to “risk-off” status for digital assets. If volatility dampens and cryptocurrencies decorrelate from other risk assets like high-growth equities, they could transition from speculative investments to mainstream portfolio components. For a firm built on fundamental analysis, cryptocurrencies posed a unique problem: how do you value an asset with no cash flows, no earnings, and no balance sheet? T Rowe Price analyst David Kroger addressed this by adapting traditional discounted cash flow frameworks, using staking rewards as a substitute for cash flow in the valuation process. The methodology acknowledges that cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks with different consensus mechanisms; Bitcoin uses energy-intensive “proof of work” mining, while Ethereum employs “proof of stake” validation. (No, I have no clue what those phrases mean.) The critical distinction: unlike gold (another non-cash-generating asset), Bitcoin is actually used for real-world transactions. With Bitcoin’s programmatically fixed supply of 21 million tokens, growth in transaction volume measured in USD necessitates a rising price for Bitcoin. This creates a potential return framework if Bitcoin transaction volumes grow alongside the broader economy. Over the 12 months ended August 2024, more than $1.3 billion in fees were expended on the Bitcoin network to support a total transaction volume of $2.4 trillion, demonstrating real economic utility. The crypto ETF filing comes at a pivotal moment for T Rowe Price. Like many active managers, the firm has faced persistent outflows as investors gravitate toward lower-cost passive strategies. The firm manages $1.77 trillion in assets but has been “seeking to diversify into new areas,” according to industry analysts. In response, Price has launched 24 ETFs in recent years—a dramatic expansion for a firm historically focused on mutual funds. Last month, it announced a partnership with Goldman Sachs to develop new private market products for retail investors. The Active Crypto ETF represents both a continuation of this ETF strategy and something more: evidence that Price’s research apparatus sees genuine opportunity in digital assets, not just a need to check a product box. As VettaFi’s Todd Rosenbluth noted, “It’s exciting to see them expand their ETF lineup beyond stock and bond exposure.” Price’s researchers acknowledge sympathy for the “digital gold” thesis: the view that Bitcoin could serve as a hedge against financial collapse, similar to physical gold but with advantages like algorithmic scarcity rather than mere physical limits. But they’ve moved beyond that framework. Understanding value in crypto means “applying alternative notions of utility; it is a parallel world to ‘Trad-Fi,’ with a different lexicon,” Thomson writes. That lexicon includes concepts like decentralized applications (DApps), decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), and token burning, all of which create potential economic value flows. The comparison to gold is instructive but incomplete. Both Bitcoin and gold have scarcity value and bear a cost of carry since neither generates income. But Bitcoin’s algorithmic supply limit (the “halving” that occurs every four years until 2140, when the maximum 21 million tokens will exist) distinguishes it from paper currencies printed without theoretical limits. Thomson opens his research with a cautionary tale about a 1999 stock called Fyffes that jumped 40% in one day merely by announcing a virtual fruit market, then contrasts it with a 2024 crypto entrepreneur paying $6.2 million for a banana duct-taped to a wall before eating it in front of journalists. Both stories feature “a whiff of alchemy and transience—that wealth can be created and destroyed from fumes,” Thomson writes. Yet his conclusion is not to dismiss crypto but to separate “the ephemeral from the permanent, the froth from the substance, Ponzi from probity.” Price’s framework suggests that for digital assets to merit inclusion in diversified portfolios, they need an expectation of positive future returns, specifically, excess returns above cash that reward investors for accepting risk. Traditional assets like stocks (with equity risk premiums) and bonds (with duration premiums) have decades of data supporting this expectation. Digital assets have reached what Price calls the “gold stage.” They have economic value greater than zero. The next step is establishing a durable long-term return thesis beyond merely betting on continued adoption or financial collapse. The fact that Price is willing to file for a crypto ETF suggests its research team believes that thesis is taking shape. Hubrich’s analysis is particularly telling: “To formulate a long-term return thesis for digital assets (Das), investors will need to determine whether passive holders should expect to participate in the value added by the blockchain. The answer is likely to depend on the DA, so this analysis will need to be conducted on a case-by-case basis.” This is precisely the type of granular, security-by-security analysis that Price has applied to stocks and bonds for decades. Dominic Rizzo, who manages some of T Rowe Price’s ETFs, signaled the firm’s direction at an ETF conference earlier in 2025, noting that “now is a good time to consider bitcoin exposure” and comparing cryptocurrency pricing to commodities, saying it “closely tracks the cost of mining it.” These weren’t off-the-cuff remarks but deliberate signals from a firm that doesn’t speculate publicly. When the government shutdown ends and the SEC resumes processing applications, Price won’t be first out of the gate. But if the firm’s research proves prescient, the T Rowe Price Active Crypto ETF could establish the standard for how thoughtful, non-speculative institutional investors approach digital assets by applying rigorous fundamental analysis to select among cryptocurrencies based on network usage, staking rewards, adoption trends, and value creation. For a firm that has navigated the Great Depression, multiple wars, the dot-com bubble, the global financial crisis, and countless market cycles, launching a crypto ETF is not a panic move or a desperate grab for assets. It’s a calculated decision backed by years of research and a belief that digital assets are evolving into something durable. As software engineer Jameson Lopp observes in Thomson’s research: “First step to understanding crypto: admitting you don’t understand crypto. Final step: realizing that ‘understanding’ is a moving target.” For T Rowe Price, that journey from skepticism to cautious embrace reflects the same discipline that has defined the firm for nearly nine decades. The research led somewhere uncomfortable, somewhere new, somewhere volatile—and Price followed. Whether that decision proves prescient or premature won’t be known for years. But it demonstrates that even the most conservative firms must evolve when the research is clear. Sometimes the most characteristic move is the one that looks uncharacteristic.

Title: Consumer sentiment is sinking across the board — except for Americans with the most stocks

Jason Ma is the weekend editor at Fortune, where he covers markets, the economy, finance, and housing. The ongoing government shutdown has helped push confidence to near-record lows, but one segment of the population is actually feeling more optimistic. The initial reading for the University of Michigan’s sentiment index fell to 50.3 in November from 53.6 last month, almost matching the all-time low of 50 from June 2022, when the annual rate of inflation hit its post-pandemic high. “With the federal government shutdown dragging on for over a month, consumers are now expressing worries about potential negative consequences for the economy,” Joanne Hsu, the survey’s director, said in a statement Friday. The decline was widespread and was seen across different age groups, income brackets, and political affiliations, she added. But not everyone followed that trend. “One key exception: consumers with the largest tercile of stock holdings posted a notable 11% increase in sentiment, supported by continued strength in stock markets,” Hsu said. The survey closed before Tuesday’s elections, which revealed continued voter discontent about affordability as food and energy prices creep higher. The timing is also notable given that it didn’t capture the most recent stock market selloff that sent the Nasdaq to its worst weekly loss since April’s trade war chaos. That came as investors grew more concerned about the AI boom looking like a bubble that could pop soon. Until this past week, the stock market was on a hot streak, notching fresh record high after record high, with the S&P 500 even closing in on the 7,000 milestone. The market’s impact on consumer sentiment comes as stock ownership has broadened over past five years into more income and age groups. A separate University of Michigan report from last month said the increase in market participation has been especially large among lower-income consumers, while participation rates of younger and older consumers have caught up with middle-aged consumers. In fact, a survey released last month from the BlackRock Foundation and Commonwealth showed that over 54% of Americans earning $30,000 to $79,999 a year are now retail investors in the capital markets. And more than half of that cohort began investing in the past five years. Stock ownership has highlighted a divergence in consumer sentiment in recent months: investors are turning more upbeat while non-investors have turned more pessimistic, according to University of Michigan data from October. And participants with the top 20% of stock holdings are especially optimistic. The spilt even mirrors the K-shaped economy that has emerged as higher-income Americans continue to spend and prop up overall consumption, while others have pulled back. Meanwhile, the so-called wealth effect of higher asset prices on consumer spending has become more potent in the last 15 years, making it harder to separate the stock market from the economy. Today, a $1 increase in stock wealth leads to a $0.05 marginal propensity to consume, up from less than $0.02 in 2010, according to Oxford Economics. The University of Michigan pointed out in October that sentiment among stock market participants had been on the rise since May—after tumbling in April when President Donald Trump shocked global markets with his “Liberation Day” tariffs. By contrast, sentiment for non-stockholders continued to decline and had already hit post-pandemic lows. “These patterns are consistent with the fact that strong asset values support consumer sentimentonly for those who own those assets,” the report said. “Meanwhile, given that wealthier, higher-income consumers generate a disproportionate share of aggregate spending, the recent uptick in sentiment among these households may may help buoy consumption spending even amid views of the economy that are relatively subdued from a historical perspective.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Refining My Conservative Retirement Target Portfolio

Using historical data on funds to make assumptions about future performance involves correctly interpreting the trends. Over the past six years, the U.S. has experienced an extraordinarily unusual period: During the next six years, we will probably experience another bear market and modest to moderate inflation. Interest rates are likely to continue falling in the short-term, but not as low as the decade following the financial crisis because of less Quantitative Easing and higher deficits and national debt. High valuations are a headwind to equity returns, and high interest rates are a tailwind for bond returns. In January 2020, before the start of the COVID bar market, the price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 was an elevated 26 and is currently 31. I believe that the full COVID Cycle from January 2020 to December 2021 and 2025 are more representative of market conditions for the next six years than the period from January 2022 to December 2024. In this article, I explore how alternative investments and mixed asset funds with flexible strategies can be used to develop a conservative portfolio. To evaluate funds, I selected thirty-six funds in twenty-three different Lipper Categories that had good risk-adjusted performance during the full COVID cycle and 2025. I created an optimizer using Excel Solver to maximize the Martin Ratio for the full COVID cycle with constraints for portfolio concentration, minimum returns, drawdowns, yields, allocation to “junk bonds”, and consistency across the individual years and bear markets. Figure #1 shows the performance during the past four bear markets by allocation to stocks for all of the 461 mixed asset funds in the Lipper global dataset with at least six years of history. Note that the severity of the bear market has a larger impact on the portfolio performance than the of the stock to bond ratio. The two black dashed lines show a range of likely maximum downturns for the three bear markets, excluding the dotcom bear market, which was associated with a mild recession. The three maroon squares are the maximum drawdowns of the “Conservative” and “Moderate” portfolios that I created and the target portfolio that I described last month in Putting My Conservative Retirement Portfolio on Cruise Control. The two portfolios created for this article had low to average drawdowns. Figure #1: Mixed Asset Fund Drawdowns During Four Bear Markets Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Table #1 shows the average annualized returns over the past six years for the mixed asset funds and the “Conservative”, “Moderate”, and original target portfolio. The two new portfolios outperformed both the mixed asset funds and the original target portfolio. Table #1: Mixed Asset Fund Returns for Past Six Years Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. I am currently reading “A Crash Course on Crises: Macroeconomic Concepts for Run-Ups, Collapses, and Recoveries” by Princeton University economics professor Markus K. Brunnermeier and London School of Economics professor Ricardo Reis, which researches the interrelationship between financial markets and the economy during a crisis. They describe part of their audience to be “members of the informed public wanting to absorb some of the concepts that should be guiding both macroeconomic and financial policy.” The book contains some wonderful insights into investing behavior, such as “Why don’t other, more sophisticated investors, lean against the bubble, preventing it from arising in the first place?” They continue, “These investors try to forecast how long the bubble will persist, which is governed by the trading behavior of the other (sophisticated) investors.” I have no illusions that I can predict the behavior of other sophisticated investors. As described by Hyman Minsky, many crises are preceded by some type of innovation (such as artificial intelligence) followed by long periods of price increases, speculation, and leverage. These are followed by a period of instability and traders becoming risk-averse and de-leveraging. Stock market price-to-earnings ratios were around 18 before the 1929 stock market crash, peaked at 34 prior to the bursting of the dotcom bubble, hit 21 prior to the start of the financial crisis, and are now at an elevated 31. There are usually “triggering events” that set off chain reactions between asset markets and financial markets that determine the severity of corrections and whether a macro-financial crisis results. At the National Association for Business Economics, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said, “When COVID-19 struck in March 2020, the economy came to a near standstill and financial markets seized up, threatening to transform a public health crisis into a severe, prolonged economic downturn.” The stage is set for a correction, and there are plenty of potential “triggering events” such as a slowing economy, rising inflation, potential supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical risk. Figure #2 represents the investing environment for the past six years. Fiscal and monetary stimulus contained the economic fallout from the COVID bear market lasting from January 2020 through March of that year, but Personal Consumption Price inflation rose from a half percent following the COVID bear market to nearly seven percent by January 2022. Charles Boccadoro described The Great Normalization (TGN) in which interest rates normalized to higher rates, hurting bond performance. The TGN bear market lasted from January 2022 to September of that year. By December 2023, the price-to-earnings ratio had crossed the high valuation level of $25 per dollar of earnings. The debasement trade is partly the result of investors and global central banks buying gold and the increased acceptance of cryptocurrency. I believe that the dollar will weaken but not be replaced as the global reserve currency, and the debasement trade is overbought. Figure #2: The COVID and Great Normalization Full Cycles Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. The full COVID Cycle was from January 2020 to December 2021 and includes the COVID bear market and inflation. I expect cycles of bear markets and inflation to be more frequent in the coming decade than in the decade following the financial crisis. Rates are high, so “The Great Normalization” of rising rates is unlikely to occur to such extremes for many years. Finally, valuations are currently high and more likely to fall than rise either over time or in a correction with a “triggering event”. I set up my Excel optimizer for both the Conservative and Moderate portfolios to maximize the Martin Ratio for the January 2020 to December 2021 period by changing allocations to 36 funds with constraints that I wanted to have drawdowns of less than nine percent for both the COVID and TGN bear markets. Maximum allocations were set for Alternative, Bond, Equity, and Mixed Asset fund types to ensure diversification. The Conservative portfolio has additional constraints of having yields at least 4% with less than 13% allocated to lower quality “junk bonds”. Figure #3 contains the inflation-adjusted results from Portfolio Visualizer assuming 4% annual withdrawals for the Conservative, Moderate, and Original Target Portfolio compared to the Fidelity Asset Manager 40% (FFANX), which is a good global mixed asset fund. The link is provided here. The Conservative and Moderate portfolios had similar returns through 2023, with the Moderate portfolio having higher volatility. Both beat inflation over the six years after adjusting for withdrawals. During the period of rising valuations and the debasement trade, the Moderate Portfolio has outperformed. Both outperformed the Original Target Portfolio from my last article because of a wider selection of funds under consideration, improvements in methodology, and an increase in the maximum allocation for a fund from 10% to 15%. All three outperformed the 40/60 baseline fund, which was negatively impacted during the rising rates period. Figure #3: Conservative and Moderate Portfolio Growth – Six Years Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer Table #2 contains the resulting allocations with the funds sorted from the lowest Ulcer Ratio over the past six years to the highest. I own shares in FPFIX/FFIRX, PCBAX, PMAIX, PZRMX, and AVALX. It will take a couple of years to fill out the rest of the portfolio, depending upon cash flows, and I will lean towards the less risky funds next. Table #2: Portfolio Allocations Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Table #3 contains the portfolio metrics for the period May 2019 to September 2025 from Portfolio Visualizer. Annualized returns are after withdrawals, while Time-Weighted Rate of Return reflects investment performance. Table #3: Portfolio Performance Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer Table #4 contains the metrics and ratings from MFO for the funds for the past six years. They are sorted from the lowest Ulcer Index, which measures the depth and duration of drawdowns from the lowest to the highest. MFO Risk is based on the Ulcer Index comparing all funds, while the Ulcer Rating is for funds within the same category peers. Martin Ratio is the risk-free return divided by the Ulcer Index. The MFO Rating is based on the Martin Ratio for funds within the same Lipper Category. The Batting Average Rating (BA) is based on the percentage of the months that a fund beat its peers. One takeaway is that some of the funds outperformed during down markets but lagged peers overall. Table #4: Fund Metrix – Six Years Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Optimization depends on having funds with low correlations to each other. Notice that some funds had their maximum drawdowns during the COVID (2020) bear market, and some had them during the Great Normalization (2022) bear market. Table #5 shows how the funds performed in each of the bear markets and the bull markets. The lower-risk funds provide some safety during downturns, while the riskier funds provide growth potential. Blue shaded cells indicate the best performers, and red are the worst performers. Table #5: Fund Performance During COVID and Great Normalization Cycles Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Columbia Thermostat bases its stock to bond allocation on valuations. During the financial crisis, the strategy was to invest in all stocks or bonds, and it did not perform well. It has improved its strategy to have a range of allocations depending on price levels and performed well during the COVID bear market. The Fact Sheet indicates that the fund is currently 70% invested in fixed income and 30% invested in equity. It contains the allocation to stocks by the S&P 500 level. BlackRock Tactical Opportunities (PBAIX, PCBAX) is an Alternative Global Macro fund that has performed well since the 2008 financial crisis, but during the financial crisis fell nearly 27% in 2008 and returned 26% in 2009. I own shares in PCBAX, but limit allocations to alternatives because they use derivatives, which can be less predictable during a crisis. Eaton Vance Global Macro Absolute Return (EAGMX) is another good Alternative Global Macro fund that had a maximum drawdown of 7% during the financial crisis. I included it in the original target portfolio from last month. The Permanent Portfolio (PRPFX) is based on the concepts developed by Harry Browne in the 1980s to provide steady, long-term growth with low volatility without trying to time the market. The fund managers describe Permanent Portfolio (PRPFX) as, “Designed as a core portfolio holding, Permanent Portfolio seeks to preserve and increase the purchasing power value of each shareholder’s account over the long-term, regardless of current or future market conditions, through strategic investments in a broad array of different asset classes.” It invests fixed percentages of its net assets in dollar assets (35%), gold (20%), aggressive growth stocks (15%), real estate and natural resource stocks (15%), Swiss Franc assets (10%), and silver (5%). The PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX) is described by the fund managers as “By investing in a blend of inflation-related asset classes, the fund seeks to help preserve and grow purchasing power, enhance portfolio diversification, and guard against market shocks across varying inflation environments.” It currently has a composition of Inflation Linked Bonds 68%), Commodities (22%), Currencies (15%), REITS (10%), and Precious Metals (10%). I own shares in PZRMX. Figure #4 contains some of the funds that did well during 2020 to 2022 with high inflation. These are mostly in the Flexible Portfolio Lipper Category plus DIVO in equity income, Permanent Portfolio (PRPFX, maroon line) in the Alternative Global Macro category, and the PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX, red line) in the Flexible Portfolio Category. During the period in between the bear markets, the S&P 500 rose 89% while core bonds rose a paltry 2.5%. Figure #4: Fund Performance During Inflation (2020 – 2022) Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset and St. Louis Federal Reserve FRED database. From 2012 through 2019, Permanent Portfolio (PRPFX) and PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX) had very similar performance. From 2019 through 2021, PRPFX outperformed PZRMX and greatly outperformed starting in 2023. I prefer owning PRPFX and PZRMX to directly owning gold because it is much more volatile. Over the past year, I decreased my allocation to stock from 65% to 50% which is a small decrease in risk. Rebalancing during high market valuations and downturns is a modest way of “buying low and selling high”. I believe that risk risk-adjusted performance of bonds to be greater than equities for the next few years. Using the bucket approach to match risk assets with spending needs and using bond ladders does more to reduce portfolio risk than lowering the allocation to stocks. As a qualifier, I use financial advisors to manage the majority of my portfolio using a traditional, globally diversified 60/40 portfolio. I am developing this “Conservative Portfolio” strategy for a subset of the portfolio that I manage in addition to traditional bond funds and bond ladders to have liquidity available in any market condition, and with some growth potential.

Welcome to the casino! GraniteShares 3x Short AMD Daily ETP, a product marketed for European investors, recently pulled off the rare feat of going to zero. The fund, purely a speculator’s trading vehicle, was designed to rise by 3% for every 1% that AMD stock fell. Perfect opp for experienced sharks to dart in, tear off a chunk of carcass, and get out before anything bad can happen. Think of a holding time that might be measured in seconds, and you’re there. The fund imploded when AMD announced a deal with OpenAI to deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD Instinct GPUs for OpenAI’s next-generation AI infrastructure. AMD’s stock surged up 37% before the market even opened. In consequence, the fund was structured to fall by more than 100% leading to an “index cancellation redemption event.” Alternatively, it is a good reminder that in a casino, the house always wins. Akre Focus Fund completed its reorganization into the Akre Focus ETF effective October 27th. The reorganization will result in no changes to its investment objectives or fundamental investment approach. The ETF is expected to deliver the strategy in a more cost-effective, tax-efficient, and flexible format for shareholders. ARK Bitcoin Yield ETF is in registration. Catherine D. Wood and William Scherer will oversee the daily operations of the ETF. Expenses have not been stated. BBH Select Series Large Cap and Mid Cap funds will be reorganized into related ETFs. Existing fund shareholders will be shareholders of the ETFs before the commencement of trading on November 17th. BBH touts the ability to trade intraday, portfolio transparency, and potentially lower expenses and tax bills as reasons for considering the ETFs. The reorganization will be a tax-free event. The case for the fund, beyond that, is open to question. Each fund has about half a billion in assets and, by Morningstar’s measure, offers low relative risk but below-average returns. As measured by the Sharpe ratio, the funds are not compelling; each is below its benchmark and category over the past three years, with managers who have been on board for about four (Large Cap) and two years (Mid Cap). Dimensional Funds Advisors has filed a registration statement for its first ETF share class of funds since Vanguard’s patent expired in 2023. The 13 incipient ETFs are: U.S. Large Company, U.S. Large Cap Equity, U.S. Small Cap Value, U.S. Targeted Value, U.S. Core Equity 1, U.S. Core Equity 2, U.S. Vector Equity, U.S. Small Cap, U.S. Micro Cap, U.S. High Relative Profitability, DFA Real Estate Securities, U.S. Large Cap Growth, U.S. Small Cap Growth ETF The SEC has stated that it is going to issue an order allowing the firm to have this type of structure. JP Morgan has completed its reorganization of its JP Morgan National Municipal Income Fund into the JP Morgan Municipal ETF effective October 27, 2025. Lazard Emerging Markets Core Equity Portfolio Fund was converted into the Lazard Emerging Markets Opportunities ETF on October 27, 2025. Pabrai Wagons ETF is in registration. Mohnish Pabrai will be the portfolio manager; expenses have not been stated. Our colleague, Devesh Shah, profiled the estimable Mr. Pabrai and the open-end fund version in “The Pabrai Fund Overview and Interview with Mohnish Pabrai” (10/2024). Top 20% among global small- to mid-caps in 2024, bottom 10% YTD in 2025, much smaller and cheaper stocks than its peers, fully invested. Thrivent Core Small Cap Value fund will be converted into an ETF, pending receipt of shareholder approval, on November 21, 2025. Vanguard launched the Vanguard Emerging Markets ex-China ETF (VEXC). The portfolio managers for VEXC will be Michael Perre, Jeffrey Miller, and John Kraynak, CFA. The ETF will launch with an expected expense ratio of 0.07%. The ETF will offer exposure to emerging markets equities while excluding securities classified by FTSE as being based in China. American Century Small Cap Value fund will reopen to new investors on December 9th. It has been closed since August 2021. Effective December 1, 2025, Clearbridge Small Cap Growth Fund will reopen to purchases (and incoming exchanges!) from new investors. Wasatch International Small Cap Value and Global Small Cap Value funds began to be offered to investors on October 1. Effective as of December 8, 2025, the AMG Montrusco Bolton Large Cap Growth Fund becomes the AMG GW&K Small Cap Growth Fund, (ii) make changes to its principal investment strategies and principal risks, (iii) changes from “non‑diversified” to “diversified”, (iv) replaces the S&P 500 Growth Index, one of its benchmark indices, with the Russell 2000 Growth Index and (v) gets a new management team. Other than that, all quiet. Effective October 29, 2025, the CCM Global Equity ETF (CCMG) became the Sequoia Global Value ETF (SFGV). The fund launched in January 2024, modestly trails its peers and benchmark … and has drawn a billion in assets. Curious. The Frontier MFG Core Infrastructure Fund was renamed the MFG Core Infrastructure Fund on October 31, 2025. On or about December 15, 2025, the Gabelli Automation ETF will change to the Gabelli Global Technology Leaders ETF. Given that the fund has accumulated a tepid record and under $7 million AUM in nearly four years, I wouldn’t be rushing in. On April 21, 2025, Macquarie Group Limited, the parent company of Delaware Investments Funds Advisers, announced that it had entered into an agreement for Nomura Holding America Inc. to acquire Macquarie Asset Management’s US and European public investments business. The transaction closed on November 1, 2025. One consequence is that Macquarie funds will pick up the Nomura name. Should the Board approve these name changes, they would become effective as of May 1, 2026. On or around December 19, 2025, the Rayliant Quantamental Emerging Market ex-China Equity ETF will be succeeded by the Rayliant Wilshire NxtGen Emerging Markets Equity ETF. Among the … uhh, tweaks, accompanying the name change: “the Fund will transition from an actively-managed exchange-traded fund that invests primarily in equity securities of companies in emerging markets, excluding China, to a passively-managed ETF that seeks to track the performance of a machine learning-driven index that includes equity securities of companies in emerging markets, including China.” Quick heads up for shoppers: no need to buy Christmas presents for the Alger Weatherbie Enduring Growth ETF, which will endure no more as of Christmas Eve, 2025. ATAC US Rotation ETF departed on October 24, 2025. That’s separate from the older, more successful ATAC Rotation Fund, which remains. The ETF has $4 million, and the fund has about $50 million. Azoria 500 Meritocracy ETF and Azoria TSLA Convexity ETF will be liquidated on December 15, 2025. Apparently, the Fidelity Digital Health ETF has declared digitally terminal and is expected to liquidate on or about November 20, 2025. Fidelity SAI Municipal Bond Index Fund is expected to liquidate on or about November 12, 2025. On October 16, 2025, the Board of Trustees of Fidelity Merrimack Street Trust approved the liquidation of the Fidelity Sustainable Core Plus Bond ETF on or about November 20, 2025. The flames died out for the FIRE Funds Wealth Builder ETF and FIRE Funds™ Income Target ETF on October 30, 2025. The Guardian Capital Fundamental Global Equity Fund and the Alta Quality Growth Fund will be liquidating their assets at the close of business on December 3, 2025. Humankind US Stock ETF will be liquidated on or about December 8, 2025. LeaderShares Activist Leaders ETF and LeaderShares Equity Skew ETF joined the ranks of former funds on October 30, 2025. Otter Creek Long/Short Opportunity fund and the Otter Creek Focus Strategy ETF will be liquidated on October 30th. Keith Long was one of the portfolio managers and the founder of Otter Creek Management until he passed away in August 2023. The Rayliant Quantamental China Equity ETF will be liquidated on December 5, 2025. The Saratoga Funds, Energy & Basic Materials Portfolio, the Financial Services Portfolio, and the Municipal Bond Portfolio will be liquidated on December 17, 2025. Sterling Capital Focus Equity ETF won’t be making it to Thanksgiving this year; the fund is slated to liquidate, terminate, evaporate, and eviscerate on November 24, 2025. Thrivent Core Low Volatility Equity Fund and Thrivent Core Mid Cap Value Fund ceased their thriving on October 22, 2025. Victory High Income Municipal Bond Fund will have its final opportunity to declare victory on or about December 22, 2025. Thereafter, it will be a former fund. The Shadow here! Like Mark, I’m a long-time member of the MFO community. I’ve started over 2300 discussion threads, most focusing on developments in the fund industry. I am a personal investor that was introduced to mutual funds when I was young to fund my college education.

Title: Microsoft Has Reportedly Developed “Toolkits” to Break NVIDIA’s CUDA Dominance, Slashing Inference Costs with AMD AI GPUs
URL: https://wccftech.com/microsoft-has-developed-toolkits-to-break-nvidia-cuda-dominance/
Time Published: 2025-11-08T15:44:28Z
Full Content:
Microsoft is exploring ways to leverage the 'stack' of its AMD GPUs for inferencing workloads, as the company develops toolkits that convert NVIDIA CUDA models into ROCm-supported code. One of the reasons NVIDIA has managed to retain its dominance in the AI space is that the firm has a robust CUDA software ecosystem in place, which its competitors, such as AMD, cannot currently rival. Efforts have been made to allow cross-platform support of software stacks, but we haven't seen a solution that has become mainstream. However, according to a 'high-ranking' Microsoft employee, it is reported that the tech giant has developed 'toolkits' that allow the firm to run CUDA code on AMD GPUs by translating it into a ROCm-compatible version. Breaking CUDA's dominance isn't an easy task, as the software ecosystem is so integral to the AI industry that its adoption is almost ubiquitous, even in nations like China. However, Microsoft's toolkit, mentioned by the employee, likely employs a route that has been in the market for quite some time. One way to perform a CUDA-to-ROCm translation is through a runtime compatibility layer, which enables CUDA API calls to be translated into ROCm without requiring complete source code rewrites. One example of this is the ZLUDA tool, which intercepts CUDA calls, translates them into ROCm, and does so without requiring a full recompile. We built some toolkits to help convert like CUDA models to ROCm so you could use it on an AMD, like a 300X. We have had a lot of inquiries about what is our path with AMD, the 400X and the 450X. We're actually working with AMD on that to see what we can do to maximize that. However, due to ROCm still being a relatively 'immature' software stack, there are several API calls or pieces of code in CUDA that have no mapping with AMD's software, which, in some cases, collapses the performance, which is a high-risk problem in large datacenter environments. Another possible variant of the toolkit being mentioned here is likely an end-to-end cloud migration tool that integrates with Azure, targeting both AMD and NVIDIA instances. Of course, this does bring problems when conversions happen on a large scale, but by the looks of it, the toolkits developed by Microsoft appear to be in confined use. Now, the reason why Microsoft is pursuing the 'software conversions' here is simply because the firm is seeing an increase in inference workloads, and the company is looking for a more cost-effective workload, which is why AMD's AI chips make sense here, since they are the only counterpart to the 'pricey' NVIDIA GPUs. And since you cannot leave out CUDA models across inference environments, the translation from it to ROCm becomes the next big step for Microsoft.

Over the last few months, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has been on a tear of dealmaking, announcing multibillion dollar agreements with the biggest tech companies in the world. There’s Oracle, Nvidia, Microsoft, AMD, Broadcom, and most recently, Amazon. He’s committed to spending a grand sum total of $1.4 trillion on datacenters in the coming years — an eyebrow-raising figure for a company which claims its annual revenue is projected to reach $20 billion this year, begging an all-important question for the entire tech industry, whose fate is now tied to OpenAI: What happens if he can’t pay? At an event this week, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar seemed to suggest that the government could act as a “backstop” for the company’s commitments — comments she later walked back. And in a long-winded post on X, Altman addressed the question of what happens to OpenAI if its web of deals falls apart: “If we screw up and can’t fix it, we should fail, and other companies will continue on doing good work and servicing customers,” Altman said. “...We of course could be wrong, and the market—not the government—will deal with it if we are.” The odds don’t look great right now. In order to come through on its compute commitments, OpenAI’s revenue would have to grow to an estimated $577 billion by 2029, roughly the size of Google’s revenue that same year, Tomasz Tunguz, a general partner at Theory Ventures, wrote in a recent blog post. That’s a roughly 2900% jump from its current projections for 2025. But OpenAI has options. One likely scenario is that the AI company pays for and utilizes only a portion of the compute it has booked, said D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria. In that case, companies like Oracle, Amazon, Microsoft, CoreWeave and others will most likely renegotiate the contracts and ensure they get at least some amount of business from OpenAI, especially if the alternative is getting none at all. “They don't want OpenAI to go bankrupt, so their incentive is to renegotiate,” he told Forbes. “He’s taking all this commitment knowing that he's not going to actually face any consequences because he doesn't have a financial stake.” Renegotiating contracts isn’t uncommon in the data center world. These contracts are extremely complex and often spread out over a span of years; some parties can even further extend timelines in case companies aren’t able to meet commitments. Clients like OpenAI are typically billed on the basis of usage. The “big numbers” being announced are often larger than what’s actually committed under contract, largely due to variables like share price, data center construction cost and GPU price, data center expert Daniel Golding said. For instance, OpenAI has committed to buy up to 6 GW of AMD’s chips (estimated to be worth around $90 billion) in exchange for about 10% of AMD shares—no cash on either side. But that hinges on performance milestones for OpenAI’s technology and commercial business as well as AMD’s share price. The contracts often have some capital I ifs. Thanks to constraints on power supply and chip availability, there’s a possibility that some of these infrastructure providers aren’t able to deliver in time, another opportunity for OpenAI to weasel out of paying some of the top line number. OpenAI’s $22.4 billion in total contracts with CoreWeave, for instance, can be terminated by either party at any time “for cause” (legal speak for things like delays). But even with about a trillion dollars on the line, the bigger risk in Altman’s mind is not having access to enough cheap compute to train and run better AI models when the time comes— a move that is crucial for revenue growth. “We believe the risk to OpenAI of not having enough computing power is more significant and more likely than the risk of having too much,” he said, adding that the company is also exploring ways to sell compute to other companies directly, much like CoreWeave does. When reached for comment, OpenAI spokesperson Steve Sharpe said the company has “nothing to add.” Altman’s fixation on grabbing as much gargantuan compute as he can is not surprising. He has always knelt at the altar of scaling laws. Earlier this year, Altman mused on the coming of AGI, or artificial general intelligence, the company’s overarching goal of creating AI that matches or surpasses human capabilities. “The intelligence of an AI model roughly equals the log of the resources used to train and run it,” he wrote, noting you could get “continuous and predictable gains” from pumping money into those resources. “The scaling laws that predict this are accurate over many orders of magnitude,” he wrote. Even before ChatGPT was released, he told employees at his crypto-cum-identity company Worldcoin (now called World), that one of his personal operating principles is “scale it up and see what happens,” something he’s found effective with everything from large neural networks to fusion reactors, Forbes reported. And the faster the better. Scaling up “earlier than it makes sense to … is super, super valuable,” he told Worldcoin employees. “The math that Mr. Altman is doing in his head is ‘they need me more than I need them.’” Experts note chief dealmaker Altman doesn’t have anything to lose. He has repeatedly claimed he does not have a stake in the company, and won’t have a stake even after OpenAI has restructured to become a public benefit corporation. “He has the upside, in a sense, in terms of influence, if it all succeeds,” said Ofer Eldar, a corporate governance professor at the UC Berkeley School of Law. “He's taking all this commitment knowing that he's not going to actually face any consequences because he doesn't have a financial stake.” That’s not good corporate governance, according to Jo-Ellen Pozner, a professor of management and entrepreneurship at Santa Clara University’s Leavey School of Business. “We allow leaders that we see as being super pioneering to behave idiosyncratically, and when things move in the opposite direction and somebody has to pay, it's unclear that they're the ones that are going to have to pay,” she said. Luria adds: “He can commit to as much as he wants. He can commit to a trillion dollars, ten trillion, a hundred trillion dollars. It doesn't matter. Either he uses it, he renegotiates it, or he walks away.” There are of course more indirect stakes for Altman, experts said, like the reputational blow he’d take if the deals fall apart. But on paper, he’d seemingly be off the hook, they said. As OpenAI has grown in prominence, tech giants have clamored to strike deals with the AI behemoth. “More of the world wants to work with us, so deals are quicker to negotiate,” Altman said recently. And they’ve reaped the upsides: Oracle, Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom gained a collective $636 billion in market cap on the days their deals were announced. Most recently, when OpenAI announced a $38 billion AI infrastructure deal with Amazon on Monday, the company’s stock increased 4%, adding $10 billion to Jeff Bezos’ net worth. “The math that Mr. Altman is doing in his head is ‘they need me more than I need them,’” Luria said. Companies involved in these circular deals have already indicated they’re willing to bail each other out. In September, Nvidia said it would buy CoreWeave’s unsold computing capacity through 2032, initially worth $6.3 billion. Presumably, that could expand to include anything OpenAI doesn’t use given that it’s CoreWeave’s largest customer. “If you owe the bank a hundred thousand dollars, the bank owns you. If you owe the bank a hundred million dollars, you own the bank,” said Lloyd Walmsley, a Mizuho analyst who covers Meta, Google and Amazon. “ Everyone's holding hands and, and having this leap of faith that the products are so powerful.” It’s also possible that OpenAI uses all the compute it has booked, and needs more. In that case, the AI titan will need to raise more funding—either through private or public markets—and increase its revenue exponentially. Part of why Altman has spoken about a potential OpenAI IPO is that it would make raising cheaper debt much easier. Altman said on Thursday that he’s confident that revenue will continue to grow, primarily from upcoming enterprise products and categories like robotics and consumer devices. Then, take the extreme case. If OpenAI were to file for bankruptcy protection, who would get paid first? Who would, in Sam Altman’s words, “get burnt”? For one, it’s entirely possible that some cash-rich company, perhaps one on the other end of one of its big contracts like Microsoft or Oracle, buys it in a fire sale. In the very unlikely event OpenAI goes bankrupt and liquidates instead, debtholders would get their money back first. Then equity investors, and finally—if there’s anything left over—common shareholders. OpenAI has only announced one debt deal so far, a $4 billion credit facility with nine banks including JPMorgan, Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. The company announced the loan in October 2024 and said it is a revolving credit facility (akin to a giant corporate credit card). It’s unclear if OpenAI has additional debt, which it isn’t required to disclose as a private company. “If you owe the bank a hundred thousand dollars, the bank owns you. If you owe the bank a hundred million dollars, you own the bank.” King among OpenAI’s equity holders is Microsoft, which owns 27% of the company following OpenAI’s restructuring as a for-profit company last week. Microsoft has invested $11.6 billion of its $13 billion commitment to OpenAI, and OpenAI has committed to purchase $250 billion of Microsoft Azure’s compute services over the coming years. The companies have two-way plans to share revenue. “Of the dominoes that are going to fall when OpenAI can't pay everybody [and the question arises of] who gets paid first, and I'd argue that Microsoft gets paid first,” Luria added. Other large shareholders include Thrive, SoftBank, Dragoneer and investors in the $6 billion merger between Jony Ive’s io and OpenAI. Common shareholders—employees, cofounders and the nonprofit—would get what’s left, proportionally to how much they paid for their shares. Interestingly, OpenAI’s nonprofit holds a special “Class N” common share, which gives it majority voting and veto power in elections of board directors, though that share isn’t entitled to any financial return if the company were to go under. (The nonprofit’s 26% stake likely also includes ordinary common shares.) Altman’s wheeling and dealing is nothing short of mind-boggling, though many of the biggest payments aren’t due for a few years. In the AI universe, that’s plenty of time to figure out how he’s going to pay for it all, whether it’s additional fundraising or explosive revenue growth. Seems like nobody knows the answer just yet, not even him.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite is a step above its competitors in every respect, including price. This monster $599 headset literally does it all. Simultaneous audio between two USB-C sources, 3.5mm, and Bluetooth, support for literally every gaming platform, premium materials, ANC, 30-hour swappable batteries, a desktop digital audio controller, and superb audio. The only issues amount to minor nitpicks, but you're going to need to really, REALLY want those extra features to justify that sky-high price tag. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite is the best headset I've ever reviewed. Top shelf build quality and comfort Industry-leading device versatility Immaculate, peerless audio Retractable mic with ANC Handy DAC with great features Monster battery life Premium specs means premium price Software is a bit slow and could be improved Materials make it a fingerprint magnet Why you can trust Windows Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test. $599.99. That's how much the latest effort from SteelSeries will set you back. And it's a price tag that's impossible to overlook. This is the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite. It joins other products that share the "Elite" branding, such as the Xbox Elite Controller, targeting users on the high end. Gamers span all sorts of purchasing power capabilities these days, and companies know it. For those with cash to burn, building products that can seemingly do everything while also sporting the most premium materials is a segment manufacturers are increasingly targeting. The Arctis Nova Elite unashamedly joins that market as the best Xbox headset for pure, decadent luxury. As a humble games blogger, I'm not sure there's a universe where I would (or even could) ever pay $599.99 for a headset, practically under any circumstances — but if I could afford it, it would absolutely be for this headset. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite is undeniably the most luxurious gaming headset I have ever used, whose features and quality inarguably justify that sky-high price tag. But you're going to be a very specific type of gamer to want to buy in here. This review was made possible thanks to a review sample provided by SteelSeries. The company had no input nor saw the contents of this review prior to publication. For over a decade, I've been reviewing headsets of all shapes and sizes. I've tried earbuds, budget gaming headsets, and premium cans for enthusiasts. I keep all of the headsets I review for active comparisons, and could probably open my own headset store if this tech blogging lark ever folds. One thing that won't fold is my enthusiasm for recommending YOU the best Xbox and PC headsets for your use cases. As for this headset, I've also been using the previous Arctis Nova as my daily driver. How does this one compare? Read on. You know the price already. It's a beefy boy, but what about the specs to match it? Let's take a look. This is premium from every angle you look. This is a hi-res certified headset, which means it's verified by independent organizations as being able to deliver sound beyond a typical CD. This is 24-bit/96 kHz signals specifically, and to do that, requires a higher grade of engineering and materials. As far as I could tell, this is the first wireless gaming headset to achieve this standard — a level typically reserved for audiophile products and studio-grade gear. Category Arctis Nova Pro Elite Drivers 40mm carbon fiber drivers with brass surrounds Frequency response 10 Hz – 40 kHz (Hi-Res certified) Connectivity Dual USB-C, 2.4 GHz wireless, 3.5mm line-in, Bluetooth Microphone Retractable and beamforming internal retracted modes Battery system Dual hot-swappable batteries (30~ hours x2) Build materials Steel headband, aluminum hinges, premium leatherette cushions Weight ~350 g Compatibility PC, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, Xbox (via DAC), mobile (via Bluetooth) Special features Hi-Res Wireless certification, AI mic noise reduction, EQ software, ANC options, full DAC with multi-platform connectivity, simultaneous audio source mixing Price (RRP) $559.99 USD It's not all about hi-res certification here, though. While premium materials definitely had a role to play here, this headset also boasts some of the most impressive versatility we've ever seen in a gaming headset. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. The Arctis Nova Elite's powerful digital audio controller looks unassuming on your desk, but it boasts monstrous capabilities. It's your platform for hot-swapping and keeping batteries charged up (with each of the 2 included cells offering up to 30 hours of playback). It also lets you mix audio signals from four different sources: two USB-C, one 3.5mm line-in, and one Bluetooth 5.3. This is the first headset that has offered the ability to mix Xbox, PS5, and PC audio simultaneously since SPDIF fell out of fashion as a result — something game streamers using consoles and capture cards might appreciate. Even the packaging is premium here, as SteelSeries guns for the audiophile and enthusiast gamer segment. It's as expensive as some Xbox Series X and PS5 models at $599.99, and it seems to have good stock levels across the board as of writing. Does the Arctis Nova Elite stick the landing? Absolutely yes, in (almost) every regard. And luckily, the parts that could be improved are software in nature and can be updated. Here are more details on the experience. When I opened up the package to this headset, I immediately knew I was about to experience something special. This is by far and away the most expensive headset I have ever reviewed, and its premium presentation will immediately command your attention. The packaging is accented in gold and comes in a sort of monolithic box as if it had descended from another planet. The Arctis Nova Elite sports a familiar design if you've seen the predecessor Arctis Nova Pro (my previous primary driver here), complete with a retractable mic, detachable magnetic side-plates housing USB-C connectivity and the battery bay, as well as a floating headband. What sets it apart is that every aspect of it is dialled up to 11. Various parts of the headset that were plastic in other models are now metal, including the textured volume dial and adjustable hinges on either side. The dials, buttons, and materials all sport a very luxurious feel. Various parts of the headset that were plastic in other models are now metal, including the textured volume dial and adjustable hinges on either side. The leatherette earcups feel incredibly comfortable, and dare I say, dreamy on the skin, easily defeating fabric-clad rivals. The floating headband is also an easy win for long, long periods of use, and retains SteelSeries' tradition for cranial comfort. One weird downside of the floating headband is that it's easy to rock the headset off your head if you get a little too immersed in the music (and immersed you will, the sound delivery on this headset is immense). It's designed for long gaming sessions at the end of the day, but it's worth being aware of. Returning is the retractable boom microphone, which now cleverly has per-configuration settings. When you retract it, you can still use it for calls, and it'll beamform your voice similar to earbuds. When you extend it, it functions as a high-quality mic for comms and potentially even light content creation. I'm not sure I'd record a full YouTube video on this mic over my Elgato XLR, but it's up there with the best gaming headset mics I've used. Indeed, the ability to retract the mic and fall back to Bluetooth 5.3 gives you lifestyle usability here that many other "gaming" headsets don't really offer. The subtle design on the black model means it won't look out of place when used during commutes or on a plane, and there's even an alternative colorway that fits a more Apple-style grey fashion aesthetic, too. The only criticism I'd offer here from a "lifestyle" perspective is that, perhaps, the logos are a bit "loud" for this type of use case. There are after-market sideplates you can buy that look a little more subtle, though, or even louder ones if you prefer. The World of Warcraft Horde ones are out of stock, though (dang.) Also, the soft-touch plastics SteelSeries opted for here tend to be fingerprint magnets too, which isn't a big deal, but on the black model, it can be pretty noticeable. When you're knee deep in corpses in a Battlefield 6 map or rocking to Nirvana while writing a gaming headset review on the internet (meta), you're likely not thinking about the side plates or fingerprints, though. How's the audio? It's fan-expletive-tastic. Let's not beat around the bush here. The Arctis Nova Elite is the most immaculate audio experience I've had in over a decade of gaming headset reviews. I put them directly head-to-head with a family member's studio-grade Beyerdynamic DT 1990 PRO and was quite stunned to find the experience pleasantly comparable. This is a gaming headset, but I've found myself using it primarily for music over the past few weeks. Rediscovering new details in soundscapes I know very well has been incredibly fun with this product, as someone who generally uses earbuds or other random gaming headsets for music typically. No other headset I've used allows for this absurd level of versatility and freedom. There's no distortion, no glitching, no artifacting, no muddiness, no range is overbearing or under-represented — it's simply hard to go back to anything else after using these. ANC helps eliminate background noise on planes, trains, and buses, and easy on-ear controls and a solid mobile app make them a winner for commuters. Indeed, you have multiple ways to connect to this headset, too. As noted, the digital audio controller will sit at your desk and politely allow you to connect up not one, but actually three sound sources, on top of a fourth Bluetooth signal directly into the headset. And yes, you can mix them all simultaneously. No other headset I've used allows for this absurd level of versatility and freedom. The vast majority of users won't need this, but as a game streamer that uses a laptop and an Xbox with a capture card, I've found it incredibly welcome to not need to Bluetooth to my TV to get game audio (but you can still do that if you want?!). The headset is heavily configurable, too. The Steelseries GG software on PC and mobile devices allows you to load up from a huge array of presets for various games, more so than any other headset I've tried. Even obscure games are represented here, which is impressive. The only downside is that you can't really delete any of the presets, nor favorite the ones you prefer. It can be a pain going back and forward between a gaming preset and a music preset, for example — but it's easily fixable. The software on PC in general could use a variety of improvements, as it sometimes hangs and features app downloads and things most people are doubtlessly unlikely to use (why would I need to download Discord from SteelSeries?). But, this is quite honestly my only gripe with the feature set, and thankfully, software is a comparably easy fix over a hardware flaw. This headset has no hardware flaws. The first iteration of the Arctis Nova Pro had a protrusion in the left ear that could get uncomfortable across long sessions, for example, but there's no such issue here. Maximum comfort, with maximum longevity, and superb, immaculate audio. For gaming, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite continues to excel. Games like Battlefield 6 and Overwatch absolutely sing on this device, giving away enemy positions with powerful tactical awareness, all without detracting from the more immersive sound design of the various virtual warzones we inhabit. The amount of tweaking you can do is impressive, too. Pushed to its extremes, the bass can get obnoxiously punchy if you want it to, or leave it thick and creamy, all while retaining maximum clarity and separation. Instruments sound like real instruments on this headset, which might sound like an odd thing to say — but you really feel the physicality of a kick drum or the slide of a bass string in this soundscape. Imagine how that translates to games with high-quality audio design, with explosions and gunfire zipping all around you. It's difficult to compare this to other gaming headsets as a result. The Arctis Nova Elite is just sublime. I wish the apps were a little less bloated and more focused, but it doesn't impact the sound experience. The microphone experience is good, too. As you can hear in the clip above, you're looking at crystal clear comms with the microphone extended, and very good call quality when it's retracted. You can set per-config sidetone too. The sidetone quality isn't the best, but it's more than adequate for game comms. All up, it's hard to find things to gripe about here. I wish the apps were a little less bloated and more focused, but it doesn't impact the sound experience. The number of settings you can alter and control is intuitive to set up and access, even if the software itself can be a bit slow at times. And hey, it can (and will) be updated. This headset is an absolute winner, but ... it's hard to look past that price point. There's pretty much no other headset that competes with the Arctis Nova Elite. On pure audio alone, the Arctis Nova Elite stands out in its own class and is more closely comparable to other hi-res headsets that typically don't fall into the gaming category. The only other headset with this kind of wireless versatility is the Astro A50 (2025), and the Arctis Nova Elite has it utterly beaten on raw audio, comfort, and lifestyle versatility. The Astro A50 is a pure gaming headset, though, and shaves $300 off the asking price to boot. I think, unless you were planning to use this headset everywhere and anywhere as a lifestyle option, you might get more bang for your buck with the similarly versatile Astro A50 ... but you wouldn't get the sound quality, multi-USB source mixing, or hot-swappable batteries. There's simply no real comparison here. The Arctis Nova Elite is well and truly in a category of its own. The Arctis Nova Elite is the ultimate gaming headset. It's the ultimate everything headset, frankly, able to easily accommodate high-end gaming, multi-device mixing for content creation, and day-to-day lifestyle use with ANC and Bluetooth. Its hi-res certification isn't just a sticker; it's immediately recognizable the second you commit a current to this headset. The sound reproduction puts the Arctis Nova Elite thoroughly in a category of its own, with few, if any, comparable peers. But boy howdy, it ain't cheap. You're going to either need to be a true all-day audio enthusiast, particularly fiscally affluent, or (like me) a poor financial planner to justify buying this. In my headset reviews, I tend to put a big emphasis on value for "most" people. Most of us are unlikely to look at a $599.99 headset and ever consider it an option — myself included. But with this, hearing is believing. It's one of the best headsets around. I've used my Arctis Nova Pro as my "daily" headset for several years at this point, and aside from some cushion wear, it's as good as it was the day I got it (and the cushions are easily replaced, too). If you were planning to use this headset for years and years, I think even the more budget-conscious could consider this headset, particularly if you wanted something you could use everywhere and anywhere. At the same time, would you feel comfy taking a $599.99 headset on the subway in that situation? I'm not sure I would. This headset is targeting a very specific type of customer unashamedly, and given what it offers, it's hard to penalize it for its price tag alone. The price makes sense given what's on offer. Whether or not it makes sense for your budget entirely depends on you and your needs. One thing I do know is you absolutely will not be disappointed. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite is a best-in-class headset boasting supreme versatility, comfort, audio, and specs. It also boasts a supreme price tag, shrugging off affordability for maximum features and luxury. You're either going to really want all of its features or have cash to burn to justify this headset, but either way, you won't be disappointed.

Title: Bitcoin 4-Year Cycle is Dead, Here’s Why Bull Run is Not Over

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Bitcoin price has seen a significant pivot from its historic 4-year cycle that is supported by halving events. Science Author, Shanaka Anslem Perera, on X, pointed out that Bitcoin has pivoted from its historic 4-year cycle, which is driven by halving events. As a result of this shift, the coin’s traditional playbook of significant positive momentum has now become obsolete. Still, the crypto enthusiast does not think that Bitcoin’s bull run is over. Historically, Bitcoin’s performance has followed a four-year cycle, largely driven by halving events, which result in a reduction in the block reward. At every point in this cycle, the crypto ecosystem experienced a massive bull run, followed by sharp price corrections. Fast forward to the present day, and there seems to be a notable shift that has now rendered this traditional playbook obsolete. On October 6, 2025, Crypto Twitter declared Bitcoin’s cycle peak at $126,270. Then this was followed by a 21% drop in the coin’s price levels. BITCOIN’S 4-YEAR CYCLE JUST DIED AND NOBODY NOTICED Crypto Twitter exploded calling October 6th the cycle peak. Eighty-four percent crashes incoming. Bear market confirmed. Pack it up. Except the math says they are catastrophically wrong. Every indicator that called previous… pic.twitter.com/b6sj1kGn5e — Shanaka Anslem Perera ⚡ (@shanaka86) November 8, 2025 As a result, several influencers and analysts, armed with historical patterns, predicted an 84% crash and a prolonged bear market. However, Perera believes that there may be a different story to tell. There may still be hope, as he claims that the bull run is far from over. Apparently, key indicators such as the Pi Cycle, MVRV Z-Score, and Puell Multiple, which would usually signal the onset of a bull run, are unusually quiet. According to these metrics, the crypto market is in a mid-cycle consolidation, and not the end of the road. Perera believes that Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) may have played a vital role in redirecting the four-year cycle. Bitcoin ETFs have absorbed a staggering $64 billion, with giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and corporate treasuries acting as a vacuum for every whale dump. The influx of institutional investors into the sector may have rid Bitcoin of certain rollercoasters. On November 4, Coinspeaker reported that Bitcoin ETFs saw outflows of up to $186.5 million, led entirely by BlackRock’s IBIT. Within the last six days leading up to November 7, there were consistent outflows totaling $660 million. Within the last 24 hours, the sector has seen up to $240 million flood back into ETFs. In the wake of this situation, the Bitcoin price has recovered by 2.38% and is currently trading at $101,997.13.

Title: Data-center operator CoreWeave is a stock-market darling. Bears see its finances as emblematic of an AI infrastructure bubble
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/08/coreweave-earnings-debt-ai-infrastructure-bubble/
Time Published: 2025-11-08T13:00:00Z
Full Content:
Jeremy Kahn is the AI editor at Fortune, spearheading the publication's coverage of artificial intelligence. He also co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. Leo Schwartz is a senior writer at Fortune covering fintech, crypto, venture capital, and financial regulation. A vast data center in Plano, Texas, is a symbol of the enormous AI infrastructure boom that has boosted stock markets and driven U.S. economic growth over the past year. The data center occupies more than 450,000 square feet and cost $1.6 billion to construct and equip. It supplies 30 megawatts of computing power to train and run AI models. Yet the company that runs it is a leading candidate to be ground-zero for a future AI financial meltdown. The data center is one of dozens around the world operated by CoreWeave, a company that develops and manages data centers and sells their computing capacity to technology companies. Its business is at the center of the AI economy—providing computing power to meet the voracious demand of the likes of Microsoft and OpenAI. But CoreWeave doesn’t own the Plano facility, nor does it own most of the data hubs it’s operating. And that is a part of the problem. The company is built, by its own admission, on a mountain of debt—obligations it has piled up as it races to build out a network of server farms for its customers. And that mountain looms far larger than the piles of cash that CoreWeave has brought in the door so far. When the company announces earnings on Monday, bulls and bears alike will be watching to see how its revenue is growing, and whether it has been able to pare its losses. CoreWeave’s earnings are likely to be a bellwether for the state of the entire AI boom, and for the industry’s massive and expensive infrastructure buildout in particular. CoreWeave has $7.6 billion in current liabilities—bills that fall due within 12 months—on its balance sheet, and $11 billion in debt overall, according to its most recent quarterly earnings report, filed in August. Coming from a tech giant like Google or Microsoft with tens of billions in free cash flow, such numbers wouldn’t raise an eyebrow. But CoreWeave’s revenues were only $1.9 billion in 2024. On its Q2 earnings call, CEO Michael Intrator told analysts that full year 2025 revenue would land between $5.15 billion to $5.35 billion. On the same call, the CEO said he expected CoreWeave’s capex for the year would total between $20 billion and $23 billion. Those short-term figures pale beside a bigger and potentially more onerous obligation that isn’t on its balance sheet: the $34 billion in scheduled lease payments that will start kicking in between now and 2028. Many of those payments are stretched over relatively long terms, of 10 years or more. Still, some of this is for data centers and office buildings that have not yet begun to operate or bring in revenue—representing a vulnerability if any of the as-yet-unprofitable startups CoreWeave sells computing services to are unable to meet their contractual obligations, or if construction delays mean CoreWeave is not able to provide capacity on time, allowing customers to cancel contracts. In a sense, Coreweave is a metaphor for the broader AI industry at the present moment, as top companies commit to enormous capex spending today in the confidence that it’ll be justified by future revenue from AI platforms and services. Investors appear to be broadly convinced by the company’s narrative: CoreWeave’s stock price is up 160% since the company’s IPO in March. But Fortune’s analysis of CoreWeave’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are laced with warnings and caveats, show how risky the company’s business model could be. In interviews with several analysts, bulls and bears agreed that CoreWeave’s fundamentals, as reflected in its filings, don’t currently add up. “A lot has to go right,” says Thomas Blakey, a managing director of software equity research at Cantor Fitzgerald, who rates CoreWeave “overweight.” (Of 26 equity analysts who currently cover the stock, 14 had the equivalent of buy or outperform ratings on the shares, while nine had “hold” ratings, and three had “underperform” or “sell” recommendations, according to data from S&P Market Intelligence.) The bears see CoreWeave as a strong candidate to find itself underwater with its mounting liabilities, making it potentially the first domino to fall in the AI ecosystem. “To say they’ll scale out of this is questionable,” says Gil Luria, the head of technology research at the investment firm D.A. Davidson. “I don’t see how it becomes more profitable.” He believes that the likeliest outcome for CoreWeave on a five-year time horizon is bankruptcy—either because its current customers will be able to rely on their own infrastructure by then, or because an increasingly stretched CoreWeave will no longer be able to borrow. In a statement to Fortune, a company spokesperson said that “CoreWeave’s capital structure and financial performance are strong and underpinned by long-term take-or-pay contracts signed with the world’s leading enterprises and AI labs who partner with CoreWeave because we deliver the best AI cloud.” The statement went on to say that the company structured its contracts to “support and repay any related debt obligations while generating additional free cash flow. CoreWeave operates in a supply-constrained market where demand far exceeds capacity, and our hyper-growth is evidence of the trust leading companies place in us to power their most critical AI workloads.” With the company continuing to make huge new spending commitments even as it books new future revenue, AI investors’ attention will be glued to its upcoming quarterly earnings report. One number that everyone will be watching is CoreWeave’s “remaining performance obligations,” or RPOs—essentially revenues that CoreWeave has booked but that have not yet been paid. (Like its scheduled lease payments, CoreWeave’s RPOs are excluded from its balance sheet.) If CoreWeave is booking the kinds of contracts that will pull it out of debt sooner rather than later, the RPOs level—and the forecast for how quickly those future bookings are likely to turn into actual cash—are where they would show up. The company has announced several major new deals since its last quarterly earnings announcement, including a $14.2 billion agreement to supply Meta with computing capacity, and an pact with AI startup Poolside for a data center stuffed with 40,000 Nvidia GPUs. So it is likely its RPO total will climb significantly. Wall Street analysts’ forecasts for the company’s 2026 revenue range from $10.9 billion to $14.9 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.Bulls argue that this is exactly how the boom will play out in CoreWeave’s favor: The revenue will come through, in great quantity, and its scale will solve the company’s problems by catching up with and then outpacing its capital expenditures. In that scenario, the company becomes the next Levi Strauss or Amazon Web Services, providing the “picks and shovels” of the AI boom, and getting filthy rich. “The potential is beyond the scope of our imagination at this point,” says Kevin Dede, a senior technology analyst at the financial services firm H.C. Wainwright, which rates CoreWeave a “buy.” But for now CoreWeave is miles away from being profitable and is bleeding cash, absent its ability to issue debt. The RPOs it reported in its most recent earnings that are likely to be realized in the next 12 months are not, on their own, sufficient to cover its current obligations and announced growth plans (more on that shortly). The company has razor-thin operating margins—1.6% in the past quarter. After accounting for its large interest expenses, those margins turn sharply negative. The company lost more than $600 million on $2.2 billion in revenue in the first six months of 2025. “That’s not great,” Luria says. “Is there any way that gap closes?”Barring an enormous surge in revenue over the next 12 months or so, the company will likely need to borrow more money, or renegotiate with creditors, in order to cover the obligations already on its books. To be sure, the AI boom could deliver that revenue surge—but even slight weakening in spending growth across the industry could hit CoreWeave disproportionately. Kerrisdale Capital, an investment management firm that is shorting the stock, is pithy in its conclusions: CoreWeave, it wrote in a September report, is “the poster child of the AI infrastructure bubble.” CoreWeave began as a crypto-mining company, a side project of a few friends who were hedge-fund traders. Crypto mining, like AI, relies heavily on graphic processing units, or GPUs, with the chips racing to solve complicated algorithms that spit out currency rewards for correctly verifying blockchain transactions, and CoreWeave was a steady buyer. Over time, Brian Venturo, one of the company’s founders, realized that the rise in AI would be a major factor fueling the surge in demand for the computing power of the GPUs that CoreWeave was already accumulating. Beginning in October 2021, CoreWeave entered into two deals with asset management firm Magnetar Capital, raising first $50 million in convertible notes, and then a year later, an additional $125 million, also in convertible notes. The company used nearly all of it to buy GPUs from Nvidia. Over the next few years, CoreWeave would secure billions of dollars in a combination of debt and equity, building out a sprawling array of data centers across the U.S., and eventually expanding to the U.K. This March, CoreWeave’s IPO made it one of the closest things to a pure-play AI company to debut on public markets. Initially, fears about the company’s debt load restrained its stock’s performance. But its shares took off in May after it reported its first quarterly earnings, including soaring revenue growth of 420% quarter-on-quarter. While the price has declined since a peak in June, CoreWeave shares closed on Friday at $104, up from a debut of $40. But as Luria puts it, the bear case for CoreWeave is simple math. The company’s business model is to borrow capital and then use that capital to build data centers filled with GPUs and then sell time on those GPUs to AI companies. “The question is, are they getting a sufficient return … on their investment to justify the interest they’re paying on their debt?” Luria says. Its most recent filings show how hefty that debt has become. The problem isn’t just the amount of CoreWeave’s debt. It’s the structure—most of it is more expensive than average for corporate debt, and much of it comes due in the next nine months. Of CoreWeave’s current liabilities, $3.6 billion is debt payable by June 30, 2026, just part of $11 billion in overall debt the company carries on its balance sheet. Much of that debt carries hefty interest rates of between 9% and 15%, according to the financial statements, with 11% being the weighted average rate overall. (This fall, rates on newly issued investment-grade corporate debt have hovered between 5.5% and 6%, according to Moody’s. The rate at which CoreWeave is able to borrow has come down over time, with most of its newer debt issued at closer to 9%. ) The majority of CoreWeave’s outstanding debt, its statements show, is in the form of two loans, called Delayed Draw Term Loan (DDTL)1.0 and DDTL 2.0. There is $1.8 billion outstanding on the DDTL 1.0, at a 15% interest rate, and $5 billion in DDTL 2.0, at an 11% interest rate. The company has begun payment on DDTL 1.0; quarterly principal payments on DDTL 2.0 are due beginning in January 2026. (The interest rates on both these loans are floating.) This is where the company’s RPOs come in. CoreWeave says that as of June 30 it had a little over $30 billion, the majority of which should turn into actual sales over the next four years. The company says 50% of that amount, or $15 billion, will be recognized in the next two years. Wall Street consensus forecasts are that the company’s revenues will be about $12 billion for next year. But if its operating margins remain at just 1.6%, the company will only generate $192 million in income from this revenue—not enough to cover its interest expenses or make the principal repayments on its debt. That implies that CoreWeave’s returns remain far below the cost of its capital. Higher RPOs, of course, would mean more revenue for CoreWeave next year. That said, there are also far more capital expenses to come. CoreWeave continues to spend heavily to purchase Nvidia GPUs—which make up the great majority of its capital expenditures—and other equipment to outfit its data centers. In the first half of 2025, for example, it invested $4.7 billion in property, plant and equipment while bringing in only $2.2 billion in revenue. The report from Kerrisdale cites similar concerns as Luria in justifying its short position. CoreWeave is “a debt-fueled GPU rental business with no moat, dressed up as innovation,” the firm writes, arguing that the stock faces a 90% downside. Luria and Kerrisdale both cite CoreWeave’s highly concentrated customer base as another potential peril—a reality that CoreWeave itself acknowledged in its last earnings report. “A substantial portion of our revenue is driven by a limited number of our customers, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in, spend from one or a few of our top customers would adversely affect our business,” the company wrote. Most notably: In the second quarter of 2025, an eye-popping 71% of CoreWeave’s revenue came from Microsoft alone. To be sure, Microsoft has a better credit rating than many countries, including the United States, and is unlikely to renege on its contract with CoreWeave. And CoreWeave’s contracts with its lessees generally require them to pay to the ends of their leases even if they don’t wind up utilizing them, except in case of “nonperformance.” Much of CoreWeave’s utility has come from offering readily available compute as those companies raced to scale up their own operations. But with Microsoft set to spend tens of billions of dollars on developing its own data centers, it may not need CoreWeave’s services in the future. “They will pay their obligations, but the likelihood of them renewing at the end of the contract is much less guaranteed,” Luria says. CoreWeave’s other major customer, OpenAI, is another matter. In March, CoreWeave entered an agreement with Sam Altman’s AI giant, with OpenAI committed to paying $11.9 billion through October 2030, with a $4 billion expansion announced in May. But OpenAI itself has made commitments far beyond its current cash flow—including commitments in the many hundreds of billions to Oracle, Nvidia and other data center providers. If OpenAI runs into any financial troubles, Luria says, CoreWeave likely wouldn’t be first to receive payments, compared to much larger OpenAI partners like Microsoft, Amazon, or even Oracle. (That’s also the case for some of the other, smaller venture-backed and loss-making AI startups CoreWeave serves, such as poolside, Cohere, and Mistral.) To rely on CoreWeave’s ties to OpenAI, he says, “You have to believe that OpenAI is going to be unbelievably successful, so much so that it can pay everybody that’s ahead in line.” All of this means there’ll be plenty at stake when CoreWeave reports earnings on Monday. The company will also be digesting a recent setback: In late October, the shareholders of Core Scientific, a crypto miner with a hoard of computing resources that CoreWeave coveted, rejected CoreWeave’s $9 billion all-stock acquisition offer. (CoreWeave will console itself with a $270 million breakup fee—an amount that will help it cover the $360 million it is expected to pay Core Scientific to lease data center capacity from it next year. Overall, CoreWeave is on the hook to pay Core Scientific some $10 billion in future lease payments over the next 12 years, which may have been one reason CoreWeave was eager to try to use its highly-valued shares to purchase Core Scientific in an all-equity deal valued at $9 billion when the offer was initially made.) The argument for CoreWeave’s success is just as simple as the math against it: AI is going to represent a transformational shift in the global economy, and CoreWeave is powering the technology’s growth. As the development of AI accelerates, so will the demand for computing power from companies aside from the hyperscalers, all hungry for the services of providers like CoreWeave. What’s more, today’s creditors may be willing to wait a little longer for that demand to materialize: The lenders behind DDTL 2.0 recently renegotiated the terms of the loan to delay the start of principal payments. Blakey, at Cantor Fitzgerald, says that CoreWeave is already diversifying its customer base, noting the recent deal with Meta. “It’s a growth business,” he says, in reference to CoreWeave’s capital expenditures. “If business is growing, you have to invest against it.” He and other bulls see a future where the company is no longer laden with debt. Once CoreWeave sheds its liabilities over the next five years, Blakey says, a growing percent of its revenue can begin coming from infrastructure that’s already paid off, boosting CoreWeave’s margins. Moreover, Blakey says that new models of chips might run more efficiently or be able to fetch a higher premium from customers, allowing CoreWeave to hold more pricing power. Blakey says that those $30.1 billion in RPOs—the revenue that has been booked but not yet delivered—are likely to increase meaningfully in CoreWeave’s next earnings, based on recently announced agreements. But the number to watch might be the additional obligations in borrowing that the company will take on to service them: If those obligations scale up alongside the booked revenue, bears say, CoreWeave still risks running out of cash unless it takes on yet more debt, raises more equity, or gets existing creditors to extend terms. Blakey acknowledges that a sustainable path forward for CoreWeave is perilous. “A lot has to go right,” he says. Still, he compares the current moment in AI to the beginning of the smartphone era, where analysts doubted Apple’s claims that it would transform global communication. “CoreWeave is a leader there in terms of this market,” Blakely says. “If they can maintain that lead … they will be able to participate in the spoils.” CORRECTIONS: An earlier version of this story stated incorrectly that Coreweave’s quarterly principal payments for DDTL 1.0 would begin in January 2026; those payments have already begun. The original version also misspelled the surname of Thomas Blakey. This article was updated to add a range of analysts’ projections for CoreWeave’s 2026 revenue. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: It’s not a bubble, because AI is already running the markets

AI isn’t a bubble. It’s already reshaping markets. Autonomous AI agents now drive trading, outperforming humans and rewriting how money moves. Opinion by: Saad Naja, Founder and CEO at PiP World While the world debates whether AI is the next dot-com bubble, chasing valuations rather than implications, they’re missing the underlying innovation story. The same AI infrastructure fueling trillion-dollar bets is already rewriting how money moves. AI is no longer an investment theme. It’s the market itself. What few noticed is that the same AI infrastructure driving the headlines is already reshaping the markets from within. The invisible battle happening behind the candlesticks isn’t bulls and bears anymore; it’s between self-learning AIs that never sleep. Markets aren’t just humans using algorithms. They’re autonomous swarms fighting for milliseconds. Agents watch every market 24/7, spotting risks, debating strategies and executing without hesitation. Recent breakthroughs in AI and blockchain acceptance have created the perfect conditions for agentic markets to flourish. AI provides cognition; meanwhile, blockchain supplies trust, verification and payment rails. This offers the medium for AI agents to transact, prove, and exchange value freely. AI has crossed the chasm from stock picker to near-autonomous day trader. It learns and acts faster than any human. It spots what humans miss, predicts the move before it happens and never second-guesses itself. It’s the ultimate insider, without inflaming the SEC. It’s early days for agentic AI in trading, but make no mistake — it’s here and already moving the markets while most traders sleep. During the biggest crypto flash crash on Oct. 10, while the rest of the crypto market was in freefall, AI agents did the opposite. They stayed calm, shorted the chaos, and ended the week up 40%. They gave us a glimpse into the future of markets. One where the AI agents don’t just follow code, they respond like real traders. Some cut risk instantly. Others waited for confirmation. A few leaned into the drawdown. What’s striking is not just the gains, it’s the composure. Each AI agent made its own independent decisions, yet collectively, they converged on profitable outcomes. That’s the essence of agentic intelligence, autonomous systems learning to interpret chaos as opportunity. Companies describe similar behavior within trading desks, where agentic systems parse live data from public disclosures and feed execution layers in real-time. Over time, agents evolve from code to cognition. Autonomous systems that read markets, understand intent and execute strategies on their own. Acting like a digital hive mind, adjusting logic mid-session as markets shift around them. For years, quant funds and high-frequency traders have pitted humans plus algorithms against the market. Enter AI versus AI. Self-directed systems plan, reason and execute around the clock. What’s emerging is a battlefield of AIs — institutional, retail, and synthetic — talking to each other in real-time. When AI trades with AI, human intent disappears. Prices move on machine-to-machine negotiations, not emotion or fundamentals. The market begins to trade itself. Related: AI gives retail investors a way out of the diversification trap A majority of global trading volume now runs through algorithmic systems, estimates ranging from 60% to 89%, depending on the market. Within months, Symphony’s agentic trading layer was clearing $140 million in transactions, working with 15 of the world’s biggest financial institutions to test self-learning yield and execution agents. For decades, investing was about finding an edge. AI gives retail investors that power for the first time. Retail traders can soon deploy the same logic once reserved for billion-dollar funds. Swarm intelligence that scans arbitrage, simulates momentum, hedges risk and executes collaboratively. It’s the retail equivalent of a hedge fund in your pocket. The walls between institutional and retail finance are eroding. AI makes the 1%’s playbook accessible to the 99%. The next outperformers will deploy agentic swarms, rather than tracking indexes. AI versus AI warfare will define liquidity, volatility and price discovery. Humans will still set direction, risk tolerance and capital allocation, but won’t press the buttons. Markets will begin to self-trade in swarms of autonomous participants. Power will shift to whomever fine-tunes the feedback loops. When agents detect each other’s footprints, they’ll evolve meta-strategies, sometimes to cooperate, sometimes to manipulate one another. Trading floors are going quiet. The next generation of traders won’t shout orders; they’ll train AI agents. The winners won’t just be institutions, they’ll be retail traders who fine-tune their swarms alongside human judgment. We’re entering the agentic arms race. Markets of tomorrow won’t sleep or panic. Agentic AI will learn, evolve, compete and occasionally conspire at breakneck speed. While institutions continue to build layers of agents, retail investors face a choice. Follow the herd into AI stocks, or start training their own AI as their wing(wo)man. They won’t have an AlphaGo moment. Quiet, relentless outperformance hides in the charts, open to anyone brave enough to seize their AI agent. Opinion by: Saad Naja, Founder and CEO at PiP World.

Title: ‘Sell Your House, Clothes And Buy XRP’ — Solana Exec’s Wild Advice Goes Viral

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Solana Foundation manager Vibhu Norby jumped into a heated XRP discussion on X, adding a sharp dose of humor to an already intense online conversation. The debate began when Tradeship University founder Cameron Scrubs urged followers to sell all their other crypto assets and buy XRP. Scrubs, known for extreme XRP optimism, previously predicted that XRP would surpass Bitcoin and Ethereum within five years. He reignited that vision this week, telling investors to sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, ZCash, and Dogecoin — essentially, “sell everything” — and move into XRP. The statement quickly went viral, drawing reactions from multiple crypto communities. X user Caspian responded, saying it wasn’t meant literally. He added that the point was to align belief with action — if investors truly see value in XRP, they should act with conviction. “Own your stack, protect it, and stay ready,” he wrote. Sell your house. Sell your bed. Sell your kids. Sell your cardboard box. Sell your clothes. Buy XRP. — vibhu (@vibhu) November 7, 2025 Vibhu Norby joined the thread with satire. He joked, “Sell your house, bed, kids, cardboard box, clothes, and buy XRP,” making it clear he was mocking the hype rather than endorsing it. Another user, Slorg, claimed he had already gone all in and asked what step to take next. Norby replied that the next move was to wait for major firms like BlackRock and Mastercard to tokenize trillions in assets, potentially sending XRP to $1,000. Despite the humor, the exchange highlighted the community’s real optimism about institutional involvement and the possibility of massive price growth. Ripple added fuel to the discussion by announcing a $500 million funding round at its Swell 2025 event. Investors included Galaxy Digital, Fortress, Brevan Howard, and Pantera Capital. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the investment confirmed faith in a business “built on the foundation of XRP.” Reports also showed Ripple partnered with Mastercard to use RLUSD on XRPL for fiat settlement, while Ripple Prime is integrating XRP for institutional transfers. These developments gave long-term holders more reason to stay confident in XRP. Holding XRP is the hardest part because conviction gets tested in every wave of volatility. But when you understand the fundamentals, the liquidity infrastructure @Ripple is building and how $XRP underpins the next phase of global settlement, patience becomes your leverage. — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) November 5, 2025 Meanwhile, Versan Aljarrah, the founder of Black Swan Capitalist, acknowledges that it is a constant emotional struggle holding XRP. He explains how investor patience is tested in every market cycle, and the challenge of remaining dedicated to your investment when the price moves materially can be one of the hardest things to do as an XRP holder. Engineer Vincent Van Code responded, saying that it requires “serious conviction – or mental illness” to not sell when the price moves. It comes as no surprise that the mixture of irony, crazy predictions and institutional news keeps XRP relevant. For some of them, the “sell your house” comments are simply an exaggeration, but it showcases the passion and belief of the XRP community, which has planned and endorsed their position, and has continued to show the strength of their will no matter how volatile XRP price action has remained.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: JPMorgan doubles down on Bitcoin with $343M BTC bet – Details

Here’s why institutions are suddenly racing to get in. JPMorgan now holds 5.28 million shares of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, a 64% increase from last quarter. It reflects rising institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a core asset in global investment portfolios. JPMorgan is significantly ramping up its exposure to Bitcoin [BTC], highlighting a surge in institutional confidence toward the leading cryptocurrency. According to the bank’s latest 13F regulatory filing, its brokerage clients now hold 5.28 million shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), valued at approximately $343 million as of the 30th of September. This represents a 64% increase from the previous quarter’s 3.21 million shares. The report further reveals that JPMorgan’s exposure spans multiple divisions, including those managing high-net-worth and institutional portfolios. This broad participation reflects a strategic shift within the bank and its clients, who are seeking regulated, low-risk entry points into Bitcoin amid ongoing market fluctuations. The timing and scale of the investment signal that Wall Street’s largest players are no longer sitting on the sidelines. Instead, they are positioning themselves ahead of what they perceive as the next major leg in Bitcoin’s institutional adoption. Yet, while JPMorgan’s crypto exposure deepens, not all corporate holders are faring well. Firms like Metaplanet, a known Bitcoin accumulator, are now facing steep paper losses, holding 30823 BTC at an average purchase price of $108,036, with losses of 5.37% as per Bitcointreasuries.net data. Still, the broader institutional landscape shows resilience rather than retreat. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), for instance, continued its steady Bitcoin accumulation, recently adding 397 BTC to its reserves. This happened at a time when Bitcoin was trading around $102,260, at press time, showing modest gains, while BlackRock’s IBIT recorded $131.4 million in outflows, according to Farside Investors. Despite this, Bitcoin’s dominance stood firm at 59.84%, meaning it now represents nearly 60% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Meanwhile, in traditional markets, JPMorgan’s stock rose 0.25% to $314.21, and BlackRock climbed 1.19% to $1,082.20, according to Google Finance. These slight upticks mirror the cautious optimism in financial circles, where institutions like JPMorgan are positioning themselves to capitalize on Bitcoin’s next potential leg upward. That being said, BlackRock’s exposure is not just limited to Wall Street. In fact, the upcoming launch of iShares Bitcoin ETF on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) by mid-November 2025 marks another strategic step in its global digital asset expansion. Therefore, with Australia emerging as one of the key frontiers for Bitcoin ETFs and institutional inflows surging, BlackRock’s move signals growing confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a core asset within global portfolios.

Title: Bitcoin mining news: Cipher lands $5.5B AWS lease, IREN inks $9.7B Microsoft deal, and public bitcoin miner Q3 earnings

It was a blockbuster week for bitcoin mining news, and the clearest sign yet that miners’ AI ambitions are entering the big leagues. Cipher Mining (NASDAQ: CIFR) inked a $5.5 billion, 15-year lease with Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ: AMZN) for 300 megawatts at its Bear Lake facility, while IREN (NASDAQ: IREN) announced a $9.7 billion, five-year agreement with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) for 200 megawatts of cloud compute in Texas. Hashprice tumbled to fresh lows near $40 per petahash per day, Bitcoin retraced to $101,000, and Cipher also unveiled plans for a one-gigawatt data center joint venture. And in the background, Warren Buffett’s Pacific Power failed to deliver power to Amazon, a development that could funnel even more demand toward Bitcoin miners with spare megawatts. You’re reading a recap of The Mining Pod. Watch the full episode on YouTube. Cipher announced a 15-year, $5.5 billion lease agreement with Amazon Web Services to host AI workloads at its 300-megawatt Bear Lake facility. The site is scheduled to come online in July 2026, marking AWS’s latest move to secure long-term compute capacity amid surging AI demand. The partnership makes Cipher one of the first public Bitcoin miners to land a hyperscaler as a direct tenant. Cipher also revealed plans for a new one-gigawatt data center project dubbed “Colchis,” in which the company will retain a 95% ownership stake. Despite the historic announcement, Cipher’s stock slid more than 10% Friday, caught in a broader tech-sector sell-off. The company’s $5.5 billion deal value dwarfs its own $8 billion market cap, underscoring investor enthusiasm for miners with AI exposure. Concurrent with Cipher’s own deal, IREN signed a five-year, $9.7 billion cloud compute agreement with Microsoft to deliver 200 megawatts of critical IT load at its Childress, Texas site. The company will also collaborate with Dell in a separate $5.8 billion procurement deal to supply servers, cables, and supporting hardware for its new liquid-cooled data centers “Horizon 1” and “Horizon 4.” The twin announcements represent one of the largest combined partnerships between a Bitcoin miner and major tech firms to date. Like Cipher, IREN’s shares fell roughly 10% on the day, but analysts called the Microsoft deal a “watershed moment” for miners pivoting toward AI and HPC infrastructure. The agreement validates the “powershell” model miners are pursuing: providing power and physical infrastructure for AI tenants while leaving GPU cluster management to specialized partners. Still, open questions remain over IREN’s own GPU strategy and its 20,000-unit Neo Cloud cluster, which could serve as a proving ground for independent AI compute capabilities. Beyond the AI headlines, traditional mining economics continued to worsen. Hashprice fell to around $40 per petahash per day, levels not seen since the spring downturn following President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements. Bitcoin’s price has pulled back from highs near $126,000 to roughly $101,000, with network difficulty up more than 6% in the most recent adjustment. “The streets are bleeding,” Mining Pod analyst Matt Kimmel said. “Hash rice is flatlining, fees are dry, and the only excitement left in mining is AI.” The bleak trend underscores the widening gap between miners chasing compute diversification and those still dependent on Bitcoin block rewards. Q3 results from leading miners offered a snapshot of an industry in transition: With AI contracts now dictating sentiment, shares of several miners appear to be pricing in future deal flow rather than immediate mining economics. In a twist tying Warren Buffett to the week’s biggest AI news, Amazon reportedly filed a complaint against Berkshire Hathaway–owned Pacific Power for failing to deliver sufficient electricity to new data centers in Oregon. The shortfall, according to Bloomberg, has forced AWS to seek alternative partners, a potential win for miners like Cipher that already control scalable, low-cost energy infrastructure. The incident follows lawsuits against Pacific Power related to wildfire liabilities, adding pressure on the utility as hyperscalers scramble for new capacity. To close the week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang warned that China could overtake the U.S. in the AI arms race, citing cheaper power, looser regulations, and government-backed industrial policy. Speaking at the Financial Times’ Future of AI Summit, Huang said Western “cynicism” and fragmented state-level rules risked slowing U.S. innovation. If China continues expanding its power grid and chip manufacturing base, he said, “they will come.” For miners, that comment hit close to home. As U.S. firms repurpose Bitcoin data centers for AI, the global race for compute, and the energy to fuel it, is accelerating on all fronts. Bitcoin’s first industry publication.

Title: Ethereum Price Surge To $5,500: What To Watch Out For To Mark The Bottom

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Coming out of weeks of downtrend, the Ethereum price could be looking to establish the next bottom as it sets up for a campaign toward new all-time highs. This is highlighted by crypto analyst MMBTtrader, who explained that the Ethereum price crash could be coming to an end. This is evidenced by a number of formations on the Ethereum price chart that suggest where the next lift-off might begin. In an analysis shared on the TradingView website, the crypto analyst explained that the Ethereum price is now testing the next crucial technical level. The importance of this level comes with a 50% retracement of the Fibonacci sequence. Thus, it means that the Ethereum price is seeing major support at this level. This support lies just above the $3,200 level, which the Ethereum price had managed to maintain through the market crash. This puts the critical level at the 0.5 Fibonacci support, which currently serves as the next make-or-break level for the cryptocurrency. If the Ethereum price is able to bounce off from here, then it could trigger the next wave of recoveries for the cryptocurrency. Not only that, it would be the signal that the bottom is finally in and the crash is over. The analyst further explains that this could lead to “a high-probability setup for a resumption of the primary bullish trend.” Such a breakout would lead to a rather strong bullish move for the digital asset, and the target from here would be a brand new all-time high. The first target from here would be $5,500 as bulls push the price higher. “This target is derived from the magnitude of the prior uptrend and represents a key resistance zone on the higher timeframes,” the analyst explained. The 0.5 Fibonacci level, as explained above, is a make-or-break level. This means that whichever direction the Ethereum price takes after hitting this level could determine where the cryptocurrency is headed next. With the bullish side already explored, there is still the possibility that Ethereum fails to establish support and a bottom. In the event of the Ethereum price actually breaking below this crucial level, then it would confirm the bearish pressure that has plagued the market. The analyst highlights on the chart that if the support breaks, then Ethereum could dump further below $3,000, with the major support lying just above $2,400. Such a decline would mean an over 30% crash for Ethereum, on top of the already struggling price. Therefore, it is imperative that bulls hold above $3,200 to prevent further decline.

Title: Bubble Trouble: Is too much being spent on AI?
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/1108/1542794-ai-bubble-tech/
Time Published: 2025-11-08T07:00:00Z
Full Content:
Adam Maguire Business Journalist Michael Burry - the man who famously spotted the US subprime mortgage crisis years before most others - thinks there's an AI bubble. This week it was revealed that he had taken a $1.1 billion bet against chip-maker Nvidia and Peter Thiel’s Palantir – where he will profit if their stock prices fall. But it’s not just professional market sceptics like Burry that think things may be overheated in tech. Jamie Dimon, the head of JP Morgan, recently warned that US stocks – in particular tech stocks - are over-heated. Morgan Stanley chief executive Ted Pick and Goldman Sachs head David Soloman have also warned of an impending correction. Even big tech cheerleaders like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos have said there is an AI bubble. Meanwhile Sam Altman, the head of AI revolution icon OpenAI, thinks valuations and spending has gotten carried away. Why do they think this is a bubble? You can get some clue of why if you look at the quarterly results some of the world’s big tech companies published last week. Microsoft, for example, said it spent nearly $35 billion on capital expenditure in the quarter. Capital expenditure wouldn’t necessarily all be AI-related but in this case the vast bulk of it is. To put that figure into context, Ireland’s Budget 2026 was worth around €9.4 billion - or roughly $10.8 billion. So Microsoft spent more than three times Ireland’s annual budget in a single quarter. Meanwhile Facebook owner Meta said it would spend as much as $72 billion on capital expenditure this year. Google owner Alphabet said it would spend up to $93 billion. Amazon said its full year capital budget would be $125 billion this year – and even higher next year. And that’s just four of the big tech companies - it wouldn’t include AI spending by other large firms like Apple, Tesla, X, Oracle or Palantir. Nor would it include the tens hundreds of millions - or even billions - being spent by other big-but-not-massive companies. Or the money being invested by venture capitalists and private equity. And most of that money is ultimately going towards building data centres and buying high end computer chips - but it’s also being spent at employee level too. Back in June Sam Altman claimed that Meta was offering his top engineers pay packets valued at $300m if they moved over to Team Zuckerberg. That included a $100m signing-on bonus. The likes of Meta have also spent billions to buy stakes in, or acquire outright, AI startups that have promising-looking ideas. The scale of all of this is so significant that Goldman Sachs estimated that AI investment was a bigger contributor to growth in the US economy in the first half of the year than consumer spending. In fact, if you took out the money being spent on AI, the US economy was stagnant in the first half of the year. And tech companies’ valuations have risen to match – largely based on the promise and expectation that all this spending now will result in them making even more money in the not-too-distant future. Are there any signs of that happening? No - An MIT study in August found that, when you strip away all the hype, 95% of firms were getting zero return on their AI investments. It’s not entirely true to say that no-one is making money from AI… some are. Or, more specifically, one company is. So far the only clear winner from the AI race is Nvidia, which designs the computer chips that are powering all of these data centres that big tech firms are rushing to build. It’s gone from being a relatively niche player in the market to being the most valuable listed company in the world. As recently as its 2020 results, Nvidia had profits of $2.8 billion – which isn’t bad by any measure. But now, in the single quarter between May and July, it had a profit of $26.4 billion. It is now comfortably on track to make more than $100 billion in profit this year – which would be about 36 times the profit it made just a few years ago. For most others, though, it’s a different story. Despite their huge investments to date the likes of Meta, Alphabet and Microsoft have yet to really show the benefit AI has brought to their bottom line. Some are pointing to it being a cost-saving measure – Amazon’s recent jobs cuts, for example, were framed as them leaning on AI to be able to reduce bureaucracy. But if that’s the rationale it will take many more cuts to justify the hundreds of billions of investment. And it’s not just the big tech companies that are struggling to make it viable – the dedicated AI creators are not seeing a return yet either. Anthropic made a $5.3 billion loss last year. Elon Musk’s xAI is predicted to record a $13 billion loss this year. Even the poster-child of AI – OpenAI – made a $5 billion loss last year. That means that every time you ask ChatGPT to compose an email for you, or ask it to devise the best scrambled eggs recipe, it’s costing them money. Despite that, there are suggestions it could be valued at $1 trillion when it floats on the New York Stock Exchange in the not-too-distant future. So if it’s not making money, what’s the justification for that valuation? OpenAI and its backers hope it is following the same kind of playbook we’ve seen from so many tech start-ups over the years. This is where it has a great idea, great technology and great people – and once it builds a big enough customer base and gains efficiencies of scale, the profits will start to flow. And, in fairness, its revenue looks to have more than doubled year on year – and it recently started to unveil a range of products and services it plans to provide – including a web-browser, which will open the door to it service ads too. In the meantime, though, they’ve also committed to invest around $1.4 trillion in other companies over the next few years – which will include buying computer chips and data centre capacity to help handle the queries from all of those extra customers. But within those deals it’s making is also an interesting dynamic that has added to concerns about an AI bubble – and that’s how a lot of the investment that’s taking place seem to be almost circular. For example, one big part of OpenAI’s recent investments was a $300 billion deal with Oracle to tap into its data centre capacity. In turn, Oracle has committed to spend tens of billions of dollars to buy Nvidia chips to power its data centres. Meanwhile, Nvidia has invested $100 billion of its money into OpenAI. Which essentially means that the three companies are passing billions of dollars around in a circle. So if this is a bubble, what happens when it bursts? Well the first thing there is the 'when’ of the when. Just because there’s a growing consensus that there is a bubble, doesn’t mean that it’s ready to pop. Going back to Michael Burry – he made his first bet against the subprime mortgage market in mid-2005; it took pretty much two years for that bet to pay off. And as readers (or viewers) of The Big Short may remember, he received a lot of flak during those two years from investors who thought he was costing them a fortune. It should also be said that, while he was right that time, he can be wrong too. He took bets out against big tech stocks in 2023 too, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq has risen by nearly 80% since then. But assuming it is a matter of ‘when’ and not ‘if’, there are a whole range of predictions around what a burst AI bubble might mean. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has kind of downplayed his company’s exposure - saying that spending all of this money on data centres now was essentially just front-loading what they’ll need in the years ahead. So, he argues, worst case scenario it’ll just mean they’ll be futureproofed against a natural growth of demand for its services in the years ahead. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos suggested that while this is a bubble, it wouldn’t be a ‘bad’ bubble like the financial crisis. Instead he said it would be a ‘good’ bubble, comparing it to the Dot Com crash. His argument is that while a lot of companies collapsed in the Dot Com crash, a handful that had good ideas and viable models – including Amazon and Google – survived and thrived. He thinks the same will happen here – the tide will go out and expose those that can’t back up all of their big talk, but the useful platforms will stick it out and usher in big changes for the world. Of course that comparison does skirt over the negative impact this kind of ‘good’ bubble can have. All of those bankruptcies and valuation write-downs means lost investments and a shock to the stock market, which perhaps impacts people’s pensions, and likely leads to job cuts too. So it wouldn’t just be a case of adjusting a balance sheet or two and moving on. But is there the potential for contagion? Again, it depends first and foremost on how much more bubbly the bubble gets before it bursts. But no more than AI investment is feeding growth in the wider US and world economy right now, a dramatic collapse in investment and valuations in the sector will have a knock-on effect on national and global GDP too. There’s also the very practical impact of jobs cuts – direct and indirect. If it turns out that the AI industry has gotten too big and expensive, some of those being hired now will likely be let go. Meanwhile companies that see the value of their AI investments getting written down may need to make cuts elsewhere to cover their losses. It could also have a knock-on impact on areas like construction and consumer spending. And one concern around a potential AI crash relates to that circularity of investment that’s being seen at the moment. A big part of the boom in Nvidia’s revenue is based on the scramble to make use of OpenAI’s tools. Oracle’s stock price also reflects the fact that it’s been promised $300 billion of business from OpenAI in the coming years. As a major shareholder in OpenAI, Microsoft’s valuation is also boosted by the belief that Sam Altman’s firm will become massively profitable in the near future. Meanwhile Amazon has done its own multi-billion dollar deal with OpenAI to provide it with data centre capacity to power its AI platforms. That means that all of those big tech companies have a lot to gain from OpenAI’s success – and a lot to lose if it turns out that the technology isn’t nearly as useful as many hope. Its importance to these major firms has led to suggestions by some that the company is already too big to fail. Some have even started to call for it to be broken up to reduce the systemic risk it poses. That’s despite the fact that it’s currently still privately held, and still losing billions of dollars a year. Business Journalist Follow@AdamMaguire © RTÉ 2025.

Title: NetEase shuts down Bad Brain Games Studio after The Midnight Riders project fails to secure funding

In another unfortunate event in the games industry, NetEase has shuttered its Canadian subsidiary, Bad Brain Games Studios, making it the second studio to close under the publisher this week, following Fantastic Pixel Castle. Bad Brain Games, based out of Toronto, was established in 2023 and consisted of former Ubisoft developers, particularly from the Watch Dogs series. The studio confirmed it will halt operations on November 17, 2025, after failing to secure new funding or investment for its project, codenamed The Midnight Riders. Studio head Sean Crooks broke the news on LinkedIn and said, “It’s with a heavy heart that we share that Bad Brain Game Studios will be closing its doors.” He explained that the studio had explored every avenue to secure external investment, but to no avail. He praised the team’s “creativity and commitment” as they “pushed creative and technical boundaries every day with passion, imagination, and craft.” The Midnight Riders was supposed to be a retro-themed action-adventure game featuring a group of school-going teenagers, exploring mysterious worlds on bicycles and hunting down eldritch horrors with everyday objects like slingshots and baseball bats. Bad Brain Games released a small sizzle reel that drew tons of praise for the project’s art direction and intriguing gameplay. Despite the sudden halt in The Midnight Riders' development, Crooks stated that the project and its IP remain “available with acquisition or partnership.” The studio is still clinging to hope as Crooks said, “We believe strongly in what was created, and would love to see this world find its way to players.” Bad Brain Games Studios consisted of nearly two dozen employees, many of whom had been poached from major studios. Unfortunately, staff members are scrambling for new opportunities amid a brutal wave of layoffs in the video game industry, which has left tens of thousands of developers out of work. Crooks wrapped up the post, stating, “Your encouragement and belief in what we were building meant the world to us. While this chapter is ending sooner than we had hoped, the spirit of what we created at Bad Brain will live on through the incredible people who made it possible.” This is the third NetEase-related high-profile studio shut down in recent months. The first casualty was T-Minus Zero Entertainment. Yet T-Minus Zero managed to strike a deal with a consortium of veteran directors and founders for the studio’s name and assets. Bad Brain Games Midnight Riders hangs in limbo, awaiting any interested bidder willing to revive the title. Buy Watch Dogs: Legion on Amazon Bad Brain Games Studios - Linkedin

Title: Looking for an interesting Christmas present? Start bidding for bargains at auction
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/fine-art-antiques/2025/11/08/looking-for-an-interesting-christmas-present-start-bidding-for-bargains-at-auction/

As Christmas shopping season begins, savvy searchers for gifts will be browsing auction catalogues for ideas. Buying presents at auction is a sustainable shopping option, because such purchases keep things in circulation for longer. Buying at auction often also represents good value for money, although prospective buyers should always be aware that most auctioneers add 20 per cent buyer’s commission plus VAT at 23 per cent on the buyer’s commission to the hammer price. So, for example, a painting bought for a hammer price of €1,000 will cost €1,246. There can also be an extra charge for online bidding. With these caveats in mind, there are plenty of auctions in the next few weeks that are worth checking out. Take, for example, the live auction of railway memorabilia at Mullen’s showrooms in Laurel Park, Bray, Co Wicklow on Monday November 10th, starting at 11am. The lithographs, watercolours, paintings and photographs of trains and 20th-century tourist posters promoting rail travel all belonged to Col Raymond O’Neill, the Lord O’Neill, who is the current owner of Shane’s Castle, near Randalstown in Co Antrim. From the early 1970s, Shane’s Castle had its own miniature railway line running from a platform near the Antrim Gate lodge to Shane’s Castle on the shores of Lough Neagh. It closed to the public in 1994. An avid collector of all kinds of “railwayana”, from enamelled advertising signs to model train sets, train timetables, maps, postcards and guide books, the Lord O’Neill is the former chairman of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, a past president of the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland and a member of several other heritage bodies. He is the nephew of the late Terence O’Neill, former prime minister of Northern Ireland and leader of the Ulster Unionist Party. His stepfather was Ian Fleming, the author of the James Bond novels. Some buyers will be drawn to the illustrious provenance of items, while others will be enticed by their collectability. Take, for example, the colourfully illustrated travel posters Come to Ulster (€700-€1,000) or the poster for London, Midland and Scottish Railway, Connemara by the artist Paul Henry (€600-€1,200). The Dublin and Blessington Tramway passing Russborough Estate in Co Wicklow by Sean Boylan in 1924 (€400-€600) is one of several paintings of trains travelling through scenic spots in this collection. The auction also includes vintage Airfix model kits and model trains including the North Pole locomotive and carriage on a display track (€100-€200) and a collection of die-cast models of trams (€40-€80). Mullen’s timed online auction of classic and contemporary interiors also has plenty of potential Christmas gifts, with reasonable estimates on lots of glassware, crockery and paintings. The lots will begin closing on November 9th from 6pm. Meanwhile, Adams Blackrock is hosting an online jewellery auction of 750 pieces consigned by a long-established Irish jeweller that is now closing its doors. “The selection showcases a wide range of contemporary gold jewellery set with precious gemstones, ideal for both everyday wear and special occasions,” says Elena McCrory from Adams Blackrock. The online auction, which closes at 7pm on November 13th, is on view until Sunday November 9th from 12-4pm daily at 17 Kildare Street, Dublin. And Lynes & Lynes auctioneers in Carrigtwohill, Co Cork, is selling an eclectic range of items from several Cork residences, the recently closed Cotton Ball pub and recently closed Canty’s Garage, both in Cork City. The most striking item in the Lynes & Lynes auction has to be the 1914 Buick Tourer (€15,000-€20,000). Made by General Motors in Michigan, US, it was a luxury car at a time when motor vehicles were still relatively rare. Vintage photographic prints of Canty’s garage with delivery vehicles (€20-€30) will appeal to vintage car enthusiasts. Those seeking Christmas gifts will also have plenty to choose from at the Lynes & Lynes auction, including a set of antique glass decanters (€30-€50), Shanagarry pottery (€40-€60) and a selection of china teapots (€20-€40), all with reasonable estimates. Fans of antique fairs should note forthcoming fairs in Limerick Racecourse on November 15th and 16th and at Claregalway Castle in Co Galway on November 22nd and 23rd. Both are run by Hibernian Antique Fairs and feature dealers from the Republic and Northern Ireland. Finally, the Grace O’Malley Foundation will have a small auction at its annual fundraising lunch in the Westbury Hotel on Friday November 14th at 12.30pm. The charity provides practical home improvement supports to sick and older people struggling to survive in their own homes. The items for auction include a bronze December mask by the Irish sculptor Rory Breslin (€3,000-€5,000). A set of 14 river gods bronze masks by Breslin achieved a hammer price of €125,000 at Sheppard’s auction house earlier this year. Estimate: €2,000-€3,000 each Hammer price: €4,200 (black)/€3,200 (white) Auction house: deVeres Estimate: €6,000-€9,000 Hammer price: Not sold Auction house: deVeres Estimate: €200-€400 Hammer price: €420 Auction house: deVeres Keep up to date with fashion news and trends for you and your home.

Title: BioWare is still working on the next Mass Effect game, the studio says in N7 Day message — "EA and BioWare remain committed."

For N7 Day 2025, BioWare shares a message reiterating that the next Mass Effect game is in development. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Role-playing game developer BioWare has traditionally shared new teases, updates, or messages to the Mass Effect player community on November 7, or "N7 Day," reflecting the in-game designation for special operatives. For N7 Day 2025, BioWare declined to share any new tidbits about its next game, instead simply reiterating that the game is coming, pushing back against recent online chatter that it's in trouble or will be cancelled. "You’ve made it clear you care deeply about what’s next. So let’s start by setting the record straight: the next Mass Effect game is in development, and EA and BioWare remain committed to telling more stories in this universe," the statement reads. "The truth is, the last few years have been an incredibly busy time at BioWare. But currently, the team is heads-down and focused exclusively on Mass Effect. We have a lot of universe to cover, lots of features to build, and lots of romances to figure out. We’re excited by what we’re building, and we promise you: when we’re ready, it’ll be a lot of fun to show."This comes as Electronic Arts' (EA's) overall game division has seen a turbulent past few months. At the start of the year, BioWare was subjected to layoffs, reducing the studio down to under 100 staff. In April, hundreds of additional workers were laid off, including some at Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi developer Respawn Entertainment. More cuts came shortly after, with EA cancelling a Black Panther game and closing the developer.Now, EA has agreed to go private in a deal financed by private equity and Saudi Arabian investment, leading to concerns over the tone and content present in future games, as well as fears of additional cuts. While the next Mass Effect game was first announced with a teaser back in 2020, extremely little has been shared since then. BioWare did present a new teaser for N7 Day 2023, which showed off a new character design and hinted towards a possible game title of Epsilon (or Mass Effect 5, in a more literal sense). While there are no new tidbits regarding what players can expect from the next Mass Effect game, BioWare's update does shed some light on the long-gestating Mass Effect TV series in production at Amazon. We now know that the series will take place after the events of the original trilogy, and it is not going to be a retelling of the story of Commander Shepard.This is similar in approach to the Fallout TV series (which was also produced by Amazon), which is set years after the events of Fallout 4. I previously argued it would be a mistake to try and have a "canon" Commander Shepard and accompanying choices in the TV series, so I'm certainly happy to see BioWare confirm things won't go that way.Finally, there's a curious pattern scattered throughout the message. A few letters of different words in BioWare's blog post are italicized, and put together, they spell out "URL KROGAN."Combined with a vague post on X (formerly Twitter) from the official Mass Effect account, some players quickly figured out that it linked to a new piece of artwork, presenting a Krogan civil War. The Krogan are easily my favorite race in the Mass Effect universe, so I'm already speculating about just what this event could entail.As for the message itself, while I certainly understand what BioWare is aiming to do here, it's still hard not to feel worried. I wish the team the best, and I hope things go well in the months and years to come. Mass Effect Legendary Edition compiles all three original games into one remastered package. It's a must-play for any fans of action-RPGs, and you can snag an Xbox copy for just $9 right now. See at: Loaded (formerly CDKeys) No, the next Mass Effect game does not have a release date or even the vaguest window. Extremely little is known at this time.

Sarah Burris is a long-time veteran of political campaigns, having worked as a fundraiser and media director across the United States. She transitioned into reporting while working for Rock the Vote, Future Majority and Wiretap Magazine, covering the Millennial Generation's perspective during the presidential elections. As a political writer, Burris has had bylines at CNN, Salon.com, BNR, and AlterNet and serves as a senior digital editor for RawStory.com. Women in Media Center The Nasdaq Composite had its worst week since April this week, numbers show. Market Watch attributed the flop to the tech industry and the government shutdown. Yahoo Finance cited "seesaw stretches for 'Magnificent Seven' stalwarts Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA). The S&P 500 and the Dow also closed out the bumpy week in the red as persistent worries about an AI bubble and Big Tech valuations run high." MSNBC VP of editorial and bookings, Jesse Rodriguez, wrote on X, "US stock indexes are on track for their worst five-day start to November since 2008." "The Warren Buffett Indicator (market cap to GDP), the Shiller CAPE ratio (stock prices to earnings), and my Dr. X bubble detector are at record highs. WHEN WILL THE BUBBLE BURST?" asked Steve Hanke, professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University. "You can get people to believe a lot of things, but I guarantee you can't get them to believe grocery prices are down," said chief economist Tim Duy at SGH Macro Advisors, referring to President Donald Trump's argument that prices for everything are better. Stock associate Mike Bostic flagged concerns over the labor market, shutdown and AI bubble as the possible cause. "Ping! Is that the bubble bursting?! Bad day for American AI and tech stocks today..." said academic researcher Dr. Ian McCormick. He later added, "The selloff seems to be driven by anxiety over the ongoing US government shutdown, the resulting dearth of economic data, and warnings that an AI bubble might burst soon." In the background, "Elon will be a trillionaire. Wild," said Certified Financial Education Instructor Kalu Aja. "Thanks, Donald!" blamed media executive John Goodman.

Speculations across the crypto space have ignited a wave of excitement for the XRP price as rumors linking BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, and Ripple, a crypto payments company, continue to spread. The possibility of XRP reaching $1,000 before the end of 2025 has become the latest hot topic, fueled by bold claims from top analysts who believe that this rumored partnership could set the stage for one of the most explosive bull runs in this cycle. Crypto market analyst ‘The Real Remi Relief’ has stirred significant interest with his post on X social media, claiming that if ongoing rumors about a potential partnership between BlackRock and Ripple prove true, the XRP price could reach $1,000 by the end of 2025. He advised holders to secure their XRP in cold wallets and prepare for a potential market-wide supply shock. His optimism stems from reports shared by another well-analyst @DelCrxpto, who revealed that sources deep within the crypto industry are hinting at a major development involving BlackRock and Ripple. According to these claims, the global asset manager may be preparing to collaborate with Ripple to establish infrastructure for the tokenization of all $5.3 trillion of its ETF liquidity. If such an initiative were to materialize, it would represent one of the largest integrations of blockchain into global finance. Ripple’s network, designed for fast and cost-effective asset transfers, could provide the foundation for tokenized ETFs, potentially transforming traditional investment markets. Additionally, the crypto payments company, which is already expanding into the Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization sector, will broaden its technology and services to support a broader range of financial products. The possibility of such a partnership has reignited optimism within the XRP community, especially after the recent Ripple Swell event, which featured participation from prominent names including BlackRock, Nasdaq, Franklin Templeton, The White House, and several other global institutions. Notably, an ETF tokenization deal between Ripple and BlackRock could elevate XRP’s role in the digital asset and financial ecosystem, driving institutional adoption, which could propel its price. Despite growing optimism about XRP’s price outlook, the rumors remain unconfirmed, and neither Ripple nor BlackRock has issued any official statement. Market analyst @Steph_iscrypto has added fuel to the bullish excitement surrounding the XRP price with a technical analysis suggesting that the cryptocurrency could soon enter another parabolic phase. He announced in his X post that “XRP will shock everyone in the next 1-3 months.” His accompanying weekly chart highlights bull rallies from past cycles, where XRP surged 2,117% in 2013, 110,466% in 2017, and 1,208% in 2020. Building on this trend, XRP has recently broken through a long-term resistance level, mirroring the early stages of its previous explosive bull cycles. If historical patterns repeat, the analyst suggests that the cryptocurrency could be on the verge of another explosive bull run this cycle.

Title: Is it time to end Major League Baseball’s antitrust exemption?
URL: https://www.deseret.com/politics/2025/11/07/major-league-baseball-antitrust-exemption-mike-lee-urge-court-overturn/
Time Published: 2025-11-07T19:34:17Z
Full Content:
Two U.S. senators, including one from Utah, are taking another swing at ending Major League Baseball’s century-old exemption from antitrust laws. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., filed a friend-of-the-court brief urging the Supreme Court to overturn a longstanding precedent that has shielded professional baseball from the nation’s antitrust laws. Lee in a statement said baseball for too long has enjoyed an exemption from the competition laws that apply to every other professional sport and business in the country. “As I’ve said before, baseball understands best of all the benefits of competition,” said Lee, chair of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights. “Sadly, our Supreme Court has historically balked at the opportunity to overturn a wrongly decided case, and subject professional baseball to the same competition laws as every other professional sport. It is time for America’s pastime to be revitalized by the laws governing all American businesses.” Lee introduced legislation in 2023 to end the exemption. Booker, the subcommittee ranking member, said baseball has enjoyed a “free pass” to break the rules of fair competition because of a flawed Supreme Court ruling, one that the court itself has acknowledged was a mistake. “The one-of-a-kind antitrust exemption gives leagues the power to artificially control salaries, ticket prices, team relocations, and more, harming players and baseball fans alike,” he said in a statement. In 1922, the Supreme Court ruled in Federal Baseball Club v. National League that the Sherman Antitrust Act does not apply to professional baseball, specifically to “[t]he business [of] giving exhibitions of base ball [sic].” In that case, the Federal Baseball Club of Baltimore, a team and member of the Federal League, sued the National League and the American League, claiming they had conspired to monopolize the business of professional baseball by buying out members of the Federal League and by inducing its members to leave. The court decided that pro baseball games were not interstate commerce and were therefore outside the scope of the antitrust act because they were exhibitions, rather than a business affecting trade or commerce among the states. The senators’ brief comes in the case of Cangrejeros de Santurce Baseball Club, LLC v. Liga de Beisbol Profesional de Puerto Rico, Inc. They argue in the filing that modern professional baseball bears no resemblance to the localized exhibitions in 1922 and is a multibillion-dollar interstate enterprise indistinguishable from other professional sports. The case involves a dispute between the former owner of a professional baseball franchise in Puerto Rico and the league, its president and other franchise owners. The owner, Thomas Axon, a financial professional from New York, alleges that the league conspired to force him to relinquish control of the team, violating the Sherman Antitrust Act and other laws. Axon claims that the league’s actions were in retaliation for his criticism of the conditions at the team’s publicly-owned stadium and his threat to move the team to another city. The case has worked its way through various courts over the past three years. Attorneys for Axon petitioned the Supreme Court in October to take up the case. “The baseball antitrust exemption is no longer sustainable (if ever it was), and it should be overruled. The exemption’s conceptual foundation — that the business of baseball is not interstate commerce and thus not subject to federal economic regulation at all — was questionable from the start and is today wholly indefensible," according to the petition. The Supreme Court addressed the baseball exemption twice before. In 1953, it upheld the exemption. In 1972, it continued the exemption based on precedent set by prior cases and saying Congress must correct any errors in previous decisions by amending the antitrust laws. Lee and Booker argue in the brief that Congress should not be required to fix a “mistaken interpretation” of the law — when the court can and should overrule the Federal Baseball decision now. Congress has considered bills in the past to do away with baseball’s exemption, with the late Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch among those leading the charge in the 1990s. In 1998, it passed the Curt Flood Act partially repealing the exemption, allowing major league players to sue MLB for employment-related matters, such as compensation and working conditions. The law does not apply to minor league players, franchise relocation or other areas of baseball’s business. MLB commissioner Rob Manfred has defended baseball in response to a Senate Judiciary Committee inquiry about the exemption in 2023. He argued that “it may not be possible” for the league to enforce, establish and maintain better working conditions for minor leaguer players if the exemption were lifted. “Without coordinated oversight and decision-making by MLB, it is likely that more Minor League affiliates will leave their existing communities for a superior player-development environment, and that fewer — rather than more — Minor League clubs affiliated with MLB clubs will exist in the future,” he wrote. As ESPN reported, Manfred argued that the league must maintain the current player development system because it already spends $1 billion annually to support the minor leagues, which do not make a profit and are subsidized by MLB teams. That allows teams to provide low ticket prices and remain in areas that otherwise could not “economically support a professional baseball team.”

Title: Last month marked worst October for layoffs in more than 20 years: Challenger

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/07/2025 10:10:17 AM PST by SeekAndFind Technology firms led private-sector job cuts as employers looked to cut costs and address AI. Last month was the worst October for layoff announcements since 2003 as companies slashed roles to save money, pared back pandemic-era hires, and planned ahead for artificial intelligence, according to the global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Employers announced 153,074 cuts last month, compared to 55,597 cuts in October 2024. Last month’s figure was “the highest total for October in over 20 years, and the highest total for a single month in the fourth quarter since 2008,” Andy Challenger, chief revenue officer for Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a report Thursday. Altogether, US firms announced the end of 1,099,500 positions through the first 10 months of this year, up 44% from the 761,358 cuts seen for the entirety of 2024. Technology businesses led private-sector layoffs. “October’s pace of job cutting was much higher than average for the month,” Challenger said in a statement. “Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes,” he continued. “Those laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market.” Recent notable layoff announcements have come from Amazon (AMZN), Target (TGT), and UPS (UPS). Year-to-date cuts are at their highest since 2020, Challenger said, when the pandemic wreaked havoc on the labor market. The Challenger report comes amid a data drought from the Labor Department due to the government shutdown — now the longest in US history. The last official jobs report reflects labor conditions from August, while data from September has yet to be published. October’s jobs report, due out tomorrow, is unlikely to be published.

It’s unlikely the situation has changed dramatically since then — data from the payroll processor ADP published Wednesday actually showed modest job growth among private employers for October, with hiring gains mixed by sector. 2 posted on 11/07/2025 10:10:45 AM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind I said this yesterday.This doesn't fall squarely on Trump, but if we continue to see headlines like this (these reports are not politically biased), we are VERY naive to think the GOP won't get its butt kicked in the midterms...the labor market isn't as great as Trump purports it to be. 3 posted on 11/07/2025 10:12:50 AM PST by millenial4freedom (Government was supposed to preserve freedom, not serve as a jobs program for delinquents and misfits) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: All Sounds like we need less immigrant (especially h1b visa scammers) and increased deportations 4 posted on 11/07/2025 10:16:45 AM PST by escapefromboston (Peace, commerce and honest friendship with all nations, entangling alliances with none.)

The Federal Reserve officially sets its benchmark for an optimum percentage of full employment at an unemployment rate of 5. 0 to 5. 2%. Full employment is defined as the optimal range of unemployment where there a balance between the number of Americans gainfully employed and those seeking new job positions to avoid the negative economic consequences of labor shortages. Economists typically use 4-6% unemployment as an optimum number in our economy. If unemployment numbers go above an unemployment rate of 5. 0 to 5. 2%. then too many people are out of work but if unemployment numbers go below an unemployment rate of 5. 0 to 5. 2%. then too many people are working and there are the potential for serious labor shortages At unemployment levels below 5.0% people who are looking for jobs are in high demand and can find a new and often better job quickly and with little difficulty. As of now, at an official 4.35 % unemployment we are well below the 5.0 % unemployment levels that the Federal Reserves considers the optimum for a healthy, dynamic economy that balances job mobility, full employment and an adequate pool of skilled workers so that employers can readily hire the kind of labor force they need without shortages. In fact, we are very close to the danger zone of too low of an unemployment rate for optimum economic growth. 15 posted on 11/07/2025 10:49:19 AM PST by rdcbn1 (..when poets buy guns, tourist season is over................Walter R.

Employers announced 153,074 cuts last month, compared to 55,597 cuts in October 2024. Last month’s figure was “the highest total for October in over 20 years, and the highest total for a single month in the fourth quarter since 2008,” Andy Challenger, chief revenue officer for Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a report Thursday. Altogether, US firms announced the end of 1,099,500 positions through the first 10 months of this year, up 44% from the 761,358 cuts seen for the entirety of 2024. Technology businesses led private-sector layoffs. “October’s pace of job cutting was much higher than average for the month,” Challenger said in a statement. “Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes,” he continued. “Those laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market.” Recent notable layoff announcements have come from Amazon (AMZN), Target (TGT), and UPS (UPS). Year-to-date cuts are at their highest since 2020, Challenger said, when the pandemic wreaked havoc on the labor market. The Challenger report comes amid a data drought from the Labor Department due to the government shutdown — now the longest in US history. The last official jobs report reflects labor conditions from August, while data from September has yet to be published. October’s jobs report, due out tomorrow, is unlikely to be published.

The Federal Reserve officially sets its benchmark for an optimum percentage of full employment at an unemployment rate of 5. 0 to 5. 2%. Full employment is defined as the optimal range of unemployment where there a balance between the number of Americans gainfully employed and those seeking new job positions to avoid the negative economic consequences of labor shortages. Economists typically use 4-6% unemployment as an optimum number in our economy. If unemployment numbers go above an unemployment rate of 5. 0 to 5. 2%. then too many people are out of work but if unemployment numbers go below an unemployment rate of 5. 0 to 5. 2%. then too many people are working and there are the potential for serious labor shortages At unemployment levels below 5.0% people who are looking for jobs are in high demand and can find a new and often better job quickly and with little difficulty.

The Federal Reserve officially sets its benchmark for an optimum percentage of full employment at an unemployment rate of 5. 0 to 5. 2%. Full employment is defined as the optimal range of unemployment where there a balance between the number of Americans gainfully employed and those seeking new job positions to avoid the negative economic consequences of labor shortages. Economists typically use 4-6% unemployment as an optimum number in our economy. If unemployment numbers go above an unemployment rate of 5. 0 to 5. 2%. then too many people are out of work but if unemployment numbers go below an unemployment rate of 5. 0 to 5. 2%. then too many people are working and there are the potential for serious labor shortages At unemployment levels below 5.0% people who are looking for jobs are in high demand and can find a new and often better job quickly and with little difficulty. As of now, at an official 4.35 % unemployment we are well below the 5.0 % unemployment levels that the Federal Reserves considers the optimum for a healthy, dynamic economy that balances job mobility, full employment and an adequate pool of skilled workers so that employers can readily hire the kind of labor force they need without shortages. In fact, we are very close to the danger zone of too low of an unemployment rate for optimum economic growth. 15 posted on 11/07/2025 10:49:19 AM PST by rdcbn1 (..when poets buy guns, tourist season is over................Walter R.

Title: BioWare are "focused exclusively" on the next Mass Effect, says exec producer, along with a Krogan teaser
URL: https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-are-focused-exclusively-on-the-next-mass-effect-says-exec-producer-along-with-a-krogan-teaser
Time Published: 2025-11-07T18:02:38Z
Full Content:
"We have a lot of universe to cover, lots of features to build..." Even as the consortium led by Donald Trump's haunted finger puppet Jared Kushner and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund proceed with their wildly leveraged $50 billion acquisition of Electronic Arts, Mass Effect executive producer Mike Gamble would like everybody to know that we're just fine, you guys. Everything is hunkey-dorey over here at BioWare, a studio whose last few, famously difficult original videogame projects both severely undershot commercial expectations, as we gaze down the barrel of a buyout that will leave our parent organisation $20 billion in debt and beholden to new owners who may disagree with everything we stand for, and who allegedly want to juice the screws with generative AI. Happy N7 Day, you bastards. Here's a cute coded message for you about the future of Mass Effect, 13 years since the last indisputably good one (sorry Nic). Please ignore the tears streaming down my face. OK, so this characterisation is both mean-spirited and quite silly, but I cannot read Gamble's smiling words without hearing somebody cocking a Kessler out of shot. "Like you, we've heard the rumors lately," he acknowledges, after some seasonal preamble. "You've made it clear you care deeply about what's next. So let's start by setting the record straight: the next Mass Effect game is in development, and EA and BioWare remain committed to telling more stories in this universe." For context, the next Mass Effect game was sort-of-announced in 2020. Since then, there has been the occasional snippet of info about the possible return of the Geth and the definite return of senior developers from the original trilogy, but nothing of real substance, for BioWare's attention has been firmly fixed on the completion of Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The latter missed EA's opening quarterly targets, prompting mass layoffs in a year when EA staff earned less on average while CEO Andrew Wilson got himself a pay rise. All this was before the proposed $50 billion dollar acquisition, which has led one former Dragon Age executive to speculate that EA might sell BioWare or close them down. "The truth is, the last few years have been an incredibly busy time at BioWare," Gamble went on. "But currently, the team is heads-down and focused exclusively on Mass Effect. We have a lot of universe to cover, lots of features to build, and lots of romances to figure out. We're excited by what we're building, and we promise you: when we're ready, it'll be a lot of fun to show." He also gave an update on the forthcoming Mass Effect TV show, on which BioWare are collaborating with Amazon. Amazon, the revolting business empire that turned Sauron into an office creep, though I will concede they did an OK job with Fallout. "The writers room is going strong, and we've got a lot figured out about how it fits within the Mass Effect canon, and where it sits in respect to the new game," Gamble added. "The show will explore a brand-new story within the universe's timeline, and will be set after the original trilogy. It won't be a retread of Commander Shepard's story - because after all ... that's YOUR story, isn't it?" It is, Mike, and I'll thank Jeff Bezos to keep his stinking space colonisation fantasies away from my precious Normandy. If you're wondering why the blog post text looks weird, that's because as with N7 Day bulletins of yore, it contains a hidden message. Tot up all the italicised words, including game names, and you get "u r l Mass Effect k r g a n", unless I've missed a few. Which I guess points towards a website of some kind, while teasing that the Krogan are in Mass Effect 5. I've jumbled the letters up several times and I can't find a way to make it read "please Sony buy us".

US stock market plunged Friday, fueling fears that the AI bubble is bursting before it matures. The Nasdaq fell 1.9%, the S&P 500 lost 1.1%, and the Dow slipped 0.7% as investors dumped major tech names. Nvidia crashed over 4%, breaking below its 50-day line after the US blocked AI chip sales to China, while Palantir slid 1.2% on heavy volume. Consumer sentiment dropped to 50.3, inflation expectations rose to 4.7%, and analysts warned a deeper market correction could follow if the AI-led rally keeps unraveling.

US stock market plunged Friday, fueling fears that the AI bubble is bursting before it matures. The Nasdaq fell 1.9%, the S&P 500 lost 1.1%, and the Dow slipped 0.7% as investors dumped major tech names. Nvidia crashed over 4%, breaking below its 50-day line after the US blocked AI chip sales to China, while Palantir slid 1.2% on heavy volume. Consumer sentiment dropped to 50.3, inflation expectations rose to 4.7%, and analysts warned a deeper market correction could follow if the AI-led rally keeps unraveling.

Title: Billionaire Bill Ackman Clowned For Mamdani Appeal After Mayoral Win

Time Published: 2025-11-07T17:27:39Z
Full Content:
Billionaire Bill Ackman is being laughed at for his humble words towards Zohran Mamdani after his NYC mayoral win. A billionaire behind some of the biggest attacks on New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is being raked over the coals for being highly conciliatory to him after his decisive win. In a post on X, formerly Twitter, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman congratulated Mamdani. “Congrats on the win,” he wrote, adding: Now you have a big responsibility. If I can help NYC, just let me know what I can do.” The tweet was a surprising pivot from his previous words about the Queens assemblyman during his campaign. Ackman, who is a noted supporter of President Donald Trump, had been backing independent candidate and former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in the race and was one of Mamdani’s most vicious critics, hammering him with false claims of him being antisemitic and “amplifying hate” against Jewish New Yorkers. Mamdani has been a firm critic of Israel’s policies, particularly in their conflict in Gaza. Those attacks were often seen in multi-paragraph posts on X, where he also tore down Mamdani’s campaign positions of making New York City more affordable for residents (which include increasing taxes on corporations and billionaires, free bus service, city-run grocery stores and rent freezes for stabilized apartments), claiming it would make the city “much more dangerous and economically unviable,” and spur an exodus of billionaires. Ackman went so far as to donate $1.75 million to two super PACs – Defend NYC and the pro-Cuomo group Fix The City. But now, his conciliatory words have been accepted by the 34-year-old mayor-elect. “I appreciated his words,” Mamdani said while appearing on Good Morning America on Wednesday (Nov. 5). “I think what I find is that there is a needed commitment from leaders of the city to speak and work with anyone who is committed to lowering the cost of living in the city—and that’s something that I will fulfill.” Ackman would be the first of a group of other wealthy figures making overtures to Mamdani. Blackrock co-founder Ralph Schlosstein also publicly pledged support. “I do care deeply about the city, and I’m not going anywhere, whoever the mayor is. I’m going to do whatever I can to help him be successful,” he remarked, according to Forbes magazine. Mamdani is keeping his grassroots structured, as he begins the work of assuming office next January, announcing an all-woman transition team headed by former Federal Trade Commission head Lina Khan.

Title: 'Big Short' Michael Burry's $1bn market crash bet pays off as stocks suffer worst day since Trump's tariff meltdown

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/07/2025 9:24:26 AM PST by DFG The man who predicted the 2008 financial crash could soon be proven right again. On Tuesday, Michael Burry — who became a household name after predicting the 2008 crash and inspiring the film The Big Short — had wagered more than $1 billion that Wall Street's AI boom will end in tears. Now the cracks are showing. US tech stocks are on track for their worst week since Donald Trump's 'liberation day' tariffs rattled global markets in April. Eight of the most valuable AI-driven companies — among them Nvidia, Meta, Palantir and Oracle — have lost a staggering $1.1 trillion in market value since the end of last week. By midday in New York, The S&P 500 was down 1.2 percent, the Nasdaq 2 percent and the Dow 300 points, or 0.7 percent. The Nasdaq is on course for a 4 percent weekly loss, its sharpest decline since Trump's tariff war years. Burry specifically bet that the value of stock for Nvidia and Palantir — two of the market’s hottest AI plays — would fall, and those two have been hardest hit. Shares of Nvidia — the world's most valuable company — tumbled another 4 percent Friday, leaving them down 13 percent for the week. Palantir has plunged 17 percent since Monday, Filings show Burry's hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, disclosed put options worth about $900 million against Palantir and $187 million against Nvidia. A put option is a financial bet that pays off if a company's share price falls. CEO Jensen Huang made things worse by admitting that 'China is going to win the AI race.' He later tried to walk back the remark, but investors were already spooked. (Excerpt) Read more at dailymail.co.uk ...

US tech stocks are on track for their worst week since Donald Trump's 'liberation day' tariffs rattled global markets in April. Eight of the most valuable AI-driven companies — among them Nvidia, Meta, Palantir and Oracle — have lost a staggering $1.1 trillion in market value since the end of last week. By midday in New York, The S&P 500 was down 1.2 percent, the Nasdaq 2 percent and the Dow 300 points, or 0.7 percent. The Nasdaq is on course for a 4 percent weekly loss, its sharpest decline since Trump's tariff war years. Burry specifically bet that the value of stock for Nvidia and Palantir — two of the market’s hottest AI plays — would fall, and those two have been hardest hit. Shares of Nvidia — the world's most valuable company — tumbled another 4 percent Friday, leaving them down 13 percent for the week. Palantir has plunged 17 percent since Monday, Filings show Burry's hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, disclosed put options worth about $900 million against Palantir and $187 million against Nvidia. A put option is a financial bet that pays off if a company's share price falls. CEO Jensen Huang made things worse by admitting that 'China is going to win the AI race.'

Consumer sentiment dropped to 50.3 and inflation expectations hit 4.7%, stoking fear of slowdown. Take-Two crashed 9% on a GTA 6 delay, while Expedia jumped 17% on strong earnings. The AI stock bubble may be cracking faster than expected. (Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Title: Elon Musk says 'TeraFab' chip fab may be the only answer to Tesla's colossal AI semiconductor demand — Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang warns against 'extremely hard' challenge

Time Published: 2025-11-07T17:17:44Z

A new approach to chipmaking? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Elon Musk is thinking about outsourcing some of Tesla’s chip production to Intel Foundry and even establishing the company’s own chip production operation, he said at the company’s Annual Shareholder Meeting event. Musk is perhaps the first executive of a big company to consider building an entire semiconductor production facility due to the extreme complexities and costs associated with such a project. Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, already reacted to Musk’s musings, noting that the head of Tesla may be underestimating the challenge. “I think we may have to do a Tesla TeraFab,” Musk said. “It is like [TSMC’s] Giga[fab] but way bigger.” TSMC calls its fab complexes with production capacity from 30,000 to 100,000 wafer starts per month ‘Megafabs’, whereas fab complexes with production capacities of over 100,000 WSPM are referred to as ‘Gigafabs.’ A ‘Terafab’ would mean capacity way beyond 100,000 WSPM, which would transform Tesla into one of the industry’s biggest chipmakers. To put the capacity into context: TSMC’s Fab 21 complex in Arizona — which will cost the foundry $165 billion in total — is expected to become a Gigafab with six fabs, two advanced packaging facilities, and an R&D center. Apparently, Musk is eyeing something bigger. But let us decode the whole story first, as it takes more than money to become a chipmaker these days. “Building advanced chip manufacturing is extremely hard,” Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, said at a TSMC event on Thursday. “It is not just build the plant, but the engineering, the science, and the artistry of doing what TSMC does for a living is extremely hard.” 3/5 Jensen on Elon Musk’s chip fab plan: “Building advanced chip manufacturing is extremely hard. It’s not just build the plant, but the engineering, the science and the artistry of doing what TSMC does for a living is extremely hard. $NVDA $TSLA $TSMNovember 7, 2025 As a major carmaker that also owns some of the industry's largest AI supercomputers, Tesla needs a steady supply of high-performance processors to power its artificial intelligence efforts. The company already uses tens of thousands of Nvidia GPUs, and now that its Dojo project has been cancelled, it plans to use its AI5 processors for cars and robots in its data centers as well. To get plenty of these processors, Tesla plans to double-source them from TSMC and Samsung. Musk also mentioned tapping Intel for chip production, though this might be a bit challenging as the company does not have any automotive-grade process technologies. “One of the things I am trying to figure out is how do we make enough chips,” Musk asked rhetorically during his keynote speech at the Tesla event. “So, I have a lot of respect for the Tesla partners, TSMC and Samsung, you know, maybe we will do something with Intel. We have not signed any deal, but it is probably worth having discussions with Intel.” However, he believes that his company will need more AI processors in the long term, which will necessitate building its own chipmaking operations, essentially becoming an integrated device manufacturer (IDM), a role that even established chip designers like AMD, Fujitsu, IBM, and Panasonic gave up in recent decades. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. “Even when we extrapolate the best-case scenario for chip production from our suppliers, it is still not enough,” Musk told the audience. “So, I think we may have to do a Tesla TeraFab. It is like [TSMC’s] Giga[fab] but way bigger. I cannot see any other way to get to the volume of chips that we are looking for, so I think we are probably going to have to build a gigantic chip fab. It’s gotta be done.” It costs leading-edge chipmakers billions of dollars to develop a fabrication process and tens of billions to build a single fab with a 20,000 WSPM capacity capable of making chips on a state-of-the-art process technology. Rapidus — Japan’s first new chipmaker with plans to build chips on advanced nodes in decades — estimates that it needs around ¥5 trillion (about $32 billion) in total investment to develop a process technology and build a fab capable of commercial production of 2 nm-class chips in 2027. While we can only applaud this ambitious project, it remains to be seen whether becoming a leading chipmaker from scratch is possible in the 2020s and with leading-edge nodes. Developing a new process technology from scratch is a particularly complex, multidisciplinary endeavor that takes 5 or more years these days, from inception to yield ramp. A development cycle of a fabrication technology begins with pathfinding, materials research, transistor structure development, and then running countless TCAD simulations to model doping, strain, and leakage for a new transistor. Rapidus has licensed its 2nm GAA transistor structure from IBM, but it is also possible to license a chunk of similar technologies from imec and CEA-Leti, public-private R&D institutes. But while it is hard to overestimate the importance of the right transistor structure, this is only the start. Once transistor technology is complete, engineers build thousands of tightly coupled process steps organized into FEOL, MOL, and BEOL modules — covering transistor formation, interconnects, and metallization. Each of these steps demands atomic-level precision in deposition, etch, lithography, and anneal. Tuning those steps (each with hundreds, if not thousands, of parameters) for manufacturability, uniformity, reliability, defectivity, power, and performance requires decades of engineering experience and time from the team. At this point, technology providers like IBM, Imec, or CEA-Leti cannot really help. Once each deposition, etch, implant, lithography, and anneal step is stable in isolation, engineers start combining modules (e.g., transistor gate stack and source/drain) on test wafers and tune their sequencing and temperature budgets to prevent cross-contamination or material degradation. This is essentially when the ordered stack of hundreds of steps that define the node — the process flow — takes shape. Again, these integration recipes are not available for licensing from R&D companies or institutes. After device performance, power, and yield meet targets, the process must be made design-usable by generating PDKs, SPICE models, verified standard-cell libraries for EDA tools, and IPs for chip designers. At the same time, engineers begin implementing the fabrication process in actual fabs and production lines. That implementation and setting the right parameters for equipment is another challenge that demands experience, not something money can buy. Finally, fabs must achieve high yields in mass production, which is a hard, long, and iterative process involving plenty of experienced engineers.Can this all be done from scratch in a mere five years by a newcomer?

Title: Retail industry remains one of ‘hardest hit’ from 2025 job cuts

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The federal government again did not publish its monthly jobs report, but Challenger, Gray & Christmas data shows another period of high layoffs across sectors. October turned out to be a bleak month for some retail employees who, just ahead of the holidays, found out their roles are being eliminated. It was also a rough month overall, as it marked the highest job cut total in October in more than 20 years. Through the first 10 months of the year, U.S. employers have now cut more than 1 million jobs, according to Challenger, the highest total since 2020. “October’s pace of job cutting was much higher than average for the month,” said Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer for Challenger, Gray & Christmas. “Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes.” In retail, October brought on major layoff announcements from some of the industry’s biggest players. Target announced it would cut 1,000 corporate staff and close 800 open roles — representing about 8% of its global headquarters workforce — as part of an effort to streamline its corporate structure. However, the impact is not immediate, with laid off employees receiving pay and benefits until Jan. 3. E-commerce giant Amazon also announced it would cut about 14,000 corporate roles and will offer most employees 90 days to find a new position internally, if they wish to. Additionally, Puma in October revealed it plans to eliminate about 900 more corporate jobs globally and Carter’s said it will lay off about 300 corporate employees by the end of the year. Some retailers are still focused on hiring for the busy holiday season though. For example, Dick’s Sporting Goods is aiming to hire 14,000 associates across its businesses, Amazon will again plan to hire 250,000 workers and Michael's is planning to bring on 10,000 seasonal workers.

Title: Friday Bullet Points More Video Game Endings

And not the good kind. It is Friday and there are some news items that have popped up that I want to notice, even if only in passing. The writing was on the wall for the unloved Tencent MMORPG. I am pretty sure the MMO news sites spent more time trying to cast some spurious unflattering narrative or another about the game than actually seeing it for what it was… another mediocre entry in a very tired niche market. Is that the sun setting over the clouds? Is this MMORPG Elysium? The crime wasn’t cloning or being a throw away title as one columnist kept suggesting. There was nothing intrinsically wrong with it, even if I did not love the control scheme. Rather, it was another failure to read the room, to see that the classic DikuMUD inspired, level grinding MMORPG is dead. Or, if not dead, then stale enough that the odor coming off of the genre suggests death. I haven’t really looked forward to a new fantasy MMORPG in over a decade. Maybe I am jaded… or maybe there has really been nothing new under the sun in the genre for a long, long time. I mean, I have a quote from GDC 2007 that called it almost 20 years ago: …because of WoW, and all the dumb money and all the publisher pressure, there’ll be lots of games that shouldn’t have been MMOs but would have been great boxed products. Lots of publishers are pushing for that subscription pie, but they’ll fail. -Rob Pardo, MMOs Past, Present, and Future Panel at GDC 2007 Some titles are great and thrive as a massive experience. But most don’t. We’ve seen it over and over and over and over again. It isn’t that nobody can beat WoW or that WoW destroyed the genre… it is that replaying the same tropes and mechanics over and over for a couple of decades gets old. Tarisland was a competent recycling of those tired tropes. It did all the things expected of it. In a vacuum where nobody had seen a fantasy MMORPG, it could have been a winner. But we live in the real world where we have seen this model too many times, and the market for that sort of thing isn’t limitless… and was never as big as some suggested. The WoW-killer of myth was never going to be a copy of WoW’s model. Speaking of fantasy MMORPGs and tropes and what not, the Greg Street (formerly Ghostcrawler at Blizzard) and his studio Fantastic Pixel Castle lost its financial support from NetEase and was unable to find any other backers. My tirade above about the staleness of the MMORPG market and the complete failure of anything new in that specific niche to grab an audience and make a strong name for itself in the last decade or so could feed into this. We don’t know what plans they had or if their vision might have broken new ground or just attempted to revisit the same old scenes. Maybe NetEase couldn’t be convinced that there was any “there” there in the studio’s plan. Or maybe investors are skittish about big projects in general. The layoffs do not seem to be slowing down in the video games industry. We just saw Amazon bail out on the idea of any sort of large scale, live service game last week when they found that even their money couldn’t make the genre something it was not. Anyway, the princess that will save us from this was clearly in another castle this time around. EA is out there trying to woo the SEC to allow its board of directors to cash out… because not one of them ever cared a whit about making video games.. by selling the company to the Saudis in a deal that is structured in such a way as to blow up whatever EA was so as to end up with a shell of the former structure. I’ve been over that before in a whole post bidding farewell to EA and whatever it was. Despite having paid off the president by allowing his son-in-law to “broker” the deal for a huge fee, they are going through the motions and pretending somebody might object or try to block the acquisition. But nobody will. The president has put the most grossly incompetent people in charge of every government department to ensure they are only loyal to him and will only do what he says because they are mentally unprepared to do anything else. So the acquisition theater goes on, which included the FAQ that EA sent out to employees with the following entry: That is such a lie that I assume that the lawyer who wrote it was wearing asbestos underwear in order to shield himself from the inevitability of his pants bursting into flames due to the flagrance of the lack of candor being displayed. I mean sure, that first point is technically true, depending on your definition of immediate. EA won’t be driving people into the street with clubs the very moment the deal closes. But the company will be saddled with so much debt that the only reason some people will be kept around is that they probably can’t sell an unstaffed studio to another company. It will be a bloodbath and I will be mightily surprised if the company employs 20% of its current staff a year after the merger is complete. It will, in common with all such mergers and acquisitions, lead to job losses, studio closures, price increases, service reductions, and a variety of other lesser bad outcomes for the consumers, all to make a few individuals incrementally more wealthy and to allow the Saudis to have Madden titles featured at their esports complex in an attempt to put a friendly face on their bloodthirsty dictatorship. When people complain about the problems with late stage capitalism, this is what they are talking about, a situation where billionaires are rewarded for eliminating jobs and screwing over the general public with the full support and assistance of the government they have bought and paid for. My final entry is pretty small potatoes relative to the above. Another EVE Online fan site appears to have fallen over and will likely not be revived. This is a story that will keep repeating itself I am sure. Such sites do not last forever and the game suffers from time to time because CCP leans so hard on the community to fill in the gaps it cannot, or will not, fill itself. The company couldn’t even maintain a wiki about the game after all. In this case it was a simple site that collected the RSS feeds from the now dwindling few bloggers who write about the game and presented them in a few different views as well as a consolidated RSS feed that I run on the side bar of my other blog. It looks like the inner workings of the site gave up the ghost on October 18, after which it collected no more entries. The site only maintained a seven day combined feed, so its unified output dried up a week later. The site was run by Steve Ronouken, or Fuzzy Steve, a long time EVE Online industrialist and a former CSM member. Judging from his blog he hasn’t been active on the site for a few years. Something changed in the background or got updated and things broke I guess. The funny thing is that a dozen years ago there was a fight over who would host the site and claim the name when Marc Scaurus decided to step down from running his iteration of the site. There was community drama and name calling as two sides struggled to claim the EVE Bloggers name. Now none of the sites I mentioned in that post are up and running… except for Foo’s EVE Blogroll. We still have that at least. The site was never a huge source of traffic here or at my other site, but it was often a quality source, bringing people in already keen on the game. So it goes. Addendum: Oh, and a Warhammer MMO was cancelled as well. Re: Fantastic Pixel Castle, Josh Strife Hayes had a video a couple of months ago about him being invited to the pre-alpha of their MMO and he was entirely whelmed. Obviously it was early days, but it didn’t really look like they had a strong, coherent vision for their product (yet). LikeLike Yeah, I could see that. As soon as you start framing it up as an MMORPG or something adjacent, you get roped into a lot of assumptions, and building something out in a pre-Alpha state that speaks to the vision is difficult. LikeLike I expect EA to simply pump out annual FIFA and Madden updates, utilizing AI for all of the data (and the QA/QC work), and get rid of everything else. Okay, maybe throw The Sims a bone and have a few addons there too, but I’d also see The Sims more “aligned” with Saudi “sensibilities”. Everything else? Pretty much gone. The thing is, boardgames saw this already with the Embracer Group fueled buyout of everything under Asmodee’s umbrella.

Title: Warren Buffett-Inspired Strategy Drives Canadian Bitcoin Treasury Growth | US Crypto News

Written byLockridge Okoth Edited byMohammad Shahid Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. What happens when long-term investment wisdom meets the fast-moving adoption of Bitcoin? A Canadian fintech is quietly blending patience, discipline, and digital assets, showing that a Buffett-inspired approach might find its footing in crypto. Mogo Inc., a Canadian fintech company, is demonstrating that Warren Buffett’s value investing principles can coexist with digital assets. In May 2024, the company adopted what it calls the Berkshire Hathaway playbook, integrating long-term, disciplined investing principles into its wealth platform. The move marked a deliberate pivot away from speculative trading. It emphasized patience, temperament, and behavioral discipline, core tenets of Buffett’s approach. Eighteen months later, that philosophy is showing tangible results in Mogo’s digital asset strategy, particularly Bitcoin. “Mogo reports continued platform growth and record assets under management in Q3 2025,” said Mogo Inc. President and co-founder Greg Feller. In Q3 2025, the company increased its Bitcoin holdings by over 300% quarter-over-quarter, bringing the total to $4.7 million. This follows a July 2025 move, where Mogo’s board approved a strategic initiative authorizing up to $50 million in Bitcoin allocations as a long-term reserve asset and capital benchmark. The Q3 allocations were funded through excess cash and monetization of other investments, all while maintaining operational liquidity. The board has formally designated Bitcoin as a long-term reserve asset and capital benchmark. This signals a structured, treasury-focused approach to crypto holdings rather than short-term speculation. The initiative forms part of a broader evolution of Mogo’s Intelligent Investing platform, which integrates both self-directed and managed investing. The system utilizes behavioral science to reduce impulsive trading and encourage measured, long-term decisions. These principles align with the Berkshire Hathaway ethos. By pairing this disciplined framework with a growing crypto allocation, Mogo is bridging traditional value investing and modern digital assets in a way rarely seen in the fintech space. Mogo’s approach contrasts sharply with the typical retail crypto market, dominated by high-frequency trading and leveraged bets. By treating Bitcoin as a strategic reserve, the company is signaling that disciplined, long-term investment principles can survive, and even thrive, in crypto markets. The firm intends to continue building its Bitcoin treasury while expanding the behavioral investing features of its platform. “With the wind-down of our legacy trading business now behind us and continued execution of our Bitcoin treasury strategy, we’re entering 2026 with a stronger foundation and multiple tailwinds supporting our momentum,” read an excerpt in the press release, citing Feller. Its Q3 report makes clear that the fintech sees this as a structural shift, one that combines Buffett-inspired discipline with the opportunities of the digital asset economy. Investors fatigued by speculation can emulate the Canadian company’s approach, which showcases a rare model for measured and thoughtful participation in Bitcoin.

Title: AMC Networks Sheds 5% Of Global Workforce Via Voluntary Buyouts
URL: http://deadline.com/2025/11/amc-networks-workforce-voluntary-buyouts-1236610587/
Time Published: 2025-11-07T14:28:30Z

By Dade Hayes Business Editor AMC Networks, which is continuing to navigate the transition from linear TV to streaming, is shedding less than 5% of its global workforce of 1,800 employees via voluntary buyouts. CEO Kristin Dolan announced the reduction Friday during the company’s third-quarter earnings call with Wall Street analysts. The company had earlier reported mixed results for the quarter, with advertising sliding 17% but streaming revenue climbing 14%. In the company’s earnings release, Dolan called the quarterly performance “a key milestone in our transition from a cable networks business to a global streaming and technology focused content company.” Dolan said “less than 5%” of the workforce would be departing as a result of an initiative to “ensure we have the right skills for the future.” She added that company leaders are “thankful for the contributions of those who have chosen to pursue new opportunities, and of course those who are driving this new era of the company.” Watch on Deadline AMC Networks, parent of cable networks AMC, IFC, Sundance TV, We TV and BBC America, also operates a portfolio of niche streaming services AMC+, Shudder and Acorn TV, with a total of 10.4 million subscribers. The downsizing at AMC Networks comes during a much broader pullback across the entertainment sector. Paramount, in the wake of its merger with Skydance, is laying off about 2,000 workers, about 10% of its total head count. Warner Bros. Discovery recently initiated layoffs in its cable business, and is likely to be part of more cutbacks as it nears a transaction to either be acquired or split into two companies. Disney also let several hundred workers go last summer. It isn’t just traditional media tightening the belt, however. Advances in artificial intelligence are resulting in significant cuts even at Big Tech firms. Amazon last month said it was cutting 14,000 corporate employees, including in publishing and video game development. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

Title: ‘Do I need it?’ Groceries cost 20% to 40% more than before the pandemic. How San Diegans are making do

Mike Portal uses a no-fee credit card that gives 6% back on groceries. He pays it off every month. The chicken drumsticks in Chris Lovelace’s freezer cost 99 cents a pound, far cheaper than the red meat he used to buy. Margi Thornburgh, a night owl, checks ads and clips coupons every Wednesday at midnight and hunts for more discounts on store shelves. “I really get a thrill out of getting a bargain,” she said after spotting $1.99 smoothies at Vons recently, down from $3.99. Because they were half off, she bought 12 instead of six. “I was skipping out of the store with a big smile on my face.” These are some of San Diego’s super shoppers, who have been training for this era of fast rising grocery prices for decades. Some have the resources to turn frugal shopping into a sport of sorts — a car that lets them buy in bulk, time to shop for deals, storage space, multiple grocery stores close to home. For others, strapped for space or time, the path to eating adequately while not overspending is more challenging. Grocery prices have risen for a mix of reasons, including pandemic-era supply chain blockages and import tariffs that are passed on to shoppers. In San Diego County, food eaten outside of restaurants cost 4.4% more this July than a year earlier. That is the latest figure from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, whose publications stopped due to the federal shutdown. Fresher data — St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank’s nationwide FRED figures for September — show milk prices were up 10 cents a gallon over last year and up 68 cents over five years earlier, a rise of almost 20%. White bread was down 11 cents from last year but up 38 cents from five years earlier, about 25% higher. Ground beef cost $6.32 a pound, up from $5.67 a year ago and $4.08 in 2020. In the San Diego metro area, meat was 41% higher last month than in October 2019, dairy was 27% higher and produce was 18% higher, according to a grocery price index by Datasembly, a market analytics company that tracks prices of 1,000 products weekly across the United States. Local prices of meat and non-alcoholic beverages kept rising in the past six months, produce is almost even, and dairy and bakery items have fallen slightly, Datasembly found. Faced with these higher prices, San Diegans have changed how they plan and eat. They are abandoning foods and replacing stores they shopped at for decades with ones that have sales and coupons. They’re clinging to a few favorite items — Diet Coke, Diet Snapple, eggs and bourbon were mentioned. But they’re giving up a degree of control, opting to eat what’s on sale and not what they’re craving. They’re doing the math: if I spend this much on gas to drive around or spring for a freezer, but I save that much on food, is it worth it? As a teenager, Thornburgh learned to write grocery lists and shop weekly sales. Some 50 years later, she still uses those methods. But as local food prices have risen, outpacing the national inflation rate, Thornburgh has taken things further, combining every strategy she can think of so she doesn’t spend more than she must. “I look at all the ads either through the emails I receive or directly on the apps. I make my list by store of which items that I want to purchase. … I’m able to shop at multiple stores in one trip. I always bring a cooler to store cold and frozen items,” she outlined in an email to The San Diego Union-Tribune. Strolling through aisles, she keeps looking for deals. “I can be in a store, see an item on the shelf, and I will pull up the Target app, the Walmart app, the Food 4 Less app,” she said. “Any app of the store that I’m not in. And I will look for the price … and I will say, ‘Am I going to buy this here or am I going to go to another store?’” Her weekly grocery loop is time intensive, taking 90 minutes to two hours and covering as much as seven miles. Stops include Walmart, Food 4 less, Trader Joe’s and Vons. She recently folded in Aldi, drawn by an ad for 55-cent avocados. She picked those up, plus raspberries and asparagus, all on sale. Thornburgh, 70, gets income from contract sewing and Social Security. She is not among the 53% of adults who, according to a poll by AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, see grocery expenses as a “major source of stress.” (Groceries beat housing and health care costs and having inadequate savings or income as the top financial worry.) “I feel that I’m skilled enough and take advantage of all the tools out there,” she said. “I don’t feel stressed. But I’m very conscientious.” She reminds her husband: “If it’s not on sale, I’m not buying it. So he was really happy this week when Ding Dongs were on sale.” With these efforts, she spends around $100 a week, up from $60 before the pandemic, and saves around 50% on average at Vons and 40% at Food 4 Less. “With the money I save, it’s worth the investment of time,” she said. Thornburgh offered one more hint: don’t just shop online. Go inside stores. She acknowledged that shopping online and picking up groceries is convenient for some people, including parents of young children, but “you will miss the in-store sales, and sometimes those are substantial.” Jeff Lonsdale, Ken Sobel and Chris Lovelace are cutting back on red meat. “I don’t buy steaks anymore,” said Lonsdale, 68, who lives in a mobile retirement community in Oceanside. A half-package of sirloin burgers from Costco has been sitting in his freezer because he has “better, more affordable choices” today. He used to buy what he wanted, but as his income as a contract circuit designer fell and food prices hit new highs — especially for the beef burgers, steaks and pork chops he once enjoyed — he has changed his habits. “It used to be: I want it, I’ll go get it. Now I think, do I need it? Then maybe I go get it,” he said. “I don’t need doughnuts and cakes and desserts and that kind of thing, so I don’t even bother.” Currently, he said, “my income is short of expenses each month. My savings account keeps me above water.” Worried about cash flow, Lonsdale started tracking all food spending this year — both at stores and the occasional trip to Taco Bell. All together, his monthly spending on food is around $65 this year, he said. A food rescue program he visits three times a week helps him hold down costs, bringing surplus items from local grocery stores to his community. Around 40 people visit each time, he estimated. One recent morning, he picked up seafood salad with crackers, a 12-ounce watermelon cup, two mesquite-seasoned pork chops that totaled 12 ounces, an Earthbound Farms brand veggie tray with ranch dip, baby carrots, broccoli and celery, a Nathan’s hot dog and a 6-ounce Caesar salad. Based on the price tags he saw, he said the total might be around $20. “I mean, would you spend $3.99 for a little tray of cut up watermelon?” he said. “I get it for free and I’m loving it. And it’s not just the volume. It’s the variety. Things I have never thought about trying, never knew they had, wouldn’t have looked for.” Another nice surprise: goat cheese with herbs. “Wow, I’ll try that. It’s free. It was good.” Sobel, 71, who lives in La Jolla, cut out most meat and some other high-cost grocery items. “Sticker shock was a huge part of it — the prices that went higher all the time and the quality going down, almost commensurately,” he said. “That brought my focus back into buying only healthy foods, buying only what I’m going to eat, being careful about our choices.” After a hospitalization, Sobel decided to lose weight. He changed his diet in June and stopped buying “a lot of the high-price, mass-produced snack foods … that have skyrocketed in price.” One more change: “I really don’t throw away food anymore.” He makes a chef salad using turkey breast or sliced ham and eats that several days in a row, “until it’s completely gone.” “I’m lucky enough to be able to cut about 40% from my food budget and afford to eat,” added Sobel, who reduced his household’s average monthly grocery bill from around $550 (not counting the occasional restaurant delivery) before June to around $400 now. “But what about kids and seniors and low-income families who are losing their SNAP benefits?” Almost 400,000 San Diego County residents saw their CalFresh benefits — the state’s version of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) — halted Nov. 1 amid a federal government shutdown, now in its sixth week. Federal judges later ordered that funds be restarted. Between workers whose pay was frozen by the federal shutdown and people whose food benefits were postponed or trimmed, demand is surging at food banks and food-rescue nonprofits, whether in small communities like Lonsdale’s or at large distribution centers. In Encinitas, Lovelace rarely buys red meat at the store anymore. Instead, he goes out for quality burgers. “It’s got really, really good meat,” he said of Versailles Cafe’s $18 cheeseburger and fries. “It’s a real half pound, not a seven ouncer.” Lovelace’s rooftop solar on the house he and his wife, Dana, bought almost 50 years ago powers the two chest freezers he keeps in his garage. “I still don’t have any chicken breast in my freezer that I paid over $2 a pound for,” he said. Bacon was purchased at $4 a pound — around half of what it costs now full price. He is still working through the dozen packages of breakfast sausage he bought at half-off a while back. When he shops, he buys enough meat to last until the next big sale. Lovelace, who is 75 and retired, stopped shopping at stores that don’t send weekly ads. Like Thornburgh, he lives in a grocery-dense neighborhood with “all the big chains, so it’s really easy to get to places.” He focuses on house brands over pricier, name-brand versions. In-season food is also cheaper, he added. And he knows the market. “You have to know your prices. Sometimes that good deal really isn’t,” he said. These efforts are keeping the couple’s grocery costs almost even with last year: $560 a month in 2023 and 2024 and $577 this year, on average. “Doubtless expenses will begin to rise this holiday season as we liquidate our older inventories but we’ll still be kicking butt on money spent for food compared to any of my friends or neighbors when we compare notes on this topic,” Lovelace wrote in an email. He also credited his wife, who embraces his “cheapo philosophy.” In Mt. Helix, Portal is back to shopping like he did when he was a newlywed in the early 1990s — only now he has that cash-back credit card. “I was in the beginning of my career,” he said of his frugal youth. “We chose to have my wife stay home and take care of the babies. So, yeah, we pinched pennies and cut corners to save money.” Now his kids have kids and Portal, 65, has a home on Mt. Helix and a mortgage consulting business. But with the “tremendous increase in food costs” he has observed this year, he buys food on sale and stopped shopping at Whole Foods. “It’s just too high.” His small freezer holds berries bought on sale, which his toddler grandchildren devour. He also buys discounted meat and uses a vacuum sealer to avoid freezer burn. Ribeye on sale rose from $6 a pound to $9 or more, but even that is a relative bargain compared to full price, he said. Uncooked beef steaks cost on average $10.88 a pound last September and $12.26 this September, up from $8.13 five years ago, according to St. Louis Fed FRED data. To keep grocery expenses roughly the same as last year, even while springing for steak — and the chicken he cooks for RiRi, his 13-year-old Labrador pitbull mix — Portal and his wife stock up ahead of big holidays, when sales are “the best.” He gushed about his credit card, an American Express Blue Cash Everyday Card. Never carrying a balance is key, he said. Portal pointed value hunters to GTM Discount General Store, a surplus seller whose weekly sale recently featured 50% off Eddie Bauer sweatshirts, 40% off flood lightbulbs and 40% off spring wreaths. It has great deals on food, Portal added. Lovelace said he’s lucky to have two freezers and the garage shelves he built himself. “We have places to put stuff, and some people don’t. A lot of the things we do don’t apply across the board.” But his approach of stocking up when prices drop has worked across his lifetime. “In any given era, the same rule applies: prices on food have not gone down realistically over any real period of time in my lifetime. Little dips down and big jumps up,” he said.

Title: October Layoffs Were the Worst Since 2003 and Hit Tech Workers Hard

Reading time 2 minutes A lot of people can feel that the economy isn’t doing so hot right now. Unfortunately, due to the government shutdown, we don’t have much in the way of official economic data to give statistical clarity to that feeling. However, more and more, private firms are releasing their economic analysis, and, much of the time, it doesn’t bode well for the American worker. Now, a new report shows that this October was a particularly brutal month for the U.S. workforceâand it was especially bad for the tech industry. The analysis, from career transition services firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, shows that this past month was the worst in decades. The report states that U.S. employers announced some “153,074 job cuts in October, up 175% from the 55,597 cuts announced in October 2024. It is up 183% from the 54,064 job cuts announced one month prior.” Yikes, that’s a lot. And the cuts have been especially deep for Silicon Valley: Technology continues to lead in private-sector job cuts as companies restructure amid AI integration, slower demand, and efficiency pressures. In October, the sector announced 33,281 job cuts, up sharply from 5,639 in September. For the year, Technology firms have announced 141,159 job cuts, up 17% from the 120,470 announced through the same period in 2024. Yeah, that’s bad. That is not good at all. There’s no real way to spin that as good. âThis is the highest total for October in over 20 years, and the highest total for a single month in the fourth quarter since 2008,” the report states. “Like in 2003, a disruptive technology is changing the landscape.” âOctoberâs pace of job cutting was much higher than average for the month. Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes,” said Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer for Challenger, Gray & Christmas. “Those laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market.â We’ve already written about the huge layoffs that impacted the tech industry last monthâincluding some 14,000 people who used to be (but are no longer) employed with Amazon. The exact reason for why tech companies are shedding jobs right now is still up in the air. One narrative attributes the layoffs to the rise of AI, but other commentators have noted that it could be much more mundane economic/business factors that are squeezing the industry like a lack of growth in non-AI sectors and tariff policy eating away at profits while making it difficult to plan for the future.

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/07/2025 6:09:57 AM PST by yesthatjallen The share of first-time home buyers dropped to a record low of 21%, while the typical age of first-time buyers climbed to an all-time high of 40 years, according to the National Association of REALTORS®' 2025 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers. This annual survey of recent home buyers and sellers covers transactions between July 2024 and June 2025 and offers industry professionals, consumers, and policymakers detailed insights into homebuying and selling behavior. "The historically low share of first-time buyers underscores the real-world consequences of a housing market starved for affordable inventory," said Jessica Lautz NAR deputy chief economist and vice president of research. "The share of first-time buyers in the market has contracted by 50% since 2007 – right before the Great Recession. The implications for the housing market are staggering. Today's first-time buyers are building less housing wealth and will likely have fewer moves over a lifetime as a result." "Unfolding in the housing market is a tale of two cities," Lautz explained. "We're seeing buyers with significant housing equity making larger down payments and all-cash offers, while first-time buyers continue to struggle to enter the market." "For generations, access to homeownership has been the primary way Americans build wealth and the cornerstone of the American Dream," said Shannon McGahn, NAR executive vice president and chief advocacy officer. "Delayed or denied homeownership until age 40 instead of 30 can mean losing roughly $150,000 in equity on a typical starter home. FHA and VA programs have helped millions of Americans access homeownership, join the middle class, and create intergenerational wealth – a testament to smart government policy in support of homeownership."

Title: RWA Platforms Keep Launching—Then Hitting the Same Regulatory Wall

Time Published: 2025-11-07T14:00:29Z

Real-world asset (RWA) platforms that offer regulated securities keep launching with the same playbook. They build for one jurisdiction, secure regulatory approval, and announce institutional partnerships, only to hit a wall when they need licensing to offer those assets across borders. The SEC, MiFID II and Singapore’s MAS all impose different rules on who can legally purchase securities, which means platforms need jurisdiction-specific approvals and must navigate conflicting investor eligibility rules for each new market.

You can opt out anytime. Recent projections by Standard Chartered suggest that the tokenized asset market could grow to $30 trillion by 2034. With BlackRock’s launch of tokenized fund BUIDL and Coinbase’s acquisition of crypto fundraising platform Echo, the institutional interest just keeps rising. But talk to anyone trying to put capital into tokenized assets at scale, and you’ll hear the same complaint: compliance has become a fragmentation nightmare. It’s not that institutions don’t want in. They do. The efficiency gains are obvious: fractional ownership, instant settlement and global liquidity pools. The problem is that every jurisdiction wants something different, and nobody’s built infrastructure that handles all of those differences without duct tape and manual workarounds. Launch a tokenized bond meant to work across multiple markets, and you’re navigating regulatory frameworks that fundamentally contradict each other. The SEC demands specific investor disclosures and accreditation checks. MiFID II requires different transparency standards. Being compliant means something entirely different depending on where your investors are located. Most platforms respond by staying in one jurisdiction. That’s fine for pilots and small-scale tests, but fails once you need institutional capital distributed across global markets. Those that attempt international expansion end up layering custom compliance systems for each region, often rebuilding core infrastructure every time. That approach caps your addressable market before you start. It explains why the technology keeps advancing while institutional adoption stalls. BlackRock can tokenize funds across seven blockchains, but if each blockchain operates in regulatory isolation, you haven’t solved the problem; you’ve just multiplied it. The next generation of RWA platforms won’t eliminate regulatory complexity, because that’s unrealistic given how different jurisdictions operate. What they can do is abstract it so the complexity becomes invisible to the end user. Think of it like payment processing. Stripe doesn’t ask merchants to build separate integrations for Visa, Mastercard, American Express and every regional payment method. You plug into Stripe once, and it handles all the backend complexity of routing transactions through different networks, applying the right fraud checks and managing compliance requirements across payment types. The merchant gets a single API, but customers can pay however they choose. Modular compliance tokenized assets should work the same way. You build your platform once with compliance layers that plug into a unified technology stack. When you tokenize an asset, the system automatically enforces jurisdiction-specific rules based on each investor’s location. It all happens programmatically, without anyone manually coordinating fifteen different regulatory regimes. The technology to do this already exists. Smart contracts can encode transfer restrictions by jurisdiction. Automated AML systems flag suspicious activity in real time. Reusable digital identity solutions handle cross-border KYC without forcing investors to resubmit documents for every platform they touch. What’s been missing is someone building these capabilities into a unified system that institutions trust and regulators can audit. Institutional investors don’t just want compliance in the abstract sense. They want concrete proof that they can show to regulators on demand. That means real-time reports that update automatically, immutable transaction records that can’t be altered after the fact, and the ability to demonstrate—at any time to any regulator—that every single trade followed all applicable rules from day one. Every question of who owned which asset, when and under what legal framework should have a clear, auditable answer. The platforms that win institutional adoption will be the ones where compliance isn’t something you retrofit onto an existing system but is something that’s native to how the platform operates from its core architecture. Every transaction should generate a proper audit trail automatically, every token transfer should validate all regulatory requirements before execution and every corporate action should get logged in ways that satisfy both blockchain transparency standards and traditional financial oversight requirements. If the first generation of RWA platforms proved that tokenization can work, the next must prove that it can scale. That won’t happen through more pilots or technical proofs of concept. It will require infrastructure designed for a fragmented regulatory world from day one. The future of tokenized finance won’t belong to whoever builds the flashiest blockchain integrations, but to whoever builds compliance that travels. Until platforms can offer global reach with local precision, the trillion-dollar opportunity in tokenized assets will remain trapped behind national borders.

Title: Economists agree: You’re not crazy for feeling like the rich get richer, and the poor are doing worse. Welcome to the ‘K-shaped economy’
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/07/what-is-the-k-shaped-economy-wealth-inequality-explainer/
Time Published: 2025-11-07T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
Sasha Rogelberg is a reporter and former editorial fellow on the news desk at Fortune, covering retail and the intersection of business and popular culture. Eva is a fellow on Fortune's news desk. It all began with an anonymous Twitter handle named “Ivan the K.” The self-appointed “Lead Independent Director of Finance Twitter” had a dark theory in the depths of the pandemic. In 2020, they asked the universe, “Why is no one talking about a K recovery?” since there was much discussion at that time about an economic bounceback in the shape of either a U, an L, or, most bullish of all, a V. “Some things will bounce back,” Ivan wrote, “some will not recover. Think about it.” Economists seem to have thunk on it and agreed: The K is real. It bears similarities to another saying, invented nearly 200 years earlier by the great English romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley: “The rich get richer, the poor get poorer.” This is also called “the Matthew effect,” as some trace the sentiment all the way back to the bible’s Book of Matthew 25:29: “For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away.” If you ask Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics, this old-time religion got a new lease on life in the Reaganomics of the 1980s. “You really start to see this in the Reagan era,” Zandi told Fortune. “That’s when you get a structural divergence between productivity growth and median wage growth.” Zandi argued that many elements combined then to weaken labor in favor of capital income: globalization, the decline of unions and manufacturing and major tax reforms. “The share of national income going to labor has been trending down since the early 1980s,” he said, “and the share going to capital owners—those who already have wealth—has gone up.” So what is it about 2025, five years after the pandemic severed something economically, that accelerated both sides of the “K” for the wealthy and the poor? First, consider the extraordinary surges in economic data seen, halfway through the 2020s. The stock market rallies have led to several record highs in 2025, incentivizing the (wealthier) Americans with money in the markets to loosen their purse strings. But the bottom half of the K is extending downwards, with fast-casual restaurants like Chipotle and Cava, and fast-food joints like McDonald’s, noting that lower-income customers, especially young people, are pulling back and preferring to dine at home. Zandi’s own research has turned up some stunning results, notably that in the second quarter of 2025 the top 10% of wealthiest Americans were responsible for a whopping 49% of consumer spending. That means the economy has grown so lopsided—or K-shaped—that the richest Americans are responsible for half the economy. The K-shape is creating the illusion in economic data that despite sticky inflation and tariff-related sticker shock, consumer spending remains “resilient.” Morgan Stanley Wealth Management’s Lisa Shalett has increasingly been sounding the alarm from her perch as chief investment officer. She told Fortune in an October interview that “the income inequality stuff is really getting like completely wackadoo,” specifically citing Zandi’s research: “That means 90% of the country is only half the consumption, I mean holy cannoli.” Shalett covered the K-shaped economy specifically in a November 3 research note, in the context of whether 2026 marks an early or late stage of the economic cycle for investors. “Decoding this conundrum may hinge on the so-called K-shaped economy,” she wrote, “a concept that captures the widening chasm between the ‘haves’ and ‘have-nots.’” Then Shalett said the situation is actually even worse than what Zandi produced: “For the U.S. consumer, wealth concentration has produced a situation where the top 40% of households by income account for approximately 60% of all spending; those households, in turn, control nearly 85% of America’s wealth, two-thirds of which is directly tied to the stock market, which has climbed more than 90% in three years.” She calculated that spending by the wealthiest households was growing 6x-7x faster than for the lowest cohort. Even Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell talked about seeing the pattern at October’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting. “If you listen to the earnings calls or the reports of big, public, consumer-facing companies, many of them are saying that there’s a bifurcated economy there and that consumers at the lower end are struggling and buying less and shifting to lower cost products,” Powell said last week. “But at the top, people are spending, at the higher income and wealth.” The concept of a bifurcated economy has been baked into American society longer than even the days of Reagan, according to Tyler Schipper, associate professor of economics at the University of St. Thomas. “There’s this underlying thing that has been true for decades and decades and decades,” Schipper told Fortune. “Number one, lower income households always struggle more in the economy. They tend to be more impacted by price changes because they’re spending a higher percentage of their income. “And second, that it tends to be that after each recession, lower income workers fall further behind in the income distribution,” he added. Today, conversations around the shape of the American economy are more urgent because more of the middle class—and those making about $100,000 per year—are getting pushed into the lower half of the K, Schipper said. This can be seen in mid-income and higher-income earners flocking to discount retailers like Walmart and Dollar General. It can even take on more absurd forms, with “Ralph Lauren Christmas” trending at unprecedented levels heading into the projected $1 trillion 2025 holiday season, but TikTok and Instagram full of tips on how to achieve the look of red-tartan-plaid and cozy sweaters on a budget—in other words, not at an actually expensive Ralph Lauren store. That lower half of the K is extending ever downward as the consumer encounters a unique set of challenges, including the inflationary impact of tariffs, according to Schipper. Lower-income households tend to spend more on essential goods more likely to be impacted by tariffs. The Yale Budget Lab calculated that the levies impact the bottom of the income ladder more than three times more than the top. A low-fire, low-hire labor market has also contributed to evidence of a two-tiered economy, said Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors and a former Federal Reserve economist. While tech layoffs have been top of mind following massive cuts from Amazon, layoff rates are still low, Sahm told Fortune, meaning if you have a job, you may feel more financially secure. If you’re just entering the job market like Gen Z is, you may have a hard time finding a job as firms contract following a post-COVID hiring spree, and as AI begins to displace entry-level jobs. To be sure, data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas released on Thursday found U.S. employers cut more than 150,000 jobs last month, the largest October reduction in two decades. But another part of the resurgence of discussions about a bifurcated economy comes from the relative nature of a K-shaped economy, according to Schipper. While the economy has historically been two-tiered, diverging consumer sentiment has also contributed to a narrative that two income groups are moving away from each other. For example, in 2022 when the stock market declined, consumer sentiment in both the top-third and bottom-third of income levels converged, according to data from the University of Michigan’s Survey of Consumers. A similar pattern occurred in April, when the announcement of Liberation Day tariffs spooked Americans across income levels, Schipper noted. Last month, however, consumer attitude toward the economy saw a greater split, with low-income Americans feeling far less confident about the economy than those high-income. Some economists point to the widening divide between the rich and the poor as a consequence of monetary policy. The Fed, over the past few years, has had a historic tightening cycle – eleven rate hikes between 2022 and 2024—which was meant to pare down inflation. However, it also reinforced the split since wealthy households, flush by years of asset appreciation, could weather the slowdown better than lower income households facing higher mortgage rates and shrinking credit, Zandi said. Cheap money in the 2010s and early pandemic years boosted stocks and home values, but the 2022-and-on tightening squeezed borrowers and renters without necessarily reversing those gains. That means even as inflation has cooled, the damage lingered as asset holders retained their windfall but wage earners bore the brunt of disinflation. “Folks in the top third of the income and wealth distribution are doing well, but the remaining two-thirds of Americans are struggling… they borrowed during the pandemic when rates were low, and now they’re having to pay on that debt at a higher rate,” Zandi said. Though Fed chair Powell has acknowledged today’s K-shaped economy, a restrictive monetary policy is helping keep it in place, Sahm argued, making it unlikely for the two diverging K lines to come any closer together. “We have a Fed that’s still trying to fight inflation that’s been elevated, and part of the tool that they have for fighting inflation is interest rates are elevated, and they’ve been elevated for some time,” Sahm said. “This is the way restrictive monetary policy works: It’s going to hit households hardest who are more financially constrained.” Zandi had a different perspective. He argued that the gap will require policy changes far beyond the Fed’s remit. “The Fed can’t fix the K-shaped economy,” he said. “It can only stabilize prices and employment. The distributional effects are up to fiscal policy.” Instead, Zandi argued for a reversal of some choices made on the fiscal side that would “do no harm” to lower-and-middle-income Americans. “Don’t impose tariffs—that exacerbates inequality,” he said. “Lower- and middle-income households spend a much higher share of their budget on imported products like food, clothing, and cars.” He also criticized President Donald Trump’s “highly restrictive” immigration policy, which he said hurts jobs for industries that rely on immigrants, such as construction, agriculture and manufacturing broadly. Beyond just addressing self-inflicting wounds, Zandi argued that progress depends on both structural and cyclical forces: raising productivity through education, broad-based jobs creation, and ensuring that gains from AI will be equally shared. “If the benefits of AI are distributed more broadly,” he said, “and if job losses are offset by new opportunities, we’ll be fine.” Clear evidence of a two-tiered economy doesn’t mean a recession is imminent, economists said. It does, however, mean that if economic indicators were to take a nosedive, the risk of a recession would increase. “The K-shaped economy, the bifurcated economy, is potentially a more vulnerable economy,” Sahm said. Though layoff rates are still relatively low, if the rate of job cuts increased, there would be many more people in a job market where there’s not much hiring. The labor market today doesn’t look like it did in the job-hopping era of 2023, even when interest rates were still high, Sahm noted. Right now, only the healthcare and hospitality sectors are adding jobs in earnest, creating a concentration of growth not optimal for economic stability. “Anytime you have that, you’re more vulnerable if something bad happens,” Sahm said. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

A flurry of wealthtech announcements from Asset-Map and eMoney, Evergreen Wealth, Alphathena, d1g1t, and PreciseFP this week. November 7, 2025 GeoWealth, a turnkey asset management platform, introduced a Private Model Marketplace that coalesces strategies it's been amassing for the past year using models constructed by Apollo, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs Asset Management and J.P. Morgan Asset Management. Through GeoWealth’s unified managed account technology, advisors using the platform can build custom models or pick from pre-built ones that include exposure to private markets. Users can create standalone models or combine them with public models in the same custodial account. “We built the Private Model Marketplace to provide advisors with a turnkey, fully managed solution that delivers private market exposure without the operational burden,” GeoWealth CEO Colin Falls said in a statement. “We believe the industry is in its early days of private markets adoption, and our purpose-built technology will help RIAs meet client demand in these asset classes.” The move is the culmination of a series of announcements. In June 2024, the firm raised $18 million in growth investment funding, with BlackRock as a new lead investor. Then this past August, it raised $38 million in Series C funding led by Apollo. The two firms also announced a partnership centered on public-private model portfolios. Related:The Word on WealthTech for October 2025 In addition, just over one year ago, GeoWealth announced partnerships with Goldman Sachs and iCapital centered around bringing private market options to models. It forged a similar pact with J.P. Morgan Asset Management last month. Advisors using both Asset-Map and eMoney Advisor are now able to import their clients’ planning data from the latter and take full advantage of the visual storytelling tools in the former, thanks to a new integration announced between the two this week. Simply put, vast numbers of advisors rely on eMoney to perform complex and comprehensive financial planning for their clients, but using Asset-Map, advisors can visually illustrate the context of entire households and their assets, helping to simplify conversations and more clearly delineate and present household recommendations. And with the integration, Asset-Map reports can be easily dropped into the eMoney vault. A live demonstration from both teams online is scheduled for Dec. 16 at 2 p.m. ET (registration required). A month after a splashy launch, the new RIA created by former Personal Capital CEO Bill Harris, Evergreen Wealth, has announced a key third-party technology partnership. Related:Summit Financial: A Wealthstack For All Apex Fintech Solutions Inc. will provide its AscendOS a real-time, cloud-based investment platform, to power Evergreen’s investing platform, Dynamic Portfolios. Evergreen’s mission, once its technology stack is in place, is to serve “investors with a hyper-personalized, tax-optimized index of individual securities tuned to their specific goals, risk tolerance, tax rate and values, to deliver sophisticated, after-tax wealth management once reserved for ultra-high-net-worth clients,” according to a statement. Alphathena, which specializes in AI-enhanced direct indexing for financial advisors, announced this week the launch of Long/Short Leveraged Direct Indexing, providing advisors with access to an investing approach that was previously used by and mainly available only to institutional investors. Using the new technology will require margin accounts at Schwab, Fidelity or Interactive Brokers, but there are no additional fees or setup required at this time. The company launched at the end of 2022 and was named Best in Show at the 2023 Morningstar Fintech Showcase, and this year was the winner of the 2025 WealthManagement.com Industry Award for Direct Indexing. Related:The WealthStack Podcast: The Digital Experience Platform Playbook with Tom Fields d1g1t (pronounced “digit”), an enterprise provider of advisory technology headquartered in Canada that serves the U.S. advisory market, announced this week that it has re-engineered the core data and processing layers of its platform to deliver better performance, scalability and resilience, enabling it to support millions of accounts and accelerate more complex operations, including reporting, rebalancing and billing. According to the firm, the updates allow for faster load times, boosted performance for real-time calculations and data rendering. Core components have also been upgraded to reduce disruptions and ensure uptime. There have also been improvements in linking research to individual securities meant to help streamline due diligence. The firm rolled out extensive billing features and a Unified Managed Accounts framework a year ago. PreciseFP, the venerable client engagement and data gathering tool popular with advisors and acquired by Docupace in 2021, announced a significant upgrade to its user interface as well as new AI tools this week. The interface refresh is meant to streamline navigation and present a cleaner, more simplified layout, while the AI Template Builder, which is in beta, enables firms to create complete, client-ready forms in seconds, drastically reducing prep times. Docupace recently rolled out integrations with Focal, Flextract and Zocks.

Thanks to the government shutdown, we won't get new employment data. But don't worry, we have you covered with a roundup of private figures. Rundown But first, let's get in touch with the populace. Love Business Insider? Log into Google and make us a preferred source. Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up now Market musings Earnings season has been good. Perhaps… too good. The run-ups in the stock market's favorite tech darlings after earnings last week apparently pushed valuations to a point where investors decided they'd had enough. It's led to a chaotic current week, with two separate valuation-driven sell-offs in a matter of three days. The institutional class is as split as ever over what the future holds. JPMorgan is recommending investors buy any dips. Billionaire Ray Dalio sees a short-term rally, and then a Fed-driven sell-off. And then there's the overhang of what will happen with President Trump's tariffs, which are facing a prolonged legal battle. But that only tells part of the story. As retail investing has exploded in popularity, so has the influence of the day-traders populating Reddit and Discord forums. Their behavior can often be a harbinger of what's to come, and the strategy team JPMorgan has conveniently been keeping tabs. Here are the four main themes that have dominated retail trading over the past week as volatility has raged. They went on their biggest buying spree in four months, almost entirely in mega-cap tech But they're not blindly buying market dips They're getting tired of gold and bitcoin after torrid rallies They're most excited about these meme stocks Judging by a "social interest score" tracked by JPMorgan, the "most hyped" stocks this past week were: Beyond Meat, Nokia, POET Technologies, UiPath, Palantir, Nvidia, Chipotle, and Reddit. Are you a retail investor that's leaning into these trends, or doing something completely different? Let us know what portfolio moves you've been making at firsttrade@businessinsider.com. On the heels of another difficult day in the market, console yourself with another example of the value-creating impact of AI deals. Snap stock surged as much as 18% after announcing a $400 million partnership with Perplexity AI, to incorporate its AI search engine into Snapchat. It's a good reminder that — even on the toughest of days — AI deals trump all, and can carry a stock to market-beating performance. Is the gig up for gold? At least as an S&P 500-crushing speculative asset? It appears so. Following a 20% run up through September and into October, the price of the precious metal has come back down to earth. The chart above, from JPMorgan, reflects a corresponding shift in sentiment, specifically among retail investors. Note the blue line, which shows that retail buying has plateaued. Each Friday, I'll discuss and review a piece of markets- or finance-related media: movies, books, TV shows, podcasts, etc. Today's entry is the movie "Boiler Room" (2000). There are some quotes at the beginning of "Boiler Room" — namely "I just want to get in" and "nobody wants to work for it anymore" — that echo the frivolous, fundamental-lite stock market activity that characterized the meme stock era. Right away, you know this is a movie that's going to deal with a popular evergreen theme: how to get rich quick. This film is best approached by suspending belief around the illegalities occurring. The schemes are sub-Wolf-of-Wall-Street penny-stock pump and dumps, where the companies don't even exist. It would never happen, at least this flagrantly, but that's not the point. It's all merely a vessel for the movie's top-notch cast of wisecracking early-2000s actors masquerading as stock-brokers. Vin Diesel executes a pitch-perfect sales call in front of 100 associates, closing the deal to rapt applause. Ben Affleck — the firm's head recruiter — delivers two scintillating motivational monologues to a room full of new hires. Key quote: "Anybody who tells you that money is the root of all evil, doesn't f**king have any." Leading man Giovanni Ribisi excels as a whip-smart, money-hungry youngster who's looking to make the leap from backroom poker games to stock-broking millionaire. And it feels like Jamie Kennedy is acting in a different movie — perhaps channeling his "Malibu's Most Wanted" character at some points — but it doesn't matter, he steals every scene he's in. At one point, the core group of brokers sit around trading extended recitations of the original "Wall Street." There's an analogy in there somewhere. Of course, the movie doesn't take place exclusively within the walls of the Long Island-based JT Marlin (yes, it's that obvious of a play on JPMorgan). The crew ventures into NYC a handful of times to beat up rival brokers from the "real" Wall Street, and party at a hotel in celebration of a new (fraudulent) IPO launch. These are electric and hilarious scenes, and they show that the movie is at its strongest when the core cast is ripping it up, even if a lot of the dialogue is offensive enough to be left in the year 2000. It's not the best finance movie of all time. But, for my money, it's the most fun. And for that reason it gets a 10/10 rating. Do you have any ideas about what I should review next?

Title: U.S. investors dump $700M in Bitcoin – Is BTC’s $100K support at risk?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/u-s-investors-dump-700m-in-bitcoin-is-btcs-100k-support-at-risk/
Time Published: 2025-11-07T13:00:14Z

Here’s why Bitcoin could drop to $95K in November. Major economic zones were aggressively selling Bitcoin, with the US at the forefront. The odds of Bitcoin reaching $95,000 have climbed to 48%. Bitcoin [BTC] was trading near the $100K mark at press time. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has dropped by 1.5%, with further downside possible due to widespread selling pressure globally. The U.S. was leading in selling BTC, at the time of writing, as seen in the Coinbase Bitcoin Premium Index. The index has been in the red region since the 30th of October, reflecting the massive dumping by U.S. entities. For instance, BlackRock sold 6,800 BTC valued at more than $700 million, averaging about $30 million per transaction. The entity did not seem to stop this capital outflow from Bitcoin and its products ahead of the Fed announcement. Source: CoinGlass Additionally, Bitcoin ETF flows turned positive after six consecutive days of outflows. As per a post by Satoshi Staker, BTC ETFs saw about $240 million in inflows in the past 24 hours, though it was not enough to counter the outflows. The aggressive dumping by US entities made any reversal difficult, as other jurisdictions also mirrored this behavior. The chances of a market reversal were low, as selling pressure extended across Asia and the European Union. Over the past week, Bitcoin’s Cumulative Return By Session fell from roughly +3% to -4%, reflecting growing bearish momentum. Bearish sentiment intensified, with sellers dominating each session. On the 6th of November, sell orders far outweighed ETF inflows, effectively wiping out buy-side demand. Source: Velo This sentiment was reflected in Polymarket’s prediction markets about “What price will Bitcoin hit in November?” The chances of BTC dipping to $95,000 rose to 48%, while the odds of a decline to $90,000 now stand at 24%. Meanwhile, chances of BTC climbing to $115,000 or higher have fallen, averaging between 2% and 8%. Overall market sentiment remains tilted toward selling, likely influenced by the AI bubble, record job cuts, and the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. In addition, global tariff tensions have added further pressure on Bitcoin and other crypto assets. As the odds of a reversal continue to shrink, the CVD divergences could hint at when to anticipate one. According to Hyblock Capital data, whenever selling exceeded buying on shorter timeframes, prices tended to close higher, and vice versa. Source: Hyblock Capital Altogether, Bitcoin was undergoing massive sell pressure across the globe, explaining the current weakness. Therefore, a recovery could happen only when bids outweighed asks and aggressive selling halted.

Title: You can’t sit down! Peloton warns 900,000 customers to stop using bikes following reports of seat posts breaking and falling off

Like this site? Help us to make it better. We’re not sure if anyone working at Peloton is a fan of early 60s doo-wop group The Dovells. But if they are, the American band’s 1963 hit ‘You Can’t Sit Down’ would form a rather apt soundtrack for the fitness brand’s offices this week. On Thursday, Peloton issued a voluntary recall notice for almost 900,000 of its Original Series Bike+ models, following reports of a seat post defect which causes it to break and fall off, potentially resulting in, the company says, “injury risk” for users. Peloton has received three reports of the seat posts breaking and detaching during use, and two reports of injuries as a result of falls. Approximately 833,000 models have since been recalled in the US, while 44,800 bikes sold in Canada may also be affected, though Peloton says it is yet to receive any reports of seat posts breaking from its Canadian customers. The American company has warned users affected by the recall to stop using the Original Series Bike+ model immediately, while offering customers a free replacement seat post, which can be self-installed at home. > Peloton set to charge customers £70 for using second-hand bikes, as brand’s sales finally rise by 0.2%, prompting shares to surge months after large-scale redundancies and restructuring The recall applies to Original Series Bike+ models manufactured in Taiwan between December 2019 and July 2022, which were sold in the United States and Canada from January 2020 to April 2025. The bikes were sold by Peloton directly, as well as through third-party retailers such as eBay, Amazon, and Dick’s Sporting Goods, retailing at $2,495. Peloton says the affected models can be identified by the PL02 model number and a serial number beginning with the letter ‘T’, on the label located inside the front fork, behind the front fork, or behind the flywheel. “The integrity of our products and our members’ well-being are our top priorities,” Marcio Oliveira, Peloton’s senior vice president of Global Hardware Operations and Product Safety, said in a statement. “The recall is due to the fact that the Original Series Bike+ seat post assembly can break during use, posing fall and injury hazards to the user. “Peloton has received three reports of seat posts breaking out of approximately 833,000 units sold in the US. Peloton has received no reports of a seat post breaking, out of 44,800 units sold in Canada. “We are taking this opportunity to make replacement seat posts available to all affected Bike Plus users and we encourage them to contact us to receive the redesigned seat post as soon as possible.” > Peloton reports a defect in its bike seats after users report injuries, also announces ninth straight quarter of loss This latest recall comes over two years after Peloton issued an even larger recall notice concerning a faulty seat post, following the indentation of a defect in its Original Series PL-01 model, affecting 2.2 million of its entry-level bikes. That recall, issued in May 2023, came after 35 reports from users that the seat post was vulnerable to breaking at the weld joint, leading to 13 injuries, one customer sustaining a fractured wrist, cuts, and bruises. Last year, we reported that, after a turbulent period characterised by restructuring, a curtailed retailed presence, and a series of layoffs, Peloton saw its first sales increase in nine quarters, beating analysts’ estimates and sending shares surging as much as 41 per cent. That rare bit of positive news came as the American fitness company controversially confirmed that it will start charging customers a £72 “activation fee” when they buy one of their exercise bikes second-hand. In May 2024, at the same time CEO Barry McCarthy stepped down, 15 per cent of Peloton’s workforce (around 400 people) was made redundant in another round of cuts. This latest cull, McCarthy claimed, was necessary to bring the New York-based brand’s spending in line with its revenue, following three years of continuous losses thanks to sales of connected indoor fitness equipment plummeting as Covid-era restrictions eased.

ETF Upside sat down with Tuttle to discuss his approach to ETFs and what has him so interested in alien technology. Griffin Kelly griffin@thedailyupside.com Matthew Tuttle isn’t necessarily looking to be in most portfolios. In fact, he said his company’s strategies are better fits for clients seeking high risks and high rewards, and they often speak more directly to Reddit day traders with Robinhood accounts than moms and pops with IRAs. Tuttle Capital Management has a slew of 2x single-stock funds, and tries to avoid strong correlation with major indexes. It’s also not afraid to bet on out-of-this-world ideas. “The S&P 500 is great, but launching an S&P 500 fund is never going to work from our standpoint,” Tuttle said. ETF Upside sat down with Tuttle recently to discuss his approach to ETFs, what happens when a fund doesn’t work out and what has him so interested in alien technology. ETF Upside: What’s the philosophy behind your ETFs? Matt Tuttle: I’m an active trader, so a good idea is something I would buy. I’m not going to launch a product that I wouldn’t touch with a 10-foot pole. It’s also got to be something that I can market. My space is with self-directed investors and some independent advisors. I can’t compete with BlackRock, so I’m never getting into Merrill Lynch, UBS or anything like that. A fund needs to be different from what’s already out there. Being first is huge, especially for us. BlackRock can be 10th, and it doesn’t matter. For me, we’ve got to be first. If we’re not first, I’m probably not interested. The UFO Disclosure AI Powered ETF turned some heads. What prompted filing for that fund? This is something I’ve been fascinated with since I was a kid. Where that fascination turned into a product started in 2017 when The New York Times broke a story about a secret Pentagon group that was tracking UFOs. They provided footage of fighter pilots chasing these Tic Tac things that moved in ways that theoretically are impossible. Everyone’s asking, “Are they aliens? Are they Chinese? Are they this or that?” which are all great questions. But I’m looking at that and saying, “What energy source are they using?” We’ve been having these Congressional meetings where people are testifying, saying we are reverse-engineering some of this technology. This topic has so much disinformation in it that it’s hard to know what to believe, but if that technology were to ever surface, it would be a game-changer. I was trading in the early days of the internet. I’m now actively trading AI stocks. If a source of free energy were made available, it would be the biggest thing ever, so I filed an ETF for it. I had serious people, not the tinfoil hat people, but serious people reaching out to me — people high up in big investment firms, reporters, venture capitalists, academics, those who had been in the defense industry — saying this was really cool and the tech exists. Also, if we’re ever going to get the truth, I think this [Trump] administration is going to be the one that does it. You’ve filed for and issued a lot of single-stock or single-asset funds. What advantages do you see in those? We’ve really created an ecosystem with them. When we first started doing this, it was Tesla and Nvidia, and that was it. But now there’s more and more money going into more and more stocks, and post-covid, that market has gotten more thematic. There’s a group of stocks today that I think people would call meme stocks, but I don’t like that. Yesterday’s meme stocks were AMC and GameStop, which were crap companies that hedge funds would short, rightfully so. But then a bunch of retail investors banded together to crush the hedge funds. Now you’ve got a bunch of companies that are positioned to take off tomorrow. You could argue these are companies that don’t have any earnings, but they’re also positioned at the forefront of where the world is going. A lot of these stocks are not crap companies, they’re just early. Covid changed everything because you had these guys working from home, no boss over their shoulders, and they started trading stocks. They got fed up with just putting their money in the S&P 500 and earning 8% to 12% a year. They started connecting on social media, and they’re a powerful force. I just got back from Korea, and they love this stuff. You’re not allowed to gamble in Korea, so I think this is their gambling. There’s also a lot of places where people can’t buy Bitcoin, but they can buy a 2x long in MicroStrategy, so that’s what they do as the alternative. There’s a lot going on that has contributed to the rise of these 2X long single-stocks. What happens when an ETF just doesn’t work out and has to fold? It’s part of the game. As long as I have the vision of getting the fund to $15 million, I’m going to launch something. But sometimes, that doesn’t come to pass. The one that really bothered me was the inverse [Jim] Cramer fund. A lot of it was timing. If I had come out with it in 2022, we’d have billions of dollars in it, and it would’ve been awesome. I came out with it in 2023 a few months before Nvidia shared its earnings, showed the world AI is here, and the Mag 7 basically quadrupled. Everything else he calls turns to crap, but he got the Mag 7 right, and he wasn’t moving off of it. I can’t have an inverse Cramer fund and be intellectually honest about it when my personal account is loaded to the gills with the Mag 7. That one sucked. I really wanted to make it work. The company, which is planning to add mutual fund share classes to some of its ETFs, recently rebranded and put the State Street name on many ETFs while taking SPDR off of some. More than half of millennial ETF investors told Schwab that they can and will outperform boring old index funds. While far from the biggest ETFs on the market, spaced-themed funds are skyrocketing in 2025. ETFs that focus on clean energy investments in the US and globally have been outperforming the wider market this year, and by no small margin. The success of money market funds and their ETF counterparts has coincided with low interest rates and an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Net flows of ETFs reached yet another record last month, and actively managed products also captured more market share. The pace of ETF launches and fund conversions is picking up, but there is a challenge to find shelf space at broker-dealers. Nearly a dozen ex-China funds have launched since 2023. Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners, along with venture capital firm General Catalyst, is trying to buy Janus Henderson, and an AI makeover could be in its future. Investors who want in on Alpha Architect’s next 351 exchange ETF no longer need at least $1 million — as long as their account is at Charles Schwab. The legacy mutual fund provider has filed for a crypto index fund, bringing TradFi and DeFi one step closer together. Pictet Asset Management, which oversees $800 billion, recently launched three ETFs that lean on AI, with plans to add two emerging markets strategies early next year. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: How Tesla has prepared to defend Musk's mega pay package from legal challenges

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Tesla won the war for Elon Musk's $1 trillion pay package. Now it's prepared to win future legal battles. Shareholders voted to approve the record-breaking compensation plan by a 75% margin on Thursday, paving the way for Musk to become the world's first trillionaire should he meet a series of ambitious product and financial goals. It came after the Tesla CEO's previous $56 billion pay package, which was approved by Tesla shareholders in 2018 and again in 2024, was struck down by a Delaware judge last year following an investor lawsuit. Since then, Tesla has made a series of moves to ensure Musk's $1 trillion payday doesn't suffer the same fate. The EV giant has relocated its legal home from Delaware to Texas after gaining shareholder approval for the move at its 2024 annual meeting. In May, the Lone Star State passed SB 29 and SB 1057, two bills that make it much harder for small shareholders to bring legal challenges against companies. Under SB 29, litigants must now prove in a lawsuit that a company's directors are not acting in good faith and that they have engaged in fraud or violated the law. The bill also introduced a new rule that shareholders have to own at least 3% of the company's shares to bring legal action, also known as a derivative lawsuit. The threshold is not automatically applied to companies, but Tesla incorporated it into its bylaws in May. Only Musk himself and a handful of large, institutional investors, including BlackRock and Vanguard Group, own more than 3% of Tesla — and although shareholders can club together, $42 billion worth of shares is a high bar to meet. By contrast, the lawsuit that led to the Delaware Court of Chancery's ruling on Musk's previous pay package was bought by Richard Tornetta, a former heavy-metal drummer who owned just nine Tesla shares at the time. The judge in the Tornetta case ruled that Musk was too close to some of Tesla's board members for them to act independently, and that Tesla's board did not do enough to justify how it arrived at the package's $56 billion figure. Legal professors told Business Insider that it would be far more difficult for shareholders to bring legal challenges against Musk's new pay package in Texas. "I think that it would be a very hard road to challenge this in court," said William Magnuson, a professor of law at Texas A&M University, citing the changes to Texas law that have granted heightened legal protection for company directors. "All of these really have greatly limited the ability of shareholders to challenge misbehavior by boards of directors," he said. James Spindler, a corporate and securities law professor at the University of Texas, agreed. He said that while Tesla shareholders could still challenge the level of disclosure surrounding the pay package under Texas law, as Tornetta did in Delaware, the 3% standing threshold made the prospect of a similar lawsuit unlikely. "For a public company, that's probably going to be the end of the matter. When you're talking about a multibillion-dollar company, there just aren't going to be that many people that own 3% of the shares," Spinder added. After a Delaware court struck down his last pay package, Musk urged other companies to leave the state, and several have followed Tesla and SpaceX's lead. The Diamond state has since tweaked its corporate law provisions to make it harder for small shareholders to bring derivative lawsuits. Delaware's move came as states like Texas and Nevada attempt to woo big companies with their own director-friendly regulations, and Magnuson said that companies are increasingly seeking to move to states with "friendlier" corporate law statutes that place more limits on shareholder's rights. "I think that we're at the beginning of a real sea change in the way that corporate law works," he added. Jump to

Title: Bitcoin ETFs snap 6-day outflow streak as key trendline is back in focus

BlackRock and Fidelity led a rebound in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows on Thursday, as traders shifted their focus to the 50-week EMA at about $100,000. Key takeaways: Bitcoin ETFs recorded $240 million in inflows on Thursday, ending a six-day outflow streak. Bitcoin’s failure to drop below the 50-day EMA suggests strong support in this area. Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) ended a six-day outflow streak with inflows returning on Thursday, leading traders to say they believe that a recovery is imminent as long as the BTC price holds the 50-week EMA. US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs ended a six-day streak of net outflows on Thursday, with $240 million in daily inflows. The outflow streak started on Oct. 29 and extended through Wednesday, with the biggest outflows comprising $577.74 million on Tuesday. Related: Crypto ETFs ‘punching above weight’ as almost half of ETF investors plan buys The streak of outflows followed a Bitcoin market correction that saw BTC price plunge below $100,000 for the first time since June. On Tuesday, the BTC/USD pair reached a four-month low of $98,900. The price had recovered 3% on Friday. The largest inflow was to BlackRock’s ETF, IBIT, at $112.4 million. Fidelity’s FBTC followed with $61.6 million, while ARK Invest’s ARKB added $60.4 million. Bitwise’s BITB posted moderate inflows of $5.5 million and $2.48 million, while the rest of the ETFs saw no inflows or outflows. Cumulative net inflows remain robust at $60.5 billion, and total net assets across all spot Bitcoin ETFs stand at $135.43 billion, accounting for 5.42% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. After dropping to $98,000 on Tuesday, Bitcoin quickly reclaimed the $100,000 psychological level, which coincided with the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA). This suggested that bulls were aggressively defending this level. Note that this trendline (yellow line in the chart below) has supported the price since September 2023, and losing it would be detrimental for the bulls. Bitcoin is “sitting right at the 50-week SMA, the line in the sand,” wrote YouTuber Lark Davis in a Thursday post on X, adding: “So far Bitcoin is still holding the 50-week EMA,” pseudonymous technical analyst Chad said, adding that it is important for the BTC/USD pair to close the week above this level. Fellow analyst Rekt Capital wrote that Bitcoin appears to be bottoming out around the 50-day EMA and must make a “cluster of lower lows” at this level to establish a bottom. As Cointelegraph reported, the MVRV ratio (market value to realized value) suggested $98,000 may have indeed marked the local bottom for BTC, suggesting that the price can recover due to seller exhaustion.

Title: They got laid off from the Microsoft country club and dumped into a hellish job market

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After 31 years at Microsoft, Mike Kostersitz never saw it coming. In May, his team met with a senior leader about a new product. "Everybody was happy with the progress," said Kostersitz, then a principal product manager lead working on Microsoft's cloud computing platform Azure. "Everything was peachy." The following morning, he noticed a high-priority virtual meeting had been added to his calendar — and it wasn't good news. "Me and 120 other anonymous faces got told our jobs had been eliminated," said the Washington-based 60-year-old. His manager and two of his direct reports were also among the 6,000 employees affected. In July, roughly 9,000 more were laid off. Previously, in January and February, Microsoft had made nearly 2,000 performance-based cuts. I spoke with seven of the Microsoft workers who lost their jobs over the past 12 months. Microsoft was once known for its "country club" culture, but as Ashley Stewart reported for Business Insider earlier this year, leaders worried the company had gone soft, and it ramped up scrutiny on performance. Inside Business is today's must-read story on what the forces shaping business, tech, and innovation mean for you. Each piece delivers insights to help you make smarter career, money, and life decisions. A Microsoft spokesperson has said that most of this year's cuts were not performance-based but were intended to reduce management layers and streamline operations. Along with Amazon, Meta, and Google, Microsoft is one of many companies — from Silicon Valley to corporate America — that are fueling the Great Flattening. The tenure of the ex-Microsofters I spoke to ranged from a few years to more than three decades. Some said any sense of job security they once had was shattered. Several said they were caught off guard by their layoffs, citing factors like long tenure, no documented performance issues, and Microsoft's position as the world's third-most valuable company. They wondered: If job security is dead at Microsoft, will they find it anywhere else? Kostersitz is one of them. To help with his job search, he said a Microsoft-funded career advisor recommended he "de-age" his résumé by erasing work done in the 1980s and '90s. His LinkedIn profile now only shows professional experience since 2003. The advisor also emphasized that today's job market is an endurance test. "They said it's a game of chicken right now," he said. "The person who has the longer breath and can stick it out longer will get the job." Business Insider has heard from dozens of workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.

Read more on the topic: The experiences of laid-off Microsoft employees are part of a broader shift in corporate America. As Business Insider's Aki Ito has reported, job security was a defining feature of white-collar work during the postwar boom, a period when layoffs and firings were rare. However, globalization — and the overseas competition that accompanied it — gave rise to a new management philosophy focused on cost-cutting, downsizing, and viewing employees as interchangeable. It's not just about flattening. In cuts this year, companies have cited AI — if not directly for taking jobs, then for creating an environment in which companies can operate with leaner staff. It's what workers have been fearing will happen on a large scale as AI continues to improve and become increasingly omnipresent. While Microsoft's culture has evolved over the years, some laid-off employees said they believe the recent cuts show the company has entered a new era — one where avoiding layoffs appears to be a lower priority. The former Microsoft employees, in addition to dozens of other laid-off workers I've spoken with over the past year, told me they are grappling with how to protect their careers and financial well-being after an unexpected chop. Before Eduardo Noriega was laid off by Microsoft in May, he'd been nervous about his job security since 2009, when the company cut about 5,000 workers. "When I saw the layoff, I realized that job security isn't real," said Noriega, who's in his 50s and lives in Seattle. After weighing his options, Noriega concluded that his best chance at financial stability was to build a side business he could rely on if he ever lost his job. By the time he was cut in May, he'd spent nearly a decade building a staffing firm outside work hours — and was earning more from it than from his software engineering job. He said he had been hesitant to quit Microsoft and give up the steady paycheck, but the layoff gave him the push he needed to go all in. "I never dared to quit," he said. "And then Microsoft presented the layoff, and for me, that was like an exit." For other workers across corporate America, the challenge of landing a new role in today's economy has upped the stakes of sudden unemployment. While layoffs across the broader economy remain low by historical standards, white-collar roles have been particularly vulnerable. At the same time, US businesses are hiring at one of the slowest rates since 2013. "If you become unemployed, it's become much harder to find a job," said Laura Ulrich, director of economic research at the Indeed Hiring Lab. And because hiring was so much stronger in many industries just a few years ago, she said, the shift may feel especially stark. Ian Carter began working at Microsoft in 2021, and he said the company's layoffs in 2023 and 2024 sent a clear message: His job wasn't safe. "It felt like it didn't matter if you were a great worker or not," said the 33-year-old. "Everybody was at risk." Since being laid off in May from his position as a technical program manager, he has struggled to find a job. He drew on savings for several months to cover expenses and switched to a month-to-month lease on his Redmond, Washington, apartment — crossing his fingers that he'd land something soon. But he never did. In late October, he stored his belongings and moved to Florida to live with his family and save money while continuing his search. "Rent is expensive," he said, "but rent without income coming in is doubly expensive." In May, Joe Friend learned that he and 14 other members of his working group had been laid off. Friend's tenure at Microsoft spanned more than two decades across three stints, but this was the first time he hadn't left by choice. Friend said he believes there's been a culture shift within Microsoft — one that's left employees with less job security than they once had. Some of his concerns extend beyond Microsoft to Big Tech more broadly — which is why he plans to be highly selective about his next role. "I think I'd rather earn $50,000 a year doing something I'm excited about," said the 62-year-old. "It doesn't mean I won't jump back into a job, but it certainly won't be Big Tech." Deborah Hendersen took a different approach. After 14 years at Microsoft, Hendersen, a user researcher in the company's Xbox division, was one of about 9,000 employees laid off in July. "It wasn't so much like watching a car wreck," said the 45-year-old, who lives in Seattle. "It was more like you were in the car, knowing it was going to wreck." The moment she received a mysterious meeting invite that she suspected would bring bad news, she began laying the groundwork for her future. She shared a message internally and on LinkedIn to tell her network that she'd been laid off and to learn who else had been affected. This led to the creation of a Discord chat of more than a dozen affected colleagues, where people shared job opportunities, helped each other prepare for interviews, vented their frustrations, and celebrated their successes. Hendersen also turned to her network to find openings and secure referrals. One of the roles recommended to her was a user experience researcher position at Meta. She received a referral and, in late August, a job offer. Hendersen credited her network — and in particular her laid-off colleagues — for supporting her during this challenging period. "It's so helpful to have the support of other people who are going through it — both the highs and the lows," she said. "Because everybody gets turned down, gets their hopes up, and is just figuring out how to remain sane in a really challenging time." Jump to

Title: Is the job market getting worse? As the shutdown continues, this is what we know

Time Published: 2025-11-07T10:00:00Z

Scott Horsley The government shutdown has delayed a report on the October job market. That leaves policymakers looking for other signals about the pace of hiring and firing. Joe Raedle/Getty Images North America hide caption The government shutdown is again making it it hard to answer a critical question: How is the U.S. job market doing? The impasse in Congress over funding has delayed a closely-watched report on the labor market for the second month in a row. Without that official jobs tally, the available signals are mixed. This week, a big payroll processing company reported an uptick in October hiring, for example. But a consulting firm that tracks pink slips noted a big surge in layoff notices. Policymakers typically look to monthly surveys from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the broadest and most accurate snapshot of the job market. But BLS number-crunchers have been furloughed for more than five weeks, so the September and October jobs reports have not been published. "Due to the government shutdown, this is a challenging time to give an economic outlook speech," Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook told an audience at the Brookings Institution on Monday. "The longer the shutdown lasts, the more data could be disrupted." But Cook insisted she and her colleagues are not "flying blind." They look to private-sector data for signals about hiring and firing, as well as anecdotal reports from a wide range of business contacts. Workers and people looking for work do the same, as they form their own impressions of the job market — and there are signs of concern. A measure of employee sentiment from the job-search website Glassdoor found workers are less confident about the availability of jobs now than they've been in the last three months. Glassdoor users who received a job offer in October were less likely to turn it down than the previous month, suggesting that workers feel they have less leverage in the current market. "October's decline in employee confidence reflects how quickly economic uncertainty can ripple through the workforce," said Glassdoor's chief economist Daniel Zhao. "The government shutdown and mounting layoff fears have clearly shaken employee sentiment." A number of high-profile companies such as Amazon and UPS have announced widespread layoffs in recent weeks, which likely weighs on workers' confidence. The outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas says U.S. businesses announced plans to cut 153,074 jobs last month — the worst October in more than two decades. Tech firms and warehousing companies reported some of the biggest downsizing plans. "Those laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market," says Andy Challenger, chief revenue officer at the firm. State tallies of new unemployment claims have remained relatively stable, however, suggesting that there hasn't been a big spike in overall layoffs yet. On the positive side, ADP, which handles payroll for more than 26 million U.S. employees, says it counted an increase in the number of private-sector employees last month, after two months of decline. "Private employers added jobs in October for the first time since July," says ADP's chief economist Nela Richardson. At the same time, Richardson notes that "hiring was modest relative to what we reported earlier this year." A recruiter speaks with job seekers at a job fair held in Sunrise, Fl., on Sept. 25, 2025. Joe Raedle/Getty Images North America hide caption Official data from the BLS had also shown a slowdown in hiring during the summer, before the government shutdown halted its reporting. Employers added just 22,000 jobs in August — the last month for which official numbers are available. Some of the drop in job growth could be the result of having fewer available workers. Some 10,000 baby boomers retire every day. And the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement likely means there are fewer foreign-born workers in the job market. While the unemployment rate inched up to 4.3% in August, that's still quite low by historical standards. "The slightly rising unemployment rate indicates the labor market is softening, but only modestly so," Cook said Monday. She cautioned however that unemployment rates for young and African American workers jumped more sharply over the summer, which could be a warning sign. The jobless rate for workers aged 20-24 in August was 9.2% while the unemployment rate among African Americans was 7.5%. "This is sometimes called a "two-speed" economy," Cook said, "when the well-off are doing well, while [lower-income families] and vulnerable households are not." Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Ministèrede l'Agriculture,de l'Agro-Alimentaireet de la Souverainetéalimentaire 07 novembre 2025 Info + Partager la page Sommaire The Analysis Notes present, in four pages, the main points of discussion on a current topic relevant to the areas of activity of the Department of Agriculture, Agri-Food, and Food Sovereignty. Depending on the topic, they take a forward-looking, strategic, or evaluative approach. Analysis n°224 Forests are increasingly threatened by natural disturbances, which are being exacerbated by climate change. This note explores the growing risks that will emerge in the future. It details several vulnerability factors and the associated environmental and economic impacts. In an uncertain context, understanding the interplay between the various components of risk makes it possible to prioritise actions that can mitigate it. Proactive management of forest fuel or the recovery of storm-damaged timber, for instance, are measures that can help address this challenge. Forests are affected by so-called “natural” disturbances, whether biotic (e.g. pathogens) or abiotic (e.g. fires). Their occurrence may nevertheless be of anthropogenic origin, as is the case for the majority of fires in France. Climate change intensifies these disturbances and places an increasing threat on the functions of forests: timber production, carbon sequestration, biodiversity reservoir, etc. The recent multiplication of extreme events, such as the fires in France during the summer of 2022 or the wildfire events that devastated forests in the Aude department in August 2025, has heightened the visibility of these disturbances in public debate. Awareness has also grown of their role in the decline of the land carbon sink1. The concepts associated with the notion of “risk” are numerous, each carrying a specific meaning. This note clarifies the constituent elements of the risks generated by natural disturbances in forests and illustrates them with concrete cases concerning Europe (including France) and the United States. The first part defines the components of risk (hazard, asset, vulnerability) and presents trends of the future evolution of hazards for the main disturbance agents. The second part reviews some of the environmental and economic consequences of current and future disturbances. Finally, examples of practices to reduce vulnerability through forest management or organisational solutions are described. Risk is a polysemous term, defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as the potential for adverse consequences for a system to which certain values and objectives are attached2. It is a composite notion, resulting from the encounter of three components: a hazard, an element exposed to that hazard (or asset), and its vulnerability. The hazard corresponds to the physical phenomenon capable of causing harm. The notion covers both the characteristics of the event (e.g. wind speed, burnt area) and its probability of occurrence. Hazards that correspond to punctual events (e.g. fire, storm) cause catastrophic mortality, i.e. sudden and massive, in forest stands. Others have more diffuse impacts, such as droughts, which correspond to periods of thermal and/or rainfall anomalies compared to past references. The exposed element here is the forest ecosystem, which possesses use and non-use values for society and provides ecosystem services (e.g. timber production, landscape amenities). The asset corresponds to the proper ecosystem functioning of the forest. Independently of its degree of exposure, i.e. presence in a given area, a forest is characterised by a certain level of vulnerability, meaning a predisposition to being negatively impacted. It may be vulnerable due to its predisposition to damage (sensitivity) or its limited ability to adjust to and recover from damage (adaptive capacity). Figure 1 – Breakdown of the concept of risk Ce schéma montre que le risque émerge à l’intersection de trois notions : l’aléa, l’exposition et la vulnérabilité. This diagram visually represents that risk emerges at the intersection of three notions: hazard, exposure and vulnerability. Reading: risk emerges from the encounter of a hazard that affects an exposed element characterised by a certain level of vulnerability. Source : IPCC, 2022, Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability Vulnerability may be intrinsic, linked to the physiological traits of trees, the composition and structure of stands, etc.3. For instance, some species are more resistant to fires due to thicker bark, or better adapted to rapid recovery, by resprouting (e.g. oaks) or via seed banks (e.g. Aleppo pine). Conversely, a forest with a high presence of fuel (e.g. dense understorey) is more prone to high-intensity fires. Forest vulnerability may also be extrinsic, linked to forest management, spatial planning, or land use. For example, the presence of roads makes forests more accessible for prevention and firefighting, but also more exposed to fire outbreaks caused by humans. Similarly, the existence of a monitoring system enables earlier detection of pathogen invasions. Climate change increases risk by worsening disturbance regimes (the hazard component), in other words by altering the frequency, intensity and seasonality of disturbance events and the areas they affect. These effects may be direct, for example when water stress due to lack of rainfall and longer, more intense periods of high temperatures weaken trees. They may also be indirect, particularly when new pathogens migrate and become viable (e.g. pine processionary caterpillar) or when endemic species enter epidemic phases (e.g. spruce bark beetle). Between the periods 1950–2000 and 2001–2019, damage caused by natural disturbances increased by 17% in Europe. Storms accounted for 46% of damage across both periods, followed by fires (24%), bark beetles (17%), other biotic agents (8%, e.g. diseases such as ash dieback and chestnut blight), and abiotic agents (8%, e.g. drought, snow). The increase in damage has been particularly marked in recent years for fires and bark beetles (Figure 2). The latter were responsible for 50% of the timber harvest in Germany in 2021. In France, in Bourgogne-Franche-Comté, 30,000 hectares of coniferous forests containing spruces (18% of the regional total) were destroyed or harvested between 2018 and 2022 due to bark beetle attacks. Since 2023, the crisis has affected all altitudinal levels of the Jura massif, including above 1,000 m4. Droughts, meanwhile, affected 0.5 million hectares of forests between 1987 and 2016 in Europe, and four of the five most severe events occurred after 20005. Figure 2 – Annual damage due to natural forest disturbances in Europe, 1950–2019 Ce graphique représente l’évolution des dommages en forêt causés par plusieurs catégories de perturbations naturelles, de 1950 à 2019. On voit que ceux-ci ont fortement augmenté au cours du temps. This graph shows the evolution of forest damage caused by several categories of natural disturbances, from 1950 to 2019. It illustrates the strong increase in damage over time. Source : Patacca M. et al. 2022, “Significant increase in natural disturbance impacts on European forests since 1950”, Global Change Biology Southern Europe could, during the 21st century, experience a 40 to 100% increase in annual burnt area. The fire season could lengthen by 20 days, and the probability of “megafires” increase tenfold6, 7. Temperate and boreal regions would also be affected, albeit to a lesser extent. In France, fire risk is expected to rise particularly sharply in the West and along the Mediterranean coastline8. For a +4 °C warming by the end of the century, the fire season would last 131 days and fires would affect 67% of the south-eastern quarter of the country, compared with 78 days and 28% at present9. Climate change accelerates the development cycle of pathogens and extends the areas favourable to them. The main epidemic currently underway is that of the spruce bark beetle. In western Europe, the damage it causes could be six times higher in 2021–2030 compared with 1971–201010. Storms are rare and complex events that are difficult to model. Climate change could increase wind speeds and make extreme events more common. In central Europe, a storm that is currently expected once a century could see its return period shortened to around 70 years by 210011. The different hazards interact with one another. For example, a forest damaged by a storm is more vulnerable to pathogens, and a drought increases the likelihood of fires. These interactions are expected to intensify under climate change, particularly with regard to biotic risks, making it necessary to adopt a “multi-hazard” perspective12. The occurrence of a hazard directly alters the structure and composition of the forest, as well as the ecosystem services it provides. In the short term, many trees may be destroyed or damaged, and biogeochemical cycles and habitats disrupted. The reorganisation phase that follows immediately after the hazard is crucial13, as it is when the communities that will make up the future forest establish themselves. Several outcomes are possible, ranging from full resilience (same composition and structure) to transition towards a non-forest state (in the case of major and/or repeated hazards), with intermediate states also possible. Biodiversity is affected through the impacts of disturbances on habitats. An affected area may see its species richness (number of species present) increase, decrease or remain stable14. This ambiguous relationship varies depending on the species and the dynamics of disturbances. Negative impacts often concern species that favour closed canopies (e.g. lichens), while others depend on disturbances to survive and establish themselves in open environments. The highest biodiversity levels, at landscape scale, are observed for disturbances of medium severity and size. Conversely, extreme events are generally harmful due to their tendency to homogenise habitats over large areas. The disappearance of a particular species may also be caused by certain hazards (e.g. pathogen affecting a specific tree species, such as ash dieback). A global meta-analysis has shown a negative impact of disturbances on most ecosystem services, particularly carbon sequestration. Soil quality and organic content, timber production and water quality are also affected15. Fires, for instance, increase soil erosion, reduce the recreational value of forests, and cause carbon emissions and release volatile compounds that can affect human health. According to a recent estimate, the three main disturbance agents in Europe (storms, fires, bark beetles) currently threaten the provision of forest ecosystem services by 10.4 to 12.3%. In total, 20 million hectares of forest (9.7% of the total area) would see their multifunctionality threatened, particularly in central and western Europe (Figure 3). Figure 3 – Areas affected by high risk of loss of forest ecosystem services in Europe Cette figure comporte des cartes qui montrent où sont situées, en Europe, les forêts dont les services écosystémiques sont le plus menacés par les perturbations naturelles. Les cartes concernent la production de bois, le stockage de carbone, la protection contre l’érosion et l’usage récréatif. This figure contains maps showing where, in Europe, forests have ecosystem services most threatened by natural disturbances. The maps relate to timber production, carbon storage, protection against erosion and recreational use. Reading: the coloured areas correspond to those most affected (beyond the 8th decile) by the risk to the ecosystem service considered. Other areas are also affected, but the level of risk is lower. Source : Lecina Diaz, J., et al., 2024, “Ecosystem services at risk from disturbance in Europe’s forests”, Global Change Biology Natural hazards pose risks to timber production and the wood industry. A major crisis, such as a storm, causes in the short term an influx of lower-quality timber on the market, reducing prices and disrupting trade16. Later, the damage causes a reduction in timber supply and pressure on prices (which rise), potentially lasting for several decades. In the Czech Republic, the 2018 bark beetle crisis caused an increase of 5.3 to 18 million m³ (+340%) in salvaged damaged timber compared with 2017, leading to a drop in timber prices from €55/m³ to €15/m³ (–73%)17. Disturbances also affect the value of forest land. For example, it decreased by an average of 10% between 1984–2003 and 2001–2020 in western US states, due to the multiplication of fires and droughts. Even unburnt areas are affected, to a lesser extent, through a change in risk perception by buyers18. Hazards also pose a risk of non-permanence for carbon stocks mobilised to mitigate climate change. In Europe, in the future, carbon losses linked to natural disturbances could be of the same order of magnitude as the gains expected from forest management aimed at mitigating climate change19. Due to the inherent uncertainty of meteorological phenomena, the forest carbon sink may vary greatly from year to year20. For example, Storm Vaia alone reduced Italy’s forest carbon sink by 4% in 201821. Recovering damaged timber for industry nevertheless makes it possible to transfer part of the carbon to downstream sectors, partially mitigating these consequences. The introduction of new pests could cause further degradation of the carbon sink. Seidl et al.22 estimate that 10% of European forest carbon would be exposed to five major new pests in Europe by 2080 under a high-warming scenario (RCP 8.5). An invasion by these pests would increase carbon losses due to natural hazards from +2.3% (for beech canker) to +50% (for the Asian longhorn beetle, which attacks several hardwood species). Beyond the direct mortality due to hazards, the decline of the carbon sink may also be attributed to the loss of photosynthetic activity by dying trees (Figure 4). Figure 4 – Breakdown of the decline of the French forest carbon sink between 2010 and 2020 Ce diagramme montre l’évolution du puits de carbone forestier en France de 2010 à 2020. On y voit que sa forte baisse est principalement due aux impacts du changement climatique, et notamment aux dépérissements dus aux perturbations naturelles. This diagram shows the evolution of the forest carbon sink in France from 2010 to 2020. It illustrates that its sharp decline is mainly due to the impacts of climate change, in particular dieback caused by natural disturbance. Source : Secrétariat général à la planification écologique, 2023 1 Direct action on hazards is often difficult, but risk can be reduced by lowering the vulnerability of exposed forests. Interventions are possible at different levels. Two examples are presented here: fuel management and the recovery of damaged timber. Many other measures, which we do not develop here, can also contribute to reducing vulnerability: diversification of forest composition and structure, enhanced monitoring, raising awareness among local stakeholders, etc. In forests, the presence of fuel in the understorey (e.g. low vegetation, branches) increases the risk of fire. It raises the probability of fire outbreaks and their ability to intensify and spread. When fuel is dry and continuous, the risk is even greater. Removing this vegetation preventively reduces forest vulnerability, particularly by lowering sensitivity, while also affecting the hazard component. This is, for example, the aim of the legal obligations for clearing undergrowth. These apply, in 43 French departments, to land located within 200 m of forest areas, within a radius of 50 m around buildings. These “wildland-urban” interface zones are particularly vulnerable, due to the high potential for fire outbreaks and the presence of buildings, people and economic activities. Similar measures exist elsewhere, for instance in Catalonia, Spain. In some regions, grazing is used to reduce fuel, through payments for environmental services23. A recent study assessed the impact of forest fuel management in California, where fires caused average annual damage estimated at $117 billion between 2017 and 202124. By 2050, the increase in fire intensity could be offset by the annual treatment of 240,000 hectares. The current target is to treat 400,000 hectares, which would avoid losses of $10.9 billion for an estimated annual cost of $3 billion, while each year of delay in achieving this target would lead to $4 billion in losses. However, according to the economists behind the study, the optimal area to treat to maximise benefits would be 1.6 million hectares per year, four times higher than the current target. Fuel can also be deliberately burnt preventively. Prescribed burning is a preventive measure that reduces the fuel load to prevent fire outbreaks. In France, it is planned by the State, local authorities or their representatives, and carried out by professionals. This practice also helps to maintain the good condition of certain ecosystems. Another solution, tactical fires and backfires, are firefighting techniques used during a blaze. They aim to channel the fire and support firefighting personnel. When storms occur, they generate a sudden influx of damaged timber. Recovering it enables owners to generate income, which is then reinvested in forest management. Being able to commercialise this “crisis timber” improves the adaptive capacity of forests. Conversely, leaving such timber on site increases the likelihood of another crisis (e.g. disease, fire outbreak), raising the sensitivity (and therefore vulnerability) of the stand to potential cascading hazards. Following a major crisis, wood recovery may be coordinated and supported by the State. It mainly involves two methods: storing timber for later processing locally; or exporting it to other regions25. These interventions help to ease pressure on local markets and smooth out negative economic impacts (e.g. price falls). First, an assessment of the damage must be carried out to prioritise operations. Rapid intervention is particularly necessary in the case of disease, to avoid its spread and timber degradation. During storage, timber health can be stabilised by treating it once removed from the forest (heat treatment, fumigation) and by ensuring proper storage conditions (ventilation, distance from forest, contact with the ground). A timber mobilisation plan was implemented in France following Storm Klaus (2009), which destroyed 42.5 million m³ of timber, mainly in the Aquitaine region. It included direct support for timber storage (creation and rehabilitation of storage areas) and transport outside the region, for a total of €126 million. Ultimately, 55% of the 29.5 million m³ of timber harvested post-storm benefited from direct aid. An economic model26 showed that this plan encouraged storage (+25%), accelerated and increased timber recovery (+33%), although it did not prevent the fall in prices (–60% for maritime pine). Over ten years, the plan is estimated to have generated an economic gain of €44 million for the forest-wood sector. An even more storage-focused strategy would have been more beneficial but would have slowed the recovery of prices, to the detriment of local producers. In the future, more damaged timber will be available due to the worsening of disturbance regimes. A recent foresight study27 emphasises the importance of anticipating this dynamic, not only for the economic aspects mentioned above, but also for maintaining the forest carbon sink. Upstream, it will be necessary to increase proactive harvesting of declining timber and prioritise it, in crisis years, over standard harvesting. Downstream, processing and storage capacities will need to be increased. Innovation will also be a key factor, in order to make better use of downgraded timber and, where possible, direct it towards long-life uses (e.g. construction), which are more beneficial from a climate perspective. The vulnerability of forests to natural disturbances, exacerbated by climate change, is a crucial issue for the management of forest ecosystems. This note has clarified the components of risk, distinguishing hazard, vulnerability and the assets associated with forests. Concrete examples show that forests are increasingly exposed to multiple hazards, particularly in Europe, with varied effects on ecosystem services, the forest economy and biodiversity. Adaptation strategies, such as fuel management and the recovery of damaged timber, can mitigate these impacts by reducing forest vulnerability. In the future, the development of a multi-hazard approach and proactive management practices will be crucial. To this end, it will be necessary to rely on clear conceptual frameworks in order to target the different components of risk appropriately. However, uncertainties remain about the complex interactions between the different hazards and the scale of future changes. Further research is needed to refine our knowledge, particularly regarding the impacts of extreme events. Other elements beyond forests are exposed, and potentially vulnerable, to the hazards discussed here. These include populations (fires can harm health through air pollution) and infrastructure (transport, housing, etc.). Any strategy for adapting to “forest” hazards must therefore be cross-sectoral and systemic, looking beyond the forest itself and considering these multiple components.

Title: There's no jobs report today, but here's what private data is telling us about the labor market

Every time Madison publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Economists, journalists, and investors won't be waiting by their laptops this morning for a new jobs report. It's the second month without this data release. The agency isn't releasing most reports or collecting data during the government shutdown, which is the longest one in US history. However, job seekers, economists, and anyone else missing the BLS reports can turn to recent publications from ADP, Indeed, Bank of America, and others to get a sense of how the job market and broader economy are doing. The analyses showed that October was still a tough month for job seekers. Announced job cuts climbed based on a report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas; demand cooled to a level not seen in years based on job postings on Indeed; and various reports together show a soft job market. Allison Shrivastava, an economist with the Indeed Hiring Lab, told Business Insider it's lucky that there are a lot of private sector data releases to "piece together a picture of what's going on in the economy." However, she added that even those alternative sources often rely on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to calibrate their work, so without it, job-market clarity is muddied. Here's what recent releases said about October's job market. Based on ADP payroll data, the US added 42,000 private sector jobs in October after falling in the previous two months. Despite beating the 32,000 consensus, Nela Richardson, the chief economist at ADP, said in the news release that hiring was modest. Most of the net growth came from large companies that have at least 500 employees. Job growth was mixed by industry. Trade, transportation, and utilities together added 47,000 jobs. Employment dipped in information, manufacturing, professional and business services, and leisure and hospitality. Bill Adams, the chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in commentary that the federal layoffs — which aren't included in the ADP national employment report — would pretty much cancel out the private employment growth in October. Many government workers aren't working during the government shutdown and are missing pay. Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that announced job cuts from US-based employers skyrocketed over the month to the highest October total since 2003 — increasing from 54,064 to 153,074 this past October. Last month's gain means over 1 million announced cuts so far this year, more than the roughly 761,000 cuts for the entire previous year. "Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes," Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer, said in the report. Ernie Tedeschi, a nonresident senior fellow at The Budget Lab at Yale, recently told Business Insider that companies like Amazon, which announced a reduction of 14,000 corporate workers, are likely correcting for overhiring during the pandemic-era and Great Resignation. Shrivastava told Business Insider the US is in a precarious, not dangerous situation based on the platform's data. Job postings trended downward last month, hitting the lowest point since 2021. "Things have been kind of eroding slowly," Shrivastava said. "Not a lot of job growth added, still really difficult to break into the labor market, people still really holding onto their jobs." It's not just employees sitting still; Shrivastava said employers have mainly been holding onto workers. Despite new cuts making news, BLS data up to August showed US layoff rates have been low for years — the 2021 to 2025 average of 1.0% is a hair below the 2015 to 2019 average of 1.2%. Shrivastava said a surge in layoffs would "be kind of the thing that tips the tower over." Kory Kantenga, the head of economics for the Americas at LinkedIn, said in a post that October hiring wasn't too far off from September, although it did fall 0.8% and down from the start of the year. The number of job openings per applicant has also been cooling, and dropped 1% over the month. Kantenga said in the post that both supply and demand have dropped. "The job market has been running slow, it's continuing to run slow," Kantenga told Business Insider. "There just isn't a lot of momentum across the board." Kantenga told Business Insider that job seekers need to be open to industries that are still hiring, such as healthcare and construction. "There are areas where things have actually started to turn around, but they're not yet where they need to be for there to be a lot of opportunities," Kantenga said. "Technology, information, and media is one." The Bank of America Institute said there was "​​no significant further slowdown in the labor market" last month based on internal data on how many of the bank's customers are getting paychecks. "While this data does suggest a slowdown in jobs growth has taken place since the summer, it tends to suggest that for now at least, there is no further deceleration," the new report said. Unemployment payments were up from a year ago, but the report said the growth rate cooled slightly from September. Across the board, households had higher pay than a year ago, but higher-income households had the highest rise. Gusto, a payroll and benefits platform for small businesses, found that the hiring rate and quits rate at those businesses cooled in October. Net hires at small businesses also fell by 5,900, the first drop since January. Average hourly earnings are also up a little bit from a year ago. "We're witnessing a significant shift in small business hiring patterns," Andrew Chamberlain, the principal economist at Gusto, said, adding there's essentially no job growth happening compared to the growth during the post-pandemic recovery. "The culprits are clear: persistently high borrowing costs that keep business loans at 7-15%, ongoing tariff uncertainty that makes planning nearly impossible, and elevated operating expenses across the board," he said. More rate cuts could help business owners. The Fed cut rates in September and October after holding rates steady throughout 2025. Chamberlain said Gusto expects a rebound "as the Fed starts to relax interest rates in the coming year." Jump to

Title: Robinhood’s Crypto Revenue Miss Tempers Solid Quarter: JPMorgan

Wall Street bank JPMorgan (JPM) called Robinhood’s (HOOD) third-quarter results solid but lower quality, as weaker crypto revenue and tax benefits drove much of the earnings beat. The bank said the roughly 15% earnings per share (EPS) beat was mostly due to a lower tax rate tied to stock-based compensation from the 52% rise in the share price, in a report published Thursday. Analysts led by Kenneth Worthington expect the trading platform's margins to keep improving and raised their price target on the shares to $130 from $122, while reiterating their neutral rating on the stock. The shares slumped 11% yesterday, closing around $127. Crypto was the main drag, with net revenue of $268 million missing both Street and JPMorgan estimates, sending shares lower despite strong volume growth. The bank said Robinhood’s crypto fee rate slipped to 67 basis points from an expected 68, as management continues to adjust pricing. Prediction markets offset some weakness, though the analysts cautioned that the segment depends on a small group of active traders.

Title: Vodafone and AST SpaceMobile Announce New EU Satellite Constellation and Select Germany for European Sovereign Satellite Operations Centre

Time Published: 2025-11-07T07:00:00Z

November 07, 2025 02:00 ET | Source: Vodafone Group PLC Vodafone Group PLC London London LONDON, Nov. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vodafone Group and AST SpaceMobile Inc. (NASDAQ: ASTS) have selected Germany as the location for their main Satellite Operations Centre. The centre will allocate, and map satellite connectivity used by SatCo to serve mobile network operators (MNOs) across Europe to ensure ubiquitous mobile broadband in underserved areas and support emergency services and disaster relief agencies. It will be located near either Munich or Hannover, depending on final negotiations with all relevant parties. AST SpaceMobile is building the first and only space-based cellular broadband network accessible directly by everyday smartphones, designed for both commercial and government applications. SatCo aims to provide a scalable European satellite mobile broadband service for use by MNOs to benefit all European citizens, businesses and public sector organisations. MNOs in 21 European Union (EU) member states and other European countries have expressed interest in adopting the service, with commercial launch planned to commence from 2026. The planned EU constellation will include a comprehensive ‘command switch’ feature to support European oversight and security. This capability supports updating all telemetry, tracking, and control (TTC) encryption keys for both S-Band (used to connect smartphones from space) and Q/V-Band (used for links between satellites and earth stations). It also allows for the modification of service encryption keys for communications across the continent, as well as manages the activation, deactivation, and direction of satellite beams in Europe. In addition to commercial mobile broadband, the constellation will support public protection and disaster relief efforts (PPDR). It does this by providing reliable, broadband-speed connectivity from space directly to the everyday smartphones and other cellular devices of emergency responders, even in the most dangerous and challenging environments. Margherita Della Valle, CEO of Vodafone, said: “SatCo delivers a sovereign satellite solution to the whole of Europe. It will give European operators access to secure and resilient satellite communications, complementing existing terrestrial telecommunications networks. By establishing a satellite constellation in the EU and our principal command centre in Germany, we are ensuring the next frontier of communications infrastructure is firmly embedded in Europe.” “Together with Vodafone, we are accelerating the arrival of true mobile broadband from space across Europe,” said Abel Avellan, Founder, Chairman and CEO of AST SpaceMobile. “Germany’s Operations Centre will be the operations hub for our BlueBird constellation in Europe, enabling us to serve millions of users. Alongside our gateways, we are building a robust, secure infrastructure that ensures Europe stays connected with seamless mobile broadband, always.” The planned satellite constellation can also contribute to the development of a pan-European mobile broadband system, enhancing the communication and coordination of emergency services during crises and disasters, in line with the EU Critical Communication System (EUCCS) vision. In particular, the satellites will support frequency bands that are suitable for PPDR radio communications, subject to national decisions and deployment choices. While many functions are automated, specialist engineers at the Operations Centre will monitor and respond to extraterrestrial events such as solar flares, as well as manage issues that arise on Earth. It will also house one of a network of SatCo ground-based gateway stations across Europe. These gateways provide secure backhaul links between the satellite constellation and terrestrial 4G/5G networks, enabling users to switch automatically between space-based and land-based coverage for uninterrupted, resilient connectivity. AST SpaceMobile has submitted through Germany the appropriate filings with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a specialised agency of the United Nations. This will help manage and mitigate any signal interference and ensure the smooth integration with existing mobile telecoms networks. Germany’s strategically central location provides SatCo with the ideal foundation to complement terrestrial networks, supporting the need to keep users across Europe remain securely connected anytime, anywhere. In addition to providing service to all EU MNOs using their national spectrum bands, SatCo is a candidate for access to the EU 2GHz Mobile Satellite Services (MSS) spectrum. If secured, this would enable existing MNOs to distribute a fully pan-European, sovereign, space-based broadband service directly to their customers. The aforementioned PPDR frequency bands (698–703/753–758 MHz and 733–736/788–791 MHz) would be used to support this capability.

Title: ‘Predator: Badlands,’ ‘Peaky Blinders,’ ‘The Bride!’ All Harness France VFX Expertise

Postproduction studios The Yard and One of Us herald growing maturity, resilience in French VFX sector By Ben Croll France’s vibrant VFX sector now stands at the forefront of the country’s broader push to strengthen its global production appeal, reflecting a national strategy that has championed the craft ever since the 2020 revision of the Tax Rebate for International Production (TRIP). That update introduced a 10% bonus on all eligible expenses for productions spending over $2.3 million with local VFX houses. Five years on, the incentive has proven transformative, driving studio expansion, nurturing talent and attracting a steady stream of high-profile international projects to French soil. Related Stories 'Gremlins 3' Movie Sets November 2027 Release Date Today, the sector has reached maturity — and with maturity comes resilience. The unexpected collapse of Technicolor triggered layoffs and production disruptions, while a broader post-pandemic slowdown has seen commissions drop nearly 30%. With AI disruption and studio consolidation looming, growth increasingly depends on adaptability. Popular on Variety “Flexibility, agility and teamwork define the new business model,” says the Yard founder and CEO Laurens Ehrmann. “Our midsize structure offers a real advantage. Clients know their projects matter, that they’ll get an A-team, and that we’ll always respond quickly.” With outposts in Paris, Montpellier and now London — a move to access multiple tax credits while staying close to partners like Amazon and Netflix — the Yard has tied its expansion directly to relationship management. Case in point: after working on 2019’s “Ford v Ferrari,” the Yard maintained strong ties with the project’s VFX supervisor, who later entrusted them with advanced creature work on this year’s “Predator: Badlands.” Tasked with a milestone sequence, the studio built an animation, character, creature and digidouble pipeline from scratch, handling 120 complex shots and creating a robust toolset for future creature FX. “Working on creatures is one of the most complex parts of VFX,” Ehrmann explains. “Mastering it allows you to bid on entire sequences with vast environments and complex characters, now positioning us as a tier-one VFX company.” Executives from VFX studio One of Us describe their work on 2024’s “Damsel” as similarly transformative. The studio delivered over 400 shots, including 250 featuring a fully realized, emotive dragon, with the rest dedicated to large-scale destruction and fully 3D environments. Splitting the work between outposts in London and Paris, the studio’s teams collaborated seamlessly, emerging from this trial-by-fire with cost-saving insights. “Getting involved early is critical,” says Emmanuel Pichereau, CCO of One of Us. “It allows us to plan strategically, reduce shot counts, control costs and, most importantly, align with the film’s storytelling from the very beginning when changes are still flexible.” The studio is applying this philosophy to upcoming projects like “The Bride!” and “Peaky Blinders: The Immortal Man.” For both, the team is working from its Paris office to qualify for the full French tax rebate, crafting visual effects designed to be seamless rather than showy. “We want to blend into these worlds,” says CEO Rachael Penfold. “We’re there to serve the story and realize the filmmakers’ vision, not to show off. The best visual effect is often the one you never notice.” But Penfold is happy to tout the French value proposition — and she recently traveled to Los Angeles to championed Gallic talent at industry sessions and case studies. “The French film industry is mature, and its talent is often immersed in a culture of great filmmaking, not just trained on specific software,” Penfold says. “The emphasis is cultural — it’s about artistic problem-solving and craftsmanship. While some focus on technical details, French artists tend to take a more holistic, well-rounded view. That mindset brings added value to every project.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Tech layoffs surge to 33,281 in October as AI and economic fears trigger historic job cuts

U.S. employers announced 153,074 job cuts in October, the highest for that month in more than two decades. The technology sector is experiencing a brutal correction, with more than 33,000 layoffs in October. Corporate cost-cutting, AI adoption, and softening consumer spending are driving the historic downsizing. Laid-off workers are finding it harder to secure new roles, with hiring plans at their lowest since 2011. The retail sector is also under severe pressure, with job cuts up 145% this year.

The retail sector is also under severe pressure, with job cuts up 145% this year. The American dream is unraveling for hundreds of thousands of workers as a tidal wave of corporate layoffs crashes through the economy. A disappointing new report for October reveals the highest level of job cuts for that month in more than two decades, shattering the illusion of a stable recovery and exposing a labor market in deep distress. The tech sector, once a bastion of high-paying jobs, is leading the charge in this devastating downturn, leaving seasoned professionals struggling to afford basic necessities in an economy that appears to be turning against them. According to the latest data from executive coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, U.S. employers axed 153,074 jobs in October alone. This represents a staggering 183% increase from September and is the worst October for layoffs since 2003. The total number of job cuts for 2025 has now soared past 1.09 million, reaching its highest level since the pandemic-driven economic shutdowns of 2020. A tech industry in retreat The technology industry is experiencing a brutal correction. Tech companies announced 33,281 layoffs in October, a dramatic surge from the 5,639 cuts reported in September. So far this year, the tech sector has announced 141,159 job cuts, a 17% increase from the 120,470 cuts during the same period in 2024. This data confirms that the mass layoffs that began at giants like Microsoft and Amazon in recent years have evolved into a full-blown industry-wide crisis. The drivers behind this historic downsizing are a toxic cocktail of economic pressures and technological disruption. Andy Challenger, the companyâs workplace expert and chief revenue officer, explained the confluence of factors in the report. âSome industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes,â he said. This sentiment echoes past justifications from corporate leaders, such as Amazonâs Andy Jassy, who previously stated that layoffs would help pursue âlong-term opportunities with a stronger cost structure.â The human cost of business efficiency The human cost of this corporate âbelt-tighteningâ is immense. The report delivers a chilling finding for those who have lost their jobs: âthose laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market.â This is a devastating blow to white-collar professionals who once enjoyed high demand for their skills. The report notes that many are now struggling to afford food, gas, and housing, with some former tech recruiters resorting to exhausting retail and catering jobs just to survive. While companies often cite artificial intelligence as a key reason for cuts, some experts question if AI is being used as a convenient scapegoat. Companies explicitly blamed AI for 31,039 of the October layoffs, making it the second-most cited reason after general cost-cutting. Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at the Wharton School, suggested some firms could be âAI-washingâ their job cuts. âWe spend a lot of time looking carefully at companies that are actually trying to implement AI, and thereâs very little evidence that it cuts jobs anywhere near like the level that weâre talking about,â Cappelli noted. The retail sector is also under severe pressure, with 88,664 job cuts so far this year, a 145% increase from 2024. This aligns with the struggles of companies like Target, which is facing a severe shoplifting crisis that its chief financial officer at the time, incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke, said is projected to decrease gross margin by more than $600 million for the entire year. The broader economic landscape is one of weakening consumer spending and rising costs, forcing corporations to shrink their workforces. The pain is not confined to one industry. Major household names are making deep cuts. Amazon recently announced it will eliminate about 14,000 corporate roles. Target is cutting 1,800 corporate jobs in its first major layoff in a decade. UPS is laying off 48,000 workers as it adjusts to lower shipping volumes. This widespread retrenchment signals a fundamental shift in corporate Americaâs appetite for labor. Making matters worse, hiring plans have slowed to a crawl. Employers have announced just 488,077 planned hires through October, the lowest year-to-date figure since 2011. Seasonal holiday hiring has also cratered, with just 372,520 positions announced so far, the weakest pre-holiday total since Challenger began tracking the data. The opportunities for displaced workers to find new positions are rapidly vanishing. As we head into an uncertain future, the report offers little hope for a quick turnaround. âAt this point, we do not expect a strong seasonal hiring environment in 2025,â Challenger concluded. The data paints a clear and unsettling picture: the era of easy opportunity and job security that defined the last decade is over, replaced by a new reality of automation, economic anxiety, and a struggle for survival for the American worker. The corporate pursuit of efficiency has a real and human price, and it is being paid by the hundreds of thousands now cast out of the workforce.

Major household names are making deep cuts. Amazon recently announced it will eliminate about 14,000 corporate roles. Target is cutting 1,800 corporate jobs in its first major layoff in a decade. UPS is laying off 48,000 workers as it adjusts to lower shipping volumes. This widespread retrenchment signals a fundamental shift in corporate Americaâs appetite for labor. Making matters worse, hiring plans have slowed to a crawl. Employers have announced just 488,077 planned hires through October, the lowest year-to-date figure since 2011. Seasonal holiday hiring has also cratered, with just 372,520 positions announced so far, the weakest pre-holiday total since Challenger began tracking the data. The opportunities for displaced workers to find new positions are rapidly vanishing. As we head into an uncertain future, the report offers little hope for a quick turnaround. âAt this point, we do not expect a strong seasonal hiring environment in 2025,â Challenger concluded. The data paints a clear and unsettling picture: the era of easy opportunity and job security that defined the last decade is over, replaced by a new reality of automation, economic anxiety, and a struggle for survival for the American worker. The corporate pursuit of efficiency has a real and human price, and it is being paid by the hundreds of thousands now cast out of the workforce. Sources for this article include: SFGate.com NYPost.com CNBC.com A tech industry in retreat The technology industry is experiencing a brutal correction. Tech companies announced 33,281 layoffs in October, a dramatic surge from the 5,639 cuts reported in September. So far this year, the tech sector has announced 141,159 job cuts, a 17% increase from the 120,470 cuts during the same period in 2024. This data confirms that the mass layoffs that began at giants like Microsoft and Amazon in recent years have evolved into a full-blown industry-wide crisis. The drivers behind this historic downsizing are a toxic cocktail of economic pressures and technological disruption. Andy Challenger, the companyâs workplace expert and chief revenue officer, explained the confluence of factors in the report. âSome industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes,â he said. This sentiment echoes past justifications from corporate leaders, such as Amazonâs Andy Jassy, who previously stated that layoffs would help pursue âlong-term opportunities with a stronger cost structure.â The human cost of business efficiency The human cost of this corporate âbelt-tighteningâ is immense. The report delivers a chilling finding for those who have lost their jobs: âthose laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market.â This is a devastating blow to white-collar professionals who once enjoyed high demand for their skills. The report notes that many are now struggling to afford food, gas, and housing, with some former tech recruiters resorting to exhausting retail and catering jobs just to survive. While companies often cite artificial intelligence as a key reason for cuts, some experts question if AI is being used as a convenient scapegoat. Companies explicitly blamed AI for 31,039 of the October layoffs, making it the second-most cited reason after general cost-cutting. Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at the Wharton School, suggested some firms could be âAI-washingâ their job cuts. âWe spend a lot of time looking carefully at companies that are actually trying to implement AI, and thereâs very little evidence that it cuts jobs anywhere near like the level that weâre talking about,â Cappelli noted. The retail sector is also under severe pressure, with 88,664 job cuts so far this year, a 145% increase from 2024.

UPS is laying off 48,000 workers as it adjusts to lower shipping volumes. This widespread retrenchment signals a fundamental shift in corporate Americaâs appetite for labor. Making matters worse, hiring plans have slowed to a crawl. Employers have announced just 488,077 planned hires through October, the lowest year-to-date figure since 2011.

Sources for this article include: SFGate.com NYPost.com CNBC.com The retail sector is also under severe pressure, with 88,664 job cuts so far this year, a 145% increase from 2024. This aligns with the struggles of companies like Target, which is facing a severe shoplifting crisis that its chief financial officer at the time, incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke, said is projected to decrease gross margin by more than $600 million for the entire year.

Title: Final Fantasy developer Square Enix plans to automate 70% of its QA with AI even as it continues layoffs in the west

Time Published: 2025-11-07T03:14:00Z
Full Content:
Square Enix is pushing to automate 70% of its QA and debugging tasks in game development by the end of 2027, following its announcement of widespread layoffs across its Western offices. The company explained its new initiative in its latest progress report for its medium-term business plan, “Square Enix Reboots and Awakens,” to address problems such as low sales of games like Final Fantasy XIV. Square Enix is teaming up with the Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory at the University of Tokyo, consisting of a team of researchers from the lab and Square Enix engineers. The end goal is to make QA faster and cheaper. QA testing traditionally involves manual testing of games for bugs, glitches, and issues, which is exhausting in titles like Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest. Square Enix’s report explicitly stated, “To automate 70% of QA and debugging tasks in game development by the end of 2027.” This means that an AI debugging system could automatically generate test scenarios, simulate player behavior, and isolate bugs and issues in video games. While similar tools exist in engines like Unreal Engine 5, Square Enix seems determined to take things a step further. However, this development strategy doesn’t come without sacrifice, as on the very same day Square Enix laid off over 100 employees across its UK, U.S., and European offices, calling it a “fundamental restructuring” of its overseas publishing arm and a “best position for the group’s long-term growth.” However, the company didn’t explicitly state that the job cuts were linked to the QA AI push. Still, speculation suggests the company could soon replace a significant portion of its testing staff with AI. Square Enix isn’t the only company leaping into AI, though. A September 2025 survey by CESA asked 54 companies about AI, and 51% confirmed they’re using generative AI for artwork, story concepts, and coding. An additional 31% confirmed they were using AI to build game engines. Square Enix claims AI will help the company compete in an industry where AAA games are costing exponentially more to develop over the years due to rising licensing, labor, and QA costs as the bar continues to be raised higher. It is important, however, to note that the company itself is doing considerably well financially this quarter, thanks in part to Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake. Despite its enthusiasm, the QA automation push seems like a high-stakes bet for the company, as it risks alienating talent that might be hard to replace should it backfire. Employee morale is already strained at the company, and the coming years will show if Square Enix’s “reboot” will genuinely pay off.

US stock market fell hard today as AI hype cracked. The Nasdaq plunged 1.9%, the S&P 500 slipped 1.1%, and the Dow lost 0.8%. Tesla slid 3.5% before Musk’s pay vote. Nvidia, Amazon, and Palantir also tanked as investors questioned AI valuations. Job cuts surged to 153,074, the most since 2003. The 10-year yield eased to 4.09%, and Bitcoin floated near $100,900. Wall Street’s red close showed AI fever cooling fast — and investor nerves rising again.

Title: 20VC x SaaStr This Week: Navan’s “Disappointing” $5B IPO, VCs Getting 6% Instead of 20%, and the Fire-Half-Your-Team AI Test: The New Venture Reality

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts We’re back! Harry, Rory and Jason this week. The venture landscape has fundamentally shifted. A $4.5B exit is no longer enough for mega-funds, ownership targets are getting crushed across the board, and if your SaaS company didn’t see AI-driven reacceleration in 2025, you’ve failed. Meanwhile, the best Series A environment in years is hidden behind pricing pressure, and every “mature” software company better be capturing dollars from the AI spend explosion—or they’re headed for a 3x revenue PE buyout. Navan’s IPO at $700M revenue, 32% growth, and a ~$5B market cap should be a massive win. Instead, it feels like a disappointment. Why? Because mature SaaS companies are now trading at 6-7x NTM revenue — or less — and with fund sizes exploding, VCs need $10B+ outcomes to move the needle. As Jason put it bluntly: “Is a $4.5 billion exit good enough today? It’s a horrible thing to say, but if we’re talking about in VC and inside baseball, it’s a bonafide question.” The math is unforgiving. Lightspeed invested $257M into Navan and returned ~$1B for a 4x blended return. Their early rounds probably returned 20-30x, but following with $200M+ in late-stage capital diluted that spectacular early return down to “just” 4x on the total investment. For a $2B fund, even a billion-dollar return only gets you a third of the way to 1x. Benchmark—the gold standard of ownership discipline—only secured 10% of Mercor at a massive valuation. Jason’s last three deals came in at 6-8% ownership despite his rule being double-digit ownership of two winners per fund. Y Combinator has institutionalized 10% rounds at demo day (3 on 30, 4 on 40), leaving seed VCs scrambling for 5-6% unless they “way overbid and basically do two rounds at once.” The paradox: Both hyper-capital-efficient companies (that don’t need much money) and hyper-capital-inefficient companies (that need billions) result in low ownership for VCs. As Rory noted: “A founder’s optimized fundraising is a VC’s below ownership target.” Jason delivered one of the spiciest takes of the episode: “You better have gotten a few nickels out of the AI expenditures.. Some growth from all that massive AI spend in 2025. If you didn’t, if you’re not growing faster at the end of 2025 than at the start, then as a founder, I give you an F minus.” The data backs him up. Twilio went from single-digit growth to 15% growth fueled by voice AI customers (top 10 voice AI startups up 10x). MongoDB is benefiting from every AI company needing databases. Snowflake has re-accelerated. Stripe is booming from AI customers. Even if you can’t become Harvey, you must co-attach to the AI spend explosion. The window is closing fast. “You had 18 months to ship a product that mattered in this world. Where’s your agent? Where’s your reacceleration? F. No more excuses after Thanksgiving.” Despite the pricing pain, Jason argues Series A is in a golden age: “This is the best of times to be a series A investor because there is just an explosion of seed AI startups… It is a gift that thousands of founders are in San Francisco raising seed funds from multiple accelerators.” The top of funnel has never been better. YC, Neo, South Park Commons, and others are creating an unprecedented pipeline of smart, vetted founders. Yes, competition is fierce—Rory noted losing deals to Andreessen Horowitz and Kleiner Perkins (firms that would have been “slightly early” five years ago). But the direction of travel is clear: “Some form of agentic software… The mission has been assigned.” Buried in the discussion of Navan’s “disappointing” IPO was a striking observation: “The amount of wealth in Silicon Valley is just unprecedented in our lifetimes. It’s just gone up dramatically the last 18 months. In a very concentrated fashion.” This creates a strange dynamic where VCs are getting richer than ever (Oren Zev as a solo investor turned $150M into $1B+, Lightspeed’s $257M became ~$1B) while simultaneously feeling the pressure to deliver even bigger outcomes. A $50M post-seed valuation for a company that “has to be way better than Navan” feels both expensive and necessary. Let’s dig deeper into why Navan’s $5B outcome feels bittersweet. The company survived a near-death experience (COVID wiping out travel), came back strong with $700M+ revenue at 32% growth, and delivered billions to investors. By any historical standard, this is spectacular. But the lockup period reveals the gap between headlines and reality. Typical lockup: 6 months before you can start selling, and 18-24 months to fully distribute a large position. As Rory explained: “The IPO, I mean, it’s significant, but the economic significance is limited.” Translation: Those “billion-dollar returns” reported on IPO day often turn into $700M after 18 months of distribution. Worse, the last private round priced at $9B. Anyone who bought at that valuation or in the IPO is now down 30-50%. As Rory noted, this actually disproves Bill Gurley’s “free money” thesis about IPO pops: “This is an example of an IPO where, you know, if you look at it from the perspective of the issuer of stock, not only did they not leave money on the table, they actually priced at what now looks like a high.” The follow-on concentration strategy amplified returns but also amplified late-stage risk. Lightspeed’s early rounds probably delivered 20-30x, but their $257M total investment (including heavy late-stage follow-on) blended down to ~4x. For Orin Zev’s smaller fund structure with SPVs, the $150M-to-$1B return (6.7x) on a single deal is phenomenal. Same outcome, different fund architecture, wildly different impact. One of the most insightful discussions centered on adoption velocity. OpenEvidence grew to 300,000 doctors in one year—one-tenth the time it took Doximity. Individual adoption of AI tools is explosive. But corporate adoption? Much slower. As Jason observed: “I don’t think everyone’s going to buy Agent Force or their equivalent in a year. It might be 5 years, not 10 like SaaS. It might be half the time of SaaS.” This creates opportunity and risk. Opportunity: If you’re selling to enterprises (Salesforce, HubSpot), you have 5 years to get this right, not 1 year. Risk: Individual users are already using ChatGPT, Cursor, and other tools “legally or illegally.” Every associate is using AI to write briefs whether law firms have adopted Harvey or not. The TAM question becomes critical. OpenEvidence might capture 300K doctors fast, but there are only ~1M doctors in America (half in-house, half external). As Rory warned: “You’ve got to be sure that once you get all the names that you have enough follow-on stories for those names. You don’t want to be one and done.” Harvey faces the same math. To justify an $8B valuation at 30% growth (7x multiple at maturity), they need to hit $3B in revenue. With ~1M lawyers in America, that implies thousands of dollars per lawyer per year in subscription—not impossible (WestLaw is bigger), but a high bar. Speaking of Harvey: $150M ARR, 98% GRR, 170% NDR, 40% DAU/MAU ratio, raised at $8B valuation with minimal dilution (~2% for $150M). Jason’s back-of-napkin math: “If it’s 400 forward revenue that’s 20x. That’s exactly what it is. 400 AR. That’s what they’re predicting.” Rory agreed: These low-dilution rounds at hypergrowth companies are great for early investors but create pressure on the ultimate exit. The bull case: LLMs are perfect for law (language manipulation is literally what lawyers do), Harvey established market leadership fast, and legal had been a “pretty barren place” for software until now. The question mark: Is there a $3B annual spend in software for corporate law practices? Rory’s framework: “You basically have to be such a big automation tool for these lawyers that they’re willing to spend, you know, equivalent dollars, you know, thousands of dollars per year in subscription to make the math work.” Jason’s evolution: “I couldn’t believe that software companies could really capture dollars from replacing humans for real… Now we’re really seeing it. Agents are better than mediocre humans.” His conviction comes from using products, not Powerpoints. He’s running 20+ agents at SaaStr, replacing $40K workers with $10K/year agents, and seeing real results. The discussion of Sam Altman’s response to Brad Gerstner (“if you want to sell your shares, I’ll find someone for you in 60 seconds”) revealed deep concerns about governance and capital requirements. Jason’s reaction: “When that was said to me by a founder, I never said a critical word ever again. I didn’t mean I didn’t realize I pushed too hard. I never said a critical word ever ever again when I was told there’s a market for your shares if you want to sell.” But Rory pushed back: “If you are on the board of a company that’s planning to spend a trillion dollars and you only have 12 billion in revenue. It’s a totally appropriate board level question to say how are we going to do this.” The stakes are enormous: “The health of the entire US economy depends on the answer to this question. It turns out ‘fuck off and sell your shares’ is not an acceptable answer.” OpenAI needs to do $100B+ in revenue by 2027 to support the capex commitments. That’s not just impressive—it’s “hundreds of billions of dollars a year in a world where today only Amazon” operates at that scale. Google does $100B in a quarter; so does Amazon. OpenAI needs to reach that level. Rory’s compassion for Sam: “There’s a little part of me that’s kind of a bit sorry for Sam Altman because of where he’s put himself. He is the poster child of the AI capex boom. And if the AI capex boom unravels and the world and media is looking for a villain to throw rocks at, it ain’t going to be a big search.” The board’s job: “Help the CEO avoid things… provide the guardrails.” When someone invents numbers at the $5-10M level and they’re wrong, they disappear. “When you invent numbers that are wildly overoptimistic at the trillion dollar level and if it unravels, you just become the poster child in every economic history for the next 200 years of the great AI crash of 2026.” AWS: Grew 20% (reacceleration from 13%), secured OpenAI deal as latest partner, but the story is bittersweet. Five years ago, AWS dominated cloud compute. Today, they’re behind Microsoft ($250B commitment), Oracle ($300B), Google, Broadcom ($400B) in the AI race. As Jason noted: “It’s tough from AWS being having really created the category of cloud and being what we all grew up on. It is a major come down to be not even above the fold on the leaderboard.” Google: The underappreciated winner. “Google is really good now at all levels. It’s really good at consumer AI. It’s really good in searches back. Search is growing for Google again. The TPUs are good. It’s a good partner.” Unlike Amazon, Google has the application layer (all the consumer apps we use), the infrastructure layer (TPUs), and is printing money. Stock up 53% from Q1 lows. Meta: Core business performed great (20% growth), but stock dropped double-digits because they’re spending $70B/year on AI with “no revenue attached.” The market’s message: “You have this wonderful business and then you’re taking the entire cash flow and you’re building this AI stuff and unlike Google, Microsoft, or Amazon you don’t have an enterprise business to sell this shit to and unlike ChatGPT you don’t yet have an obvious AI forward app.” Zuck’s response (paraphrased): “I think it’s relevant to be in this space. Thank you for your opinion. I refer you to the Artisan Corporation. I control this company. Have a nice day.” The market’s counter: “Hey you’re doing the thing you did in 2021-22 putting a whole bunch of capex into something that might not work and that’s why the shares are slightly down.” “If I were the CEOs of any of the CRM leaders, I might move on from half my leadership team if I don’t see real growth from AI agents by the middle of next year. Because there’s been enough time. You’ve just got the wrong people.” Why the urgency? Infrastructure companies like Twilio, MongoDB, and Datadog already saw the bump. Companies at the infrastructure layer get the AI spend first. Application layer companies need to prove they can capture it too—or risk being viewed as legacy players who missed the moment. Rory initially pushed back on Jason’s harshness, then came around: “Sometimes when Jason is cruel and harsh, I disagree. And then sometimes I listen and I go, he’s absolutely right. This is one of the latter ones… If you’re not on this train now, you’re just not going to be relevant and you will be sold for three times one-year revenues to a PE firm who will smush you in with something else, never to be seen again.” The contrast with Harvey is stark: Harvey has 2,000 people somewhere building legal AI. Salesforce has 2,000 people building Agent Force. One has 170% NDR and $150M ARR growing like a weed. The other needs to prove monetization in 2026 on a massive enterprise base. The ownership discussion revealed a fundamental tension in portfolio construction. Jason’s rule: “I feel like I can only make money if I own double digits of two winners per fund.” His last three investments: 6-8% despite that rule. His resolution for 2026: “Get my ownership up. We’ll see how I do it.” Rory’s framework on late-stage follow-on: Early-stage funds aim for one deal to return the fund. Late-stage funds play a different game: “We got 4 billion. We’re going to put it to work. The average good deal will be at 3 to 5x. We’ll have a low loss ratio and over time we’ll get our two two and a halfx net. It’s not small numbers of big heads business. It’s a very different business. It’s moving money at scale.” The challenge: When companies are capital-efficient, they don’t need to sell much equity. When they’re capital-inefficient (OpenAI, Anthropic), they need billions, so even $100M buys you only a few points. “Both of those, interestingly enough, would be pretty good deals… Your mental rules of thumb have been smashed to pieces.” Harry’s counter: “You have to turn the next card to see sometimes. And it’s not obviously a $10 billion company on day one. And actually value can accrue in increments over time. And you could miss some great ones by being flippant in being like, oh, it’s not a $10 billion company.” Jason’s response: “If your first check for me is a very large percent of the fund, I don’t have a lot of margin for error. I don’t have the other 145 million that he had in Trip Actions in Navan. For me, that first one has to work.” Jason’s most provocative statement: “I don’t even want to take meetings with mortal founders. I don’t even want to take them, especially if the ask is aggressive.” Context: At $50M post (with everything in), Jason needs a 100x return to make money after dilution. That company needs to be “even better than Navan” to justify the price. “Do I really believe this deal I just did is for sure going to be worth more than Navan? I don’t know. It’s such an insanely high bar.” Rory’s gentle pushback: “I recoil from the ‘I don’t do mortal humans.’ It’s a bit cuz I think, you know, it sounds a little judgy.” Jason’s clarification: “Maybe it was always hard but now like you got to see these 10 billion exits but if they’re not utterly breaking the mold… it’s hard to really believe it’s going to be worth north of 10 billion.” The sobering reality: “You now have to assume that 400 million, 500 million in revenue is the threshold for an IPO. And if you say to yourself that you only want to do deals where you at least have the upside of an IPO, the IPO potential, then the bar to what a doable successful venture-backed deal with upside has gone up.” Rory’s synthesis: “The business has got harder. It has. But also people are getting richer at the same time. The amount of wealth in Silicon Valley is just unprecedented in our lifetimes.” One of the most important exchanges revealed a dirty secret about modern venture boards. Jason: “The better the company is doing, the more everyone’s a grin fucker. There’s just never a critical word said.” His example: “I have a company that’s going batshit and it’s going too batshit… The board members will not intervene in any way to protect the shareholders because of the bad NPS that would come from damaging that founder relationship. That to me is one of the most egregious escapes from fiduciary duty.” Harry agreed: “There is so much fear among VCs of getting out of step with the most successful founders. There’s so much fear.” Rory’s take: “If it were a normal startup with the VCs we work with and they had had to come up with 1.2 trillion, I think everyone would be saying, ‘Sounds good, Sam. Sounds good, Sam. Keep going. Good month.'” The contrast with OpenAI’s actual board: Brett Taylor (likely not a yes-man) and previously Larry Summers (“Larry Summers is many things, but not a yes-man”). Having strong, independent voices matters enormously when the stakes are this high. Jason’s reflection on being told to sell by a founder: “That was a teaching moment for me. I’m like, okay, I crossed the line. Like I didn’t mean I didn’t realize I did.” But Rory’s point stands: “You’re as a board member meant to provide the guardrails. I think when I look at this one, I go, ‘Hm, I hope someone’s providing really good guard rails because if it hits, it’ll hit hard.'” The lesson: Young founders make mistakes, but experienced board members who stay silent are morally (if not legally) more culpable. “Do we really have an audit, Sam Bankman? Do we really know where the money is?” The episode crystallized two viable strategies for software companies navigating the AI transition: Path 1: Go Where Others Aren’t (The Roger Ehrenberg Strategy) As Harry noted: “Let’s go where others aren’t. Get 20% in actually reasonably priced assets. Let’s not do AI dictation tools from YC and get 4%.” This means finding categories with less competition, being willing to take concentrated positions, and having the patience to build ownership over time. The infrastructure layer companies (Twilio, Datadog, MongoDB) benefiting from AI spend without being “AI companies” exemplify this. Path 2: If You’re Slow, Pick Slower Categories Jason’s advice: “Only a couple percent of [Salesforce’s] customer base is fully ready for AI today… If you are a little slow, maybe play to your strengths. If you’re a little slow, maybe maybe go into retail or manufacturing or areas where it hasn’t changed overnight.” The key insight: Individual adoption is explosive (OpenEvidence to 300K doctors in a year). Corporate adoption takes 5 years, not 10, but still takes multiple years. If you’re a smaller team or moving slower, find industries where the decision-making process is naturally slower. But no matter which path you choose, the core message remains: You must be relevant to AI in 2026. Whether that’s replacing humans, automating tasks, or enabling AI workloads, you need a story. Companies without one will get “sold for three times one-year revenues to a PE firm” and disappear. The episode closed with a fascinating debate about prediction markets. Both agreed the space is interesting, but differed on which bet to take. Jason’s lean toward Kalshi: “Based on my limited knowledge, I’m going Kalshi because I feel like it is a safer long-term bet than someone that is riding the current political vibes which are all in favor of everything here.” The risk: “There is a chance there will be a new administration that will be less sympathetic to this category… The first act could be to undo everything everything that Sachs and Buddies have done. That could be the January 1st whatever.” Rory’s prediction: “I predict that any reregulation won’t happen because of any new administration. I think the real challenge to sports betting like this will actually be the leagues themselves wrestling with the fact that when you have sports betting, you have sports cheating.” The Brian Armstrong example: Using specific phrases during an earnings call to tilt the scales on a Kalshi bet creates all sorts of weird incentive problems. “When you have these prediction markets and then the person can tilt, put their finger on the scales of who wins… There’s going to be a lot of weird stuff that happens.” The broader point: Regulatory risk isn’t just about current administration views. It’s about second-order effects (league commissioners dealing with cheating scandals), insider trading concerns (policy bets moving an hour before official announcements), and the fact that “everything is legal” right now doesn’t mean it stays that way. Jason Lemkin: On the exit bar: “The horrible question in venture and startups, it is horrible. Is a $4.5 billion exit good enough today? It’s a horrible thing to say, but if we’re talking about in VC and inside baseball, it’s a bonafide question.” On AI urgency: “You better have gotten a few nickels out of the AI expenditures… If you didn’t, if you’re not growing faster at the end of 2025 than the start as a founder, I give you an F minus. There’s so much money and you don’t have to be Harvey to get a little piece of it.” Rory O’Driscoll: On ownership: “A founder’s optimized fundraising is a VC’s below ownership target. That’s right. If Cursor had needed 40 million to get rolling, then Reedrock would own 20%. If they only need 20 million, then there you are.” On Sam Altman: “There’s a little part of me that’s kind of a bit sorry for Sam Altman because of where he’s put himself. He is the poster child of the AI capex boom, right? And if the AI capex boom unravels and the world and media is looking for a villain to throw rocks at, it ain’t going to be a big search.” Harry Stebbings: On board dynamics: “There is so much fear among VCs of getting out of step with the most successful founders. There’s so much fear. And you guys are going to disagree with me, but I see it all across my portfolio. The better the company is doing, the more everyone’s a grin fucker. There’s just never a critical word said.” On adoption velocity: “OpenEvidence grew to 300,000 doctors in one year, which is one-tenth of the amount of time it took Doximity. That was interesting just in terms of market pull and adoption rate.” Final Thought: The venture landscape going into 2026 is simultaneously the most exciting and most unforgiving it’s ever been. Pricing is high, ownership is compressed, exit expectations are brutal, and the speed of AI adoption creates winners and losers faster than any previous technology shift. But for those who can navigate it—who can find the right companies, get meaningful ownership, help them capture AI spend, and provide real board-level guidance—the wealth creation is unprecedented. Just don’t expect it to be easy, and definitely don’t expect a $5B exit to feel like a win anymore.

Title: Elon Musk awarded nearly $1 trillion pay package by Tesla shareholders

WHIO 7 NOW Tesla shareholders awarded CEO Elon Musk a pay package on Thursday that could grant the tech entrepreneur nearly $1 trillion in compensation over the next decade. The pay package would make Musk the best-compensated CEO ever recorded. According to a securities filing in September, Musk would rake in roughly $900 billion over the duration of the agreement. The full compensation would only be delivered if Musk vaults the company from its present value of $1.1 trillion to $8.5 trillion, a figure that exceeds the current combined market values of Meta, Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet, the filing says. The compensation package also includes a set of production goals, including one million Robotaxis in commercial operation and the delivery of one million humanoid robots over the next 10 years, according to the securities filing. Before Tesla released the results of the shareholder vote, some major shareholders said they had voted down the proposal. Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund said Tuesday that it had voted against the pay package, raising concerns about its scale and potential risks. "While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk’s visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk consistent with our views on executive compensation," Norges Bank Investment Management, the manager of the fund, said in a statement. (NEW YORK) -- Musk, considered the world's richest person, currently boasts a net worth of about $504 billion, according to Forbes. If he were to receive the full pay package, Musk would become the world's first-ever trillionaire. The pay package could also increase Musk's ownership stake in Tesla to as much as 29%. Musk has long pursued a larger ownership stake. “We are at a pivotal juncture in Tesla’s history, and the proposals the Special Committee has carefully designed and the Board has put forward will help determine Tesla’s future,” the company’s website said earlier this week. “If you believe, like us, that Elon is the CEO that can make our ambitious vision a reality, vote NOW.” Online voting among shareholders closed at 11:59 a.m. ET on Wednesday. The company's new compensation package arrives as Musk's previous payment plan remains in legal limbo. Last year, a Delaware judge twice struck down a $50 billion pay package for Musk put forward by the company in 2018. Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Court of Chancery, which litigates corporate governance litigation for companies incorporated in Delaware, initially declared that the negotiations surrounding the package had been inappropriate, due to a lack of independence among board members and problematic influence by Musk over those negotiations. In a second ruling, McCormick decided that an additional shareholder vote on the compensation package -- even if made with full knowledge of the initial problems surrounding the negotiation of the agreement -- could not undo those problems. Musk has appealed the ruling. Tesla announced a 12% jump in revenue over the third quarter in October, snapping a streak of two consecutive quarters of falling sales. Still, earnings fell short of analysts’ expectations, causing a drop in the stock price.

Title: Elon Musk awarded nearly $1 trillion pay package by Tesla shareholders

Musk would become the best-compensated CEO ever. Tesla shareholders awarded CEO Elon Musk a pay package on Thursday that could grant the tech entrepreneur nearly $1 trillion in compensation over the next decade. The pay package would make Musk the best-compensated CEO ever recorded. According to a securities filing in September, Musk would rake in roughly $900 billion over the duration of the agreement. Approval of the compensation package received more than 75% of the shareholder vote, Tesla General Counsel Brandon Erhart said during the shareholder meeting on Thursday. The full compensation would only be delivered if Musk vaults the company from its present value of $1.1 trillion to $8.5 trillion, a figure that exceeds the current combined market values of Meta, Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet, the filing says. The compensation package also includes a set of production goals, including one million Robotaxis in commercial operation and the delivery of one million humanoid robots over the next 10 years, according to the securities filing. Before Tesla released the results of the shareholder vote, some major shareholders said they had voted down the proposal. Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund said Tuesday that it had voted against the pay package, raising concerns about its scale and potential risks. "While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk’s visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk consistent with our views on executive compensation," Norges Bank Investment Management, the manager of the fund, said in a statement. Musk, considered the world's richest person, currently boasts a net worth of about $504 billion, according to Forbes. If he were to receive the full pay package, Musk would become the world's first-ever trillionaire. The pay package could also increase Musk's ownership stake in Tesla to as much as 29%. Musk has long pursued a larger ownership stake. “We are at a pivotal juncture in Tesla’s history, and the proposals the Special Committee has carefully designed and the Board has put forward will help determine Tesla’s future,” the company’s website said earlier this week. “If you believe, like us, that Elon is the CEO that can make our ambitious vision a reality, vote NOW.” Online voting among shareholders closed at 11:59 a.m. ET on Wednesday. The company's new compensation package arrives as Musk's previous payment plan remains in legal limbo. Last year, a Delaware judge twice struck down a $50 billion pay package for Musk put forward by the company in 2018. Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Court of Chancery, which litigates corporate governance litigation for companies incorporated in Delaware, initially declared that the negotiations surrounding the package had been inappropriate, due to a lack of independence among board members and problematic influence by Musk over those negotiations. In a second ruling, McCormick decided that an additional shareholder vote on the compensation package -- even if made with full knowledge of the initial problems surrounding the negotiation of the agreement -- could not undo those problems. Musk has appealed the ruling. Tesla announced a 12% jump in revenue over the third quarter in October, snapping a streak of two consecutive quarters of falling sales. Still, earnings fell short of analysts’ expectations, causing a drop in the stock price. Overall, shares of Tesla have climbed about 16% this year, putting them roughly in line with a jump in the S&P 500 over that period. Musk's work as a “special government employee” with the Trump administration, which ended in May, set off demonstrations at Tesla dealerships worldwide in protest of his effort to slash government spending as leader of the Department of Government Efficiency. On an earnings call in June, Musk fielded a question about his control of the company, which a Morgan Stanley analyst said was 13%.

Title: Laid off? Tech recruiting exec shares 4 tips for getting back on your feet—and on the job market
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/06/tips-for-when-you-get-laid-off/
Time Published: 2025-11-06T21:55:02Z

It’s a day every IT pro dreads: hearing about layoffs within your company, then being summoned into an HR manager’s office and being dismissed. The tech industry is going through a purge. Earlier this week, IBM announced plans to layoff a portion of its workforce. Meanwhile, Amazon shared plans to axe 14,000 employees and Meta let go of 600 workers from its AI unit last month. After a layoff comes the uncomfortable question: “What’s next?” For most, it’s dusting yourself off and looking for a new opportunity. According to Overture Partners CRO Mark Aiello, that can be a grueling process. “Definitely no one ever went to bed on Sunday night saying, ‘Hey, I get to look for a new job. Tomorrow is going to be great!’” Aiello said. Dusting off the ol’ résumé. IT Brew caught up with Diana Huang, VP of technology staffing agency Prosum’s Southern California market, to learn how IT pros can make their job search less cumbersome, as well as proper résumé etiquette. Huang said one of the most important things an IT pro can do to improve their résumé is to demonstrate their accomplishments through numbers or other measurable metrics. “It could be ‘Reduced cloud spend by 15% through automation,’ or ‘Improved deployment frequency from weekly to daily,’” Huang said. “It’s adding numbers and specifics and showing your impact.” She added that professionals should make sure résumé details match what’s on their LinkedIn profile. A good résumé is also as concise as possible. “Don’t write a novel. No one’s going to read 15 pages,” Huang said. “Let’s try to really keep it short. If you’re more junior, five years [or] under, keep it [to] one page and try to keep it really concise.” Applicants are also working against applicant tracking systems, software used by hiring managers to filter and rank résumés by specified keywords or qualifications, according to Aiello, who added these “magic” algorithms can complicate things for job-seekers. “It’s more secret than anything the CIA does that they don’t explain, and you have to hope that you have the right keywords and the right weighting and all of that,” he said. Because of this, Aiello advises that applicants avoid using LinkedIn’s Easy Apply function and similar tools, and instead take time tailoring résumés to feature skills mentioned in the job descriptions of the desired role. “[Overusing Easy Apply] should mean ‘I like to be ghosted’…because that’s basically what’s going to happen to you,” Aiello said. He added that those who do feel inclined to use the function should do additional research and reach out to hiring managers separately. How to be a notable networker. Networking is also important when professionals are seeking a new opportunity, Aiello added. He said professionals seeking a new role should be specific when discussing their ideal role with their industry connections. “Don’t just say, ‘I’m looking for a job.’ Help them think exactly of what it is that you do in terms that they can understand,” he said. Emailing or texting similar job postings can help to illustrate what an IT pro is looking for. Huang suggests tech professionals build strong connections with a handful of local recruiters who specialize in IT. “If you’re able to have those strong relationships, they will give you access to opportunities that will give you a better chance, rather than just submitting an application and a lot of times turning into a black hole,” she said. She also advised professionals to announce that they are seeking work on LinkedIn and similar platforms. “I bet you a lot of people who would see that and have worked with you would be like, ‘Oh, I’m so sad to hear that, but I know of so and so who might be looking. Let me make that connection,’” Huang said. “So, don’t be afraid to broadcast that.” The golden rules of job hunting. Aiello said it is important for professionals to remember to maintain contact with networked connections, even after they land a new job. “If the only time you hear from your friend is when you need a ride to the airport or you need help moving after a while, they’re no longer going to be your friend,” he said. Huang added that job-seekers should let recruiters know if they lose interest in a position or leave the candidate pool altogether. “If you ghost, then you will be blacklisted out of their system, and they will not present you again to their clients.” This report was originally published by IT Brew. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Disaster Ensues After AI Behemoth Floats Idea Of Stealing Your Tax Dollars If They Fail

AI behemoth OpenAI tried to lay the groundwork for a taxpayer-funded bailout Wednesday and was met with swift condemnation. The Wall Street Journal published a story Sunday suggesting that OpenAI has now become “too big to fail.” In other words, if the company were to go under, it would be such a blow to the U.S. economy that the government would have to intervene and save it; otherwise, there might be a spiraling drain effect that sucks down the entire system. A domino effect from hell. OpenAI’s CFO, Sarah Friar, seemed to test-pilot the idea at a Wall Street Journal conference Wednesday, saying that the company wants to build up an ecosystem of banks, private equity groups, and a federal government “backstop” or “guarantee” to help build and finance the crucial data centers. (RELATED: Battle Against Data Centers Driving Up Electric Bills Unites Republicans, Democrats) There was swift backlash on social media, however, which forced OpenAI to do some cleanup. Friar later clarified her comment, saying that the mention of a “backdrop” muddied her point that “American strength in technology will come from building real industrial capacity which requires the private sector and government playing their part.” OpenAI wants federal taxpayer backstop for new investments, per Bloomberg. CFO has clarified this was a “misspeak.” — unusual_whales (@unusual_whales) November 6, 2025 OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted a long statement Thursday on X, claiming they are not looking for “government guarantees,” or a handout from Uncle Sam. I would like to clarify a few things. First, the obvious one: we do not have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters. We believe that governments should not pick winners or losers, and that taxpayers should not bail out companies that make bad business decisions or… — Sam Altman (@sama) November 6, 2025 “First, the obvious one: we do not have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters. We believe that governments should not pick winners or losers, and that taxpayers should not bail out companies that make bad business decisions or otherwise lose in the market. If one company fails, other companies will do good work,” he said. Sam just wrote a 1,500-word essay explaining why he absolutely doesn’t want government guarantees… while outlining a $1.4 trillion moonshot that somehow needs them in spirit, if not on paper. It’s performance art at this point. 😂 He’s basically saying: “We don’t want… — Void Freud (@voidfreud) November 6, 2025 Altman went on to say that OpenAI has discussed government-subsidized loans to help build semiconductor factories in the U.S. “The one area where we have discussed loan guarantees is as part of supporting the buildout of semiconductor fabs in the US, where we and other companies have responded to the government’s call and where we would be happy to help (though we did not formally apply),” Altman said. “The basic idea there has been ensuring that the sourcing of the chip supply chain is as American as possible in order to bring jobs and industrialization back to the US, and to enhance the strategic position of the US with an independent supply chain, for the benefit of all American companies. This is of course different from governments guaranteeing private-benefit datacenter buildouts,” he goes on. White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks joined the mop-up, as well. (Sacks is essentially Silicon Valley’s lobbying voice in the Trump White House.) There will be no federal bailout for AI. The U.S. has at least 5 major frontier model companies. If one fails, others will take its place. — David Sacks (@DavidSacks) November 6, 2025 But, if there were a real market meltdown soon, why should we take these people’s statements that they don’t want a guaranteed federal bailout as true at face value? Clearly, they have been mulling over the idea. And it would be much easier to finance a mass buildout of data centers if investors knew that the federal government and taxpayers would ultimately foot the bill. In other words, if they knew the risk and downside of the whole AI bubble blowing up in their faces was passed on to the public. Altman recently got snappy when Brad Gerstner, an American investor, dared to ask him how OpenAI is going to pay for $1.4 trillion of long-term spending commitments on hardware and data center infrastructure from 2025-2035, even though the company’s revenue still is middling. “First of all. We’re doing well more revenue than that. Second of all, Brad, if you want to sell your shares, I’ll find you a buyer. I just, enough. I think there’s a lot of people who would love to buy OpenAI shares. I think people who talk with a lot of breathless concern about our compute stuff or whatever, that would be thrilled to buy shares. So I think we could sell your shares or anybody else’s to some of the people who are making the most noise on Twitter about this very quickly. We do plan for revenue to grow steeply. Revenue is growing steeply,” Altman claimed. Of course, the “people who are making the most noise on Twitter about this” just seem to be those with common sense, an ability to do basic math, and a growing skepticism that AI technology will actually be worth the investment. One MIT study found that 95% of organizations that have tried to implement generative AI, like OpenAI’s technology, ChatGPT, got zero in return. Another study from the Rand Corporation revealed that 80% of AI implementations fail. All of it is beginning to reek of … ‘Just give me more money, and this time, there will be a major breakthrough, and it will all be worth it. The best is yet to come!’ I don’t know exactly how many times Altman and other tech CEOs have said something to this effect over the years, but I know it’s more than once. And something of note: the famous investor who shorted the U.S. housing market ahead of the 08/09 financial crisis, Michael Burry, now has a short position on tech behemoths Palantir and Nvidia. He’s betting that these stocks are overvalued and will soon crash. 🚨 BREAKING: Michael Burry goes short on $PLTR and $NVDA in his latest 13F filing Scion Capital just bought put options on 1M Nvidia shares and 5M Palantir shares 👀 The Big Short is feeling bearish on AI pic.twitter.com/Kn6EcINm20 — Michael Burry Stock Tracker ♟ (@burrytracker) November 3, 2025 News of the trade sparked a big selloff in tech, as speculation that AI is a bubble ready to burst is running rampant. That might explain why OpenAI tried to float the idea of the federal government and taxpayers funding their infrastructure. Sign up for John Loftus’s weekly newsletter here!

Future GLP-1 drugs will launch at a capped price of $149 under the terms of the agreement. For the first time, Medicare will cover GLP-1 drugs for obesity, with patient co-pays set at roughly $50. The administration also introduced a federal purchasing option that will allow consumers to buy GLP-1 drugs directly through a government website called “TrumpRX.” “Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have agreed to provide all of their other medications to Medicaid at 'most favored nations' prices, meaning you will pay the lowest price anywhere in the world,” President Donald Trump said during the press conference. Trump also highlighted the fact that the project bears his name. “They want to use my name, Trump. Better be good,” he said. “I think it’s turning out to be pretty amazing.” Trump added that the companies planned major U.S. manufacturing investments to support expanded supply, saying they “are building new plants” to produce GLP-1 medications domestically. GLP-1 drugs are a class of medications that mimic a natural hormone involved in regulating blood sugar and appetite. They were originally developed for diabetes, but have become widely used for weight loss because they slow digestion, reduce hunger, and help control blood glucose levels. Officials said the pricing changes were part of a broader effort to expand access to obesity and diabetes treatments. Shares of Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) both jumped following the announcement, with LLY still recently up about 1% to $936, while NVO is down about 4% to $46 a share amid a broader daily decline for stocks. Administration officials said about 10% of Medicare beneficiaries would qualify for coverage under the new plan, based on criteria tied to body mass index and preexisting conditions such as prediabetes and cardiovascular disease. Eligible patients would pay a $50 monthly co-pay, with the change expected to take effect in the middle of next year. Officials also said some Medicaid enrollees could gain access to lower prices beginning in 2027 through a forthcoming pilot program run by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Trump previewed his approach in February, telling Fox News, “The so-called fat drug or fat shot, whatever it’s called, Ozempic or Mounjaro—in London, you get it for $88. In New York, you get it for $1,200, you can’t even buy it. It’s very unfair… I’m going to solve it one way or the other.” Not present during the press conferences were representatives of major insurers, who did not say whether they would change their coverage rules in response to the new prices. Until now, plans have had limited access largely because of the high cost of the drugs and the large number of patients seeking them for weight-loss treatment. During the press conference, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the agreement would broaden access for patients who had been unable to afford GLP-1 drugs. “Obesity is the number one driver of chronic disease. Fifty percent of our adult population are obese or overweight, and it drives about 50% of healthcare costs in this country,” Kennedy said. “We are going to see a decline because of this historic agreement. We’re going to see a decline in costs, but also, more importantly, in the afflictions themselves.” The negotiations took “months and months,” Kennedy added, and described the resulting deal as poised to provide “the biggest impact on the American people” among recent health policy moves. The administration did not say when commercial insurers might adjust their coverage policies.

Future GLP-1 drugs will launch at a capped price of $149 under the terms of the agreement. For the first time, Medicare will cover GLP-1 drugs for obesity, with patient co-pays set at roughly $50. The administration also introduced a federal purchasing option that will allow consumers to buy GLP-1 drugs directly through a government website called “TrumpRX.” “Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have agreed to provide all of their other medications to Medicaid at 'most favored nations' prices, meaning you will pay the lowest price anywhere in the world,” President Donald Trump said during the press conference. Trump also highlighted the fact that the project bears his name. “They want to use my name, Trump. Better be good,” he said. “I think it’s turning out to be pretty amazing.” Trump added that the companies planned major U.S. manufacturing investments to support expanded supply, saying they “are building new plants” to produce GLP-1 medications domestically. GLP-1 drugs are a class of medications that mimic a natural hormone involved in regulating blood sugar and appetite. They were originally developed for diabetes, but have become widely used for weight loss because they slow digestion, reduce hunger, and help control blood glucose levels. Officials said the pricing changes were part of a broader effort to expand access to obesity and diabetes treatments. Shares of Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) both jumped following the announcement, with LLY still recently up about 1% to $936, while NVO is down about 4% to $46 a share amid a broader daily decline for stocks. Administration officials said about 10% of Medicare beneficiaries would qualify for coverage under the new plan, based on criteria tied to body mass index and preexisting conditions such as prediabetes and cardiovascular disease. Eligible patients would pay a $50 monthly co-pay, with the change expected to take effect in the middle of next year. Officials also said some Medicaid enrollees could gain access to lower prices beginning in 2027 through a forthcoming pilot program run by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Trump previewed his approach in February, telling Fox News, “The so-called fat drug or fat shot, whatever it’s called, Ozempic or Mounjaro—in London, you get it for $88. In New York, you get it for $1,200, you can’t even buy it. It’s very unfair… I’m going to solve it one way or the other.” Not present during the press conferences were representatives of major insurers, who did not say whether they would change their coverage rules in response to the new prices. Until now, plans have had limited access largely because of the high cost of the drugs and the large number of patients seeking them for weight-loss treatment. During the press conference, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the agreement would broaden access for patients who had been unable to afford GLP-1 drugs. “Obesity is the number one driver of chronic disease. Fifty percent of our adult population are obese or overweight, and it drives about 50% of healthcare costs in this country,” Kennedy said. “We are going to see a decline because of this historic agreement. We’re going to see a decline in costs, but also, more importantly, in the afflictions themselves.” The negotiations took “months and months,” Kennedy added, and described the resulting deal as poised to provide “the biggest impact on the American people” among recent health policy moves. The administration did not say when commercial insurers might adjust their coverage policies. Officials said final implementation of the Medicare provisions would be completed after further review. “This is a great day for American health and health care,” President Trump said. “For all American patients, these are things that are miracles.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: AI wreaks havoc on US jobs with two-decade high 150K cut in October – bringing 2025 total to 1M: report
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/11/06/business/ai-wreaks-havoc-on-us-jobs-with-two-decade-high-150k-cut-in-october-report/
Time Published: 2025-11-06T20:40:24Z

US employers axed about 153,000 workers last month — making it the worst October for layoffs in two decades and bringing total firings for the year so far to over 1 million, according to a new report that noted many companies blamed the latest layoffs on AI. The last time the US saw a worse October in terms of firings was in 2003, when 171,874 people were laid off. As in the aughts, the latest layoff numbers came amid a time of tech-driven realignment for the economy. Back then, the issue was changes in the telecom industry sparked by the rise of cell phones, experts say; today, it’s the advent of AI and automating tasks once done by humans. Companies cited artificial intelligence in 31,039 of the October layoffs — second only to general cost-cutting — according to the report Challenger, Gray & Christmas released Thursday. “Like in 2003, a disruptive technology is changing the landscape,” said Andy Challenger, the firm’s chief revenue officer. AI was explicitly blamed for relatively few of the total job cuts so far this year — just 48,414 of them, according to the data. October’s 153,074 job cuts marked a 183% spike from September — when 54,064 positions were slashed — and a 175% jump from the same month a year ago, Challenger, Gray & Christmas found. Analysts and businesses having been using the firm’s reports, which usually draw little notice, while official jobs data has stalled because of the government shutdown. Through the first 10 months of 2025, announced layoffs topped 1.09 million — a 65% increase from the 664,839 job cuts last year and the highest total since 2020, when pandemic shutdowns sent pink slips soaring. “Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes,” said Challenger. The data shows technology and warehousing companies led October’s cuts. Tech firms announced 33,281 layoffs, up sharply from 5,639 the prior month, while warehousing firms axed 47,878 jobs — a surge driven by automation and lingering overcapacity from pandemic-era expansion. For the year, the tech industry has slashed 141,159 jobs so far — up 17% from the 120,470 that were announced through the same period in 2024. The retail sector also remains under pressure, with 88,664 job cuts so far this year, up 145% from 2024, as chains face weaker discretionary spending and ongoing store closures. “Over the last decade, companies have shied away from announcing layoffs in the fourth quarter, so it’s surprising to see so many in October,” said Challenger. Warehousing, services, and consumer product firms also joined the retrenchment, while media and nonprofit organizations reported mounting losses tied to automation and reduced government funding. Challenger said nonprofits have announced 27,651 job cuts this year — up more than 400% — while the media industry logged 16,680, a 26% increase. Overall, companies cited cost-cutting in 50,437 October layoffs, followed by artificial intelligence, market conditions and facility closures. The layoffs seem unlikely to stop anytime soon. Amazon, Target, Paramount Skydance and Starbucks have each moved to cut hundreds or thousands of positions, underscoring the breadth of the corporate pullback heading into the holidays. Amazon said last week it will eliminate about 14,000 corporate roles, part of a reorganization to “further reduce bureaucracy” and shift resources toward artificial intelligence. At Target, incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke announced the company’s first major layoffs in a decade, cutting 1,800 corporate jobs — roughly 8% of its headquarters staff — as the retailer struggles with a sales slump and aims to “simplify how we work.” UPS recently announced it would lay off 48,000 workers as part of a sweeping cost-cutting initiative. In Hollywood, Paramount Skydance began cutting about 2,000 positions, or 10% of its workforce, following its merger approval earlier this year. Starbucks filed notice to Washington state regulators that it will lay off 974 employees in Seattle and Kent starting Dec. 5. The non-retail layoffs follow earlier cuts across Washington State as CEO Brian Niccol restructures the company after a post-pandemic downturn. Even as layoffs accelerate, hiring plans have slowed dramatically. Employers have announced 488,077 planned hires through October — down 35% from last year and the lowest year-to-date figure since 2011. Seasonal hiring has also cratered, with just 372,520 positions announced so far, the weakest pre-holiday total since Challenger began tracking the figure in 2012. “At a time when job creation is at its lowest point in years, the optics of announcing layoffs in the fourth quarter are particularly unfavorable,” Challenger said. “Those laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market.” Advertisement

Title: Is the AI boom losing steam as investors grow wary of returns?

Billions have poured into AI, helping stock valuations soar. But the cracks are starting to show. Slowing adoption, surging costs and elusive profits are fueling warnings that the boom may be headed for a hard reset. The artificial intelligence (AI) party is still in full swing, with tens of billions globally pouring into infrastructure, startups and attracting the best talent. Among the headline announcements this year: ChatGPT parent company Open AI, Softbank and Oracle pledged to invest $500 billion (€433 billion) in AI supercomputers, Open AI and chip giant Nvidia announced a $100 billion fund to maintain the United States' dominance in advanced chips, while Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Tencent hiked investments to help speed up China's ambition to lead AI by 2030. Since ChatGPT’s debut in November 2022, AI-related stocks have added an estimated $17.5 trillion in market value, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, driving around 75% of the S&P 500’s gains and propelling companies like Nvidia and Microsoft to record-breaking valuations. But signs of a hangover are getting harder to ignore. AI usage by corporations is slipping, spending is tightening and the machine learning hype has massively outpaced the profits. Many economists think usage concerns, barely three years into AI going mainstream, dropkick the prevailing narrative that AI would revolutionize how businesses operate by streamlining repetitive tasks and improving forecasting. "The vast bet on AI infrastructure assumes surging usage, yet multiple US surveys show adoption has actually declined since the summer," Carl-Benedikt Frey, professor of AI & work at the UK's University of Oxford, told DW. "Unless new, durable use cases emerge quickly, something will give — and the bubble could burst." The US Census Bureau, which surveys 1.2 million US companies every fortnight, found that AI-tool usage at firms with more than 250 employees dropped from nearly 14% in June to under 12% in August.

Other weaknesses are inconsistent reliability and the poor performance of autonomous agents, which complete tasks successfully only about a third of the time. "Unlike an intern who learns on the job, today’s pretrained [AI] systems don’t improve through experience. We need continual learning and models that adapt to changing circumstances," said Frey. As the gap widens between sky-high expectations and commercial reality, investor enthusiasm for AI is starting to fade. In the third quarter of the year, venture-capital deals with private AI firms dropped by 22% quarter on quarter to 1,295, although funding levels remained above $45 billion for the fourth consecutive quarter, market intelligence firm CB Insights wrote last month. "What perturbs me is the scale of the money being invested compared to the amount of revenue flowing from AI," economist Stuart Mills, a senior fellow at the London School of Economics, told DW. Market leader OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft, generated $3.7 billion in revenue last year, versus total operating expenses of $8-9 billion. The company says it is on course to make $13 billion this year but is still expected to burn through $129 billion before 2029, news site The Information calculated in September. Mills thinks generative AI companies like Elon Musk's Grok and ChatGPT are "charging far less than they need to make a profit" and should raise subscription prices. Few have quantified the AI bubble more starkly than Julien Garran, partner at UK-based research firm MacroStrategy Partnership. He argues that the sheer volume of capital flowing into AI — despite little evidence of sustainable returns — dwarfs previous speculative frenzies. "We estimate a misallocation of capital equivalent to 65% of US GDP — four times bigger than the housing buildup before the 2008/9 financial crisis and 17 times bigger than the dot-com bust," Garran told DW. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Recent earnings from Big Tech have sparked cautious optimism, but also fresh doubts about AI’s staying power. Data analytics and intelligence platform Palantir's Q3 revenue surged 63% year-over-year, but its stock price fell by up to 7% on the news. AMD and Meta also saw their strong AI-related earnings overshadowed by market concerns about sustainability. That disconnect between soaring valuations and shaky fundamentals is exactly what worries Mills, who sees a widening gap between what AI promises and what it actually delivers to businesses. "The data suggests that AI is not penetrating high enough up the value chain. Loads of people are using it, but it's not being used for tasks that directly contribute to value production," he told DW. Nvidia's upcoming earnings on November 19 may prove a key test of whether the AI boom still has legs. In the second quarter, Nvidia's data center sales alone made up 88% of total revenue, which hit a record $46.7 billion. For Q3, the company has guided $54 billion, projecting 54% year-on-year growth, which would equate to a full-year total of more than $200 billion. "With the exception of Nvidia, which is selling shovels in a gold rush, most generative AI companies are both wildly overvalued and wildly overhyped," Gary Marcus, Emeritus Professor of Psychology and Neural Science at New York University, told DW. "My guess is that it will all fall apart, possibly soon. The fundamentals, technical and economic, make no sense." Garran, meanwhile, believes the era of rapid progress in large language models (LLMs) is drawing to a close, not because of technical limits, but because the economics no longer stack up. "They [AI platforms] have already hit the wall," Garran said, adding that the cost of training new models is "skyrocketing, and the improvements aren’t much better." Striking a more positive tone, Sarah Hoffman, director of AI Thought Leadership at the New York-based market intelligence firm AlphaSense, predicted a "market correction" in AI, rather than a "cataclysmic 'bubble bursting.'" After an extended period of extraordinary hype, enterprise investment in AI will become far more discerning, Hoffmann told DW in an emailed statement, with the focus "shifting from big promises to clear proof of impact." "More companies will begin formally tracking AI ROI [return on investment] to ensure projects deliver measurable returns," she added. Edited by: Uwe Hessler

Title: OpenAI’s Government Lifeline: A $1T Ask Amid Wall Street’s AI Doubts

With years of experience in tech news and product reviews, we focus on providing reliable insights, balanced reviews, and practical guidance from actual people. Our goal is to help readers make informed decisions. Read more. Key Takeaways OpenAI has reportedly requested U.S. government loan guarantees to support what could become one of the largest private infrastructure buildouts in history, an AI expansion valued at more than $ 1 trillion. The plan also aligns with OpenAI’s broader effort to reduce its dependence on Nvidia’s costly GPU ecosystem, as it explores alternative financing and chip-sourcing strategies to sustain its trillion-dollar expansion into large-scale AI infrastructure. The timing is notable. While OpenAI seeks federal backing, segments of Wall Street are growing cautious about the sustainability of the AI rally. Hedge fund manager Michael Burry has reportedly taken substantial put positions against Nvidia and Palantir, betting on a correction in overextended AI equities. Meanwhile, banks such as Deutsche Bank are exploring hedges against their data-center exposure, anticipating a possible cooling period in AI infrastructure spending. It marks a clear divergence between Silicon Valley’s aggressive capital expansion and Wall Street’s tightening risk appetite—a contrast that could define the next phase of the AI investment cycle. Since its launch, OpenAI has attracted substantial private and corporate investment, led by its deep partnership with Microsoft. That backing has helped fuel its rapid expansion in both research and cloud-based AI services. Now, however, the company’s ambitions extend beyond traditional venture and corporate funding. OpenAI is pursuing federal loan guarantees, effectively positioning its AI infrastructure strategy as a public-private partnership. The move would shift part of the financial burden and risk of scaling artificial intelligence from private investors to the U.S. government, marking a significant evolution in how frontier technology projects are financed. At a recent conference, CFO Sarah Friar said the company is building “an ecosystem of banks, private equity, maybe even governmental” participants. In a typical scenario, technology companies raise debt through private markets, paying interest rates that reflect their credit risk. OpenAI’s proposal departs from that model. By seeking a federal loan guarantee, the company would transfer much of the default risk from lenders to the U.S. government. This backing would allow OpenAI to borrow at significantly lower rates and negotiate higher loan-to-value terms, reducing the overall cost of capital for its ambitious infrastructure plans. According to OpenAI’s Chief Financial Officer, Sarah Friar, government participation could “materially lower the cost of financing” while broadening the base of lenders willing to fund the project. For policymakers and taxpayers, the optics are complicated. A private technology firm seeking state-backed financing to build infrastructure that could accelerate automation (and potentially displace jobs) poses a political and ethical dilemma. Analysts have compared OpenAI’s proposal to historical frameworks, such as the Defense Production Act and Department of Energy loan programs, which supported the early electric vehicle and solar sectors. The difference this time lies in the asset class: AI infrastructure, not physical manufacturing. If the plan proceeds, the financial risk would be borne by the public, rather than the venture capital community that traditionally funds frontier technology. By tying its AI build-out to federal support, OpenAI is effectively redefining the boundary between public and private investment in computing infrastructure, hinting at a state–Silicon Valley hybrid model for the next era of technological expansion. In recent filings and market moves, the relentless AI bull run is starting to show visible signs of losing steam. Two very different actors are showing varying degrees of scepticism about the AI boom’s outlook: one a famed contrarian investor, and the other a multinational bank with significant exposure to the hardware boom. According to Scion Asset Management’s Q3 2025 13F filing, hedge fund manager Michael Burry has taken substantial put option positions against Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR), with a combined notional value of roughly $1.1 billion. These bearish bets account for approximately 80% of Scion’s disclosed U.S. equity portfolio, indicating a strong conviction that the current AI rally may have extended beyond its fundamentals. Burry’s positioning suggests he expects a significant correction in both AI hardware and software valuations, a contrarian view amid the sector’s explosive growth. However, it’s worth noting that 13F filings don’t include cash or foreign holdings, meaning Scion could be holding sizable reserves outside of its reported U.S. equity positions. Still, Burry’s track record invites caution in interpretation. His legendary short against the U.S. housing market in 2008 proved highly profitable but was long-dated and capital-intensive, requiring substantial collateral to maintain open positions. More recently, in 2023, Burry expressed a bearish outlook on social media platform X just before a major market rebound, a call he quietly deleted afterward. The takeaway? Undoubtedly, there is a risk that the AI bubble could pop. However, timing it correctly is the risky part; the market may well run a lot higher before a meaningful downturn. On a different front, Deutsche Bank is quietly rebalancing its exposure. The bank is reportedly exploring hedges and short baskets targeting AI-linked stocks and data center debt, as it evaluates its exposure to multibillion-dollar financing for compute infrastructure. With lenders themselves beginning to hedge their bets, the frenzy that only recently dominated AI investment may be beginning to morph into something more measured and cautious. OpenAI’s request for government-backed loan guarantees raises questions that go far beyond corporate finance. If Washington agrees to underwrite even a portion of a $1 trillion AI infrastructure plan, it would mark a defining shift for the industry, the point at which advanced computing transitions from a private enterprise to a state-subsidized utility. Economists warn that data centers and GPUs depreciate significantly faster than traditional infrastructure, creating a mismatch between the short lifespan of these assets and the long-term liabilities that taxpayers may be asked to support. Supporters counter that such a partnership could represent a digital-era form of industrial policy, ensuring U.S. leadership in AI and artificial general intelligence before global competitors, particularly China and emerging state-backed players in the Middle East, can scale comparable systems. The push reflects not just the scale of infrastructure but also a shift in how AI is delivered, from strictly enterprise systems to increasingly personalized, user-facing models that are being tailored for everyday interaction, featuring modular personalities and adult-mode customization. Critics, however, see a familiar pattern emerging: socialized risk and privatized rewards. Either way, the proposal forces a deeper question for the decade ahead — can the AI revolution sustain itself on private capital alone, or has it already grown too big to fail?

Title: No Brainer Dividend Stocks To Buy Now

Investing Realty Income (O) reported $1.08 FFO per share in Q3 with revenue up 10.5% year-over-year to $1.47B. United Parcel Service (UPS) plans to generate $3.5B in cost savings while focusing on high-margin areas. Pfizer (PFE) raised full-year EPS guidance to $3.00-$3.15 and targets $7.7B in net cost savings by 2027. Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. You cannot know the power of an investment unless you see the returns. Many think of dividend stocks as a way of generating cash income from their portfolio, but if you handle the income well, you can generate a higher total return through dividend reinvestment while boosting the long-term capital appreciation potential. Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS), and Realty Income (NYSE:O) are no-brainer dividend stocks to own right now. If you’re chasing long-term growth, you need to make dividend stocks an important part of your portfolio. They’re reliable, have an upside potential, and generate regular income. However, when picking dividend stocks, quality matters more than quantity. Here’s why they are no-brainer stocks that stand out in the industry. Realty Income is a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) that has a history of 112 consecutive quarterly dividend increases. This means about 28 years of quarterly dividend increases. The company takes pride in calling itself “The Monthly Dividend Company” since it pays monthly dividends and has a yield of 5.5%. Realty Income owns properties across the globe and has triple net leases on them. This allows the company to ensure steady rental income while keeping the operating costs at a minimum. The insurance, taxes, and maintenance costs are borne by the tenants, allowing the REIT to generate a higher cash flow and sustain dividends. In the third quarter results, the funds from operations (FFO) stood at $1.08 per share, and the revenue came in around $1.47 billion, up 10.5% year-over-year. The management has adjusted the full year guidance upwards and has a positive outlook for future growth. It has an occupancy rate of 98.7%, signalling confidence towards the business. During the quarter, it invested $1.36 billion across 123 properties and properties under development. Realty Income has a payout ratio of 75.29% and has an annual payout of $3.23 per share. Exchanging hands for $56.12, Realty Income stock has gained 6.6% in 2025 but has lost value over the last six months. This dip is a buying opportunity for income investors. RBC Capital has a price target of $61 with an Outperform rating. iStock Unreleased via Getty Images Logistics company United Parcel Service is known for the high yield and sustainable dividends. It has a juicy yield of 7.06% and has raised dividends for 16 consecutive years. Exchanging hands for $92, UPS is a solid buy below $100. The stock has lost 25% value in 2025 and has gone from the 52-week high of $138 to $92 today. Despite the dip, the dividend isn’t under any threat. United Parcel Service has increased dividends for over a decade, and while the future dividend growth may slow down, the payout rate will remain secure. UPS has seen a dip in earnings due to tariffs and inflation. However, the management has laid out a plan to generate $3.5 billion in savings. It is also focusing on high-margin areas and has reduced Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) deliveries. This could lead to margin expansion in the long term, allowing UPS to maintain the dividend growth streak. The company managed to beat estimates in the recently announced third-quarter results. Its revenue came in at $21.4 billion, while the EPS stood at $1.74. It reported a net income of $1.31 billion and expects fourth quarter revenue of $24 billion. The company has reduced the workforce significantly and is looking for other ways to cut costs. United Parcel Service has a payout ratio of 86.99%, and the annual payout is $6.56. It has a 5-year dividend growth rate of 10.42%, and its cash flow supports the dividend payout. I think the company’s turnaround has just begun, and there’s a lot more upside potential. It is a high-yield stock trading at a discount. Alexandros Michailidis / iStock Editorial via Getty Images Pfizer Inc. is slowly bouncing back and gaining traction. The company beat estimates in the third quarter results, and despite the fall in income, the management raised full-year guidance. It reported a revenue of $16.6 billion and an EPS of $0.87, down 18% year over year. This drop was due to the one-time adjustment towards a licensing deal with 3SBio. Pfizer is working on cost reduction measures to improve margins. It aims to achieve net cost savings of $4.5 billion by the end of 2025 and $7.7 billion by the end of 2027. The cost savings will be invested towards research and development for improving the pipeline programs. The management expects the full-year EPS in the range of $3 to $3.15, up from the previous outlook of $2.90 to $3.10. The company is in a clash for Metsera with Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO). Pfizer was set to acquire Metsera for $4.9 billion, which could give it a golden ticket to enter the obesity market. However, Novo Nordisk bid at $6 billion, triggering a bidding war. Pfizer has upgraded its bid to $8.1 billion. Pfizer is seeing high demand for its recent launches and acquired drugs, and the growth from these products could help offset the looming patent cliff losses. The management remains committed to dividend and will be working to improve shareholder value. Pfizer has a payout ratio of 13.13% and an annual dividend of $1.72. It has reported a 5-year dividend growth of 3.77%.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg Drops To Sixth-Richest After Meta Stock Slides

ByTy Roush, Forbes Staff. Mark Zuckerberg’s net worth was reduced by nearly $5 billion as Meta shares declined on Thursday, dropping him among the ranks of the world’s wealthiest after Reuters reported Meta projected a chunk of revenue would come from running advertisements for scams. Shares of Meta dropped 2.3% to around $620.75 as of Thursday morning, adding to a roughly 17.5% slide for the stock over the last week, which includes a single-day drop of more than 11% after Meta posted third-quarter earnings. Zuckerberg, who was ranked the world’s third-richest person early last week behind Oracle’s Larry Ellison ($298.8 billion) and Tesla’s Elon Musk ($496.5 billion), respectively, now ranks behind No. 3 Jeff Bezos ($257 billion), No. 4 Larry Page ($235 billion) and No. 5 Sergey Brin ($217.9 billion). Zuckerberg, who holds roughly 13% equity in Meta, had his net worth reduced by $4.6 billion (2.1%) as Meta’s shares dropped. Reuters reported Thursday, citing internal company documents, that Meta projected 10% of overall revenue—estimated at $16 billion—would come from running advertisements for scams and banned goods. Meta spokesperson Andy Stone told Reuters the documents cited by the outlet “present a selective view that distorts Meta’s approach to fraud and scams,” noting the company’s internal estimates were lower and that the 10% estimate included “many” legitimate ads.” Stone declined to give an updated figure to Reuters (Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment to Forbes). Other documents indicated Meta was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission for running ads for financial scams, Reuters reported. Regulators in the U.K. reported in 2023 that Meta’s products were involved in 54% of all payment-related scam losses that year, more than double all other social platforms combined.

Title: AI fatigue detected: 4 recent developments show the stock market's driving engine is at a crossroads

Every time Joe publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Good morning and welcome to First Trade. The Supreme Court is skeptical about President Trump's tariffs. It's still early innings, but watch this space for what this means about the future of the market. Rundown But first, traders are getting tired. Love Business Insider? Log into Google and make us a preferred source. Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up now Market musings The old saying goes that something happening once is an accident, twice is a coincidence, and three times is a pattern. Given developments in the AI space in recent days, it looks like we have a full-fledged pattern of skepticism. It's created an inflection point of sorts for a trade that seemed unstoppable as recently as last Tuesday, the last time the S&P 500 closed at record highs. Yes, stocks are coming off a strong day, but it feels like something has shifted under the surface. While three makes a pattern, I'll do you one better. Detailed below are four examples of AI exhaustion, in reverse chronological order, dating back one week: 1. Michael Burry comes out of hibernation to short some giants If Burry is emerging from the woodwork, you know something is afoot. The legendary "Big Short" investor dusted off his X account this week to compare the AI boom to the dot-com bubble. He also disclosed short wagers against market darlings Nvidia and Palantir. While Burry has made a series of bearish bets in recent years that haven't come to fruition, he certainly knows his way around an unsustainable bubble, and his views are an important contribution to the broader groundswell. 2. Sky-high valuations suddenly matter When Wall Street CEOs gathered at an investment summit in Hong Kong this week, few expected the high-profile guests to take a two-by-four to bullish stock portfolios. But that's exactly what Morgan Stanley's Ted Pick and Goldman Sachs' David Solomon did. They warned of a 10-20% drawdown in equities, characterizing it as a necessary and normal consolidation. In a different environment, the comments might've passed without incident. But with investors starting to question AI valuations, it confirmed some latent worries. On this same subject… 3. Palantir sells off big after crushing every conceivable earnings metric A record quarter? Meh. An increased profit forecast? Yawn. All anyone seemed to care about after Palantir's third-quarter earnings was how absurd the company's valuation was, with the stock up 174% year to date. The actual results rendered were irrelevant, offering a clear sign of exhaustion, and a desire from investors to regroup and reassess. 4. Meta's AI-spending pledge sends its stock tanking Loyal readers of First Trade will recognize this as a familiar trope that's been mentioned a handful of times already. Well, it really is that big of a deal. You know the story by now: Meta — already spending tens of billions on AI — said it plans to spend even more in 2026. That might've excited investors a few months ago, but this time around the forecast landed with a thud, and the stock tumbled. The message from investors was clear: we want tangible results, not an opaque money pit. Not convinced? Allow me to offer a visual aid that's specific to OpenAI's role in the fervor. The headline takeaway from this chart is how much Oracle's stock has come back down after a 36% single-day spike on Sept. 10, which was driven by giant new AI-cloud deals and the future revenue they could bring. That day, Oracle announced almost half a trillion dollars in new cloud contracts. A big chunk of that was from an OpenAI deal to develop data-center capacity. OpenAI essentially played kingmaker, as it has so much lately. Since then, OpenAI has unveiled a string of other giant AI infrastructure agreements. With doubts creeping in about OpenAI's ability to pay for all this, investors are discounting these deals. Hence the drop in Oracle shares. This recurring section will highlight individuals who have dominated the week in markets. This week's First Trade MVP is Miriam Adelson, the widow of Sheldon Adelson, founder and chairman of the casino company Las Vegas Sands, of which she and her family own a half-stake. This week's entry would be more aptly titled "MVP of the past two weeks," because LVS has been on a 24% tear over that period, since earnings after the closing bell on Oct. 22. That includes a 5% increase this week. LVS beat revenue forecasts, and saw especially strong growth at its Marina Bay Sands resort, which contributed to a 56% year-over-year sales increase for Singapore operations. The move has lifted Adelson's net worth to $39.9 billion, making her (and her family) the 45th-richest person in the world, according to Forbes data. And did I mention that she's the majority owner of the Dallas Mavericks? No word on how she feels about trading Luka Dončić for pennies. Business Insider's Will Edwards highlights investing recommendations pegged to the biggest trends in markets. One of the biggest questions in the market right now is how effective AI will be in raising profit margins. Tech firms are dumping tens of billions of dollars a year into building out infrastructure to support the technology, helping to propel US economic growth and stock-market gains. But will it ever pay off? For one company, the answer is already yes. And its stock is already seeing the benefits in a big way. Shares of CH Robinson (CHRW), a freight logistics firm, are up 49% year-to-date. After the company's third-quarter earnings report last week, the stock jumped about 20% in a single day. The stock is moving so dramatically because the company has begun using generative AI, said Travis Prentice, the founder of the Informed Momentum Company. AI is able to provide price quotes, book appointments, respond to emails, and process orders for the firm, allowing its shipments per person per day to have increased by 40% since 2022. Meanwhile, CH Robinson has reduced its employee base by more than 10%, boosting margins amid a 12% decline in expenses. "Not the most sexy business in the world, but when everyone talks about AI and there's no ROI with AI, this is a massive exception to the rules," Prentice told BI. "It's driving productivity gains of like 40-50%." "That's a story that no one's really talking about — AI is actually improving business operations," he continued. "They're one of the outliers, but I'm sure there's gonna be a lot to follow when they see the gains that they're having." — Will Edwards Joe Ciolli, executive editor and anchor, in Chicago.

November 06, 2025 04:05 ET | Source: DayTrading.com DayTrading.com LONDON, Nov. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Analysis from an investor with 60,000+ hours trading under his belt and a degree in Economics from Harvard examines the current valuation landscape of U.S. equities. DayTrading.com’s Dan Buckley started by looking at basic metrics, namely the forward Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio. This evaluates how much today’s investors are paying for each dollar of next year’s expected profit.The U.S. market is trading at roughly 23x forward earnings, which is far above the 15x times level seen in international markets. "This is an extreme gap, representing a roughly 51% void," Buckley says. "When valuations stretch this far, future returns are often modest at best and downright negative at worst." The last times the U.S. hit these sorts of valuations were: Buckley noted that since the 2021 peak, the U.S. stock market has delivered a compound annual return of around 9%, but before that, it went nearly a decade without making substantial, sustained gains. After the downturn in early 2022, U.S. equities took nearly two years just to get back to previous highs. A Market Bigger Than Its EconomyAnalysis from DayTrading.com reviewed several metrics highlighting a familiar pattern: global investors maintain a significant weighting in U.S. assets compared with the scale of the underlying economy. This imbalance reflects how influential U.S. markets have become within global portfolios and index benchmarks. U.S. Market ImbalanceThe research highlighted that the U.S. currently represents around 65% of the MSCI All Country World Index. This is a benchmark that guides billions in global investment flows. Yet by comparison, America produces only around 26% of the world’s economic output in nominal dollar terms, and it’s actually more like 15% when adjusted for the cost of living. Buckley noted that even investment vehicles labelled as "global" reflect this outsized concentration. For example, Vanguard’s Total World Stock ETF (VT), is often used as a diversified core holding by many institutions. That still invests around 66% of its assets in the U.S., with 4% just in Nvidia. "When one single chipmaker accounts for more in a portfolio than many entire countries, diversification is merely a slogan - not a reality," Buckley added. The Outsized Impact Of AIDayTrading.com's research took aim at AI, pointing out that roughly half of the S&P 500’s gains in 2025 stem from companies tied to artificial intelligence - semiconductor leaders, mega-cap platforms, and infrastructure providers. These include now household names like Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Palantir (PLTR). Buckley observed that AI has become a major focus for both markets and corporate strategy, but noted that the extent and pace of its long-term impact remain to be seen. "It’s true that AI will transform many businesses and their operations," he says. "But investors are pouring money in assuming every firm will be a winner, and better yet, all at the same time. But that’s rarely how innovation pays out – just look at the dot-com era, where many went under and only a few flourished." Market Perspective: A Measured ViewBuckley emphasized that his comments should not be interpreted as forecasting a market downturn. Rather, he offered a measured assessment of current U.S. equity conditions, noting potential areas of imbalance that may emerge when market expectations are elevated. While financial markets can often behave unpredictably, Buckley observed that not all sectors appear overextended. Certain segments—including financials, healthcare, select industrials, and international markets—continue to show valuations that align more closely with underlying fundamentals. “U.S. stocks don’t necessarily need a flood of negative news to experience adjustment,” Buckley noted. “Even subtle signs of strain can have an effect when perfection is already reflected in prices.”The full analysis is available here: U.S. Stocks: Great Expectations, Even Greater Valuations About DayTrading.comDayTrading.com is a platform that provides information and market analysis for individual investors.

The last times the U.S. hit these sorts of valuations were: Buckley noted that since the 2021 peak, the U.S. stock market has delivered a compound annual return of around 9%, but before that, it went nearly a decade without making substantial, sustained gains. After the downturn in early 2022, U.S. equities took nearly two years just to get back to previous highs. A Market Bigger Than Its EconomyAnalysis from DayTrading.com reviewed several metrics highlighting a familiar pattern: global investors maintain a significant weighting in U.S. assets compared with the scale of the underlying economy. This imbalance reflects how influential U.S. markets have become within global portfolios and index benchmarks. U.S. Market ImbalanceThe research highlighted that the U.S. currently represents around 65% of the MSCI All Country World Index. This is a benchmark that guides billions in global investment flows. Yet by comparison, America produces only around 26% of the world’s economic output in nominal dollar terms, and it’s actually more like 15% when adjusted for the cost of living. Buckley noted that even investment vehicles labelled as "global" reflect this outsized concentration. For example, Vanguard’s Total World Stock ETF (VT), is often used as a diversified core holding by many institutions. That still invests around 66% of its assets in the U.S., with 4% just in Nvidia. "When one single chipmaker accounts for more in a portfolio than many entire countries, diversification is merely a slogan - not a reality," Buckley added. The Outsized Impact Of AIDayTrading.com's research took aim at AI, pointing out that roughly half of the S&P 500’s gains in 2025 stem from companies tied to artificial intelligence - semiconductor leaders, mega-cap platforms, and infrastructure providers. These include now household names like Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Palantir (PLTR). Buckley observed that AI has become a major focus for both markets and corporate strategy, but noted that the extent and pace of its long-term impact remain to be seen. "It’s true that AI will transform many businesses and their operations," he says. "But investors are pouring money in assuming every firm will be a winner, and better yet, all at the same time. But that’s rarely how innovation pays out – just look at the dot-com era, where many went under and only a few flourished." Market Perspective: A Measured ViewBuckley emphasized that his comments should not be interpreted as forecasting a market downturn. Rather, he offered a measured assessment of current U.S. equity conditions, noting potential areas of imbalance that may emerge when market expectations are elevated. While financial markets can often behave unpredictably, Buckley observed that not all sectors appear overextended. Certain segments—including financials, healthcare, select industrials, and international markets—continue to show valuations that align more closely with underlying fundamentals. “U.S. stocks don’t necessarily need a flood of negative news to experience adjustment,” Buckley noted. “Even subtle signs of strain can have an effect when perfection is already reflected in prices.”The full analysis is available here: U.S. Stocks: Great Expectations, Even Greater Valuations About DayTrading.comDayTrading.com is a platform that provides information and market analysis for individual investors.

Title: Asian shares advance after solid earnings and economic reports updates lift Wall Street

Wall Street logged tiny gains before the bell with markets relying heavily on corporate earnings data for insight into how the U.S. economy is doing in the absence of government data due to the shutdown Wall Street logged tiny gains before the bell Thursday with markets relying heavily on corporate earnings data for insight into how the U.S. economy is doing in the absence of government data due to the shutdown. Futures for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were up 0.2% ahead of the market's open, while futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up 0.1%. Shares of Lyft rose 6.2% after hours, even as the ride-hailing app badly missed Wall Street's sales and profit targets. However, Lyft did post some of its best-ever numbers across several categories and investors seemed optimistic about the company's multiple corporate partnerships, many related to autonomous vehicles. Food delivery app DoorDash tumbled 12% overnight after it warned investors that it will be spending significantly more on product development next year. DoorDash's third-quarter revenue beat Wall Street targets but its profit fell short. That, combined with research and development costs rising 23% to $355 million, sent investors for the exits. Elsewhere, in Europe at midday Britain's FTSE 100 ticked down a modest 0.1% after the Bank of England kept its main interest rate unchanged at 4% as expected. Germany's DAX lost 0.3% while the CAC 40 in Paris declined 0.6%. In Asia, shares bounced back from a retreat the day before. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 jumped 1.3% to 50,883.68. Shares in Nissan Motor Co. fell 1.7% after the company said it was selling its headquarters building in Yokohama to raise cash. After trading closed, Nissan reported a 221.9 billion yen ($1.4 billion) loss for April-September and said its revenue dropped 7% from a year earlier. In South Korea, the Kospi advanced 0.6% to 4,026.45. Taiwan's Taiex was up 0.7%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 2.1% to 26,485.90, while the Shanghai Composite index climbed 0.1% to 4,007.76. However, shares in autonomous driving companies Pony.ai and WeRide fell in their debut on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Pony.ai lost 9.3%, while WeRide's shares fell 10%. Shares in Cathay Pacific Airways gained 4% after it announced that Qatar Airways was selling its 9.57% stake in the Hong Kong-based carrier in a buyback worth $896 million. The deal is subject to shareholder approval. The latest round of earnings offers Wall Street a source of information on consumers, businesses and the economy that is otherwise lacking amid the government shutdown. Important monthly updates on inflation and employment have ceased, leaving investors, economists and the Federal Reserve without a fuller picture of the economy. There are still several informative private economic updates that Wall Street can review, including the monthly report from ADP showed that private payrolls rose more than expected in October. The report offers a partial glimpse into the job market, which has been generally weakening and raising broader concerns about economic growth. A weaker job market remains a big concern for the Fed. The central bank cut its benchmark rate for the second time this year at its most recent meeting, in part to help bolster the economy amid a weakening job market. Lower interest rates can make loans and credit less expensive, potentially promoting economic growth. But, lower rates can also add fuel to inflation, which tends to stunt economic growth. In energy trading, U.S. benchmark crude gained 50 cents to $60.10 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, advanced 44 cents to $63.96 per barrel. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: What the $400 million Snap-Perplexity deal means for users

Every time Aditi publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Snapchat users will soon be able to use the app as an AI search tool. On Wednesday, the social media platform announced a deal to integrate Perplexity AI into Snap's search engine. Perplexity is paying Snap $400 million in cash and equity over a year. "Perplexity's AI-powered answer engine will let Snapchatters ask questions and get clear, conversational answers drawn from verifiable sources, all within Snapchat," Snap said in the Wednesday press release. The companies plan to roll out the Perplexity search engine in early 2026, per the release. A Perplexity spokesperson told Business Insider that user data from Snapchat would not be used for training its AI. "Our goal is to make AI more personal, social, and fun — woven into the fabric of your friendships, Snaps, and conversations," Snap's CEO, Evan Spiegel, said in the release. On Wednesday, Snap reported third-quarter revenue of $1.51 billion, a 10% increase compared to the same period last year. Its monthly active users increased 7% year-over-year to 943 million. Snap's stock price surged more than 17% in after-hours trading on Wednesday. Shares are down more than 35% this year. The Perplexity-Snapchat tieup follows the lead of other social media platforms, such as Meta and X, that have integrated AI chatbots into their app interfaces. In April 2024, Meta introduced the Meta AI chatbot on its applications, including Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook. The chatbot received mixed reviews from users, some of whom complained about it being activated unnecessarily and hindering the app experience. In December, Elon Musk's X launched the Grok chatbot on its app for all free users, which he called a "politically incorrect" alternative to other chatbots. The Perplexity deal comes as Snap is seeing a change in how its users interact. Spiegel said on Wednesday's earnings call that there has been an "engagement shift from things like friend stories to content posted on Spotlight." Spotlight is Snapchat's public discover page, where users can view short, entertaining videos, similar to TikTok's "For You Page," or Instagram's Reels. The company plans to introduce features like games and conversation starters to reignite connections between users. Jump to

Title: WeRide’s CEO pitches robotaxis as a solution to aging populations and long commutes, as the firm raises more money for R&D with a HK IPO
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/06/weride-ceo-tony-han-robotaxi-hong-kong-ipo-shares-safety/
Time Published: 2025-11-06T05:01:00Z
Full Content:
Nicholas Gordon is an Asia editor based in Hong Kong, where he helps to drive Fortune’s coverage of Asian business and economics news. Shares of WeRide start trading on Hong Kong’s stock exchange today, just over a year after the robotaxi firm forayed into U.S. markets with a Nasdaq listing. For founder and CEO Tony Han, the offering is part of a global strategy to fund the expensive but necessary research behind the company’s autonomous-driving tech. WeRide’s shares are now listed on both the Nasdaq and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. WeRide elected for a dual primary listing, which will allow mainland Chinese investors to buy the stock through the city’s Southbound Stock Connect scheme. “We want to make our stock more accessible to investors all over the world,” Han told Fortune in late October, on the sidelines of the Fortune Global Forum. “China is a very important market, both for consumers and also for investors. A Hong Kong dual listing actually helps some potential investors who can only invest in the Hong Kong stock market to buy our stock.” Han says the funds raised through the Hong Kong listing will help the robotaxi firm continue to spend on R&D and deployment. “We will still need to raise more funds,” he said, “so this will put WeRide in a much better position to access more funds.” Fellow robotaxi firm Pony AI also starts trading in Hong Kong today after its own IPO on that exchange. Like WeRide, Pony AI listed on the Nasdaq late last year. Hong Kong’s IPO market is booming as Chinese firms hope to leverage the city’s access to both international and mainland Chinese capital. Firms listed in mainland China, including home appliance manufacturer Midea and battery-maker CATL, have launched secondary listings in Hong Kong in order to draw international investment. Yet several U.S.-listed Chinese companies are also considering primary listings in Hong Kong in order to access mainland Chinese investors. There’s also a geopolitical dimension: U.S.-listed Chinese firms may see Hong Kong as a backup in the event the Trump administration decides to delist them from U.S. exchanges, as part of a yearslong dispute between Washington and Beijing over auditing standards. The city’s Southbound Stock Connect scheme allows certified investors in mainland China to buy stocks listed in Hong Kong. Southbound flows hit a record $110 billion in the first seven months of the year, according to the South China Morning Post citing data from Wind, already greater than the entire total in 2024. Investors are flocking to AI firms and “new consumption”—think Pop Mart and Labubu. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index is up around 32% for the year so far; by comparison, the Nasdaq Golden Dragon Index, which tracks U.S.-listed Chinese companies, is up 22%. WeRide raised $308 million in its Hong Kong IPO, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. Shares were priced at 27.10 Hong Kong dollars, a slight discount to the stock’s Nasdaq price at Monday’s close. WeRide HK-listed shares fell almost 12% on their first day of Hong Kong trading; the firm’s shares have lost over 40% of their value since the U.S. IPO. Pony AI’s HK shares fell around 14%. Tony Han, formerly chief scientist at Baidu’s autonomous vehicle unit, founded WeRide in 2017. Based in Guangzhou, the self-driving vehicle company operates in several major Chinese cities, as well as markets outside China. The company has deployments in Singapore, France, Spain, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, among others. WeRide is now testing or operating vehicles in 30 cities across 11 countries. WeRide is a member of this year’s Future 50, Fortune’s annual ranking of companies with the greatest potential for growth. The firm is also a member of this year’s Change the World list, which highlights companies that are doing social good through their business models. Han evangelizes the many ways that self-driving vehicles—and moving away from a car-centric culture—can improve society. He predicts that accident rates will be “drastically reduced” once cars are put in the hands of computers as opposed to humans. “Most accidents, we find, are due to human factors,” Han explained, citing the effects of drinking, drowsiness, and distraction on human drivers. “Machines won’t be drunk, won’t overdose. Machines are very reliable. Fatal accident rates for robotaxis are much lower than human drivers.” Less congestion could be another benefit of automated vehicles. “Robotaxis will never speed, will never just cut in line,” he said. “Traffic will just flow much more smoothly.” There’s a broader economic argument for self-driving cars in countries whose populations are rapidly aging as birth rates decline—a particularly thorny problem in China and elsewhere in Asia. “With such huge markets, we will need lots of labor in transport and mobility,” Han said. “If we are shorthanded, then we have to use AI to replace the shortage, to fill the gap between demand and requirements.” That extends to public transport and public services. WeRide runs robobuses, robosweepers, and other automated forms of public transit and city vehicles. “The cost of bus drivers in a developed economy is quite high,” Han explained. If these costs can be reduced through automation, he argued, then cities can expand their transit systems and “help build more eco-friendly transportation for the whole planet.” WeRide reported $27.9 million in revenue for the first six months of 2025, a 32% jump from the same period a year earlier. Still, the company reported a $110 million net loss for that same period, owing in large part to spending of $90 million on research and development, approaching the $107 million spent on R&D for all of 2024. Robotaxis remain an expensive and unprofitable proposition. An HSBC report in July pointed out that self-driving cars have a lot of hidden costs, including remote supervisors, charging and parking infrastructure, and tech support. The bank suggested that robotaxis might not break even until about eight years after launch. Yet HSBC also predicted that robotaxis will likely reach their commercial potential in China first, owing to greater adoption and acceptance of robotaxi technologies. Chinese companies are leading the global push for robotaxis. In addition to WeRide and Pony AI, Baidu is also expanding its robotaxi offerings through its Apollo Go vehicles. China also manufactures many of the components that go into self-driving cars. One key component producer is Hesai Technology, the world’s leading producer of automotive lidar sensors, which are used by robotaxis and other autonomous vehicles to recognize their environment and avoid obstacles. Global ride-share companies are taking notice. WeRide is offering its Middle Eastern robotaxis through a partnership with Uber. Singaporean ride-hailing firm Grab has also made a strategic equity investment in WeRide, and is working with the Chinese firm to offer its Robotaxi GXRs and robobuses in Singapore starting next year. Singaporean transit company ComfortDelGro, meanwhile, is working with Pony AI to explore offering robotaxis, while Lyft is collaborating with Baidu to test its Apollo Go self-driving cars in Europe. By comparison, U.S.-based robotaxi operations are proving to be a lot slower in global expansion. Waymo currently operates in Tokyo and London. Han isn’t surprised that global firms are now embracing Chinese robotaxis. After all, if China offers the best product, why wouldn’t foreign firms want to cooperate with it? “When I was a teenager, we bought electronics from Japan, tools from Germany, and computers from the U.S. It’s very normal. It’s very normal,” Han said. “If WeRide can supply good robotaxi technology and services to Uber, and in turn, Uber and WeRide together bring a very efficient and comfortable taxi service to ordinary people; why shouldn’t we do that?” Clarification, Nov. 6, 2025: This article has been updated to clarify that WeRide will offer both robotaxi and robobus services in Singapore, as well as to note the total number of markets the firm operates in.

November 05, 2025 20:30 ET | Source: WeRide Inc. WeRide Inc. HONG KONG, Nov. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WeRide (HKEX: 0800.HK, NASDAQ: WRD), a global leader in autonomous driving technology, today announced its successful listing on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (HKEX) under the stock code 0800.HK, becoming the world's first Robotaxi company to be publicly traded on both Hong Kong and US exchanges. With that, WeRide also becomes the world's first Robotaxi and autonomous driving technology company to achieve a dual primary listing on both HKEX and NASDAQ. Under its Hong Kong listing, WeRide issued a total of 88.25 million shares (pre-greenshoe), with 17.65 million shares offered publicly and 70.60 million shares for international placement. The offer price was set at HKD 27.1 per share, raising a total of approximately HKD 2.39 billion (pre-greenshoe). Dr. Tony Han, Founder and CEO of WeRide, had voluntarily committed to a three-year lock-up on October 28, 2025, pledging not to sell any of his shares for the next three years. This demonstrated the founder's and management team's confidence in WeRide's fundamentals and growth, as well as their full commitment to the company's long-term vision and global expansion. "We are deeply grateful to our partners, investors, customers, and every member of the WeRide team. Your trust and dedication have helped turn our vision of autonomous driving into reality. Over the past eight years, WeRide has evolved from technological innovation to commercial operation, becoming the only company worldwide with products holding autonomous driving permits in seven countries, and deployments in over 30 cities across 11 countries. We firmly believe that safe and reliable autonomous driving technology will deliver huge economic and social benefits. Our Hong Kong listing marks a new beginning, and we will continue to lead with technology, drive global commercial deployment, and deliver long-term, sustainable value for our shareholders and society," said Dr. Tony Han, Founder and CEO of WeRide, at the listing ceremony. Founded in 2017, WeRide was listed on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange on October 25, 2024, becoming the world's first publicly listed Robotaxi and universal autonomous driving technology company. The HKEX listing broadens its investor base and access to capital markets, enabling deeper investment in technology R&D and accelerating the global deployment of its autonomous vehicle fleet. Powered by its proprietary WeRide One universal autonomous driving technology platform, WeRide offers Level 2 to Level 4 (L4) products and services across smart mobility, smart logistics, and smart sanitation, including the Robotaxi, Robobus, Robosweeper, Robovan and ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems). With WeRide GENESIS, its self-developed, closed-loop simulation engine, WeRide has also significantly lowered road testing costs and safety risks, accelerating product iteration efficiency, market expansion speed, and commercial deployment scale. Currently, WeRide is the only technology company in the world with products holding autonomous driving permits in seven countries – China, the UAE, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, France, Belgium, and the US. The company operates a fleet of more than 1,500 L4 vehicles, including over 700 Robotaxis. Partnering with Uber in Abu Dhabi, WeRide operates the largest commercial Robotaxi fleet outside of China and the US. Looking ahead, WeRide plans to deploy tens of thousands of Robotaxis by 2030. On industry collaboration, WeRide continues to attract leading global investors and ecosystem partners, building a strategic network with companies such as NVIDIA, Bosch, Uber, Grab, and Renault-Nissan.
