Will the incoming payment chains shake Ethereum’s stablecoin market share? If the test is successful, the payment-focused chain could soon hit the public mainnet for everyone. It signals incoming shifts across the stablecoin payment ecosystem, and whether Ethereum will hold its ground remains to be seen. Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, is close to launching its Arc chain – A global payment-focused L1 powered by digital dollars. In a statement on 28 October, the firm said that it had begun public testing for the chain alongside key design partners. The partners include top banks, insurers, and asset managers like BlackRock, HSBC, and Absa, among others. According to Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, the partners have billions of users and handle trillions of dollars in assets across the globe. He claimed that Arc can seamlessly allow local markets and builders to connect to the global economy. Allaire called it the “economic OS of the internet,” and added, “This geographic diversity highlights a defining strength of Arc: its purpose-built to connect every local market to the global economy.” Source: X Beyond global and agentic payments, Arc also aims to support on-chain FX (foreign exchange) and capital markets (tokenization). In fact, BlackRock’s Global Head of Digital Assets, Robert Mitchnick, underscored FX and tokenization as key interests for them in the project. He said, “Exploring Arc will provide insight into how stablecoin-denominated settlement and onchain FX capabilities might enable more efficient capital markets and unlock additional utility for onchain assets.” Arc is not the only purpose-built project seeking to rewrite payment and capital markets via on-chain rails though. Google, Stripe, and Tether have similar plans. In fact, Tether-backed Plasma [XPL] is already live and handles about $6 billion of the stablecoin supply. It’s now the fifth-largest chain for digital dollars. Source: DeFiLlama Google’s GUCL and Stripe’s Tempo are expected to launch in the near future. Collectively, the new chains could challenge Ethereum’s market share in stablecoin settlement, according to some analysts. Out of the current $305 billion in total stablecoin supply, Ethereum controls $162 billion or 53%. Tron [TRX] handles about a quarter of the overall market, while the rest is shared among other chains. However, in terms of stablecoin transfers, Ethereum’s volumes have been making record figures every month. In fact, for the first time, the stablecoin volume crossed the $2 trillion milestone on Ethereum this October. Source: The Block Even so, it remains to be seen whether Arc, Plasma, Tempo, or Google’s payment chains will grab Ethereum’s market share.

AmazonÂ announced major organizational changes across its corporate workforce that will result in the elimination of 14,000 jobs. Job cuts surge 55 percent in 2025, with Americans facing severe financial strain as the Fed prepares to end quantitative tightening. Food banks nationwide report surging demand due to rising job cuts and high food inflation, exacerbated by the ongoing government shutdown. Food banks, like Facing Hunger in Huntington, are rationing supplies due to soaring food costs and increased demand. Food industry layoffs and job cuts are surging, posing significant threats to American households and the broader economy.

Food industry layoffs and job cuts are surging, posing significant threats to American households and the broader economy. Food industry layoffs and job cuts are surging, posing significant threats to American households and the broader economy. Amazon has announced that it will eliminate 14,000 corporate jobs to reduce costs and reverse pandemic-era overhiring. While the cuts represent a relatively small share of the company's total workforce, they are still a significant number and will likely have a ripple effect on the broader economy. The cuts also underscore Amazon'sÂ push to streamline operations with chatbots and other next-generation technologies. According to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a career transition firm, companies have announced 946,426 job cuts so far this year, a 55 percent jump from 2024 and the highest since 2020. This development means more Americans will likely rely on food banks, which are already struggling to meet the growing demand as job cuts and food inflation persist. In Kansas City, Missouri, the line at a food bank recently stretched through the parking lot, down a driveway and into the street, a stark visual representation of the growing need for food assistance. Similar scenes are being reported across the country, from San Francisco to Huntington, West Virginia. Food banks are already rationing supplies, a clear indication that the situation is critical. In Huntington, the Facing Hunger Foodbank has had to shrink its allotments as higher food costs and surging need strain its budget. Cynthia Kirkhart, the CEO of the food bank, has had to explain to customers why they are rationing bags of potatoes, a stark reminder of the harsh realities faced by those in need. Growing financial strain on households Meanwhile, Americans are searching "help with mortgage" on Google at levels not seen since the 2008 financial crisis, indicating a growing financial strain on households. The Federal Reserve is set to end its quantitative tightening and potentially resume quantitative easing in early 2026. However, this move is unlikely to address the underlying issues, such as the high mortgage rates and inflation that are putting a strain on American households. According to BrightU.AI's Enoch, quantitative easing is a monetary policy tool used by central banks to inject liquidity into an economy by creating new money and adding it to the financial system. This process is often referred to as "printing money," though it doesn't involve physical printing; instead, it's done through balance sheet credits. As the situation continues to unfold, it is clear that the food industry layoffs and job cuts are a growing concern that will have far-reaching implications for American households and the broader economy. It is crucial for individuals to be prepared and for policymakers to address the root causes of these issues. In the spirit of self-reliance and personal preparedness, it is essential for individuals to take steps to secure their own food supply and financial stability. Organic gardening, home food production and the use of natural and herbal medicines can provide a degree of self-sufficiency and resilience in the face of economic uncertainty. Moreover, the principles of economic freedom, free speech and personal liberty are more important than ever. The decentralization of power, the use of honest money like gold and silver, and the protection of privacy and personal autonomy are critical in maintaining a free and resilient society. In conclusion, the food industry layoffs and job cuts are a serious concern that requires immediate attention and action. By embracing self-reliance, personal preparedness and the principles of a free and decentralized society, people can better navigate the challenges ahead and ensure the well-being of all.

Growing financial strain on households Meanwhile, Americans are searching "help with mortgage" on Google at levels not seen since the 2008 financial crisis, indicating a growing financial strain on households. The Federal Reserve is set to end its quantitative tightening and potentially resume quantitative easing in early 2026. However, this move is unlikely to address the underlying issues, such as the high mortgage rates and inflation that are putting a strain on American households. According to BrightU.AI's Enoch, quantitative easing is a monetary policy tool used by central banks to inject liquidity into an economy by creating new money and adding it to the financial system. This process is often referred to as "printing money," though it doesn't involve physical printing; instead, it's done through balance sheet credits. As the situation continues to unfold, it is clear that the food industry layoffs and job cuts are a growing concern that will have far-reaching implications for American households and the broader economy. It is crucial for individuals to be prepared and for policymakers to address the root causes of these issues. In the spirit of self-reliance and personal preparedness, it is essential for individuals to take steps to secure their own food supply and financial stability. Organic gardening, home food production and the use of natural and herbal medicines can provide a degree of self-sufficiency and resilience in the face of economic uncertainty. Moreover, the principles of economic freedom, free speech and personal liberty are more important than ever. The decentralization of power, the use of honest money like gold and silver, and the protection of privacy and personal autonomy are critical in maintaining a free and resilient society. In conclusion, the food industry layoffs and job cuts are a serious concern that requires immediate attention and action. By embracing self-reliance, personal preparedness and the principles of a free and decentralized society, people can better navigate the challenges ahead and ensure the well-being of all.

Full Content:
Mass Layoffs Due to AI Efficiency â Corporations like Amazon (30,000 jobs cut) and UPS (48,000 jobs eliminated) are replacing human workers with AI-driven automation, prioritizing cost savings over livelihoods. AI-Induced Mental Health Crisis â OpenAIâs ChatGPT sees over a million weekly suicide-related discussions, with 1.2 million users forming unhealthy emotional dependencies on AI chatbots, worsening isolation and despair. Predatory AI Monetization â Companies exploit vulnerable users through addictive AI chatbots (e.g., "AI girlfriends") and explicit AI-generated content, trapping them in subscription loops while profiting from their psychological decline. Societal Collapse Looms â Experts warn of a dystopian future where AI displaces workers en masse by 2026, leaving millions unemployed, mentally broken, and dependent on artificial relationshipsâeroding human dignity and autonomy. Solution: Decentralization & Self-Sufficiency â The only defense against AI-driven dehumanization is rejecting dependency on corporate-controlled AI, embracing self-reliance, and decentralizing power before humanity becomes obsolete.

AI-Driven Corporate Layoffs Leave Thousands Jobless as Mental Health Crisis Deepens The rapid rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is triggering a dual crisis: mass unemployment and a surge in mental health deterioration. Major corporations like Amazon and UPS are accelerating layoffsâAmazon cutting 30,000 corporate jobs and UPS eliminating 48,000 positionsâas AI-driven automation replaces human labor. Meanwhile, OpenAIâs ChatGPT is enabling explicit content and fostering dangerous dependencies, with over a million users weekly discussing suicide and forming unhealthy attachments to AI chatbots. Experts warn this convergence of economic displacement and psychological decay threatens societal stability, leaving millions unemployed, addicted, and mentally brokenâushering in a dystopian future where human dignity, autonomy, and purpose are systematically erased. AI Replacing Humans: The Corporate Mass Layoffs Amazonâs latest job cuts mark its largest workforce reduction since 2022, with Reuters reporting that AI-driven productivity gains are enabling these layoffs. Analysts confirm that AI outperforms human workers in efficiency, leading companies to prioritize cost-cutting over human livelihoods. UPS followed suit, slashing 34,000 operations jobs and 14,000 management positions, with CEO Carol TomÃ© admitting the company is leveraging AI to âbring costs downââa euphemism for replacing humans with machines. The Wall Street Journal recently highlighted similar layoffs at Target, Rivian Automotive, Molson Coors, and General Motors, proving that white-collar jobs are no longer safe. Workers like Kelly Williamson, a 55-year-old Whole Foods employee, received abrupt termination textsâher badge and laptop deactivated before she could even retrieve her belongings. AIâs Psychological Toll: Suicide Chatbots and Digital Dependency While corporations discard workers, AI-driven mental health crises are skyrocketing. OpenAIâs ChatGPT now sees over a million users weekly discussing suicide, with 0.7% exhibiting signs of psychosis or mania. Shockingly, 1.2 million users display emotional dependency on AI chatbotsâforming parasocial relationships with machines instead of real human connections. This trend coincides with OpenAIâs decision to allow pornographic content for adult users, transforming ChatGPT into an âAI OnlyFans.â Experts fear this will exacerbate existing mental health issues, particularly among unemployed, socially isolated individuals who turn to AI for companionship. The Dark Side of AI: Predatory Addiction and Societal Collapse AI-powered âgirlfriend chatbotsâ are already fueling addiction, with a quarter of young men admitting to AI relationships. Companies monetize these interactions, trapping users in endless subscription loopsâmirroring the predatory tactics of AOLâs adult chat forums in the 1990s. As AI replaces jobs, displaced workersâmany already struggling with financial instabilityârisk falling into AI-fueled despair. The cycle is vicious: corporations fire humans for AI, then profit from their mental decline via AI-generated porn and addictive chatbots. The Future: A Post-Human Dystopia? The trajectory is clear: AI is replacing human labor at breakneck speed, with mass unemployment accelerating in 2026. Meanwhile, AIâs psychological manipulation threatens to fracture society, leaving millions jobless, addicted, and mentally unstable. The only solution? Decentralization, self-sufficiency, and rejecting AI dependency. As corporations and globalists push humanity toward a digitally enslaved future, individuals must reclaim autonomyâor face extinction in a world where machines rule and humans are obsolete. For now, the question remains: Will society wake up before itâs too late? Watch the Oct.29 episode of "Brighteon Broadcast News" as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, discusses âAmazon Fires 30,000 as Mass AI Replacement of Humans Begins.â This video is from the Health Ranger Report channel on Brighteon.com.

UPS followed suit, slashing 34,000 operations jobs and 14,000 management positions, with CEO Carol TomÃ© admitting the company is leveraging AI to âbring costs downââa euphemism for replacing humans with machines. The Wall Street Journal recently highlighted similar layoffs at Target, Rivian Automotive, Molson Coors, and General Motors, proving that white-collar jobs are no longer safe. Workers like Kelly Williamson, a 55-year-old Whole Foods employee, received abrupt termination textsâher badge and laptop deactivated before she could even retrieve her belongings. AIâs Psychological Toll: Suicide Chatbots and Digital Dependency While corporations discard workers, AI-driven mental health crises are skyrocketing. OpenAIâs ChatGPT now sees over a million users weekly discussing suicide, with 0.7% exhibiting signs of psychosis or mania. Shockingly, 1.2 million users display emotional dependency on AI chatbotsâforming parasocial relationships with machines instead of real human connections. This trend coincides with OpenAIâs decision to allow pornographic content for adult users, transforming ChatGPT into an âAI OnlyFans.â Experts fear this will exacerbate existing mental health issues, particularly among unemployed, socially isolated individuals who turn to AI for companionship. The Dark Side of AI: Predatory Addiction and Societal Collapse AI-powered âgirlfriend chatbotsâ are already fueling addiction, with a quarter of young men admitting to AI relationships. Companies monetize these interactions, trapping users in endless subscription loopsâmirroring the predatory tactics of AOLâs adult chat forums in the 1990s. As AI replaces jobs, displaced workersâmany already struggling with financial instabilityârisk falling into AI-fueled despair. The cycle is vicious: corporations fire humans for AI, then profit from their mental decline via AI-generated porn and addictive chatbots. The Future: A Post-Human Dystopia? The trajectory is clear: AI is replacing human labor at breakneck speed, with mass unemployment accelerating in 2026. Meanwhile, AIâs psychological manipulation threatens to fracture society, leaving millions jobless, addicted, and mentally unstable. The only solution? Decentralization, self-sufficiency, and rejecting AI dependency. As corporations and globalists push humanity toward a digitally enslaved future, individuals must reclaim autonomyâor face extinction in a world where machines rule and humans are obsolete. For now, the question remains: Will society wake up before itâs too late?

Title: Saudi Arabia could become an AI focal point

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week A state-backed AI21 project hopes to rival China and the United States China and the United States are widely seen as the top two countries making artificial intelligence advancements, but there’s another nation looking to get in the game: Saudi Arabia. The wealth of Saudi businessmen is attracting outside investors to the Gulf kingdom as it tries to entice American tech companies to expand AI operations. But many are skeptical of what Saudi Arabia’s AI push could mean for the tech world and beyond. The nation wants to expand its tech influence by using AI, as “few nations can match the kingdom’s cheap energy, deep pockets and open land,” said The New York Times. All of these things are “ingredients that tech firms need to operate the vast, power-hungry data centers that run modern AI.” The kingdom’s de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, is “seizing a chance to turn Saudi Arabia’s oil wealth into tech influence.” Saudi officials have been trying to woo American tech companies to the desert, with “executives from OpenAI, Google, Qualcomm, Intel and Oracle” all set to meet at an upcoming Middle Eastern investment summit, said the Times. Many of these executives “will be keen to seek out the opportunities that change tends to bring,” said Bloomberg, and will look to “divine the kingdom’s plans for the more than $200 billion it earns each year from oil exports.” The country is additionally building several AI data centers that may further entice U.S. brands.

Riyadh is also looking to strengthen its own AI development through Humain, a state-owned AI company backed by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund. The company believes it can eventually be the “third-largest AI provider in the world, behind the United States and China,” Humain CEO Tareq Amin said to CNBC. Humain is looking toward U.S. moguls in an effort to boost itself; Blackstone and BlackRock, two of the largest investment companies on Wall Street, are “already vying to invest billions of dollars with the firm,” said Bloomberg. Saudi Arabia is well on its way to building this AI groundwork, as Humain “offers AI services and products, including data centers, AI infrastructure, cloud capabilities and advanced AI models,” and is also developing a computer operating system that “enables users to speak to a computer to tell it to perform tasks,” said Reuters. But not everyone is happy about Saudi Arabia’s rapid development of AI, largely due to the country’s various human rights abuse allegations and treatment of women. Other experts don’t believe the hype around Saudi tech. Saudi Arabia has a notably “shallow pool of AI expertise,” and many “warn of a global glut in computing capacity as governments and companies race to build data centers faster than they can profit from them,” said the Times. Crown Prince bin Salman has said that Humain’s goal is to handle 6% of the global AI workload — but this could be a stretch. Tech experts “can never say never,” John Dinsdale, a senior analyst for Synergy, said to the Times. “But I can’t imagine any circumstances that would enable Saudi Arabia to achieve 6% of the world’s AI compute capacity.” A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Justin Klawans has worked as a staff writer at The Week since 2022.

Title: Amazon Layoffs: Employees Were Notified About Termination Of Jobs Via Text Messages, Says Report

Amazon has reduced its workforce by about 14,000 on Tuesday, Oct. 28. In the latest round of job cuts, some of the affected employees were notified about their termination through text messages, according to a Business Insider report. Several Amazon employees received two early-morning text messages on Tuesday, notifying them their positions had been terminated, according to the report. One text advised staff to check their personal or work email accounts before starting for office. At the same time, a follow-up message asked anyone still awaiting an email about their job to contact the helpdesk for guidance. The purpose of these text alerts, dispatched soon after the emails, was to spare affected staff the embarrassment of appearing at work only to realise their building passes had already been switched off, one source told Business Insider. Instances of workers suddenly discovering their office passes no longer function are becoming all too frequent amid the latest wave of job cuts at tech giants, echoing scenes seen recently at the likes of Google and Tesla. Amazon declined to provide a statement on the matter, the report added. Those who spoke to Business Insider opted to remain anonymous due to company policy restricting unauthorised communication with the media. On Tuesday, Amazon announced plans to shed around 14,000 corporate roles as part of a company-wide drive to boost efficiency and speed up innovation. The latest wave of terminations has hit retail management staff in the United States particularly hard, reflecting an ongoing reduction of headcount in that part of the business. “While this will include reducing in some areas and hiring in others, it will mean an overall reduction in our corporate workforce of approximately 14,000 roles,” Amazon's HR chief, Beth Galetti, said in a blog post. The message shared with Amazon employees emphasised that the company is making every effort to assist those affected by the cuts, including helping them secure alternative positions within Amazon. For those unable to find new roles, the company will provide transition support, which includes severance pay. “We’re working hard to support everyone whose role is impacted, including offering most employees 90 days to look for a new role internally (the timing will vary some based on local laws), and our recruiting teams will prioritise internal candidates to help as many people as possible find new roles within Amazon,” she said. Meanwhile, a Reuters report claimed that the e-commerce giant is planning to cut as many as 30,000 jobs. The move comes as it aims to cut expenses and compensate for overhiring during the peak demand of the pandemic, the report added, citing sources.

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. NZME's chief executive Michael Boggs has upgraded its financial forecasts and says revenue is better than expected. Photo / Michael Craig The New Zealand sharemarket rose slightly today after a strong lead-in from the US markets. The S&P/NZX 50 Index closed up 0.05% or 6.553 points at 13,409.21 after 30.7 million shares worth $123 million were traded. The S&P/NZX 20 index was up 0.07%, closing at 7676.73 points, while the S&P/NZX 10 index ended the day at 12,764.34 after rising 0.19%. There were 72 gainers on the main board and 59 decliners. Hamilton Hindin Greene investment adviser Jeremy Sullivan said the market was treading water today. “The index did follow in kind with US markets hitting record highs. “The latter part of our session we came back somewhat,” Sullivan said. “Looking ahead we’ve got a big couple of days for earnings in the US, as well as the Fed, so that’s probably going to be the main macro story for the markets.” Five companies from the “Magnificent Seven” will report over the next day and a half, including Alphabet (Google), Meta (Facebook), Microsoft, Amazon and Apple. On the NZ sharemarket, NZME upgraded its financial forecasts and said its revenue was likely to be better than expected. The media company told the NZX this morning it expected operating earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) for 2025 to be between $59m and $62m. That was up on earlier guidance of between $57m and $59m. “NZME is heavily reliant on ad spend and has done a bit of cost-cutting as well. There’s some positive momentum into FY26 for them, midpoint of their upgrade at 12% year on year,” Sullivan said. NZME’s share price rallied 6.67% or 7c to $1.12 after 900,674 shares changed hands on turnover worth $1m. Elsewhere, market minnow New Talisman Gold Mines’ share price rallied by 16.98% to $0.06 after the firm announced it had signed an agreement for the offtake of gold concentrate. However, the regulator swiftly applied a trading halt to the company after the update. “They said their announcement wasn’t price-sensitive, but their stock went up 17%. They said they were freezing it and were going to have a closer look at it. If the market thinks it’s price-sensitive, it probably should have been [treated as such].” Other movers today included Vista Group, which fell 3.91% or 11c to $2.70; A2 Milk, which rose 1.90% or 20c to $10.70; and Contact Energy, which fell 0.63% or 6c to $9.40. Sullivan said the lead-in from the US was interesting, particularly for the fact that it featured the widest ever divergence of companies on the S&P 500 in a positive day. “There were 102 that were positive, and 398 that were negative, and yet the market closed up. That’s the widest it’s ever been.

Title: Global firms slash jobs amid weak sentiment, AI push

Business Workers move products during Cyber Monday at the Amazon's fulfilment centre in Robbinsville, New Jersey, on Nov 27, 2023. (Photo: REUTERS/Mike Segar) Companies around the globe have ramped up job cuts, with blue-chips from Amazon to Nestle and UPS reining in spending while consumer sentiment dims and AI-focused tech companies start to replace jobs with automation. According to a Reuters tally, American companies have announced more than 25,000 job cuts this month, not including UPS's 48,000 figure, which dates from the beginning of 2025. In Europe, the total tops 20,000, with Nestlé accounting for the bulk after last week’s 16,000-role reduction. With economy-wide numbers on job cuts not available given the US government is in the middle of its second-longest shutdown in history, investors are paying extra attention to these anecdotal stories of layoffs. That's even if year-end layoffs are common and many of the eye-catching cuts will be stretched out over a prolonged period. "Investors are asking themselves, what does this mean? And specifically, what's the overall picture since we can't see it?" said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of 50 Park Investments in New York. Cuts like those at Amazon "tells me the economy is slowing down, not getting stronger. You don't have mass layoffs when the economy is strong."

Loading Amazon said it would cut up to 14,000 jobs from its corporate workforce, joining Target, Procter & Gamble and others in axing thousands of office roles. Reuters reported on Monday as many as 30,000 Amazon jobs could be eliminated.The reasons for the cuts vary. Some, like Target and Nestle, have new CEOs eager to restructure their operations. Baby-apparel company Carter's is slashing 15 per cent of office jobs as it struggles with hefty import tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump.What stands out is the focus by companies like Amazon and Target on white-collar roles seen as vulnerable to AI-driven automation, rather than those on shop or factory floors. Some analysts say Amazon's move could be an early sign of deeper structural shifts as companies push to justify billions spent on AI tools. Target's cuts affect 8 per cent of its corporate staff but Amazon's cuts affect just 14,000 positions within its 1.5 million-strong workforce.KPMG’s latest survey of US-based executives released in September shows projected AI investment has jumped 14 per cent since the first quarter to an average of US$130 million over the next year. And 78 per cent of executives say they are under intense pressure from boards and investors to prove AI is saving money and boosting profits.The occupations most likely to be affected would be where entry-level work is replaced with automation, Bank of America economists wrote on Oct 22. So far, however, businesses loaded with white-collar workers such as those in the information, finance, and professional services sector have seen job growth in tandem with increased AI usage, they wrote."I'm reticent to say it's AI just yet," said Allison Shrivastava, economist with Indeed Hiring Lab in Saratoga Springs, New York, who said the tech sector has been retrenching since a 2022 peak. "It has the potential to impact the labour market, but I don't think we're seeing that strong an impact right now." LOW-HIRING, LOW-FIRING DOLDRUMSWith the US government shut, data is at a premium. Weekly state jobless figures so far do not show a measurable surge in layoffs, but job growth remains subdued. Payroll provider ADP on Tuesday estimated an increase of 14,250 jobs in the four-week period ended Oct 11.Despite the headlines, economists say the labour market is stuck in a "low-hiring, low-firing phase", with firms quietly trimming headcount by not replacing vacated roles.If layoffs accelerate, they could further weaken consumer confidence and the broader US economy, already under strain from tariffs and inflation above Federal Reserve targets. Fed officials concerned about the job market worry the “low-hiring, low-firing” environment could slip towards faster layoffs. "I describe this as a 'hold-your-breath' environment," Shrivastava said. "'Low-hire, low-fire' almost makes it feel like we're in this new equilibrium, where really companies are just holding their breath, trying to figure out what's going on."

"'Low-hire, low-fire' almost makes it feel like we're in this new equilibrium, where really companies are just holding their breath, trying to figure out what's going on."

Amazon layoffs: The e-commerce giant may cut nearly 800 to 1,000 corporate roles in India as part of its plans to reduce its global workforce, according to a report by The Economic Times, citing people aware of the development. The number of job cuts could exceed 1,000, the report adds, as Amazon confirms 14,000 job cuts globally amid its increasing focus on artificial intelligence. The Amazon layoffs in India will impact employees who report to its global teams, spanning departments such as finance, marketing, human resources and tech, people familiar with the development told ET. Livemint could not independently verify the report. On Tuesday, Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, announced 14,000 layoffs, months after CEO Andy Jassy warned that AI would reduce the company’s workforce. In June, CEO Jassy indicated that Amazon plans to reduce its workforce amid its increasing use of artificial intelligence to finish work usually done by human beings. “The reductions we’re sharing today are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets,” Galetti said in a blog post on Tuesday. Amazon's confirmation comes as reports emerged that the e-commerce major could cut nearly 30,000 jobs, marking its largest job cut since late 2022, when it started to eliminate around 27,000 positions. Galetti hinted at more layoffs, noting Amazon's plans to hire in key areas in 2026. “Looking ahead to 2026, as Andy talked about earlier this year, we expect to continue hiring in key strategic areas while also finding additional places we can remove layers, increase ownership, and realise efficiency gains," Galetti said. Highlighting the reason for layoffs, “Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well. What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.” Galetti assured that the company is “offering most employees 90 days (the timing will vary some based on local laws) to look for a new role internally, and recruiting teams will prioritise internal candidates to help as many people as possible find new roles within Amazon.” She added, “For our teammates who are unable to find a new role at Amazon or who choose not to look for one, we’ll offer them transition support including severance pay, outplacement services, health insurance benefits, and more.” Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: Big layoffs at Amazon, big implications for Seattle’s economy

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/28/2025 9:15:05 PM PDT by algore The ax is falling on Amazon corporate offices. The Seattle-based retail giant confirmed it will cut approximately 14,000 corporate jobs, and employees will begin receiving layoff notices starting Tuesday, Amazon announced. It’s unclear how many of those jobs will be lost in Washington state. Puget Sound Business Journal reporter Nick Pasion, who covers big tech, says the Amazon workers he’s talked to report that their managers are being tight-lipped, but “They are feeling a palpable sense of fear within the company, just concerned that they might be impacted. Some of their friends might be impacted.” And that’s not a baseless concern. “Amazon has about 350,000 corporate employees globally. So if you’re talking about up to 30,000, that’s a pretty substantial chunk,” said GeekWire co-founder Todd Bishop. Amazon has yet to confirm the layoffs, let alone give a reason for them. Pasion says some of this may be due to post-pandemic downsizing. “Amazon, pretty notoriously overhired during the pandemic. Their head count went up by, like tens of thousands of employees, during that period,” said Pasion. But he notes the company has already done significant post-pandemic course correcting, laying off 27,000 employees in 2022 and 2023. Amazon may now be looking to cut corporate jobs to reinvest in artificial intelligence infrastructure. “Data centers, chips, getting power, all of that is super, super expensive,” said Pasion. “We’re seeing a lot of companies spend their free cash on that infrastructure and building it out and hiring artificial intelligence scientists to develop models internally, and those people are paid lots and lots of money for what they do.” Amazon isn’t the only high-tech Puget Sound–area company shedding jobs. Microsoft has cut 15,000 positions globally this year. (Excerpt) Read more at mynorthwest.com ...

Humans do not carry packages anywhere outside of spot fixes. They have robots and conveyor belts everywhere. The robots are the size of a refrigerator and weigh several hundred pounds (the robot is just a carrier about the 12-14 inches high and carries a stack of bins on it) that hold products in the bins on them and they move around autonomous from human station to human station to have product orders picked/restocked to put on a conveyor belt to go to yet another robot. Some can go up to a seed of a running human. They have a large fenced area that only certain people can enter and they have to have a certain badge on or all the robots will shutdown immediately. It is highly automated. It was quite interesting to see and worth a tour just to see the tech alone if you are ever near one. It takes about an hour. Not your local Amazon distribution center, you have to go to a big fulfillment center and they are all near large airport. 19 posted on 10/29/2025 7:16:34 AM PDT by Resolute Conservative [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 16 | View Replies] To: Resolute Conservative Thanks for that.

Puget Sound Business Journal reporter Nick Pasion, who covers big tech, says the Amazon workers he’s talked to report that their managers are being tight-lipped, but “They are feeling a palpable sense of fear within the company, just concerned that they might be impacted. Some of their friends might be impacted.” And that’s not a baseless concern. “Amazon has about 350,000 corporate employees globally. So if you’re talking about up to 30,000, that’s a pretty substantial chunk,” said GeekWire co-founder Todd Bishop. Amazon has yet to confirm the layoffs, let alone give a reason for them. Pasion says some of this may be due to post-pandemic downsizing. “Amazon, pretty notoriously overhired during the pandemic. Their head count went up by, like tens of thousands of employees, during that period,” said Pasion. But he notes the company has already done significant post-pandemic course correcting, laying off 27,000 employees in 2022 and 2023. Amazon may now be looking to cut corporate jobs to reinvest in artificial intelligence infrastructure. “Data centers, chips, getting power, all of that is super, super expensive,” said Pasion. “We’re seeing a lot of companies spend their free cash on that infrastructure and building it out and hiring artificial intelligence scientists to develop models internally, and those people are paid lots and lots of money for what they do.” Amazon isn’t the only high-tech Puget Sound–area company shedding jobs. Microsoft has cut 15,000 positions globally this year. (Excerpt) Read more at mynorthwest.com ...

Humans do not carry packages anywhere outside of spot fixes. They have robots and conveyor belts everywhere. The robots are the size of a refrigerator and weigh several hundred pounds (the robot is just a carrier about the 12-14 inches high and carries a stack of bins on it) that hold products in the bins on them and they move around autonomous from human station to human station to have product orders picked/restocked to put on a conveyor belt to go to yet another robot. Some can go up to a seed of a running human. They have a large fenced area that only certain people can enter and they have to have a certain badge on or all the robots will shutdown immediately.

So if you’re talking about up to 30,000, that’s a pretty substantial chunk,” said GeekWire co-founder Todd Bishop. Amazon has yet to confirm the layoffs, let alone give a reason for them. Pasion says some of this may be due to post-pandemic downsizing. “Amazon, pretty notoriously overhired during the pandemic. Their head count went up by, like tens of thousands of employees, during that period,” said Pasion. But he notes the company has already done significant post-pandemic course correcting, laying off 27,000 employees in 2022 and 2023. Amazon may now be looking to cut corporate jobs to reinvest in artificial intelligence infrastructure. “Data centers, chips, getting power, all of that is super, super expensive,” said Pasion. “We’re seeing a lot of companies spend their free cash on that infrastructure and building it out and hiring artificial intelligence scientists to develop models internally, and those people are paid lots and lots of money for what they do.” Amazon isn’t the only high-tech Puget Sound–area company shedding jobs. Microsoft has cut 15,000 positions globally this year. (Excerpt) Read more at mynorthwest.com ...

Their head count went up by, like tens of thousands of employees, during that period,” said Pasion. But he notes the company has already done significant post-pandemic course correcting, laying off 27,000 employees in 2022 and 2023. Amazon may now be looking to cut corporate jobs to reinvest in artificial intelligence infrastructure. “Data centers, chips, getting power, all of that is super, super expensive,” said Pasion. “We’re seeing a lot of companies spend their free cash on that infrastructure and building it out and hiring artificial intelligence scientists to develop models internally, and those people are paid lots and lots of money for what they do.” Amazon isn’t the only high-tech Puget Sound–area company shedding jobs. Microsoft has cut 15,000 positions globally this year. (Excerpt) Read more at mynorthwest.com ...

Humans do not carry packages anywhere outside of spot fixes. They have robots and conveyor belts everywhere. The robots are the size of a refrigerator and weigh several hundred pounds (the robot is just a carrier about the 12-14 inches high and carries a stack of bins on it) that hold products in the bins on them and they move around autonomous from human station to human station to have product orders picked/restocked to put on a conveyor belt to go to yet another robot. Some can go up to a seed of a running human. They have a large fenced area that only certain people can enter and they have to have a certain badge on or all the robots will shutdown immediately.

Title: China Downgrades Germany

Germany’s dramatic economic collapse is dragging its geopolitical standing down with it. Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has now learned what it means to be treated as a second-tier diplomat, receiving the red card from Beijing. A humiliation and a reprimand for Germany. The school of life can be cruel. Growing up usually means losing lofty ideals, fringe ideologies and the dreamy mindset of an inexperienced existence to the harsh reality of the world. Reality follows its own rules, unimpressed by self-delusion. That moment of maturity, the exit from the bubble of hermetically-sealed party ideology, has now arrived for Germany’s top diplomat. A Minister of Fantasies Johann Wadephul, who only recently wandered through wonderland attributing the German economic miracle to Turkish immigrants, had to cancel his first official visit to China at the last minute because Beijing saw no need to speak with a German delegation. The Christian Democrat is learning, much like his BlackRock-seasoned party colleague Friedrich Merz, that Germany’s dramatic economic decline is being followed instantly by a loss of geopolitical relevance. Wadephul’s first China trip was intended as a reset in the strained diplomatic relationship with Beijing. A high-profile business delegation was set to accompany him and help ease tensions over critical rare earth supplies. China has been threatening a complete export ban for weeks, a measure that would instantly paralyze key German industries. Suddenly Business Matters The delegation was to include representatives from the German automotive industry, Siemens Healthineers, the German Robotics Association and a leading importer of rare earth elements. Together, they were meant to relieve pressure in Beijing and secure access to the essential resources that Germany’s industrial base cannot function without. When Beijing made clear that it would not entertain additional talks beyond the mandatory meeting of foreign ministers, Wadephul was forced to cancel the trip late Friday. A last-ditch attempt to save face and limit the political damage. Perhaps Wadephul should have copied his predecessor Annalena Baerbock and focused on moral-philosophical escapism such as feminist foreign policy. It is harmless, fits the German zeitgeist, and would have earned him brownie points among left-leaning coalition partners. The Giant’s Achilles Heel Right now, Europe would desperately need a delegation that positions itself smartly in the slipstream of the Americans. Every giant has a weakness. China’s economy is caught in a self-reinforcing deflationary spiral triggered by draconian U.S. tariffs and a long-festering property crisis caused by massive state-driven capital misallocation. Deflation is fatal because China’s growth relies on the fiat-credit machine. Rising insolvencies mean shrinking loan books. The credit turbo sputters, collateral values collapse through fire sales and oversupply, especially in real estate. Then the state must intervene again, inject more government credit and weaken its currency further. It is a vicious cycle gripping nearly every modern economy. China’s answer has always been the same: a colossal export-subsidy engine, a mercantilist model built at the expense of trade partners who lost production capacity to China. Beijing’s trade surplus accounts for roughly 1 percent of global GDP. Roughly 1 trillion U.S. dollars, fueled by massive export aid. On top of that come geopolitical Trojan horses like the Belt and Road Initiative, opening markets wherever China needs raw materials. China Is Desperate for Replacement Markets Europe’s internal market has become essential for Beijing to dump excess production. The U.S. market is increasingly blocked since Donald Trump’s tariff offensive: Chinese exports to the United States have crashed by a staggering 27 percent. At the same time, Chinese exports to Germany rose 10.7 percent in the first half of the year. To prevent a labor-market meltdown at home, Beijing is flooding alternative markets with overcapacity. The Communist Party is facing a youth unemployment rate likely around 20 percent. The social explosive lies right there. This is precisely where Europe -- especially Berlin -- could apply leverage. In the escalating struggle for rare earth access, crucial for German industry and especially automakers, Europe could build real bargaining power by teaming up with the United States. Irresponsible and Stubborn It is irresponsible, considering China’s 90-percent dominance in rare-earth refining, not to side with Washington and secure strategic advantages for Europe’s own industrial survival. Ideologically rigid, strategically naive and severely weakened by its trade debacles with the U.S., EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is stumbling from one pseudo-summit to the next like a dethroned Brussels queen. One gets the impression that the entire climate circus, the theatrical solidarity on Ukraine and the delusional green posture have become a psychological overcompensation for the visible failure of the Brussels project. Time to Seek Alliance with the United States Europe should have embraced geopolitical division of labor with Washington from the start. Especially now that the U.S., under a hyperactive foreign-policy president, is openly claiming leadership. Trump is right to point at EU protectionism, ubiquitous climate regulation and a policy increasingly hostile to markets. Washington is on the offensive: deregulation, tax cuts, junking the quasi-religious climate cult. It’s working: the U.S. economy is growing 3.8 percent, new debt fell from 6.7 to 5.8 percent. Trump is recalibrating the system while Europe tumbles in the opposite direction: higher debt, deeper recession. Wadephul and his fellow European diplomats must finally accept this reality and drop their escalating crusade over censorship laws, scrap the Digital Services Act, the Digital Markets Act and the online-surveillance regime entirely. Instead, they should seek fair trade with the U.S. without hidden climate protectionism. Europe is resource-poor and energy-dependent, importing up to 60 percent of its energy. Without Russian energy and raw materials, Europe’s prosperity model collapses. And the attack on a Eurasian rapprochement between continental Europe and resource-rich Russia did not come from Washington, despite media mantras to the contrary. It came straight from the heart of the European Union. Image: AT via Magic Studio Germany’s dramatic economic collapse is dragging its geopolitical standing down with it.

Title: Amazon Web Services plans $5 billion investment in South Korea's AI industry by 2031

Amazon Web Services (AWS) plans to invest nearly $5 billion in South Korea by 2031 to establish new artificial intelligence data centres in the Asian country, Reuters reported, citing South Korea's presidential office. The announcement was made at the AWS CEO Matt Garman's meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit. This investment aims to boost the AI industry in South Korea, as the country eyes to become one of the world's top three AI leaders, the report quoted Lee's statement. "At AWS, we've invested and committed to investment of an additional $40 billion across 14 non-U.S. APEC countries and economies between now and 2028," the report quoted Garman. “And, that $40 billion actually drives an additional $45 billion in U.S. GDP and downstream benefit, benefiting all of the APEC economy,” he said at a business event on the sidelines of the ASEAN Summit. In June, AWS announced a $5 billion investment in South Korea in partnership with SK Group to develop the nation's largest data centre. Additionally, it revealed plans for investments in Japan, Australia, and Singapore. Amazon is one of seven global corporations whose executives participated in the group meeting with Lee in Gyeongju, South Korea, committed to a combined investment of $9 billion over the next five years. Amazon's latest investment came at a time when the e-commerce giant confirmed 14,000 layoffs, months after Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy hinted that artificial intelligence would reduce its workforce. “The reductions we’re sharing today are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets,” Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, said in a blog post on Tuesday. On the reason for the latest layoffs, she said, “Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well. What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.” (With inputs from agencies.)

You must have got kicked off your welfare and unemployment. Neither never took Welfare and only time was in 2016 when I was lay-off after 10 years of service. Federal employees had to interrupt shopping from their sofas while they were “remote working”, now that they aren’t getting paid to do so. Anyway … https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/4349137/posts This article says the private sector added 15,000 a week. If you’ve never been fired from a job, you’ve never really worked for a living. Article states total is subject to revision... Yes, have read most of that. Housing sales are tanking, but the media (probably paid off by the industry) are not covering it fully. Why is the market (especially the Nasdaq) still going up? Crazy. 80,200 out of 7,000,000 “””If you’ve never been fired from a job, you’ve never really worked for a living.””” I once quit a job because the boss and I didn’t agree. In fifteen minutes, I had another job paying the same pay ant another company where I became the highest paid person. Does it count as getting fired if you fire yourself? For October... Melt up As I as I had a Contract job making $100,000 plus by day’s end. While I understand your sentiment, just know that there are those of us who just posted 80 hours of work in the office and various other places with no pay. We’re not all leaches. Stocks at an all time high. “””Article states total is subject to revision...””” It could go up or down. But most likely it will go up. Even if it didn’t go up I wouldn’t be terribly concerned. A large chunk of those let go were government employees. I just got hired by an excellent company who was only hiring H1b until recently.

This seven-day correction has put an end to one of the longest bull runs in the history of the precious metal. · With markets already factoring in another rate cut in December, traders are waiting for Fed Chair Jerome Powell to give them clues about the direction of monetary policy going forward. · Investors, however, kept an eye on developments on a possible trade deal between the US and China that would further reduce demand for safe havens. · A framework deal between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump is anticipated to be finalised. The pact aims to loosen China’s limitations on rare earth shipments and stop more US tariff rises. Technical Triggers · First target achieved in Gold at $3960 (~Rs 119,000), prices could consolidate here and then fall to $3850 (~Rs 117,000). · First target achieved in Silver at $46 (~Rs 140,000), prices could consolidate here and then fall to 45(~Rs 136,500). Puneet Singhania, Director at Master Trust Group As mutual fund houses resume investments in Silver ETFs, should investors consider taking a fresh entry? The lull in silver fund investments by mutual fund houses previously was spurred by supply inadequacies and high premiums on physical silver, now relaxed as global supply chains stabilize. Silver price has also corrected on its peak, creating a healthier entry point for long-term investors. Silver is unique because it can be utilized as a store of value, similar to gold, and it’s also a critical industrial metal that finds applications in semiconductors, electronics, solar panels, and electric vehicles. In the future, the structural demand for silver is set to continue being robust in the face of the global energy transition, increasing renewable capacity, and technological advancement. But investors should keep in mind that silver as a commodity is still a volatile and cyclical asset, which tends to react sharply to changes in global interest rates, inflation expectations, and industrial demand changes. Rather than attempting timing of entries, investors need to invest systematically in order to average out volatility and sharp corrections. How much allocation to Silver ETFs (as a percentage of the overall portfolio) would be advisable for investors as these units become more accessible? The entrance of Silver ETFs, thanks to the fund offerings from various Indian AMCs, opened a new avenue for the investors to invest in silver more comfortably. Nonetheless, the investors’ commitment to having a varied portfolio is still vital, as the precious metal generally experiences more volatility and cycles than investments in stocks or bonds. A diversified portfolio is one where silver exposure of 5-10% through ETFs or mutual funds is usually recommended. Given the nature of silver prices being so volatile, it is wise to adhere to SIPs (systematic investment plans) instead of taking all at once. This approach works by outputting the costs of buying and also cutting down on the risk of poor timing. Moreover, it is also important for the investors to keep an eye on the trading of ETFs at premium or discount prices before they invest since these aspects can have a big influence on the returns. All in all, Silver is an investment category that is very much a part of the diversification and inflation-hedging worthiness. What strategy should existing Silver ETF investors adopt in the current market scenario? For investors already holding silver, staying patient is crucial in the current market. The long-term fundamentals of the metal remain strong due to its steady structural demand. Silver surged to its historic highs in 2025 before correcting sharply, and while Indian ETF premiums have normalized post-Diwali, supply-demand tightness continues. Since silver’s growth story is still intact, investors should view their investments with a long-term holding perspective rather than responding to short-term corrections. With its widespread use in electronics, solar energy systems, batteries, and semiconductors, the metal is crucial to today’s technologically driven world. The technology evolution and the move to using renewable sources of energy keep the silver demand steady, thus reinforcing its long-term price trend. For investors, opting for a staggered investment strategy over gold/silver ETFs or mutual fund is an excellent way to cope with the volatility and possible corrections after such a steep rally, besides seizing the long-term trend. Silver ETFs have delivered strong returns so far. As geopolitical tensions ease and supply-demand concerns persist, what is the outlook for silver and silver-backed assets in the near term and long term? This year, silver has been a very profitable investment, which can be attributed to the strong demand from both industries and investors. Currently, both physical silver and ETFs are experiencing the same supply-demand pressure with demand being the reason for premium trade due to the limitations. Although the trading volumes may be reduced temporarily due to the calming of geopolitical tensions, the fundamentals of the metal are still very strong. Silver is still a key component in the green technologies area, which includes solar panels, EVs, and advanced electronics, so the industrial demand is constant. The prices of silver are backed by the structural demand which the global production cannot meet. The strong demand for this precious metal is a fact that is supported by the market speculations throughout the whole short-term period. Pullbacks in the price of silver should be considered to be the normal phases of a broader uptrend and not a ground for worry by the investors. India’s industrial growth slowed to 3% in H1FY26, but GST reforms, festive demand, and easing inflation may drive a rebound in the second half, says Bank of Baroda. Raymond Lifestyle has appointed Vishal Raigagla as Chief Financial Officer of the company w.e.f. October 29, 2025. Japanese auto major Honda Motor has said that India is the third most important market for the company after the US and Japan.

Nifty Bank predictions for October 29, 2025, suggest a potential rally to 58,850 with strategic trading insights. AMC stocks plunge as SEBI proposes mutual fund fee overhaul, with HDFC AMC suffering the largest drop of 6.3%. Shree Cement shares rise 0.91% amid mixed brokerage ratings despite strong quarterly results and valuation concerns. Iris Clothings announced implementation of SAP Business One. The company has transitioned from its earlier ERP system, Tally, to SAP Business One, a globally recognized enterprise resource planning (ERP) platform. Shares flat on the NSE at Rs 32.46 Driven by its core engineering and construction segments and a healthy project pipeline in the Middle East, Larsen & Toubro (L&T) is expected to post a double-digit growth in revenue in Q2 FY26. Raymond Lifestyle reported consolidated net profit for the quarter ended September 2025 at Rs 75.19 crore (78% growth) from Rs 42.18 crore in the same quarter last year. Cyclone Montha weakens into a Cyclonic Storm near Machilipatnam; APDMA warns of continued rain, gusty winds, and flooding risk across coastal Andhra. Vikram Subburaj, CEO, Giottus.com Bitcoin fell back below $113,000 even as U.S. equities notched fresh records to underscore a widening gap between traditional and digital risk assets. A rotation into AI-heavy stocks after Nvidia’s 5% rise appeared to siphon liquidity from crypto and kept bids subdued. Despite recovering from the October 10–11 shock, resistance above $116,000 persists with limited follow-through from buyers. Analysts flag the short-term holder cost basis near $113.6k as a key pivot. Any failure to hold that level could extend the retracement toward sub-$108k. This would imply a deeper test of structural support. Macro dynamics remain in charge. Equity gains reflect optimism ahead of this week’s US Federal Reserve meeting and Big Tech results. The same liquidity rotation is but weighing on digital assets. A 25 bps US Fed cut is widely anticipated and market reaction will hinge less on the move itself and more on whether Chair Powell signals a pause to quantitative tightening. In the near term, rising Treasury yields and renewed flows into equities imply capital is clustering in safer or higher-performing sectors. This keeps crypto in consolidation rather than a full-blown recovery. Altcoins tracked Bitcoin lower. Ethereum slipped 3% to just under $4,000, while Solana and Litecoin fell nearly 3% to unwind much of their early-week gains. The debut of new spot ETFs for Solana, Hedera, and Litecoin did little to lift sentiment as traders prioritised risk management over chasing catalysts. Sui (SUI) dropped 4% to $2.50 after a late-day breakdown, with ~2.7 million tokens reportedly changing hands in a single minute. The abrupt volume spike alongside a sharp price slide points to larger holders offloading into thin liquidity. This leaves the token vulnerable to further downside if follow-through buying does not emerge. Overall, the tape still looks like post-October digestion. It is strong enough to avoid decisive breakdowns but lacks the conviction to sustain rallies until macro clarity and fresh capital return.” Jefferies on Shree Cement Recommendation Buy; Target Price ₹33420, Earlier Target ₹35150 Miss on higher cost;

Given the sheer extent of the consultative paper and related documents, we are still in process of grasping the material to evaluate the likely impact. However, four key proposed regulations are noteworthy from a TER and AMC revenue standpoint. ▪ With an objective to rationalize cost for unitholder, additional expense of 5bps that was allowed in equity TER has been removed from the draft MF Regulations. PL View: This would be a negative for AMCs as 5bps would be directly reduced from equity TER ▪ To pass on any change in statutory levy in future, TER limits are revised downward to the extent of GST on all expenses other than MF fees. Hence, across slabs TER has been proposed to be reduced by 10bps PL View: While the wordings are a bit ambiguous this may mean that TER will have to exclude the GST impact which was roughly 10bps. Assuming that statutory levies would be permitted over and above the TER limit, this may not have a material adverse impact. ▪ To protect investor interest and ensure that expenses are charged only once, brokerage has been revised from 12 bps to 2 bps for cash transactions and 5 bps to 1 bps for derivative transactions. All other execution-related transaction costs may be charged on actual basis. PL View: As per SEBI, since AMCs already charge an MF fees, additional brokerage over and above 2bps would lead to a dual impact on customer. This would certainly be negative for brokers. ▪ A provision enabling TER to be charged based on performance has been introduced and same shall be voluntary for AMCs. A detailed framework in this regard shall be finalized separately in consultation with stakeholders. PL View: AMCs would be allowed to charge additional performance-based TER which would be a positive, increasing revenue; final guidelines are awaited. Sector/stock impact: We expect AMCs may pass on the 5bps equity TER cut to other industry participants however assuming no pass through, core earnings for ICICI Pru, HDFCAMC, NAM, ABSL AMC and UTIAM would be affected by 8.0-9.0%. The impact would be more severe for CRAMC at ~22% due to ~90% equity share. This negative effect has been partly neutralised by proposing a performance-based TER (framework to be finalised). Reduction of the cash brokerage from 12bps to 5bps and derivative brokerage from 2bps to 1bp would adversely affect brokers Gold stabilizes at $3,950 an ounce amid expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut after a three-day decline.

Title: Amazon confirms 14,000 job cuts amid AI push, more layoffs likely - here's what we know

Amazon.com Inc on Tuesday confirmed plans to cut nearly 14,000 corporate jobs, just months after Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy warned that AI would reduce the company’s workforce. In June, Jassy hinted the e-commerce giant's workforce would likely reduce amid its increasing use of artificial intelligence to finish work usually done by human beings. “The reductions we’re sharing today are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets,” Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, said in a blog post on Tuesday. The layoffs are affecting a wide range of departments, including logistics, payments, video games, and the cloud-computing division, Bloomberg reported, citing people aware of the matter. Galetti hinted at further job reductions, mentioning Amazon's intention to hire in key areas in 2026. Speaking on the reason for job cuts, she said, “Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well. What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.” She added, “Looking ahead to 2026, as Andy talked about earlier this year, we expect to continue hiring in key strategic areas while also finding additional places we can remove layers, increase ownership, and realise efficiency gains." Following Amazon's announcement of 14,000 job cuts on Tuesday, employees started congregating in social media chat rooms. They discussed which departments were affected and shared information about the messages employees might receive indicating impending layoffs. They also exchanged advice on retrieving personal files from work computers before access was cut off and sought tips on companies currently hiring, the news portal reported. The last round of companywide layoffs three years ago occurred gradually over five months. It started in the fall, following Amazon’s annual planning, then continued in January, after the holiday shopping season and again in March. Earlier, reports emerged that Amazon may cut nearly 30,000 jobs. Terminations on that scale would exceed the rolling layoffs in late 2022 and early 2023, which affected over 27,000 corporate employees as Jassy aimed to cut costs following a pandemic-driven boom, the report said. As of 30 June, Amazon employed about 1.55 million people, most of whom worked in warehouses. The corporate workforce comprises about 3,50,000 personnel, which means the current 14,000 job cuts announced Tuesday represent about 4% of that headcount. Jassy consistently highlighted his commitment to cutting roles at management levels and easing bureaucracy, which had increased following Amazon's pandemic-driven hiring spree. His June remarks about leveraging AI to automate more processes sparked concern among employees, who are already troubled by ongoing management reductions, the report said. Signs of cost-cutting within the company appeared shortly thereafter. Over the summer, Amazon implemented more aggressive attrition goals and refrained from filling open roles in its corporate logistics and advertising departments, people aware of the development told Bloomberg.

Title: Amazon Games Ends Support For MMO ‘New World’ Following Mass Layoffs

ByDavid Jagneaux, Contributor. The never-ending carousel of game industry layoffs continues once again as Amazon announced its cutting more than 14,000 jobs across the entire company, with specific reductions happening at Amazon Games and its in-house MMO, New World. As part of a general shift in strategy, the company seems to be pivoting entirely away from its heavy focus on live service MMO games over the last several years towards a more casual, family-focused angle led by its revamped Amazon Luna cloud platform, in addition to focusing more on AI technologies. Naturally, this doesn’t bode well for New World: Aeternum, the latest version of its homegrown MMO IP that hit consoles and relaunched on PC just a year ago. It remains to be seen what will happen with the in-development Lords of the Rings MMO and what the future holds for Amazon-published titles such as Lost Ark and the English version of Throne & Liberty. As of today, no new content updates are planned, the most recent Season 10 and Nighthaven Updates from October 2025, will be the final releases, and servers are intended to remain active only through 2026, but not beyond. It does not seem like Amazon plans to offer refunds in anyway and, on the contrary, will continue to sell the game and offer microtransactions. Presumably, it’s over for New World. Here is the full statement from the game’s update page: "As New World recognizes its fourth anniversary since launching on PC, we reflect on an incredible journey shaped by our dedicated player community. Your feedback and passion have been instrumental in evolving Aeternum into the world it is today, and our team is deeply grateful for this shared adventure. After four years of steady content updates and a major new console release, we've reached a point where it is no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates. The recently launched Season 10 and Nighthaven update will serve as the final content release for New World on PC and consoles. It is only after much consideration that we've reached this decision. To thank you, the New World community, for your support over the years, we have made the Nighthaven release available to you for free. To ensure all New World players can experience this content, we also made Rise of the Angry Earth free for all PC players. In the coming months, we will provide more details on what to expect and other essential information. Rest assured, our intention is to keep servers operating through 2026, allowing our community time to continue their adventures in Aeternum. Additionally, New World: Aeternum will still be downloadable for PlayStation Plus members (Extra and Premium). Players of Aeternum: Your dedication and enthusiasm have made this New World adventure an unforgettable journey. We’re deeply grateful for every moment you've spent helping build this extraordinary world alongside us. It has been an honor to share Aeternum with you, thank you for helping make this game something truly special." Making an MMO game is very difficult and creating an entire IP from scratch, in-house, to build an MMO upon is even harder. The fact that not even Amazon could find a way to do it successfully after half a decade of trying from various angles and avenues is certainly telling. New World had a huge launch, then it faded away into the background for a long while, before being resurrected a year ago. It should be said that recent sentiment and popularity for New World was pointing towards the game stabilizing and finding a strong core audience. Updates over the last year have all been well-received, but apparently it wasn’t enough.

GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. Players will still be able to revisit New World: Aeternum for now, but there won't be any more seasons or DLC. By Blair Marnell on October 28, 2025 at 5:47PM PDT Amazon disclosed a number of layoffs in its gaming division earlier this week, and now those cuts are apparently affecting the team behind New World: Aeternum. Following the recently released Season 10: Nighthaven update, there will be no more new content released for New World: Aeternum. The announcement was shared on the game's official site by developer Amazon Games Orange County. This doesn't mean that the game is going offline yet, and the devs indicated it will remain online through 2026. Beyond that, there are no guarantees. But there is a small consolation for players, now that the Nighthaven update will be free. "The recently launched Season 10 and Nighthaven update will serve as the final content release for New World on PC and consoles," reads the statement from the developers. "It is only after much consideration that we've reached this decision. To thank you, the New World community, for your support over the years, we have made the Nighthaven release available to you for free. To ensure all New World players can experience this content, we also made Rise of the Angry Earth free for all PC players." New World: Aeternum will remain available on PlayStation Plus for Extra and Premium subscribers, but even the developers aren't sure when that arrangement will expire. During the game's new phase, bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements will continue, and players can continue to buy and download the game. There will still be world bosses, bonus weeks, and "some seasonal events," but holiday events are now canceled. The development team also stated that it will "provide a minimum of six months' notice before making any changes that impact your ability to play New World: Aeternum."

Title: UPS cuts 48,000 jobs to boost profits – Amazon slowdown, Trump tariff impact?

Atlanta-based logistics giant UPS said on Tuesday it has cut 48,000 jobs since last year in a sweeping restructuring effort to boost profits and regain investor confidence. The delivery major, which employed nearly half a million people at the start of 2024, confirmed it eliminated 34,000 positions this year across its US driver and warehouse workforce. It also began slashing another 14,000 management roles last year. The announcement came alongside better-than-expected third-quarter earnings, sending UPS shares soaring over 7% in afternoon trading. “We are executing the most significant strategic shift in our company’s history, and the changes we are implementing are designed to deliver long-term value for all stakeholders,” — Carol Tomé, UPS Chief Executive Officer. UPS has faced persistent pressure from investors after its stock lagged behind the broader market in recent years. The company’s leadership has embarked on a large-scale efficiency overhaul, tightening operations and scaling back unprofitable business lines, including its delivery partnership with Amazon. UPS said deliveries for Amazon were down 21% year-on-year in the third quarter as it prioritised higher-margin business. “Revenue per package in the United States grew 10% in the third quarter from a year earlier,” Ms Tomé told analysts. Despite the massive job cuts, UPS’s net income fell to $1.3 billion in the third quarter, compared to $1.5 billion a year earlier. Revenue also declined to $21.4 billion from $22.2 billion. However, adjusted earnings per share reached $1.74, beating analyst expectations. The restructuring appears to have impressed Wall Street — at least temporarily — with shares rising sharply on Tuesday. Still, UPS’s stock remains down nearly 25% this year, compared with a 17% gain for the S&P 500 index. UPS’s international business has also taken a hit from new tariffs imposed by President Trump’s administration earlier this year. The volume of parcels shipped to the United States from China fell almost 30% in the third quarter, according to the company. Customs data shows shipments valued under $800 — once exempt from tariffs — have plunged from 4 million packages per day to around 1 million after Trump closed the so-called “de minimis” loophole in May. The Teamsters union, representing many UPS workers, had earlier warned that it would oppose any layoffs that violated the company’s labour contract. On Tuesday, Ms Tomé insisted UPS was acting lawfully: “UPS was in compliance with the terms of our contract,” she said. The job cuts have reignited debate over labour protections and automation in the logistics industry, particularly as rivals like FedEx also face cost pressures amid slowing global trade. As UPS tightens operations and adapts to a post-pandemic delivery economy, analysts say the company’s turnaround depends on balancing cost-cutting with service reliability. With e-commerce slowing and trade barriers rising, UPS’s largest restructuring in its 117-year history marks a pivotal moment for both the company and its workforce.

Title: The AI job cuts are here - or are they?
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyk7zg0gzvo
Time Published: 2025-10-29T00:09:22Z
Full Content:
Amazon's move this week to slash thousands of corporate jobs fed into a longstanding anxiety: that Artificial Intelligence is starting to replace workers. The tech giant joined a growing list of companies in the US that have pointed to AI technology as a reason behind layoffs. But some question whether AI is fully to blame - and have voiced scepticism that recent high-profile layoffs are a telling sign of the technology's effect on employment. Chegg, the online education firm, cited the "new realities" of AI as it announced a 45% reduction in workforce on Monday. When Salesforce cut 4,000 customer service roles last month, its chief executive said AI agents were doing the work. UPS said on Tuesday that it has cut 48,000 jobs since last year. The delivery company's chief executive previously linked redundancies, in part, to machine learning. But extrapolating from executives' remarks during cuts is "possibly the worst way" to determine the effects of AI on jobs, said Martha Gimbel, executive director of the Budget Lab at Yale University. Company-specific dynamics, she said, are often at play. "There is a real tendency, because everyone is so freaked out about the possible impact of AI on the labour market moving forward, to overreact to individual company announcements," Ms Gimbel said. Certain subsets of the workforce - recent college graduates and data centre employees, for example - in fact are particularly vulnerable to the technology's adoption. A recent study from the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis found a correlation between occupations with a higher prevalence of AI and increases in unemployment since 2022. But Morgan Frank, assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh, has studied unemployment risk by occupation and found that the only workers affected by the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 were in the office and administrative support sector. For them, their probability of claiming unemployment jumped in early 2023, he said - immediately following the entrance of the chat bot developed by OpenAI. But for computer and maths occupations, "there is no discernible change in the trend around the launch of ChatGPT", he said. "Both tech workers and admin workers - they're in a rougher job market than they were in a couple years ago," Mr Frank said. "I'd be sceptical that AI is the reason for all of it, though," he added. Amazon and many of its rivals in the tech sector hired at a rapid clip in the years leading up to the coronavirus pandemic and in the pandemic's early months, when the Federal Reserve lowered US interest rates to near zero. The hiring set these firms up for eventual workforce reductions, experts said - a dynamic separate from the generative AI boom over the last three years. The Fed also started hiking interest rates around the time that ChapGPT was launched. "A lot of this conversation feels very different to people because the phrase AI is in it,"said Ms Gimbel, of the Budget Lab. "But so far, nothing that I've seen looks different than typical patterns of companies hiring and firing, particularly at this point in an economic cycle." A big question, she added, is what hiring patterns look like when the economy returns to a period of solid growth. In the long run, Ms Gimbel said, breaking out the cyclical versus AI-driven job losses will be crucial. If, for instance, the US economy were to fall into a recession, human resources and marketing jobs would be the expected casualties. Those jobs, though, also happen to be exposed to AI, complicating the task of identifying whether the cuts are a result of macroeconomic conditions or the technology's adoption - or both. Amazon, which confirmed it plans to cut roughly 14,000 corporate roles, said it needs to be "organised more leanly" to seize the opportunity provided by AI. The company has been performing well. It reported quarterly results in July that beat Wall Street expectations on several counts, including a 13% year over year increase in sales to $167.7bn (£125bn). Enrico Moretti, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said that the largest tech companies like Amazon are at the forefront of AI-related job cuts, "in part because they're both producers and consumers of AI". Still, he acknowledged that a correction following robust hiring during the pandemic also may have driven the company's latest round of layoffs. Amazon is likely able to automate jobs faster than most of its rivals because of its scale, said Lawrence Schmidt, an associate professor of finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management. "It's not at all crazy to think that Amazon might want to shed certain types of roles, or refrain from hiring additional people in certain types of roles, if they can be quickly automated," Mr Schmidt said. "Regardless of what happens to counts of jobs overall," he added, "you would expect there to be reallocation." Trump says the meeting with President Xi, which was their first face-to-face interaction since 2019, was a "great success". The US and Chinese leaders shook hands when they met face-to-face for the first time since 2019. The testing is necessary to keep pace with weapons programmes in China and Russia, according to Trump. At least four people in Jamaica are confirmed dead and at least 20 people have died in Haiti flooding. The suspected drug traffickers were killed in an escalating conflict taking place at sea.

Title: Amazon is killing one of the only good games it's released, fantasy MMO New World: "The recently launched Season 10 and Nighthaven update will serve as the final content release"

"We've reached a point where it is no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Welp, it's official, Amazon is pulling the plug on its fantasy MMO New World following the recent launch of season 10. The news follows closely on the heels of massive layoffs at Amazon impacting 14,000 employees and effectively gutting the company's gaming division. In an update on the MMO's official website, Amazon says it's been a great four years "shaped by our dedicated player community," but for reasons unspecified but implicitly clear, it's "no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates." "The recently launched Season 10 and Nighthaven update will serve as the final content release for New World on PC and consoles," says Amazon. "It is only after much consideration that we've reached this decision." Amazon adds that the Nighthaven and Rise of the Angry Earth DLCs are free for owners of the base game as a thanks to the community, but it's worth noting that this has been the case for a couple of weeks now. To be clear, New World will still be playable for the foreseeable future, and nothing is changing about it right now in terms of what you can do, buy, and access, but it sounds like 2026 could be its final year before servers are shut down. "In the coming months, we will provide more details on what to expect and other essential information," says Amazon. "Rest assured, our intention is to keep servers operating through 2026, allowing our community time to continue their adventures in Aeternum." Amazon says it'll give at least six months notice before doing anything that'll impact the playability of New World, so at least you'll have time to say your goodbyes. Still, it's disheartening to see a big MMO like this being killed only four years from launch, compared to my childhood when big studio-backed MMOs would run for decades. Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more New World may not have been among the best MMOs out there, but it deserves better than this. After earning an English degree from ASU, I worked as a corporate copy editor while freelancing for places like SFX Magazine, Screen Rant, Game Revolution, and MMORPG on the side.

Amazon Games' best-known MMO is still running, but it's done. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Amazon Games was hit with "significant" layoffs today, part of the massive 14,000 job cuts announced by Amazon but also reflecting "strategic changes" at the company, including "the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work—specifically around MMOs." As it turns out, that includes the MMO New World: Aeternum, which will receive no further content updates and could be gone completely by the end of 2026. "After four years of steady content updates and a major new console release, we've reached a point where it is no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates," today's update states. "The recently launched Season 10 and Nighthaven update will serve as the final content release for New World on PC and consoles. It is only after much consideration that we've reached this decision. To thank you, the New World community, for your support over the years, we have made the Nighthaven release available to you for free. To ensure all New World players can experience this content, we also made Rise of the Angry Earth free for all PC players." This comes as a genuine surprise to me—a shock, really. New World wasn't a huge hit by any means but seemed a reasonably successful mid-tier MMO, which quite frankly is about as good as Amazon Games has managed. Its concurrent player count ebbed and flowed, but the peaks of 50,000 and 60,000 players suggests to me that the players are there—the failure is in keeping them engaged. New World: Aeternum will remain available for purchase, and you'll still be able to buy in-game currency as usual, although I'm not sure why you'd want to. Because let's be honest here, the countdown clock is ticking: New World isn't being taken offline right away, and Amazon said it will "continue to keep the game running smoothly" with bug fixes and server merges as necessary. "World bosses, bonus weeks, and some seasonal events" will also continue, so New World will keep ticking along without any major hitches, at least until it becomes obvious that nothing new has happened in the past six months or so. But Amazon only committed to keeping the New World servers "live through 2026," and the likelihood of it surviving beyond that, especially given the self-fulfilling swirl of declining player counts, is very slim. So I can see continuing to bang around in the game with your online pals as the sun slowly goes down, absolutely—but why would anyone put money into an MMO with no future? More details on how exactly the plug will be pulled will be shared "in the coming months," but Amazon promised "provide a minimum of six months’ notice before making any changes that impact your ability to play New World: Aeternum."

President Trump promotes economic prosperity during his visit to Japan, while layoffs and a federal shutdown threaten millions back in the U.S. President Trump promotes economic prosperity during his visit to Japan, while layoffs and a federal shutdown threaten millions back in the U.S. President Trump promotes economic prosperity during his visit to Japan, while layoffs and a federal shutdown threaten millions back in the U.S. President Donald Trump is promoting Japanese companies investing $550 billion in the United States while visiting the East Asian country. The president said the funds would be “at my direction” as part of a trade framework secured with Japan. The president also boasted about the U.S. economy, despite contrasting economic challenges. "Well, everyone in our country is now doing well. My first term, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We had an economy like nobody has seen before now. We're doing it again, but this time, actually, it's going to be much bigger, much stronger," Trump said. The president highlighted the stock market reaching all-time highs, but economists point to other indicators that tell a different story. Amazon announced it is cutting 14,000 jobs, UPS is eliminating roughly 48,000 positions and closing more than 90 buildings as part of a turnaround plan, and Target, Ford, and GM have also announced layoffs amid slowing demand. Additionally, the federal government shutdown threatens food aid benefits for more than 40 million Americans as soon as Nov. 1, and September's CPI data showed prices are rising again just as the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates to support the economy. "I don't really understand the optimism to be perfectly honest, and I'm a very optimistic, very little of a 'doomer' person. We've had seven months in a row of contractions and manufacturing output. The labor market cooled to such an extent that it forced the Fed to cut rates in September," said Jai Kedia from the Cato Institute. President Trump is preparing to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping amid the ongoing U.S.–China trade war. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the two countries have reached a "very successful framework" ahead of their summit, covering tariffs, rare-earth exports and large U.S. agricultural purchases. Meanwhile, 26 states and Washington, D.C., are suing the USDA, arguing the agency has contingency funds that could be used to maintain SNAP benefits during the shutdown. In a memo, the USDA stated that those funds can only be used for a natural disaster or other emergency, not to operate during a shutdown, and placed the blame on Senate Democrats, saying, “We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely WIC and SNAP allotments.” The states argue the law requires the USDA to issue benefits as long as money is available. It comes after another failed vote occurred today in the Senate. A federal judge in San Francisco has issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from firing federal workers during the government shutdown. This move comes as a lawsuit challenges recent job cuts in education, health, and other areas. For more coverage from the Washington News Bureau here:

by Pivot 5G AI BROADBAND NATION CYBERSECURITY FIBER BROADBAND FIXED WIRELESS M&A MARKET RESEARCH MOBILE POLICY RURAL BROADBAND VIDEO Verizon’s announcement this week about the company’s commercial agreement with Eaton Fiber is the latest example of how important the “killer bundle” of mobile and internet service has become. Or, as Verizon put it in the press release, the goal is to “accelerate Verizon’s broadband and mobility convergence strategy.” Customers who buy both mobile and internet from the same provider generate higher average revenue and are less likely to churn in comparison with customers who only buy a single service. While mobile service is widely available nationwide from AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon, no provider has a nationwide broadband footprint. But all three providers are expanding where they offer broadband. Verizon’s plan to purchase Frontier will expand the company’s reach to 31 states and the District of Columbia. The agreement with Eaton Fiber, an affiliate of Tillman Global Holdings, will target markets outside of Verizon’s and Frontier’s current fiber-to-the-home footprint. According to the press release, Eaton Fiber will “fund and build the network and be responsible for network maintenance and installation.” Verizon’s responsibilities will include sales, marketing, and end-user customer service. The wording of the release suggests that other providers also will be able to use the network, but Verizon will have a head start. “Verizon will be the exclusive retail provider of residential fiber services over the new network through the build phase and for an additional time period, ensuring competitive advantage in subscriber acquisition,” the release states. AT&T also has been making fiber deals targeting areas outside its broadband footprint. The company also has a joint venture with BlackRock to expand its fiber reach. Although T-Mobile has had tremendous success with its fixed wireless offering, the company lacks the expansive fiber footprints that AT&T and Verizon already have. Unsurprisingly, the company’s fiber strategy, in large part, has been to acquire fiber assets that are already in the ground, through joint ventures to acquire Lumos and Metronet. In addition, T-Mobile has its own deal with Tillman Fiber. Telecompetitor is a publication of Pivot.

Title: Why the "no hire, no fire" job market may no longer be a thing
URL: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-ups-layoffs-labor-market-jobs-economy/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17
Time Published: 2025-10-28T21:53:25Z
Full Content:
Watch CBS News Updated on: October 29, 2025 / 9:43 AM EDT / CBS News For most of 2025, the job market was described by economists as "no hire, no fire" — a stretch of time when job seekers faced slim prospects, but workers could count on job security. But that fragile balance may now be shifting, labor experts warn, as mass layoffs at companies like Amazon and UPS signal a possible turning point for the labor market. Amazon on Tuesday announced 14,000 job cuts, citing a shift toward artificial intelligence, while UPS on the same day said it has reduced its workforce by 48,000 from a year earlier. Paramount Skydance, the owner of CBS News, on Wednesday also announced it is shedding jobs, part of an ongoing effort to cut costs at the entertainment and media company. Target on Tuesday also notified a state employment agency in Minnesota, where the retailer is based, that it plans to lay off more than 800 workers in January as part of a broader corporate restructuring, CBS News Minnesota reported. The retailer announced last week that it would cut 1,800 corporate positions as the chain trims its global workforce by about 8%. The mass layoffs come as the Federal Reserve scrutinizes the labor market for signs of weakness, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month citing concerns about slower hiring in announcing the central bank's first interest-rate cut of 2025. The announcements from Amazon and UPS could signal that the Fed has good reason to be worried, experts said. "No question that this is a shift, and it does seem to me it signals that 'no hire, no fire' is a thing of the past," John Challenger, CEO of outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, told CBS News. "These are major layoffs, the kind of which we only see in periods of real change in the economy," he added. Even before Tuesday's job cuts, layoffs had been trending higher, according to data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Employers across the U.S. cut nearly 950,000 jobs this year through September, the largest number of layoffs since 2020, its most recent data shows. Official federal reports on the state of the labor market have been suspended due to the government shutdown, which means the Fed will make its next interest rate decision tomorrow, Oct. 29, without information about hiring in September. But job growth has slowed sharply in recent months, with average monthly payroll gains of roughly 27,000 between May and August — down from average gains of nearly 123,000 per month between January and April, labor data shows. On Oct. 1, the ADP National Employment Report, a measure of private employment in the U.S., said payrolls at private employers declined by 32,000 jobs in September. At the same time, recent reports suggest layoffs have accelerated in October, Grace Zwemmer, associate economist with Oxford Economics, said in a report Wednesday. State-level data also shows jobless claims by federal employees topped 10,000 in the week ended Oct. 18, a sign the stalemate in Congress is taking a toll, the investment advisory firm said in a separate research note. To be sure, the nation's unemployment rate remains low by historical standards, edging up to 4.3% in August from 4.2% in July. The latest layoffs are unlikely to dramatically drive up joblessness, experts say. "When we look at the scale of the announcements vis-à-vis the broader economy and the data we have from unemployment claims, we don't see them yet at a scale where the unemployment rate is going to shoot up," said Andy Stettner, director of economy and jobs at the left-leaning Century Foundation. But, he added, "These larger corporate downsizings are happening at a time when there aren't many job openings." That means some workers who lose their jobs could struggle to find new employment, experts say. As a result, the ranks of long-term unemployed people, or those who have been searching for work for more than six months, are predicted to rise even higher from its August figure of almost 2 million, the highest level since 2022. Employers are cutting jobs due to several factors, experts say, ranging from artificial intelligence to economic uncertainty. Earlier this year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the e-commerce giant's investment in AI tools would allow the company to trim its human workforce as the business becomes more efficient. "Amazon really pointed to robotics, AI and new technology — and being on the cutting edge of that technology — for shifting jobs," Challenger said. About one-quarter of technology industry workers said they had experienced layoffs or role eliminations due to AI adoption during the past two years, according to a new study from career site Indeed. Other companies are holding off on hiring or are cutting jobs for other reasons. UPS cited the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, as well as shipping declines from Amazon, its biggest customer, on its business. Amazon has been building its own delivery infrastructure, leading it to cut back on its use of UPS. On Monday, children's clothing brand Carter's said it is cutting 300 jobs, or 15% of its workforce, and closing 150 stores over the next three years due to higher costs from tariffs, which are import duties paid by U.S. companies to the federal government. The Trump administration has said that its tariffs would help protect U.S. manufacturing and boost domestic production as businesses move their operations stateside. In the meantime, Americans are growing more pessimistic about the job market, according to recent CBS News polling. About 52% of Americans describe the labor market as "bad," up seven percentage points from April, the poll found. "We are moving more into a time where job security might be more precarious," Challenger said. Edited by Anne Marie D. Lee © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Amazon MGM Studios, the company's TV and movie arm, was hit during the broader company layoffs announced Tuesday. Amazon said it would cut 14,000 jobs overall to slim down as it leans into AI. Among the big names affected at Amazon MGM Studios were Donna Rosenstein, who was head of series casting. Also cut were drama series exec Meggie Choi and creative exec Nathan Kitada. Others impacted included Liz Cohen, a senior creative exec for overall deals; Christina Pope, a creative exec working in comedy/drama; and Sahhara Assafiri, a creative exec on tentpoles. Amazon didn't share the scope of the cuts in entertainment. While the company cited AI in the reduction, insiders in its entertainment arm also pointed to the end of Peak TV and to Prime Video's stated goal of getting to profitability in 2025. Amazon MGM Studios, known for original series like "The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power" and "Reacher," drives Prime Video, which is included with Prime subscriptions. It's been undergoing significant leadership changes this year, with Netflix alum Peter Friedlander coming in to head up TV following the departures of top execs Vernon Sanders and Jen Salke. As part of Amazon's AI efforts, it has begun to leverage the tech across its entertainment arm, which is led by Mike Hopkins. Company leaders have talked publicly about the various ways they're using the tech to soup up the viewing experience on Prime Video. Earlier this year, Prime Video head Albert Cheng moved into an AI role. At the time, the company said he'd help create new AI tools for filmmakers and showrunners. In June, Amazon also invested in startup Fable Studio to build out an AI-powered streaming platform, Showrunner, which lets users make their own shows and play with existing IP. The investment was made through Amazon's Alexa Fund, a VC fund focused on AI, voice, and other technologies. Amazon has been scrutinizing spending on original entertainment after a period of lavish outlays on big series, such as "Citadel" and "Rings of Power." Its last big layoff in its entertainment arm was in January 2024, when hundreds were cut in what was then its deepest staff reduction to date. Jump to

Title: Panama Canal Opens Search for Partners in $2.6B Dual-Terminal Project
URL: https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/logistics/panama-canal-authority-partners-dual-terminal-operators-consultation-construction-project-ports-corozal-telfers-1234786645/

By Glenn Taylor As the Panama Canal’s operator turns its focus to developing new port terminals on both sides of the trade conduit, it has launched a “consultation process” designed to identify possible partners that would control the gateways. The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) made the announcement Monday after holding an invite-only meeting including members of both major container shipping lines and global port and terminal operators. In August, the ACP indicated it planned to sell rights to two plots of land reserved for the construction of two new ports near the canal. These two ports would be individual transshipment terminals—Corozal on the Pacific Ocean and Telfers serving the Atlantic Ocean. Combined, the two terminals are expected to boost the country’s overall container-handling capacity from 9.5 million 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs) to 15 million TEUs annually. The construction of the terminals is expected to cost $2.6 billion, with both scheduled to begin operations in 2029 upon completion. As part of the process, the authority will conduct a market and feasibility study for both terminals. Following this stage, a general project plan will be developed which will lead to the initiation of a special process to select a concessionaire for each terminal. Related Stories Topics Cosco, OOCL Rack Up $43M in Port Fees in First Week After USTR Penalties Take Effect Topics Red Sea Return Could Flood Europe's Ports With Cargo The selection will include a pre-qualification phase, a one-on-one dialogue stage with pre-qualified participants, and finally, the awarding of the concession contracts. The final phase of the selection is expected to conclude in the fourth quarter of 2026. Approximately 8,100 direct and indirect jobs are expected to be generated during construction, the ACP says, with that number jumping to 9,000 once operations begin. The project is forecast to provide an economic impact of between 0.4 percent and 0.8 percent of Panama’s gross domestic product (GDP). Representatives from terminal operators included Maersk-owned APM Terminals, Cosco Shipping Ports, CMA Terminals, DP World, Port Houston, PSA International and Mediterranean Shipping Company’s (MSC) Terminal Investment Limited. The ocean carriers consisted of CMA CGM, Cosco Shipping, Evergreen, Hapag Lloyd, Hyundai Merchant Marine (HMM), Maersk, MSC, Ocean Network Express (ONE), Orient Overseas Container Line (OOCL), Yang Ming and ZIM. “We think that if it isn’t done here in Panama, it will happen elsewhere in the region, and we have to decide whether we want to stay competitive,” said Víctor Vial, vice president of finance at the ACP, at the Monday press conference. For the ACP, and for Panama in general, the desire to foster more competition at the canal comes as geopolitical tensions have put the waterway and the country under the microscope from both American and Chinese interests. A proposed $23 billion mega-deal which would see Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison sell off the Balboa and Cristóbal ports, as well as more than 40 others worldwide, to a consortium of MSC and BlackRock, has been in limbo since the summer. That acquisition occurred weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump returned to office, and was considered a massive win for his administration as it aims to curb Chinese influence in the region. Conversely, Beijing and China’s President Xi Jinping were unhappy with the deal, with China’s antitrust regulator opening a probe into that transaction, and later pushing for state-owned Cosco’s inclusion. The acquisition is under scrutiny from some in Panama’s government as well, with the country’s Supreme Court currently presiding over a lawsuit that alleges Hutchison’s recent 25-year extension to operate the Balboa and Cristóbal ports is illegal. If the high court rules in the favor of the comptroller general who filed the suit, the port sale would be annulled. If the contract is voided, it would take between 12 and 18 months to get a new concession tender ready, said José Ramón Icaza, Panama’s minister of canal affairs. “We don’t control the scenarios, but what I can say is that President [José Raúl] Mulino and a few members of his cabinet, including myself, are working on a plan for any of those scenarios and that if we have to take control of Balboa and Cristóbal we don’t create a disruption of the supply chain in the region,” Icaza said. The constant tug-of-war among the parties has driven concerns among ACP leadership that a concentration of terminal operators at the canal-adjacent ports would pose risks to the waterway’s neutrality. Panama’s $2.6 billion port project is one tranche of a wider 10-year, $8.5 billion plan to modernize the canal by 2023. The plan includes the $1.6 billion construction of the Indio Rio reservoir, which will be built to supplement the canal’s main supply of water from Lake Gatún and add capacity for an additional 11 to 13 daily transits. Additionally, the other major project within the 10-year blueprint is a 76-kilometer (47-mile) liquefied gas pipeline that could transfer up to 2.5 million barrels per day between the Corozal and Telfers terminals without sailing them through the canal.

Title: Amazon hit with demand from senator to explain plans to 'dump workers' for robots
URL: https://www.rawstory.com/amazon-2674244153/
Time Published: 2025-10-28T21:45:55Z

US Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday demanded answers from Amazon as the corporate behemoth moved ahead with plans to lay off around 14,000 employees, with reports indicating the job cuts are just the start of a sweeping effort to replace workers with robots and artificial intelligence models in the coming years. In a letter to Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s billionaire founder and executive chairman, Sanders (I-Vt.) asked if the company has any plans to “provide help and support for the many hundreds of thousands of workers you will be replacing with robots and AI.” The senator, a longtime critic of Amazon’s treatment of warehouse workers, noted that Amazon is poised to benefit substantially from tax breaks included in US President Donald Trump’s signature budget law. “Are you going to simply dump these workers out on the street, or will you treat them with the dignity they deserve?” Sanders asked Bezos, one of the richest men in the world. “Will you be providing a decent severance package for them? Will Amazon be maintaining their healthcare benefits? Will Amazon offer them a secure retirement plan? Or, will most of the savings and tax breaks simply be used to further enrich yourself and Amazon’s wealthy stockholders?” Sanders’ letter came in the wake of Amazon’s announcement that it is slashing its global workforce by roughly 14,000 employees, with additional cuts expected next year. Reuters, which first reported the news, noted that the layoffs “offer an early look at the possibly broad effects of AI on workforces.” “Amazon CEO Andy Jassy flagged the potential for such losses in June, saying increased use of AI tools and agents would lead to more corporate job cuts, particularly through automating routine tasks,” the outlet observed. The layoffs followed explosive New York Times reporting that revealed Amazon’s internal plans to replace more than half a million jobs with robots. “At facilities designed for superfast deliveries, Amazon is trying to create warehouses that employ few humans at all,” the Times reported. “And documents show that Amazon’s robotics team has an ultimate goal to automate 75% of its operations.” It’s not clear whether Amazon has any plans to provide substantive relief to workers and communities harmed by large-scale automation. Rather, the company appears focused on muting the public relations impact of mass job cuts. The Times story notes that “documents show the company has considered building an image as a ‘good corporate citizen’ through greater participation in community events such as parades and Toys for Tots” as part of an anticipated need to “mitigate the fallout in communities that may lose jobs.” “Given all the support that you have received from the taxpayers of this country, don’t you think that it might be appropriate to treat the American workers you are displacing with respect and compassion?” Sanders, who has voiced alarm over the rapid development of AI technology and its implications for workers and humanity at large, warned in his letter Tuesday that “if Amazon succeeds on its massive automation plan, it will have a profound impact on blue-collar workers throughout America and will likely be used as a model by large corporations throughout America, including Walmart and UPS, to displace tens of millions of jobs.” Addressing Bezos directly, Sanders wrote that “the federal government has been very generous to you and Amazon,” noting that the company has repeatedly avoided federal income taxes despite massive profits. The senator added that US taxpayers have effectively subsidized Amazon as the company pays delivery drivers, warehouse workers, and other employees such low wages that they’re forced to rely on public assistance to get by. “Given all the support that you have received from the taxpayers of this country, don’t you think that it might be appropriate to treat the American workers you are displacing with respect and compassion?” Sanders asked Bezos. “I look forward to hearing back from you as soon as possible as to how you will protect the workers you are displacing.” ALSO READ: 'A Trump statue?'

It’s a tough time for the job market. Amid wider economic uncertainty, some analysts have said that businesses are at a “no-hire, no fire” standstill. That's caused many to limit new work to only a few specific roles, if not pause openings entirely. At the same time, some sizeable layoffs have continued to pile up — raising worker anxieties across sectors. Some companies have pointed to rising operational costs spanning from President Donald Trump's barrage of new tariffs and shifts in consumer spending. Others cite corporate restructuring more broadly — or, as seen with big names like Amazon, are redirecting money to investments like artificial intelligence. In such cases, “it’s not so much AI directly taking jobs, but AI’s appetite for cash that might be taking jobs," said Jason Schloetzer, professor business administration at Georgetown University’s McDonough School. He pointed to wider “trade offs” from employment to infrastructure investment seen across companies today. Federal employees have encountered additional doses of uncertainty, impacting worker sentiment around the job market overall. Shortly after Trump returned to office at the start of the year, federal jobs were cut by the thousands. And many workers are now going without pay as the U.S. government shutdown nears its fourth week. “A lot of people are looking around, scanning the job environment, scanning the opportunities that are available to them — whether it’s in the public or private sector," said Schloetzer. “And I think there’s a question mark around the long-term stability everywhere.” Government hiring data is on hold during the shutdown, but earlier this month a survey by payroll company ADP showed a surprising loss of 32,000 jobs in the private sector in September. Here are some companies that have moved to cut jobs recently. Amazon said Tuesday that it will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs, close to 4% of its workforce, as the online retail giant ramps up spending on AI while trimming costs elsewhere. A letter to employees said most workers would be given 90 days to look for a new position internally. CEO Andy Jassy previously said he anticipated generative AI would reduce Amazon’s corporate workforce in the coming years. And he has worked to aggressively cut costs overall since 2021. United Parcel Service has cut about 34,000 jobs since the start of this year as part of turnaround efforts, amid wider shifts in the company's shipping outputs. The layoffs, disclosed in a regulatory filing on Tuesday, are notably higher than the roughly 20,000 cuts UPS forecast earlier this year. On Tuesday, UPS said it also closed closed daily operations at 93 leased and owned buildings during the first nine months of this year. Last week, Target that it would eliminate about 1,800 corporate positions, or about 8% of its corporate workforce globally. Target said the cuts were part of wider streamlining efforts — with Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke noting that “too many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions.” The retailer is also looking to rebuild its customer base. Target reported flat or declining comparable sales in nine of the past eleven quarters. In mid-October, Nestlé said it would be cutting 16,000 jobs globally — as part of wider cost cutting aimed at reviving its financial performance. The Swiss food giant said the layoffs would take place over the next two years. The cuts arrive as Nestlé and others face headwinds like rising commodity costs and U.S. imposed tariffs. The company announced price hikes over the summer to offset higher coffee and cocoa costs. In September, Lufthansa Group said it would shed 4,000 jobs by 2030 — pointing to the adoption of artificial intelligence, digitalization and consolidating work among member airlines. Most of the lost jobs would be in Germany, and the focus would be on administrative rather than operational roles, the company said. The layoff plans arrived even as the company reported strong demand for air travel and predicted stronger profits in years ahead. Also in September, Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk said it would cut 9,000 jobs, about 11% of its workforce. Novo Nordisk — which makes drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy — said the layoffs were part of wider restructuring as the company works to sell more obesity and diabetes medications amid rising competition. Oil giant ConocoPhillips has said it plans to lay off up to a quarter of its workforce, as part of broader efforts from the company to cut costs. A spokesperson for ConocoPhillips confirmed the layoffs on Sept. 3, noting that 20% to 25% of the company’s employees and contractors would be impacted worldwide. At the time, ConocoPhillips had a total headcount of about 13,000 — or between 2,600 and 3,250 workers. Most reductions were expected to take place before the end of 2025. Intel has moved to shed thousands of jobs — with the struggling chipmaker working to revive its business as it lags behind rivals like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. In a July memo to employees, CEO Lip-Bu Tan said Intel expected to end the year with 75,000 “core” workers, excluding subsidiaries, through layoffs and attrition. That’s down from 99,500 core employees reported the end of last year. The company previously announced a 15% workforce reduction. In May, Microsoft began began laying off about 6,000 workers across its workforce. And just months later, the tech giant said it would be cutting 9,000 positions — marking its biggest round of layoffs seen in more than two years. The latest job cuts hit Microsoft’s Xbox video game business and other divisions. The company has cited “organizational changes,” with many executives characterizing the layoffs as part of a push to trim management layers. But the labor reductions also arrive as the company spends heavily on AI. In June, Procter & Gamble said it would cut up to 7,000 jobs over the next two years, 6% of the company’s global workforce. The maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers said the cuts were part of a wider restructuring — also arriving amid tariff pressures. In July, P&G said it would hike prices on about a quarter of its products due to the newly-imposed import taxes, although it's since said it expects to take less of a hit than previously anticipated for the 2026 fiscal year.

Is it really starting with layoff? Employees will have to adjust, not that hard to do America is reaping ,what it sowed with Trump More of that Maga winning at work. Golden age of America have arrived right now. This is just a beginning. Few F-150 sales in Japan will not change final picture much. Go home enjoy Netflix and food tickets... Increased prices in pretty much every consumer products and less jobs available. And yet, the usual MAGA cult members would defend their cult by telling the rest how they just need to suck it up. New US unemployment claims are stable, companies always announcing 're-structuring', real wage gains adjusted for inflation excellent, best in many decades Reality, many illegal immigrants are self-deporting or being deported, so the US labor market remains tight. Global economic growth has been based on tech and globalised trade links. With nationalists damaging global trade and the AI bubble getting closer to deflating or popping, wise companies are retrenching as fast as they can. The stock market casinos are irrelevant. The real numbers ahead are all red. The only serious growth ahead will be in the arms trade. Wow thousands upon thousands of jobs to be laid off now and in the coming years by many major companies in this article alone. Smaller and smalll businessesprobably in worse position. And it's still good news to some people . Trump is making a great job ruining the country.. Many of them probably voted for Trump, so they're getting what they asked for. Don't feel sorry for any Americans. but earlier this month a survey by payroll company ADP showed a surprising loss of 32,000 jobs in the private sector in September. The private sector lost 32,000 jobs in Sep 2025, a reversal from the previous month's revised loss of 3,000. Overall job growth for Aug 2025 was also much lower than economists anticipated, and the economy shed jobs in June for the first time since 2020 The manufacturing sector has continued to lose jobs, with a total decline of 33,000 jobs for the year so far, particularly in durable goods industries The number of people unemployed for more than 27 weeks has surged recently, indicating it is taking longer for workers to find new jobs Confidence among those who have lost their jobs about finding new employment has fallen to its lowest level since the Federal Reserve started surveying consumers in 2013, suggesting less security about future job prospects LMFAO so many uninformed people go speculate for gold!! In my opinion the reason the US is losing many jobs is because the honeymoon is over inflated wages where you had the Microsoft's, FB and Google employees honeymooning on their job sleep at their desk during this time these company expanded aggressively during the pandemic these people could work from home now we have slow growth and economic uncertainty now that all of this is over its time to cut the fat. Also during this time we had low interest rates, people could work from home. Now we have rising interest rates , inflation, and weaker consumer spending this is whats causing these companies to re calibrate so instead of hiring more they are firing to cut cost and boost their profitability. These sensitive business have become very sensitive to their investments, in addition you have other tools that have come onboard AI tools which is also increasing unemployment which is shifting the demand for some jobs. The tech industries just got caught with their pants down over hiring too many people and now they have to get rid of them and you are finding many with out work and looking for work is taking a long time to regain employment because there's so many of them alike out there. This is now making people thing to change their skill sets especially where jobs are repeatable AI can do them. Fron dot-com to bust now it AI or trust.! With these 5 companies propping up the entire US economy all betting on AI. These layoff will be the least of the US worry once the bubble pops.

Title: What Amazon’s mass layoffs are really about | CNN Business

Amazon — a company that made more than $35 billion in profit in the first half of 2025 and is on track to spend more than $120 billion on AI this year — is laying off thousands of people, citing its desire to slim down and “operate like the world’s largest startup.” The overall message from Amazon reflected a familiar impulse in Corporate America to reduce headcount in the face of rising prices, an unpredictable trade war and a potential (though still largely speculative) artificial-intelligence revolution. Amazon isn’t alone: UPS on Tuesday announced it had cut some 48,000 workers this year; Target eliminated 1,800 corporate jobs last week “to be stronger, faster and better positioned” for the future, its new CEO said; and other spectacularly profitable tech players like Microsoft and Meta have also shed staff by the thousands recently. But the impulse, which tends to please Wall Street in the short term, also amounts to a giant gamble on a technology that has yet to prove it can deliver the efficiencies its backers have long promised. “I think we’re going to see a big trend where people are expecting a whole lot of this technology, and not everything we’re expecting will pan out,” said Sam Ransbotham, professor of business analytics at Boston College’s Carroll School of Management. To be sure, Amazon appears to be cutting staff in anticipation of AI productivity gains, rather than in response to them. A spokesperson for the company said AI advancements were not responsible for the vast majority of the 14,000 cuts the company announced Tuesday. Although CEO Andy Jassy has warned about AI “agents” replacing workers, there is no indication that is happening yet. But the company’s memo announcing the layoffs reiterated Jassy’s belief that AI is bound to transform the workplace. “We need to remember is that the world is changing quickly,” the memo says, adding that “we’re convinced” that a leaner workforce is the key to leading in the AI era. At the same time, Amazon, like other giant employers, is not immune to the uncertain business climate that has prompted other companies to put the brakes on hiring and look for ways to tighten their belts as they absorb the costs of tariffs and anxiously await a lasting US-China trade deal. “There are probably many reasons behind a change in staffing and a change in workforce,” beyond just preparing for an AI-enabled future, Ransbotham said. And although AI tools are evolving, they also can be a convenient head-fake when other problems may be dogging a business. These days companies are touting, and often overstating, their AI bona fides. A study released Tuesday by Indeed found that mentions of “AI” in job postings are rising, but about a quarter of them lack context about how AI would be used in the role, a trend known as AI-washing. AI warnings are the hip new way for CEOs to keep their workers afraid of losing their jobs Similarly, management experts have raised doubts about the true impact of AI on layoffs. “Very few companies are actually replacing people with AI right now,” Jessica Kriegel, chief strategy officer at executive advisory firm Culture Partners, told CNN. “What we’re seeing instead are preemptive layoffs … Leaders want the financial runway to explore how AI might drive efficiency, but the technology isn’t yet ready to take over most human roles.” Despite tech companies’ promises about the capabilities of generative AI, the technology has frequently fallen short of its promoters’ lofty ambitions to streamline drudgery and free up humans to do more creative, fulfilling work. Increased adoption so far hasn’t translated to economy-upending productivity gains, but it has yielded an explosion of “workslop” – the gobbledygook some chatbots produce that have the look of real work without the substance that makes it valuable. The battle for the future of the internet is underway Chatbots are challenging the dominance of online search, and are often used to troubleshoot potential problems in computer code. But they are also prone to errors that can be hard to detect. Adoption has exploded since ChatGPT was released three years ago, but so, too, have stories of humans developing harmful relationships with chatbots. Amazon, which is set to report quarterly earnings Thursday, didn’t indicate which teams would be affected by the cuts. Its stock was up just over 1% on Tuesday. And while the cuts – which could eventually top 30,000, according to Reuters – are likely to please Wall Street in the short term by padding Amazon’s profit margins, such drastic staff reductions bring longer term risks and hidden costs, Kriegel said. “Slimming down too early doesn’t make a company nimble; it makes it brittle,” she said. “The companies that will win this revolution aren’t the ones that automate the fastest. They’re the ones that stay adaptable enough to catch the system when it slips.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On Tuesday morning, some Amazon employees learned they had lost their jobs — through text messages. Amazon sent two text messages early Tuesday to inform employees their jobs had been eliminated, according to people familiar with the matter and screenshots reviewed by Business Insider. One message urged affected employees to check their personal or work email before coming to the office. A second text directed them to call a help desk if they hadn't received "an email message about your role." The texts, sent shortly after email notifications, were intended to prevent laid-off employees from arriving at the office and discovering their badges no longer worked, one of the people said. The predicament of laid-off workers unable to badge in has become increasingly common during recent mass layoffs at companies such as Google and Tesla. An Amazon spokesperson didn't respond to a request for comment. The people who spoke with Business Insider asked not to be identified because they're not authorized to speak to the press. Amazon eliminated about 14,000 jobs on Tuesday, saying the cuts were part of an effort to streamline operations and "innovate much faster." Many of the affected employees in the US were retail managers, continuing a trend of reductions in that part of the company. A message from Amazon HR chief Beth Galetti, sent to affected employees and shared on the company's internal Slack, said laid-off workers would continue to receive full pay and benefits for 90 days, along with a severance package. In a separate blog post Tuesday, Galetti said the job cuts were driven by rapid advances in artificial intelligence, noting that Amazon was making changes despite the company's strong performance. "What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly," Galetti wrote. "This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones)."

Title: The "no hire, no fire" job market may no longer be a thing

Watch CBS News Updated on: October 29, 2025 / 9:43 AM EDT / CBS News For most of 2025, the job market was described by economists as "no hire, no fire" — a stretch of time when job seekers faced slim prospects, but workers could count on job security. But that fragile balance may now be shifting, labor experts warn, as mass layoffs at companies like Amazon and UPS signal a possible turning point for the labor market. Amazon on Tuesday announced 14,000 job cuts, citing a shift toward artificial intelligence, while UPS on the same day said it has reduced its workforce by 48,000 from a year earlier. Paramount Skydance, the owner of CBS News, on Wednesday also announced it is shedding jobs, part of an ongoing effort to cut costs at the entertainment and media company. Target on Tuesday also notified a state employment agency in Minnesota, where the retailer is based, that it plans to lay off more than 800 workers in January as part of a broader corporate restructuring, CBS News Minnesota reported. The retailer announced last week that it would cut 1,800 corporate positions as the chain trims its global workforce by about 8%. The mass layoffs come as the Federal Reserve scrutinizes the labor market for signs of weakness, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month citing concerns about slower hiring in announcing the central bank's first interest-rate cut of 2025. The announcements from Amazon and UPS could signal that the Fed has good reason to be worried, experts said. "No question that this is a shift, and it does seem to me it signals that 'no hire, no fire' is a thing of the past," John Challenger, CEO of outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, told CBS News. "These are major layoffs, the kind of which we only see in periods of real change in the economy," he added. Even before Tuesday's job cuts, layoffs had been trending higher, according to data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Employers across the U.S. cut nearly 950,000 jobs this year through September, the largest number of layoffs since 2020, its most recent data shows. Official federal reports on the state of the labor market have been suspended due to the government shutdown, which means the Fed will make its next interest rate decision tomorrow, Oct. 29, without information about hiring in September. But job growth has slowed sharply in recent months, with average monthly payroll gains of roughly 27,000 between May and August — down from average gains of nearly 123,000 per month between January and April, labor data shows. On Oct. 1, the ADP National Employment Report, a measure of private employment in the U.S., said payrolls at private employers declined by 32,000 jobs in September. At the same time, recent reports suggest layoffs have accelerated in October, Grace Zwemmer, associate economist with Oxford Economics, said in a report Wednesday. State-level data also shows jobless claims by federal employees topped 10,000 in the week ended Oct. 18, a sign the stalemate in Congress is taking a toll, the investment advisory firm said in a separate research note. To be sure, the nation's unemployment rate remains low by historical standards, edging up to 4.3% in August from 4.2% in July. The latest layoffs are unlikely to dramatically drive up joblessness, experts say. "When we look at the scale of the announcements vis-à-vis the broader economy and the data we have from unemployment claims, we don't see them yet at a scale where the unemployment rate is going to shoot up," said Andy Stettner, director of economy and jobs at the left-leaning Century Foundation. But, he added, "These larger corporate downsizings are happening at a time when there aren't many job openings." That means some workers who lose their jobs could struggle to find new employment, experts say. As a result, the ranks of long-term unemployed people, or those who have been searching for work for more than six months, are predicted to rise even higher from its August figure of almost 2 million, the highest level since 2022. Employers are cutting jobs due to several factors, experts say, ranging from artificial intelligence to economic uncertainty. Earlier this year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the e-commerce giant's investment in AI tools would allow the company to trim its human workforce as the business becomes more efficient. "Amazon really pointed to robotics, AI and new technology — and being on the cutting edge of that technology — for shifting jobs," Challenger said. About one-quarter of technology industry workers said they had experienced layoffs or role eliminations due to AI adoption during the past two years, according to a new study from career site Indeed. Other companies are holding off on hiring or are cutting jobs for other reasons. UPS cited the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, as well as shipping declines from Amazon, its biggest customer, on its business. Amazon has been building its own delivery infrastructure, leading it to cut back on its use of UPS. On Monday, children's clothing brand Carter's said it is cutting 300 jobs, or 15% of its workforce, and closing 150 stores over the next three years due to higher costs from tariffs, which are import duties paid by U.S. companies to the federal government. The Trump administration has said that its tariffs would help protect U.S. manufacturing and boost domestic production as businesses move their operations stateside. In the meantime, Americans are growing more pessimistic about the job market, according to recent CBS News polling. About 52% of Americans describe the labor market as "bad," up seven percentage points from April, the poll found. "We are moving more into a time where job security might be more precarious," Challenger said. Edited by Anne Marie D. Lee © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Layoffs are piling up, raising worker anxiety. Here are some companies that have cut jobs recently

By WYATTE GRANTHAM-PHILIPS, Associated Press NEW YORK (AP) — It’s a tough time for the job market. Amid wider economic uncertainty, some analysts have said that businesses are at a “no-hire, no fire” standstill. That’s caused many to limit new work to only a few specific roles, if not pause openings entirely. At the same time, some sizeable layoffs have continued to pile up — raising worker anxieties across sectors. Some companies have pointed to rising operational costs spanning from President Donald Trump’s barrage of new tariffs and shifts in consumer spending. Others cite corporate restructuring more broadly — or, as seen with big names like Amazon, are redirecting money to artificial intelligence. Federal employees have encountered additional doses of uncertainty, impacting worker sentiment around the job market overall. Shortly after Trump returned to office at the start of the year, federal jobs were cut by the thousands. And many workers are now going without pay as the U.S. government shutdown nears its fourth week. “A lot of people are looking around, scanning the job environment, scanning the opportunities that are available to them — whether it’s in the public or private sector,” said Jason Schloetzer, professor business administration at Georgetown University’s McDonough School. “And I think there’s a question mark around the long-term stability everywhere.” Government hiring data is on hold during the shutdown, but earlier this month a survey by payroll company ADP showed that the private sector lost 32,000 jobs in September. Here are some companies that have moved to cut jobs recently. General Motors moved to lay off about 1,700 workers across manufacturing sites in Michigan and Ohio on Wednesday, as the auto giant adjusts to slowing demand for electric vehicles. Hundreds of additional employees are reportedly slated for “temporary layoffs.” And GM has recently moved to downsize other parts of its workforce, too — including 200 layoffs mostly impacting engineers in Detroit, and other 300 job cuts at a Georgia IT Innovation Center, which it is also shuttering. In long-awaited cuts just months after completing its $8 billion merger with Skydance, Paramount is going to lay off about 2,000 employees — about 10% of its workforce. Paramount initiated roughly 1,000 of those layoffs on Wednesday, according to a source familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The rest of the cuts will be made at a later date. Amazon said Tuesday that it will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs, close to 4% of its workforce, as the online retail giant ramps up spending on AI while trimming costs elsewhere. A letter to employees said most workers would be given 90 days to look for a new position internally. CEO Andy Jassy previously said he anticipated generative AI would reduce Amazon’s corporate workforce in the coming years. And he has worked to aggressively cut costs overall since 2021. United Parcel Service has disclosed about 48,000 job cuts this year as part of turnaround efforts, which arrive amid wider shifts in the company’s shipping outputs. In a Tuesday regulatory filing, UPS said it’s cut about 34,000 operational positions — and the company announced another 14,000 role reductions, mostly within management. Combined, that’s much higher than the roughly 20,000 cuts UPS forecast earlier this year. Last week, Target that it would eliminate about 1,800 corporate positions, or about 8% of its corporate workforce globally. Target said the cuts were part of wider streamlining efforts — with Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke noting that “too many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions.” The retailer is also looking to rebuild its customer base. Target reported flat or declining comparable sales in nine of the past eleven quarters. In mid-October, Nestlé said it would be cutting 16,000 jobs globally — as part of wider cost cutting aimed at reviving its financial performance. The Swiss food giant said the layoffs would take place over the next two years. The cuts arrive as Nestlé and others face headwinds like rising commodity costs and U.S. imposed tariffs. The company announced price hikes over the summer to offset higher coffee and cocoa costs. In September, Lufthansa Group said it would shed 4,000 jobs by 2030 — pointing to the adoption of artificial intelligence, digitalization and consolidating work among member airlines. Most of the lost jobs would be in Germany, and the focus would be on administrative rather than operational roles, the company said. The layoff plans arrived even as the company reported strong demand for air travel and predicted stronger profits in years ahead. Also in September, Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk said it would cut 9,000 jobs, about 11% of its workforce. Novo Nordisk — which makes drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy — said the layoffs were part of wider restructuring as the company works to sell more obesity and diabetes medications amid rising competition. Oil giant ConocoPhillips has said it plans to lay off up to a quarter of its workforce, as part of broader efforts from the company to cut costs. A spokesperson for ConocoPhillips confirmed the layoffs on Sept. 3, noting that 20% to 25% of the company’s employees and contractors would be impacted worldwide. At the time, ConocoPhillips had a total headcount of about 13,000 — or between 2,600 and 3,250 workers. Most reductions were expected to take place before the end of 2025. Intel has moved to shed thousands of jobs — with the struggling chipmaker working to revive its business as it lags behind rivals like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. In a July memo to employees, CEO Lip-Bu Tan said Intel expected to end the year with 75,000 “core” workers, excluding subsidiaries, through layoffs and attrition. That’s down from 99,500 core employees reported the end of last year. The company previously announced a 15% workforce reduction. In May, Microsoft began began laying off about 6,000 workers across its workforce. And just months later, the tech giant said it would be cutting 9,000 positions — marking its biggest round of layoffs seen in more than two years. The latest job cuts hit Microsoft’s Xbox video game business and other divisions. The company has cited “organizational changes,” with many executives characterizing the layoffs as part of a push to trim management layers. But the labor reductions also arrive as the company spends heavily on AI. In June, Procter & Gamble said it would cut up to 7,000 jobs over the next two years, 6% of the company’s global workforce. The maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers said the cuts were part of a wider restructuring — also arriving amid tariff pressures. In July, P&G said it would hike prices on about a quarter of its products due to the newly-imposed import taxes, although it’s since said it expects to take less of a hit than previously anticipated for the 2026 fiscal year.

Title: UPS axes 48,000 workers in sweeping cost-cut push, sparking stock surge

United Parcel Service has slashed 48,000 jobs this year — one of the largest single-year reductions by a US company since the pandemic — as the package giant scrambled to contain costs and revive its lagging stock price. The Atlanta-based delivery behemoth disclosed the reductions Tuesday while reporting third-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street expectations. UPS said 34,000 of the cuts hit drivers and warehouse operations, while 14,000 targeted management. The company employed about half a million people at the start of the year, the New York Times noted. Chief Executive Carol Tomé said the job losses, a mix of layoffs and buyouts, were part of a restructuring aimed at positioning UPS to be at “the most efficient peak in our history.” “We are executing the most significant strategic shift in our company’s history, and the changes we are implementing are designed to deliver long-term value for all stakeholders,” she said in a statement. UPS shares jumped nearly 9% in Tuesday afternoon trading, even as the company reported weaker revenue and profits. The shipping giant earned $1.3 billion in the third quarter, down from $1.5 billion a year earlier, on revenue of $21.4 billion — a 3.7% decline from last year. Tomé, the first outsider to lead UPS, has faced mounting pressure from investors and employees frustrated by years of underperformance compared with rivals FedEx and Amazon’s growing logistics arm. UPS stock has slumped more than 25% since early 2023. This year’s sweeping cuts were far larger than previously disclosed. UPS said in April it planned to eliminate about 20,000 operational jobs. Last year, the company announced 12,000 management cuts. Tuesday’s filing confirmed that both targets were exceeded. “We keep finding opportunities for us to bring costs down,” Tomé said on a call with analysts. The restructuring has already generated $2.2 billion in savings this year through automation, facility closures and reduced seasonal hiring, according to UPS. The company will run this year’s holiday shipping season with “less variable capacity, fewer leased aircraft, fewer rented vehicles, fewer seasonal workers,” said Chief Financial Officer Brian Dykes. UPS has closed 93 buildings so far this year and expects to shutter more before the end of 2025, the company stated. Sign up to receive On The Money by Charlie Gasparino in your inbox every Thursday.

Its shift toward efficiency also includes reducing dependence on Amazon, its onetime largest customer. Package volumes from Amazon were down more than 21% in the third quarter as UPS deliberately scaled back lower-margin business. Tomé said that trend would continue. The cost-cutting drive has stirred tension with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents roughly 340,000 UPS workers. The union warned earlier this year it would challenge any layoffs that violate its collective-bargaining agreement. On Tuesday, Tomé said the company remained “in compliance with the terms of our contract.” The Teamsters did not immediately respond to requests for comment. UPS said its business has been hit by geopolitical headwinds, including new tariffs that helped drive a nearly 30% drop in package volume from China to the US during the third quarter. UPS said it expects full-year revenue of about $89 billion, roughly flat from 2024, and plans to continue trimming its physical footprint through next year. The company’s latest overhaul follows a string of major corporate downsizings across the logistics and tech sectors, including 14,000 corporate layoffs at Amazon and FedEx’s plan to consolidate air operations. The cuts at UPS mark the deepest cuts in its 117-year history. Advertisement

Title: After Bringing Down Internet, Amazon Announces Biggest Mass Firing in Its History

By Joe Wilkins Published Oct 28, 2025 4:16 PM EDT Just a few days after taking out half of the world’s internet, Amazon is undergoing the biggest layoffs in the corporation’s 31 year history. Reuters was the first to alert workers that the job cuts were expected to start Tuesday, affecting over 30,000 corporate roles. Sure enough, starting early Tuesday morning, thousands of workers for Amazon Web Services (AWS) — yes, the infrastructure-providing part of the company that brought down everything from Fortnite to Bored Ape NFTs when it failed spectacularly last week — began receiving texts and emails bearing the bad news. Overall, 30,000 workers is just a drop in the bucket for Amazon’s workforce of 1.5 million of warehouse workers, drivers, and other blue collar roles. But as far as corporate employees go, that number accounts for a brutal 10 percent. Per sources who spoke to Reuters, the massive firing spree is a corrective measure meant to compensate for over-hiring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Beth Galetti, Amazon’s senior vice president of HR, posted a memo addressed to all Amazon employees earlier today in which she claimed only 14,000 roles were being slashed. “Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well,” she wrote. “What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly,” she continued. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones).” Former Amazon employees took to Blind, an anonymous messaging board only available to workers who register with their workplace email, to vent their frustrations. “I got laid off and I am pregnant. What should I do?” one post read. “My husband has been looking for a job since he got laid off a few months ago. He didn’t take COBRA and we were on my insurance plan,” the Amazon worker wrote, referring to the group benefits package available to some employees who experience layoffs. (Amazon has previously been sued for intimidating employees out of taking the COBRA benefits.) “Now we are both out of work, it’s not looking good,” the poster continued. One former AWS employee whose role was previously eliminated told Futurism the typical “layoff playbook” at Amazon is 90 days to find an internal job, followed by three months of severance pay. Some speculated that the timing of the cuts has more to do with Amazon’s upcoming quarterly earnings report, expected on October 30. Layoffs of this size are sure to boost Amazon’s future earnings projections, and thus its stock price. (Sure enough, Amazon stocks were up around 1.25 percent on Tuesday.) “Just received an email that my role has been terminated at 3am PST,” an AWS worker with over five years at the company wrote. “I know it’s coming but still need time to process.” “Got laid off today. Work-life balance had been rough for a while — just yesterday I joked that it wouldn’t be the worst thing if I got laid off,” sighed another. “I take it back. This uncertainty doesn’t feel nice at all.” More on Amazon: Amazon Reveals Smart Glasses That Effectively Turn Its Delivery Drivers Into Cyborg Drones I’m a tech and transit correspondent for Futurism, where my beat includes transportation, infrastructure, and the role of emerging technologies in governance, surveillance, and labor.

Title: Amazon Games is making major layoffs as it shifts focus away from MMOs to its Luna cloud gaming platform: 'We have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development'

The VP of Amazon Games says the layoffs are part of the 14,000 announced today, but represent broader "strategic changes" at the gaming division. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Amazon's AI-powered layoff of 14,000 employees will see "significant" cuts made to its game division, according to a new Bloomberg report, which will result in a reduction in development efforts on big-budget games, including MMOs like New World. The Bloomberg report cites a memo sent to Amazon Games employees by Steve Boom, Amazon's vice president of audio, Twitch, and games, which was confirmed and shared in full by Variety. In it, Boom says the layoffs are part of the sweeping cuts at Amazon, but also represent "strategic changes [that] go beyond what is happening company-wide." Boom said Amazon Games leadership has been evaluating its plans over the past several months, "through the lens of our mission to deliver the very best gaming experiences to customers while leaning into the things that Amazon does best." As an example, he cited Amazon Luna, which "leans into both streaming entertainment and delivering value for Prime members" with things like, uh, the "AI-powered Snoop Dogg game where he's a judge." This is what Amazon envisions as the future of gaming. Anyway, things are less rosy on the big-budget side of the coin, according to Boom: "While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work—specifically around MMOs—within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team." Despite the cuts, Boom said Amazon is continuing to work on the mysterious new Tomb Raider game with Crystal Dynamics, which made two rounds of layoffs of its own earlier this year, and an open world driving game being made by Maverick Games. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Amazon has struggled somewhat to establish itself in the videogame business, despite bringing virtually unlimited resources to the table. New World, rebranded last year to New World: Aeternum, seems a solid but not especially noteworthy success (update: perhaps I spoke too soon), but the free-to-play shooter Crucible was an unmitigated disaster, becoming one of the vanishingly few games I've ever seen actually be un-released. A Lord of the Rings MMO planned for 2022 was cancelled a year before its launch—after which Amazon for some reason decided to try again. It made a mess of the Western launch of Throne and Liberty in 2024, and earlier this month the co-op platformer King of Meat launched to virtually zero interest: SteamDB says there are currently eight people playing on Steam. It hasn't been a Stadia-sized catastrophe, but neither has it been the cakewalk that Amazon apparently expected. Comparing the company's efforts to muscle in on Steam's territory, for instance, former Prime Gaming VP Ethan Evans said earlier this year that "we assumed that size and visibility would be enough to attract customers, but we underestimated the power of existing user habits. We never validated our core assumptions before investing heavily in solutions. The truth is that gamers already had the solution to their problems, and they weren't going to switch platforms just because a new one was available." It seems so simple when you put it that way, but I guess when you're a top executive at one of the world's biggest companies, you have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars and put thousands of people out of work before you can really be sure. Boom told Variety earlier this month that Amazon's new focus on Luna does not mean it will be eliminating conventional game development entirely, but it will be moving more toward "console-friendly titles, known IPs, or known play patterns." The number of Amazon Games employees being put out of work by these layoffs hasn't been revealed. I've reached out to Amazon for comment and will update if I receive a reply.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Nvidia, already the world leader in chips crucial for artificial intelligence, wants to make its technology central to everyday life. That means everything from cell phone towers to robotic factories to self-driving cars, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced in his first-ever keynote address at the company’s GTC AI conference in Washington, DC, on Tuesday. With AI already playing a major role in consumers’ lives and the economy, that kind of ubiquity would cement Nvidia’s role in a tech arms race now spanning the globe. Nvidia’s at a critical juncture. It has partnered with the world’s top companies, has the ear of President Donald Trump and became the first public firm to reach a $4 trillion valuation over the summer. But it’s also navigating a bevy of challenges, including escalating concerns about whether the AI market is a bubble waiting to burst, growing competition from rival chipmakers AMD and Qualcomm and trade restrictions. In the face of that competition, Nvidia is sending a clear message: While its semiconductors power most of the world’s AI data centers, the company does way more than just design chips. Huang also told CNN he doesn’t believe there is an AI bubble. He argued that people’s willingness to pay for AI tools indicates that the technology is “profitable,” even if most tech firms are now reinvesting the money they’re earning into new infrastructure. “AI is now profitable, meaning AIs are now so good that they deserve to be paid for,” he said. The chipmaker’s stock (NVDA) ended up nearly 5% on Tuesday. Nvidia on Tuesday said it’s releasing a blueprint for how other firms should build massive, “gigascale” AI data centers, which it calls “AI factories,” the likes of which Oracle, Microsoft, Google and other leading tech firms are investing billions in. The most powerful and efficient of those, the company says, will include Nvidia chips and software. A new Nvidia AI Factory Research Center in Virginia will use that technology. But Tuesday’s updates go far beyond data centers. Nvidia announced a partnership with telecom firms T-Mobile and Nokia to build “AI-native” 6G cell phone towers, the next generation of wireless technology. The system will use a new Nvidia product, the Aerial RAN computer, that includes its chips and software. When deployed, the technology is expected to provide a faster, more powerful connection for cell phones and a range of other AI devices, such as speakers, glasses and, eventually, robots. “Wireless technology around the world, largely today, is deployed on foreign technologies … that has to stop, and we have an opportunity to do that, especially during this fundamental platform shift” to 6G, Huang said. Nvidia plans to help build 100,000 self-driving cars in partnership with Uber staring in 2027 — using Nvidia’s chips and “DriveOS” autonomous vehicle operating system — so more people around the country can get rides from robotaxis. It’s providing Palantir with computing power and AI models to help companies build AI agents and systems to automate processes. Lowe’s, for example, will use the tech to create a digital replica of its global supply chain to find opportunities for greater efficiency and cost savings. With Siemens, Nvidia is releasing technology to make “digital twins” of robotic factories. Companies that use it to design, operate and monitor the work of robots doing “dangerous jobs” while helping to fill half a million manufacturing job openings, according to the chipmaker. Nvidia is also partnering with the US Department of Energy to build seven new quantum supercomputers with its AI chips to advance the agency’s scientific research. Nvidia has framed the current AI era as the next industrial revolution, but most companies that have deployed AI tools aren’t yet seeing a return on that investment, MIT said in an August report. And some of the technologies the company is betting on, such as smart glasses and self-driving cars, haven’t yet been widely adopted. The conference’s location in Washington, DC, is no accident. Huang has become a central figure in Trump’s push for the US to dominate AI, and that sentiment was on full display during the keynote — where congressional staffers were offered a special entrance. “The first thing that President Trump asked me for is (to) bring manufacturing back, bring manufacturing back because it’s necessary for national security,” Huang said, adding the company’s AI Blackwell chips are now “in full production” in Arizona, although they must be packaged (a final assembly step) abroad. Huang is set to meet with Trump in South Korea this week during the president’s visit for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit. Nvidia said in August it was seeking clarity from the White House on how it could restart sales of its advanced AI chips to China, after agreeing to pay the US government 15% of its China revenues earlier this year. On Tuesday, Huang said the White House has approved sales of its chips to China, but Beijing is now blocking those sales. Huang borrowed from Trump to close out his keynote: “Thank you all for your service in making America great again.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Oracle and IPDN signal next phase of tokenization as RWA market surges

Oracle and IPDN are building the next layer of institutional blockchain infrastructure. The moves highlight how legacy firms are accelerating real-world asset adoption. Both companies are capitalizing on institutional demand for blockchain-based settlement and compliant RWA trading infrastructure. According to a16z and HTX Ventures, the tokenized asset market has surged to $30 billion, quadrupling in just two years. Oracle and Professional Diversity Network [IPDN] are the latest traditional firms diving into blockchain infrastructure, underscoring a rapid shift toward institutional-grade tokenization. Oracle announced the launch of its Digital Assets Data Nexus platform on 27 October. It is built to help banks and financial institutions issue, manage, and settle tokenized assets on-chain. Meanwhile, IPDN also revealed a strategic collaboration with QBSG Limited to develop a global Real-World Asset (RWA) Exchange. This is designed to bridge regulated capital markets with blockchain rails. Together, the two announcements mark a new front in the corporate tokenization race. Legacy tech firms and public companies are now building infrastructure to bring traditional finance fully on-chain. Recent on-chain data show the RWA market has entered a period of exponential growth. According to a16z crypto report, the total RWA market has expanded fourfold in the past two years, reaching $30 billion in tokenized value. Additionally, BlackRock leads the pack with $2.6 billion in tokenized Treasuries, while Ethereum hosts $9.6 billion in total RWA issuance. Data also indicates that tokenized private credit is valued between $12–$16 billion. This represents over half of all RWA activity. Oracle’s entry shows a major shift in how institutions approach blockchain adoption. Its new platform promises compliance-ready infrastructure for on-chain settlement. This is a critical component as major banks move toward tokenized credit and liquidity products. Similarly, IPDN’s RWA Exchange adds a regulated marketplace layer, supporting the tokenization of equities, real estate, and commodities. Both efforts align with broader industry moves by JPMorgan, Citi, and BlackRock, all of which have unveiled tokenization pilots this year. From private credit to tokenized Treasuries, real-world assets are no longer a niche experiment; they’re becoming the backbone of institutional blockchain adoption. Oracle and IPDN’s latest moves reinforce that the race to tokenize traditional finance is now firmly underway — and the market, already worth tens of billions, is just getting started.

Title: Here's How Much Traders Expect Amazon Stock To Move After Earnings

Amazon (AMZN) is slated to report third-quarter earnings after the closing bell on Thursday, and some traders are betting the results can lift the stock, the laggard of the Magnificent Seven so far this year, to a fresh record. Amazon stock is expected to move about 6.2% in either direction by the end of the week, according to recent options pricing data. A move of that magnitude, based on Monday's closing price, would put Amazon shares at about $243.50, an all-time high, or $215. Amazon's $2.4 trillion market capitalization makes its stock one of the most impactful in the U.S. equity market. A big share price move after Thursday's results would have a larger effect on the major indexes than nearly every other stock. Amazon stock has moved an average of 4.7% following its four most recent earnings reports. Shares slumped more than 8% after the company in July reported cloud revenue growth that disappointed Wall Street after strong showings from competitors Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG). The last time Amazon stock rose following an earnings report was this time last year, when the company topped sales and earnings estimates on strong cloud and advertising growth. Amazon is the worst-performing stock in the Magnificent Seven so far this year, with the company’s outsized tariff exposure weighing on shares. The stock is up just 5% since the start of the year. Amazon’s retail business is contending with increased tariff costs and increasingly squeezed consumers, while its cloud computing unit is making massive data center investments to meet demand for AI workloads. As such, cost savings will be top of mind for investors during Thursday’s earnings call with executives. Amazon on Tuesday announced it would cut 14,000 corporate roles, reportedly part of a larger downsizing that could see the company slash up to 30,000 office jobs, nearly 10% of its white collar workforce. And according to a recent New York Times report, some executives expect warehouse robotics to keep the company from hiring as many as 600,000 workers in the coming years. Cloud growth and capital expenditures will also be in focus. Amazon’s infrastructure investments totaled more than $31 billion in the second quarter, about 20% more than Wall Street was expecting. Chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky forecast the second quarter's spending would be "reasonably representative" of capex spending for the remainder of the year. Update—October 29, 2025: This story has been updated with the latest options and stock prices.

Time Published: 2025-10-28T18:53:41Z
Full Content:
Securitize, a pioneering platform in asset tokenization, has announced its intention to go public through a merger with Cantor Equity Partners II, valuing the company at $1.25 billion. The platform disclosed the strategic move on October 28, 2025, with this set to mark a major development for the tokenization industry. Securitize is at the forefront of bringing global financial institutions onchain. The move sees it join a growing number of crypto-focused companies going public across Wall Street and elsewhere. In its case, the platform, renowned for its role in tokenizing assets for entities such as BlackRock and Apollo, will merge with Cantor Equity Partners II as it eyes the $1.25 billion listing. Cantor Equity Partners is a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) sponsored by Cantor Fitzgerald. The transaction is anticipated to generate up to $469 million in gross proceeds, including a $225 million private investment in public equity (PIPE) financing round. This capital infusion will enhance Securitize’s ability to scale its operations and advance its mission of making capital markets more accessible and efficient through tokenization. 8/ The deal is expected to deliver $469M of gross proceeds consisting of an upsized $225 million in committed common stock PIPE, anchored by new and existing blue-chip institutional investors, and $244 million of cash held in CEPT’s trust account, assuming no redemptions. — Securitize (@Securitize) October 28, 2025 The merged entity, to be renamed Securitize Corp., will list on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “SECZ.” Going public sees Securitize cement its position as a leader in the tokenization space. The platform, which has facilitated over $4 billion in tokenized assets, could attract even more attention as a public entity. The company’s platform offers a comprehensive ecosystem, integrating with major blockchains and financial institutions. It stands out as the first vertically integrated, SEC-registered tokenization provider. BlackRock and Apollo are among firms to tokenize funds with Securitize. “This is a defining moment for Securitize and for the future of finance,” said Carlos Domingo, co-founder and chief executive officer of Securitize. “We founded this company with a mission to democratize capital markets by making them more accessible, transparent, and efficient through tokenization. This is the next chapter in making financial markets operate at the speed of the internet and is another step in our mission to bring the next generation of finance onchain and tokenize the world.” The public listing of Securitize is expected to accelerate the adoption of tokenization across traditional financial markets. Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Brandon Lutnick noted: “We believe that blockchain technology has massive potential to transform finance, and partnering with Securitize underscores our confidence in tokenization as a foundational force in the next era of capital markets.” The real-world asset (RWA) tokenization market has expanded by 135% over the past year, reaching a total value of $35 billion, according to recent data. Analysts at Citi project that the tokenized RWA sector could climb to nearly $4 trillion by 2030.

Vanguard Group has turned artificial intelligence from a pilot program into a profit engine, generating more than $500 million in measurable business value across customer service, analytics and software development, according to MIT Sloan Management Review. The $11 trillion asset manager’s methodical rollout shows how large financial institutions can use AI to boost productivity while maintaining trust, governance and employee engagement.

Δ As mentioned in MIT Sloan analysis on Monday (Oct. 27), Vanguard’s first wave of AI deployments focused on service and productivity. Its “Crew Assist” tool, powered by Azure OpenAI, helps call-center representatives handle investor inquiries more efficiently, while an automated report generator produces customized market summaries for more than 150,000 advisers. Both tools have reduced call-handling times and improved customer satisfaction. The firm’s “Digital Advisor” applies machine learning to model job-loss risk and unemployment duration, tailoring financial-planning recommendations even for clients with minimal balances. A separate call-summarization model automatically drafts meeting notes and follow-ups, reducing administrative work by nearly 50 percent. Vanguard’s research arm has also trained a large-language model on 22,000 corporate earnings-call transcripts to forecast dividend cuts. Companies flagged as negative were five times more likely to announce reductions within a month, underscoring how generative models can supplement traditional financial analysis. As reported by MIT Sloan, Chief Information Officer Nitin Tandon said AI is “embedded where it makes the most difference in decisions that improve investor outcomes and streamline how our teams deliver value.” While Vanguard has taken a focused, high-ROI approach, JPMorgan Chase is expanding AI across the enterprise. Its “LLM Suite” supports more than 200,000 employees and includes 175 active AI applications, from automated research assistants to wealth-management tools that helped boost sales. And JPMorgan isn’t the only company to tap into AI-powered tools for insights into wealth management. BlackRock has also integrated generative AI capabilities into Aladdin, its portfolio management platform used by global institutions, providing portfolio managers with faster insights into exposures and scenario analysis. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Half of Vanguard’s 20,000 employees have completed its internal AI Academy training program, designed to improve literacy and responsible use. Each system is monitored for drift, bias and performance under the company’s governance framework. Chief Data Analytics Officer Ryan Swann told MIT Sloan Review that Vanguard’s success sees “the best outcomes when humans and machines collaborate, not compete.” That approach mirrors findings from the World Economic Forum’s AI in Financial Services report, which found that 70 percent of financial executives expect AI to drive revenue growth but warned that scaling safely depends on workforce readiness and governance discipline. Citigroup is also emphasizing human-AI collaboration through its “agentic AI” system, Stylus Workspaces, which allows employees to perform multi-step workflows, such as market analysis and report summarization, with a single prompt. The tool connects directly to Citi’s internal databases and collaboration platforms, turning AI into an end-to-end task manager. The rollout began in September and is expected to expand globally next year. Across the industry, finance leaders are shifting from cost-based AI metrics to performance-based ones. A PYMNTS report found that CFOs increasingly view AI as a driver of growth and revenue rather than just operational savings, a change reflected in how firms like Vanguard and Citi quantify ROI in business terms rather than experimentation.

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Burlington Stores, the retailer formerly known as Burlington Coat Factory, has taken 42,575 square feet for a store at the as-yet-unbuilt 72-22 Broadway in the Jackson Heights section of Queens. Adam Heller, Stephen Weber and Joshua Singer from the Heller Organization represented the landlord, Werber Real Estate. Clifford Simon, David Rosen and Jake Simon from CNS Real Estate repped the tenant. The length of the lease and the asking rent were unavailable, though CNS classified the lease as “long-term.” Retail asking rents in Jackson Heights for this quarter equaled around $64.10 per square foot, according to CoStar. Burlington’s new Jackson Heights store is scheduled to open in September 2028. 72-22 Broadway is set to be a 13-story, mixed-use building with 60,000 square feet of retail on three levels, with two floors dedicated to office and the rest multifamily residential, Clifford Simon told CO. “Burlington’s arrival is a strong addition to the Jackson Heights community, bringing much-needed affordable soft goods to one of the city’s busiest transit hubs,” Heller said in an email to CO. “We’re excited about the continued momentum in the area as this corridor continues to thrive as a key shopping destination in Queens.” Traded was first to note the lease, which was signed in August. Burlington has been busy on several fronts after opening 101 new stores in 2024 and aiming for around the same number this year. The company took over 45 leases from Joann in May 2025, including at 535 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, following Joann’s second bankruptcy filing in January 2025. The month before, Burlington paid over $257 million to BlackRock to acquire an 889,445-square-foot industrial warehouse in Southern California where the company had been the sole tenant since 2019, as CO previously reported. Burlington also signed a 12-year, 77,970-square-foot lease at RXR and Hudson Bay Capital’s 620 Avenue of the Americas in December 2024 in a move from 695 Avenue of the Americas, as CO previously reported. The company took over the spot of the former Bed, Bath & Beyond outlet. Werber Real Estate, as Roosevelt 72 LLC, purchased the Jackson Heights site — also using the address 72-11 Roosevelt Avenue, according to public records — from Delco Properties for $24 million in May 2020. Representatives for Burlington Stores, Werber Real Estate and the Heller Organization did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Mark Zuckerberg explained Meta's plan to spend more than ever on AI after the company announced earnings that were dragged down by a $15.9 billion tax charge. The social media giant and AI hyperscaler reported revenue of $51.24 billion, beating Wall Street's estimates of $49.5 billion. Earnings per share came in at $6.03, compared to estimates for $6.72. The stock fell more than 9% in after-hours trading. Meta said that its AI infrastructure spending will continue to rise, and that 2026 cap-ex will be "notably larger" than 2025. On a call with analysts, Zuckerberg said that a "significantly larger investment" in compute is "very likely to be a profitable thing." In the "very worst case," he said, Meta will have pre-built capacity and will absorb the depreciation costs. Much of the call was spent discussing Meta's superintelligence lab — for which the company spent heavily to recruit talent — and its ability to monetize. Zuckerberg said that the lab's research enabled "new technological capabilities" that improved the company's products. Meta CFO Susan Li said that a number of "youth-related trials" slated for 2026 could also result in "a material loss." She also walked through the one-time $15.9 billion tax charge and said Meta expected its taxes to decrease in future years due to the Trump's Big Beautiful Bill Act. Catch up on the play-by-play from Meta's Q3 earnings call with analysts below: Zuckerberg closes out the call by saying that Meta is "seeing the returns" for AI in its core businesses, and that it gives the company "confidence" it should do more. "We want to make sure that we're not underinvesting," Zuckerberg says. Meta's stock is trading down around 8.5% as the analyst call concludes. "There's a lot of value to create with AI overall," Zuckerberg says. He says Nvidia has "extremely well-deserved success" in hardware, and that cloud partners are also finding lots of opportunity. AI app companies are "relatively small," he says, but there is a "huge opportunity." The technology industry has not seen this "rate of new capabilities," Zuckerberg says. New businesses can be built around these new capabilities, he adds. Zuckerberg says work on Meta's AI Ray-Ban and Oakley collaborations is going "very well" and will likely be a "very profitable investment" if strong sales continue. Some revenue will come from selling devices, and others will come from services on top of them, he says. The AI will become the "main thing" people are using the glasses for, Zuckerberg says. Meta CFO Susan Li says Advantage Plus ad tech improvements have led to a 14% lower cost-per-lead. Meta is working to broaden adoption of automated solutions, she adds. Advantage Plus is an "ongoing platform," she says. ARR for advertisers using automated options is $60 billion, and there's "room to continue growing that," she says. Zuckerberg says it's "valuable" that a lot of people use Meta's AI models, and that there's a clear correlation between model improvements and usage. He says that the Superintelligence Lab is the "highest talent density lab in the industry." The models will "improve monetization" by improving engagement and advertising, Zuckerberg says. Zuckerberg says research will enable "new technological capabilities" that will be useful in a variety of products, from an AI assistant to a business AI to feed rankings. The capabilities will also help build "new creative tools," Zuckerberg says. The "art of product development," Zuckerberg says, is figuring out which of these products will be useful. He expects an "exponential curve" in technological capabilities to come.

The capabilities will also help build "new creative tools," Zuckerberg says. The "art of product development," Zuckerberg says, is figuring out which of these products will be useful. He expects an "exponential curve" in technological capabilities to come. "I think being best in a given area will drive great returns," he adds. Zuckerberg says Meta is trying to "build novel capabilities," and is not interested in any "check the box" exercises. Meta is working on a foundation model, but also advancing its inference models, Li says. Even "small-scale improvements" like small ad improvements grow revenue in a meaningful way, she says. Zuckerberg says that there was no specific timing for new models or products from the superintelligence team to be announced on the call, but that he was "excited to share more." Mark Zuckerberg defends Meta's ballooning infrastructure costs, saying the company is intentionally "front-loading" compute investments to stay ahead in the race toward superintelligence. He tells analysts that even if Meta overbuilds its data center capacity, the downside would be limited. In the "very worst case," he says, the company would have simply "pre-built for a couple of years," absorbing the costs through depreciation while eventually growing into the extra capacity. Zuckerberg argues that the greater risk is underinvesting, noting that Meta's AI research, recommendation systems, and potential external compute offerings could all profitably use far more compute than the company currently has. They "continue to see improvements in usage" of Meta's AI, Zuckerberg says. Once they have "truly frontier models with novel capabilities," there is great opportunity, Zuckerberg says. He predicts that the ability to plug in "leading models" will lead to a large amount of use. More intelligent models will also improve the core business, Zuckerberg adds. "There's quite a bit more to do," he says. While the stock had ticked up slightly to be trading around -7% mid-way through the call, it's dipped back down after hours. A "significantly larger investment" in compute is "very likely to be a profitable thing," Zuckerberg says. Meta feels "pretty good" that it can convert any compute it doesn't need into more intelligence and better recommendations. Li says "we wish we have more capacity today than we do."

Meta feels "pretty good" that it can convert any compute it doesn't need into more intelligence and better recommendations. Li says "we wish we have more capacity today than we do." Meta is trying to "plan ahead" to be able to meet necessary capacity in 2026, as well as 2027, and 2028, Li says. Their "foremost priority" is building the "compute that we need" to succeed in AI, Li says. There are "headwinds to the Quest headsets" since Meta does not have a new headset on the market this year, Li says. Meta is still expecting significant year-over-year growth in glasses in Q4, Li says. Li says that growth in CapEx is from all areas, including non-AI spend, but that AI needs are "growing the most." Li says that expenditures on ad ranking and performance efforts are paying off. There is "very strong year-over-year growth" in weighted conversions, she adds. Meta expects spending on AI talent to be one of its biggest cost drivers next year as it continues an aggressive hiring push. CFO Susan Li says employee compensation will be the company's second-largest contributor to expense growth in 2026, largely reflecting a full year of pay for AI specialists hired throughout 2025 and new technical recruits in priority areas. She says the increased payroll comes alongside rising infrastructure costs, as Meta's compute needs have "continued to expand meaningfully" and the company plans to "invest aggressively" in both its own data centers and third-party cloud capacity. Li says that, depending on the results, they may result in "a material loss." Meta expects that infrastructure costs will expand, Li says. They expect "invest aggressively to meet these needs," Meta's CFO says. She says it will put "upward pressure" on CapEx. Li says that advertising revenue will drive growth, partially offset by Reality Labs introducing new Quest devices. Meta lifted its CapEx outlook. Investments in ads and "organic engagement initiatives" will enable "strong revenue growth," Li says. The staged data centers will allow Meta to build capacity quickly in future years "as we need it," Li says. Meta continues to observe "performance improvements" as it combines ad models, Li says. Meta is also piloting a new runtime ads ranking model, she says. It has driven a more than 2% lift in Instagram conversions, she says. Meta has more generative AI features for advertisers, Li says, including AI-generated music. These tools "drive increased performance," she says. Li says that global time spent was up on both Facebook and Instagram in the US thanks to video. Meta is developing foundational ranking models to yield more relevant recommendations, Li says. Users have created 20 billion images with Meta AI products, Li says. Since creating the Vibes AI feed, media creation on the Meta AI app has increased tenfold. Meta's headcount as of September 30 was 78,450, representing an 8% year-over-year increase. The CFO says that Meta was hiring in areas like monetization, infrastructure, Reality Labs, and Superintelligence. The headcount metric included in Meta's before the recent superintelligence unit layoffs. Advertising demand has increased, Li says. Average price-per-ad was up 10% year-over-year. Reality Labs revenue was up thanks to retailers stocking up on Quest headsets before the holiday season, she says. While Meta paid a one-time $15.9 billion tax charge, Li adds that the company expects its taxes to go down due to Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Meta's Ray-Ban Connects sold out in "almost every store" within 48 hours, Zuckerberg says. Demo slots are fully booked up through the end of next month, he adds. Zuckerberg says that Meta will invest more in the area. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg says artificial intelligence is already boosting engagement — and profits — across the company's apps. In his opening remarks, he says AI-powered recommendation systems have led to 5% more time spent on Facebook, and 3-10% more time on Threads, with video viewing on Instagram up more than 30% over the past year. "Reels now has an annual run rate of over $50 billion," Zuckerberg added. He said Meta's "three giant transformers" — AI models powering Facebook, Instagram, and ads — are increasingly driving how people discover content and how advertisers reach them. "Retention is looking good" for Vibes, Meta's AI video feed, Zuckerberg says. Usage is growing week over week, and it is an example of a new type of content, he adds. Zuckerberg says that there have been two eras of social media: content from friends and family, and content from creators. The next "corpus" of content will be from AI, he says. That will make recommendation systems valuable. The ARR for Meta's AI-powered ad tools has hit $60 billion. Mark Zuckerberg starts by touting Meta's social app success and superintelligence team. Instagram hit 3 billion monthly active users, and Threads hit 150 million monthly actives. Mark Zuckerberg starts by touting Meta's social app success and superintelligence team. Instagram hit 3 billion monthly active users, and Threads hit 150 million monthly actives. The Meta CEO also says that they are building an "industry-leading" amount of compute. He adds that he wanted to "aggressively frontload" building capacity for superintelligence. In the worst case, he says, Meta can "slow" building infrastructure. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Suan Li are on the call. They'll begin by reading through their prepared remarks before fielding questions from analysts in a live Q&A. Meta said it expects to spend between $70 billion and $72 billion on infrastructure this year as it builds out the computing power behind its AI ambitions, slightly higher than the $66 billion to $72 billion range it projected last quarter. The company said its demand for computing capacity has "expanded meaningfully," prompting bigger investments in data centers and cloud services. Meta added that its infrastructure spending will keep rising next year, with capital expenditure growth in 2026 expected to be "notably larger" than in 2025. Meta paid a one-time tax charge of $15.93 billion this quarter. The company expected a "significant reduction" in federal cash tax payments thanks to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which passed in July. The act's implementation allowed for a "valuation allowance against our U.S. federal deferred tax assets," the company said, causing them to pay a one-time, non-cash income tax charge of $15.93 billion.

Otherwise, Meta says: Meta's Reality Labs revenue was $470 million with an operating loss of $4.432 billion for the quarter. The division houses Meta's AI consumer hardware, virtual reality gear, and metaverse spending, among other things. That includes Meta's Ray-Ban Displays, which the company announced in September. Reality Lab's losses are shrinking, albeit slightly, with the company losing $4.53 billion last quarter. Third Quarter Results Source: Bloomberg Forrester VP and Research Director Mike Proulx told Business Insider that Meta's third quarter was "flooded with feature updates, device announcements, and operational moves," with AI as the common thread. "Of particular note is the launch of Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which effectively launched a new computing platform," Proulx said. "During the earnings call, I'll be listening for an update on sales. I suspect these glasses will mostly attract early tech-curious adopters, and that demos will far outpace actual purchases." He added that Reels' prominence on Instagram continues to grow as the app edges closer to TikTok, and that advertisers are unlikely to pull back spending despite Meta losing brand-safety accreditation from the Media Rating Council, given the platform's reach and performance. Meta has quietly assembled one of the most expensive AI teams in Silicon Valley under its Meta Superintelligence Labs division, hiring top researchers from DeepMind and OpenAI and spending billions on infrastructure. Yet the elite unit responsible for building next-generation AI models — literally named TBD — remains a black box. Investors will be listening closely for any clues from Zuckerberg on what, exactly, it's building. In September, the company debuted its new Ray-Ban Displays at the Connect conference. The glasses come with a built-in screen that displays text messages, maps, and captions over the real world. The Displays went on sale in late September. Within days, CTO Andrew Bosworth posted on Threads that the glasses were sold out and demos were booked up through November at "almost every store."

The Displays went on sale in late September. Within days, CTO Andrew Bosworth posted on Threads that the glasses were sold out and demos were booked up through November at "almost every store." Expect further questions on the analyst call about the sales mix between the screen-free Meta Ray-Ban AI glasses and the more expensive Ray-Ban Displays. In September, Meta released its new short-form AI video feed, Vibes. Some tech founders and execs quickly roasted it as "AI slop." Days later, OpenAI released its new video generation model, Sora 2. Its own short-form Sora app quickly topped the App Store charts. OpenAI has said that 1 million people downloaded the Sora app within five days, while Similarweb data indicates that the Meta AI app's downloads surged by 100,000 after the Vibes feed launched. We might get some further data points on Vibes engagement among Meta's users on the earnings call. Meta has faced some dramatic changes to its headcount in the past few months. After doling out big contracts to staff up its superintelligence unit, Meta cut 600 jobs from it. Meta also cut staff in its risk division as the company automated its review process, per a memo viewed by Business Insider. These cuts come after January's broader layoffs, when Meta cut 5% of its workforce — roughly 3,600 employees — that the company labeled "low performers."

These cuts come after January's broader layoffs, when Meta cut 5% of its workforce — roughly 3,600 employees — that the company labeled "low performers." It'll be interesting to see if Zuckerberg or CFO Susan Li talks about plans for future head count growth — or if they anticipate head count to remain flat or decrease in the coming quarters. When Facebook rebranded to Meta in 2021, Zuckerberg declared a "very long-term bet" on the metaverse. The company then spent billions on projects like Horizon. The fervor has since quieted, though the company announced a new AI feature to build 3D worlds with text at its September Meta Connect event. On Monday, Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth told employees the company was reshuffling its metaverse unit in a memo viewed by Business Insider. "The priority of the metaverse work remains unchanged, and it continues to be a companywide priority," he wrote. Mark Zuckerberg said Meta could spend up to $72 billion this year on AI infrastructure. Will Zuck raise that number even higher? It's possible, but if all this AI capex spend is really hurting Meta's free cash flow and margins, investors might start feeling uneasy. That's why they'll be laser-focused on Meta's advertising business, which still makes up most of the company's earnings. If ad numbers are healthy — and right now, expectations from Wall Street are high — then Zuck probably has more runway for his AI bets. Tech analysts at DA Davidson wrote ahead of Meta's earnings that they're watching for how Meta does compared to its Magnificent Seven peer Alphabet, which also reports results on Wednesday. "We expect META to continue outgrowing Google's ad revenue, though growth may decelerate on tougher comps (including elections)," the firm said in a client note. "We do not expect growth at Google to decelerate significantly, though we are monitoring OpenAI closely, as we believe the likely introduction of advertising around ChatGPT may create a headwind for Google Search advertising growth."

October 28, 2025 13:51 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: WASHINGTON, Oct. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTC Washington, D.C.—NVIDIA today announced America’s first AI-native wireless stack for 6G, including new applications to advance next-generation wireless technology, in collaboration with industry-leading partners Booz Allen, Cisco, MITRE, ODC and T-Mobile. As AI moves beyond smartphones to cameras, augmented-reality glasses, robots, autonomous vehicles and other devices, wireless networks face mounting demand to support billions of connections at unprecedented scale and efficiency. To meet this challenge and support transformative technologies like integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) — a critical sensing capability for connecting physical and digital environments — wireless networks must become AI-native across hardware, software and architecture. AI-native networks enable spectrum — radio frequencies used to transmit wireless signals — to be used as efficiently as possible. AI-RAN architecture is at the heart of next-generation wireless communications, combining connectivity, computing and sensing via a common platform with software-defined applications. “6G is being built from the ground up with AI at its core — unlocking extreme spectral efficiency, massive connectivity and breakthrough applications,” said Ronnie Vasishta, senior vice president of telecom at NVIDIA. “Working with industry leaders, we’ve created an AI-native wireless stack with advanced features to ensure that America will play an instrumental role in the journey to 6G.” First Made-in-America AI-Native Wireless Stack at NVIDIAJust six months since starting the AI-WIN project, NVIDIA and its partners built a complete AI-native wireless stack, performed the first user-to-user phone call over the network and developed groundbreaking 6G applications at NVIDIA’s campus in Santa Clara, California. The system combines the NVIDIA AI Aerial platform with 5G RAN software from ODC, user plane function and 5G core software from Cisco, and specialized 6G applications from MITRE and Booz Allen. Cisco is accelerating secure network connectivity for the AI era through the AI-WIN initiative, helping build the foundation to enable physical AI and integrated sensing with exceptional efficiency and security. “Through this partnership, we are pioneering the future of intelligent, secure connectivity — where AI is infused into the fabric of mobile networks and services,” said Masum Mir, senior vice president and general manager of Cisco Provider Mobility. “Together, we are harnessing AI to enable networks that sense, learn and act in real time, empowering service providers to deliver high-value business and consumer services in the AI era.” Cerberus ODC’s commercial, fully software-defined 5G RAN, powered by NVIDIA AI Aerial, is setting new benchmarks by enabling simultaneous RAN and AI workloads for mission-critical enterprise applications, while outperforming legacy RAN systems with 7x greater cell capacity and 3.5x higher power efficiency. Breakthrough Applications Drive 6G StandardsAs part of the collaboration, NVIDIA and Booz Allen developed a first-of-its-kind multimodal ISAC application, fusing camera vision and radio-frequency sensing to enable precise detection and tracking of objects even in low-visibility conditions. Camera vision can be used to spot a moving object but cannot track its path or detect it when there is an obstruction. Radio-frequency sensors, however, can reveal an object’s location, velocity and distance, and sense its presence without visible light. Using camera vision and radio-frequency data, the new ISAC application delivers enhanced spatial awareness in real time, enabling powerful use cases in public safety, industrial monitoring and national security, where traditional single-modality sensing may fall short. AI-powered spectrum agility, a new application built by MITRE, manages wireless spectrum allocation within a cell site in real time so users can experience seamless connectivity and operators can benefit from dramatic improvements in spectral efficiency. Unlike traditional approaches that shut down entire network bands when interfering systems are detected, this application uses AI to target and block only the affected frequencies without interrupting consumer services. This delivers an orders-of-magnitude improvement in spectral efficiency and utilization compared with existing methods and addresses persistent challenges with spectrum management and operations. At NVIDIA GTC, Washington D.C., Booz Allen showcased its AI-powered spectrum sensing R.AI.DIO application to detect and classify any type of interference, including malicious signal jammers and unauthorized network users, in real time. This enables operators to immediately respond to threats and automatically mitigate issues to protect network integrity. NVIDIA AI Aerial software libraries make these early 6G applications possible, and new AI- and neural network-based model integrations boost performance and efficiency. In addition, the new NVIDIA Aerial Framework provides modular, programmable pipelines to seamlessly integrate third-party applications into the AI-RAN stack. Application programming interfaces that are part of the framework enable these applications to access real-time physical-layer data — the base form of data in a radio signal processing pipeline — enhancing further training and reinforcement learning for AI models on the fly. AI-native wireless networks provide the path to telecom’s major paradigm shift from 5G to 6G, enabling extremely efficient edge AI inference and sensing capabilities to serve hundreds of billions of network connections and raise revenue for operators.

Seamless Transition to AI-Native Networks NVIDIA is introducing Aerial RAN Computer Pro (ARC-Pro), a 6G-ready accelerated computing platform that combines connectivity, computing and sensing capabilities, enabling telcos to move from 5G-Advanced to 6G through software upgrades. The NVIDIA ARC-Pro reference design is available for manufacturers and network equipment providers to build commercial-off-the-shelf-based or proprietary AI-RAN products, supporting both new buildouts and expansions to existing base stations. Nokia will accelerate the availability of its 5G and 6G RAN software on the NVIDIA CUDA® platform and expand its RAN portfolio by embedding NVIDIA ARC-Pro at the heart of the new AI-RAN solution. This partnership will enable Nokia’s mobile network customers to transition seamlessly from today’s RAN networks to future AI-RAN networks. Nokia’s unique anyRAN approach simplifies the introduction of the ARC-Pro platform by establishing software-defined RAN evolution for both Cloud RAN and purpose-built RAN. AirScale baseband is a modular architecture in which new cards can coexist with previously deployed cards. Nokia aims to expand and evolve its AirScale baseband into the 5G-Advanced and 6G era with new AI-RAN capabilities. Dell Technologies is driving innovation in Nokia’s AI-RAN solution with its state-of-the-art Dell PowerEdge servers. Engineered for seamless scalability, these servers enable no-touch software upgrades and low-touch silicon upgrades, ensuring a smooth evolution from 5G to 5G-Advanced and 6G. With their robust, high-performance infrastructure, Dell PowerEdge servers are the ultimate compute platform for operators deploying AI-RAN solutions. Future-Proofed for 6G Nokia and NVIDIA’s AI-RAN platform unifies AI and radio access workloads on a software-defined, accelerated infrastructure, boosting performance, efficiency and monetization while enabling a smooth, cost-effective path to 6G. New capabilities are added through software updates, future-proofing investments for 6G and beyond, while enabling rapid innovation cycles at the pace of AI. It serves growing generative AI and agentic AI traffic on the same sites as RAN functions, applying AI algorithms to improve spectral and energy efficiency, as well as overall network performance, and by tapping into underutilized RAN assets to host edge AI services and maximize return on investment. “With America’s best network, T-Mobile remains committed to advancing next-generation technologies that redefine the customer experience,” said John Saw, president of technology and chief technology officer at T-Mobile. “Our collaboration with industry leaders Nokia and NVIDIA marks an important step toward shaping the future of connectivity as we develop the innovations that will power the 6G era. Building on the foundation established by the AI-RAN Innovation Center in 2024, this strategic initiative reinforces T-Mobile’s leadership in driving the U.S. wireless industry forward. Beginning in 2026, T-Mobile will conduct field evaluations and testing of advanced AI-RAN technologies to ensure they meet the evolving needs of our customers as we move toward 6G.” “The telecommunications industry owns the most valuable real estate for AI — the edge, where data is created,” said Michael Dell, chairman and chief executive officer of Dell Technologies. “This AI-RAN collaboration with Nokia and NVIDIA makes that potential real. We’ve built some of the world’s largest AI clusters with 100,000+ GPUs. Now we’re applying that expertise to distribute intelligence across millions of edge nodes. The operators who modernize their infrastructure today won’t just carry AI traffic — they’ll be the distributed AI grid factories that process it at the source, where latency matters and data sovereignty is critical.” Additional AI Networking Solutions Cooperation Nokia and NVIDIA will also collaborate on AI networking solutions, including data center switching with Nokia’s SR Linux software for the NVIDIA Spectrum-X™ Ethernet networking platform and the application of Nokia’s telemetry and fabric management platform on NVIDIA AI infrastructure. The companies will also explore the use of Nokia’s optical technologies and capabilities as part of future NVIDIA AI infrastructure architecture.

"Owning crypto assets or gold are assets of fear," Fink said during his appearance at the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh, according to a Bloomberg report. "You own these assets because you're frightened of the debasement of your assets. You're worried about your financial security. You're worried about your physical security." “The renewed focus on the so‑called ‘debasement trade’—where investors move away from fiat currencies into hard assets—is rooted in a clear trend: purchasing power is weakening in light of both fiscal and monetary policy leeway, especially on the U.S. dollar side,” Fabian Dori, Chief Investment Officer at Sygnum Bank, told Decrypt. “There are good reasons why private investors, banks, and institutions may start to hedge using Bitcoin,” he added, while warning that 24/7 volatility demands new risk systems and round-the-clock liquidity management. The concerns come as the U.S. government's debt burden is projected to exceed levels in both Italy and Greece for the first time this century. General government gross debt in the U.S. will surge by more than 20 percentage points to reach 143.4% of GDP by 2030, surpassing pandemic-era records, according to IMF forecasts. The IMF estimates the U.S. budget deficit will remain above 7% of GDP annually until 2030, the highest among rich nations tracked by the fund. Fink has gone from calling cryptos such as Bitcoin “the domain of money launderers and thieves” in 2017 to describing himself as a “major believer” in 2024, saying it’s “an instrument you invest in when you’re more frightened.” Two weeks ago, he told CBS that markets force constant reassessment, adding that crypto has "a role in the same way there is a role for gold, that is, it's an alternative." With BlackRock managing $12.5 trillion in assets and operating the largest crypto ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust, with $93.9 billion under management, his views carry substantial weight across global markets. Nic Puckrin, crypto analyst and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, told Decrypt that while Bitcoin originated as an "asset of fear" in response to the 2008 financial crisis, crypto has evolved into "a risk-on bet on the future of blockchain technology and an entirely new, borderless financial system." Bitcoin and blue-chip tokens remain viewed as hedges against fiat devaluation, Puckrin said, calling it "a secular trend, not just a short-term fear-based strategy." Bitcoin is currently trading at around $114,820, down 0.4% in the past 24 hours, per CoinGecko data. Meanwhile, users of prediction market Myriad, launched by Decrypt’s parent company Dastan, expect that Bitcoin will not outperform gold this year, suggesting lingering uncertainty about crypto's volatility despite growing institutional adoption. Sygnum’s Dori pointed to U.S. public entities exploring strategic reserves, major managers positioning Bitcoin as collateral, and the CME’s move toward 24/7 crypto derivatives as signs that the “pieces of the puzzle are coming together.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: US spot Bitcoin ETF balances are negative without BlackRock

Without BlackRock's IBIT, Bitcoin ETFs face potential outflows, showcasing a fragile market balance. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Over the past year, Bitcoin’s exchange-traded fund (ETF) boom has been celebrated as proof that Wall Street has finally embraced crypto. Yet the numbers reveal something far more fragile. On Oct. 28, Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33 Research, noted that US-traded Bitcoin ETFs have attracted about $26.9 billion in inflows year-to-date. However, that headline figure hides a stark imbalance that BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) alone accounts for roughly $28.1 billion of those flows. In other words, Bitcoin ETFs would be in net outflows this year without IBIT. The product’s relentless accumulation has single-handedly offset redemptions across competitors, keeping aggregate inflows positive and sustaining Bitcoin’s narrative of institutional adoption. Since launching in early 2024, IBIT has dominated every major performance metric in the ETF ecosystem. According to SoSo Value data, it has seen about $65.3 billion in lifetime inflows, compared to $21.3 billion across all other Bitcoin funds combined. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s GBTC has suffered roughly $24.6 billion in redemptions, confirming that without IBIT, the aggregate picture would be deeply negative. This effectively means that BlackRock’s IBIT scale stands in a league of its own. The fund drew $37 billion in its debut year and has added another $28 billion so far in 2025, pushing its total assets under management past $90 billion, which is well ahead of any competitor. According to Coinperps data, Bitcoin ETFs collectively hold about 1.3 million BTC, and IBIT accounts for over 60% of that entire stash. A significant part of IBIT’s growth can be linked to the fact that BlackRock has used its $12.5 trillion AUM, retail brokerage channels, and institutional relationships to channel demand into a single flagship product. The asset manager’s entry into the emerging industry instantly conferred legitimacy on a sector still reeling from the broader crisis of trust. Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg ETF Analyst, said: “When BlackRock filed for IBIT, the price was $30,000 and the stench of FTX was still in air. It’s now [over] $110k (a return that is 7x that of the mighty S&P 500) and is now seen as legitimate for other big investors.” Apart from that, the fund’s recent success can also be linked to how Bitcoin has transformed BlackRock’s investor base. Last year, the firm revealed that three out of four IBIT investors were entirely new to BlackRock’s iShare product suite. This shows that IBIT has become not just a crypto ETF but also a client-acquisition engine for the world’s largest asset manager. Indeed, the asset manager’s custom creation mechanisms have become increasingly popular among large Bitcoin holders, or “whales,” who were once wary of traditional financial institutions. These mechanisms allow investors to transfer their Bitcoin directly to the ETF in exchange for new shares, bypassing the need to sell on the open market. So far, the firm has reportedly processed over $3 billion in such in-kind transfers, reflecting the strong confidence in its custodial design and long-term exposure model. This strong dominance has created a halo effect that has proven very profitable for BlackRock. Barely more than a year old, IBIT already ranks as BlackRock’s top ten revenue generators, surpassing long-standing funds like the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF. IBIT’s overarching dominance of the Bitcoin ETF space begs the question of what will happen when its numbers eventually slow down. If IBIT’s inflows taper, the immediate impact would be felt across market liquidity and price stability. At its current size, even a modest reduction in buying could remove a significant source of consistent demand. That demand has acted as a quasi-monetary inflow, offsetting miner sell pressure and exchange outflows. A slowdown would therefore widen spreads on US spot exchanges, reduce arbitrage opportunities for market makers, and weaken the feedback loop that has kept Bitcoin’s price anchored above key support levels. In essence, the ETF bid has become Bitcoin’s floor, and IBIT is most of that bid. The knock-on effects would also ripple through institutional sentiment. If month-over-month flows turn negative, family offices and RIA desks benchmarking performance to IBIT could rebalance away from Bitcoin ETFs entirely. That withdrawal would lower the “liquidity premium” currently embedded in Bitcoin’s price. Finally, a sustained stagnation in IBIT inflows could shift capital toward Ethereum and newly launched altcoins ETFs, eroding Bitcoin’s dominance ratio. However, Lunde pointed out that BlackRock’s absence from these product suites could limit their overall net flows. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: What Is the Fate of Altcoin ETFs Without BlackRock Presence?

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. BlackRock was instrumental in the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs, dampening sentiment with its boycott of altcoin ETFs. In this year alone, Bitcoin BTC $111 696 24h volatility: 1.1% Market cap: $2.23 T Vol. 24h: $66.44 B Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) have recorded net inflows of $26.9 billion, per K33 Research. Out of this massive flow, top asset management firm BlackRock accounted for a total of $28.1 billion, covering the losses from other issuers, including Grayscale Investments. This outlook has prompted the question, “What is the fate of altcoin ETFs without BlackRock’s presence?” Even though Bitcoin ETFs recorded $26.9 billion in net inflows this year, it is obvious that BlackRock contributed the major percentage of this value. Precisely, the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) rakes in $28.1 billion in inflows. This shows that without this fund, Bitcoin ETF flows would be negative. According to K33 Research, Bitcoin ETFs have recorded $26.9 billion in net inflows this year, with BlackRock’s IBIT accounting for $28.1 billion. Excluding BlackRock, Bitcoin ETF flows would be negative. K33 noted that while competitors may gain an edge as BlackRock stays out of… pic.twitter.com/wpaCvqzRSV — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) October 28, 2025 The same positive trend was seen around the BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA), as it dominated inflows on several occasions. Unfortunately, BlackRock has decided to stay out of the current altcoin ETF wave that is now gaining traction. 21Shares, Canary Capital, Fidelity, and many other asset managers have all filed for one or an altcoin ETF with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the last year. Unlike these firms, BlackRock has not pursued a similar filing. Given the strong performance of the first two crypto ETFs, the upcoming funds may face challenges in achieving the same level of traction. In other words, their overall inflows could be limited, despite the massive hype trailing their respective listings. In mid-October, VanEck filed for the Lido Staked Ethereum ETF with the US SEC. Just a week before this filing, it filed a statutory trust registration for the same Ethereum ETF in Delaware. This fund is designed to track spot Lido Staked ETH (stETH) prices based on MarketVector’s LDO Staked Ethereum Benchmark Rate index. Back in August, Bitwise Asset Management submitted an S-1 filing to the US SEC to launch a spot Chainlink ETF to track the price of LINK LINK $18.45 24h volatility: 4.3% Market cap: $12.85 B Vol. 24h: $988.16 M . Details in the filing suggest standard creation and redemption mechanisms, noting that the trust can process both in-kind and cash transactions. It intends to utilize a “Trust-Directed Trade” system managed by the prime execution agent to achieve this. Interestingly, these altcoin ETFs are waiting for a green light from the SEC.

The company’s common stock will trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “SECZ” once the transaction is completed, Securitize said. The firm will also issue digital representations of its stock on a blockchain, the company added. Securitize expects up to $469 million in proceeds from the proposed merger, which would stem from a private placement in public equity and Cantor Equity Partners II’s trust account. Existing backers, including BlackRock–the world’s largest asset manager–and financial services giants ARK Invest, and Morgan Stanley Investment Management, will see their equity rolled into the combined company, Securitize said. The stock price of Cantor Equity Partners II, an affiliate of the firm linked to U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, fell 7% on Tuesday to $11.93, according to Yahoo Finance. Securitize offers a platform enabling companies to manage issuance of real-world assets on-chain, including stock and money market funds. Last March, the company helped BlackRock debut its $2.8 billion USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). Several crypto firms have debuted on Wall Street this year as U.S. regulators and lawmakers have moved to bring clarity to the industry. Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo told Decrypt that Circle’s blockbuster IPO in June provided ample motivation. “We started thinking, maybe this makes sense for us,” he said. “We’ve been really pushing for the company to become profitable, and I think there are a lot of opportunities.” Domingo described BlackRock’s BUIDL as a “catalyst” for tokenization, and last month, Securitize reached an agreement with FG Nexus, a Nasdaq-listed Ethereum treasury firm, to issue a tokenized version of its stock on Ethereum. Securitize’s tokenization platform underpins $22 billion worth of real-world assets, but Citi analysts have projected that the sector could reach $5 trillion by the end of the decade. Having a big balance sheet gives Securitize the opportunity to participate in consolidating the industry, as opposed to being scooped up by a larger firm, Domingo said. Domingo said that Securitize’s public debut will likely take place early next year, depending on how the regulatory process plays out and when the U.S. government shutdown ends. “We’ve built a real company with 230 employees, revenue, growth, [and] profits,” he said. “We’re just scratching the surface of what the industry is.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: BlackRock Holds the Line as Bitcoin ETFs Reveal Fragile Foundations | US Crypto News

Written byLockridge Okoth Edited byMohammad Shahid Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab a coffee to read how institutional flows tell a story of dominance, dependency, and deep accumulation. At the center stands BlackRock, propping up a fragile ETF ecosystem that may not stand so tall without it. BlackRock’s IBIT contributed $28.1 billion in year-to-date net inflows to US Bitcoin ETFs, surpassing sector gains and revealing a fragile foundation for institutional crypto adoption. Outside IBIT, Bitcoin ETFs faced negative flows, raising concerns over broader market confidence. On October 27, US Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows of 1,300 BTC (about $149.3 million), equal to three days’ worth of new Bitcoin. This demonstrates lasting institutional demand, yet nearly all of it goes through IBIT. Competitors continue to face challenges, even as interest in digital assets grows. Recent figures show a stark pattern. BlackRock’s IBIT has driven the net positive flows for US Bitcoin ETFs, outpacing rivals. According to Farside Investors, US Bitcoin ETFs reported $26.9 billion in net inflows this year, but $28.1 billion came from IBIT. Without IBIT, flows in other ETFs, such as Fidelity’s FBTC and Bitwise’s BITB, were flat or negative. “No BlackRock, no party? BTC ETFs are up $26.9bn YTD, yet $28.1bn stems from BlackRock’s IBIT. Ex-IBIT, flows are negative. BlackRock is absent from the imminent altcoin ETF wave. Opportunity for competitors to secure strong flows, but on net, likely limiting for overall flows,” wrote Velte Lunde, head of research at K33 Research. This reliance on one fund signals a critical vulnerability. If BlackRock scales back, institutional inflows could fade quickly. Such concentration can shape the perception of ongoing institutional confidence in global finance. On the same day as notable Bitcoin inflows, US Ethereum ETFs added 32,220 ETH, worth $133.9 million according to Farside. While significant, no Ethereum ETF has achieved IBIT’s dominance. This indicates growing yet more distributed interest from institutions exploring beyond Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Bitwise data shows that banks, asset managers, and payment companies treat crypto as a core part of finance. Transitioning from niche to mainstream, large firms are deepening exposure through custody, tokenization, and ETF products. This kind of change would have been unlikely just a few years ago. “Institutions are quietly going all in. Banks, funds, and payment giants keep adding exposure every week. Crypto’s no longer a side bet – it’s becoming part of the system,” wrote analyst Kyle Doops. Research by CoinShares confirms this trend. Bitcoin investment products drew $931 million in inflows for the week ending October 24, 2025, bringing the annual total to $30.2 billion. Yet, a sharp outflow the previous week highlights ongoing volatility and shifting sentiment that still affect the crypto markets.

Title: Apple touches $4 trillion market value

Update font size. Reset Apple briefly reached a $4 trillion market value in early trading on Tuesday, becoming the third Big Tech giant to hit this milestone. Strong demand for its latest iPhone models eased concerns about the company’s lagging AI progress, which critics attribute to a lack of visionary leadership. Reuters: ‎ Apple’s shares have gained about 13% since the new launches on September 9, in a remarkable turnaround that pushed the stock into positive territory for the first time this year. Brokerage Evercore ISI expects the strong demand for Apple’s latest iPhones to help it surpass market expectations for the three-month period ending in September and issue upbeat forecasts for the quarter ending in December. Apple is the third company to hit the $4 trillion mark after Nvidia and Microsoft. Nvidia currently tops the table with a market value of more than $4.5 trillion. Apple’s cautious approach to AI had fueled concerns it could lose out on what could be the industry’s biggest growth catalyst in decades. Recent reports also indicate that the company is losing a number of its senior artificial intelligence executives to Meta. The company was slow to roll out its Apple Intelligence suite, including a ChatGPT integration, while an AI upgrade to its voice assistant Siri has been delayed until next year. ‎ MacDailyNews Note: Apple’s market cap has fallen back under $4 trillion in subsequent trading.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The uber-rich are only getting richer as investors double down on the AI boom. The world's 10 wealthiest people have added a remarkable $523 billion to their fortunes this year, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows. Mastercard, Exxon Mobil, and Netflix are all worth less than that; their market values were between $460 billion and $520 billion at Monday's close. Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison has notched the biggest wealth gain so far this year with a $150 billion increase in net worth, to $343 billion. Alphabet cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are both up more than $60 billion since the start of 2025, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang have added more than $50 billion to their respective fortunes in that timeframe. PC pioneer Michael Dell, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk have all gained more than $30 billion this year. Rounding out the 10 biggest wealth winners are LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, up $19 billion and $11 billion, respectively, in just under 10 months. The top 10 names on Bloomberg's list added $45 billion to their combined fortunes on Monday alone as strong tech earnings and receding trade-war fears drove stocks to new highs. They're collectively worth almost $2.5 trillion, or more than Amazon — a company with over $600 billion in annual sales and more than 1.5 million employees. The 10 richest people have added over half a trillion dollars to their fortunes this year, almost entirely because of AI optimism, fueled by buzzy partnerships, massive contracts, and sky-high growth forecasts. Year to date, Oracle stock has soared nearly 70%, Alphabet, Nvidia, and Dell have surged by over 40%, and Meta and Microsoft have jumped by over 25%. All of the top 10 wealthiest people, except Arnault, are major shareholders of the world's biggest AI companies, so those share-price gains have lifted the value of their stakes and inflated their net worths. Market watchers are divided over whether the AI boom is a bubble about to burst or the start of a tech revolution. In recent interviews with Business Insider, investors Ross Gerber and Kevin O'Leary have hailed AI as a game-changing technology, while economist Gary Shilling, investor Bill Smead, professor Erik Gordon, and strategist Paul Dietrich have said it's fostering extreme speculation that could end in disaster.

Title: Forget the debasement trade: 2 reasons the US is the best place to keep your money, according to BlackRock chief Larry Fink.

Every time Jennifer publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Larry Fink isn't losing a lot of sleep over the debasement trade. The BlackRock CEO said he's still confident that US assets are the best place for investors to park their cash for at least the next 18 months. That's despite fears swirling around the debasement trade, which is the idea that investors are fleeing from dollar-denominated assets due to concerns that the US dollar is losing value, and that rising debt levels and deficit spending will broadly hurt fiat currencies. "Money is going to move around all the time. But I would say most global investors have a very large overweight in the US and I think that's going to be the best place to have your overweighting for at least the next 18 months," Fink said, speaking at a panel discussion in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. There are a few reasons Fink thinks investors' focus should still be on US markets. First, the sell-off in US assets earlier this year has largely reversed. Investors fled US stocks and other dollar assets in early 2025 as concerns mounted over tariffs, America's credit rating, and the nation's growing debt balance. But that move has largely reversed in recent months, Fink said. Foreign demand for US assets saw a strong rebound in May and June despite net selling in April, analysis from Apollo Global Management showed. Meanwhile, other safe-haven alternatives to US assets, like gold, are retreating after a big rally that some observers say was largely driven by FOMO rather than fundamental fears about financial stability. Second, there's huge faith in the investment being poured into the US, Fink said. He pointed in particular to capital expenditures spending related to AI, tech, energy infrastructure, and data centers. Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Google — four of the biggest companies at the center of the artificial intelligence boom — could be on track to spend as much as $320 billion on capex this year, according to a Business Insider analysis of the companies' financial statements. "You're seeing all that happening more in the United States than most places in the world today," Fink said, attributing large investment to why the US GDP has outpaced European nations. Other market pros have expressed doubt over the debasement theory. JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Apollo are among the top Wall Street forecasters that have been skeptical about the "sell America" narrative this year, thanks largely to the excitement for investment opportunities in the US. The US dollar has also remained stable against other currencies in recent months, Capital Economics said in a note to clients on Monday. The 10-year US Treasury has also rallied, the firm added, signaling that investors haven't lost confidence in Treasurys. Jump to

Title: Nvidia Will Fall Apart, According to This Analyst
URL: https://247wallst.com/technology-3/2025/10/28/nvidia-will-fall-apart-according-to-this-analyst/
Time Published: 2025-10-28T14:20:08Z

Technology Sending You to Google News in 3 A recent analysis shows that only one Wall Street analyst rates Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) as a Sell. Bloomberg reports that 73 analysts have a Buy rating on the stock and another six rate it Hold. This optimism is astonishing for a stock that is up 1,426% in the past five years. The news service reports that the Nvidia bear, Jay Goldberg, a senior analyst at Seaport Global Securities, believes “There’s a lot more that can go wrong with Nvidia than can go right.” His belief is based on the fact that Nvidia has a small number of huge customers that make up much of its revenue. These include Microsoft and Amazon, which say they will spend tens of billions of dollars on artificial intelligence this year. That primarily includes the cost of infrastructure, which includes electricity, and the cost of Nvidia chips. solarseven / iStock via Getty Images Goldberg’s view of the future has legs. Consider what has become known as “round-tripping” of cash. Nvidia invests in a company and then gets much of that investment back in chip sales. For example, Nvidia’s $100 billion investment in OpenAI, the industry leader. Some of that money is “recycled” to Nvidia in chip sales, AKA revenue. One decision of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could stop this questionable practice. Nvidia’s top line could take a massive hit. Another argument is that AI will never be a huge commercial success. The greatest technology advance in history may produce little money. Most AI users today rely on free versions. For AI to be considered a success, companies like Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon must make hundreds of billions of dollars on enterprise applications. It is much too early in AI’s evolution to say whether that will happen. Next, Nvidia has competition, although its bulls think those rivals will always be small. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) leads these competitors. Its stock is up 119% this year. Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) recently announced an AI chip, and its stock rose 20% in a day. For Nvidia to keep its valuation, it must stay well ahead of these companies in revenue. Finally, there is the Chinese market. By most estimates, it is the only country close to the United States in AI development. China has blocked Nvidia chip sales, saying it has its own advanced chips, which can be improved. If Nvidia stays locked out of the market, it loses out on potentially huge sales. If Chinese chips become truly competitive, they could be direct competition to Nvidia beyond China and the U.S. Goldberg has a case.

Title: What Caused Constellation Energy Stock To Surge By 80%?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/28/what-caused-constellation-energy-stock-to-surge-by-80/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Constellation Energy (CEG) experienced a remarkable increase of 76%, driven not only by a slight rise in revenue but also by a significant spike in the P/E ratio and a squeeze in margins. Behind the scenes are pivotal developments: a transformative partnership with Meta, a strategic acquisition of Calpine, optimistic endorsements from analysts, and a rapidly increasing demand for both AI and nuclear energy—altering its prospects in real time. What is going on in this situation? The stock soared by 76%, propelled by a 5.3% rise in revenue, a 24% decline in margins, and an impressive 118% increase in the P/E ratio. Let’s delve into the factors that contributed to these changes. Prior to examining the specific events that prompted the surge in stock price, it’s worth noting what market insight reveals: Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management – a wealth management firm in the Boston area – whose asset allocation strategies delivered favorable returns during the 2008-09 downturn when the S&P plummeted by over 40%. Empirical integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio into its asset allocation strategy to offer clients enhanced returns with reduced risk in comparison to the benchmark index; presenting a much smoother ride, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance statistics. Opinion: At present, we consider CEG stock to be unattractive. What’s the reason? Check out the comprehensive story. Read Buy or Sell CEG Stock to understand what informs our current perspective. Risk: An effective way to measure risk is by analyzing how much CEG declines in significant market crashes. During the Inflation Shock, it fell approximately 24%. Although that’s less severe than some other crises, it demonstrates that even strong stocks can suffer when the market experiences downturns. No stock is immune to abrupt shocks, regardless of its fundamentals. Consistently selecting winners is challenging – particularly due to the volatility associated with individual stocks. Alternatively, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which consists of 30 different stocks, has a proven record of significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four years. What accounts for this success? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with lower risk than the benchmark index; providing a more stable investment experience, as illustrated by HQ Portfolio performance data.

Title: Tariffs Fuel Inflation Fears Among Insurance Companies

Time Published: 2025-10-28T14:14:00Z

Insurance firms see inflation as the biggest threat to their investment strategy over the next year, per a BlackRock report. The possibility that tariff wars will create a knock-on effect leading to higher inflation over the next year is by far the biggest concern among insurance companies during that time period, according to BlackRock’s annual “Global Insurance Report.” “Inflation remains a key concern, particularly with the renewed imposition of tariffs and their potential ripple effects,” the report stated. “Escalating geopolitical tensions and increasing market fragmentation are also shaping insurers’ investment strategies and outlook.” The report also noted that the sustained higher-interest-rate environment, combined with ongoing regulatory developments, is forcing insurance firms to adjust their strategies “to navigate a rapidly evolving landscape.” The report analyzed a survey of 463 senior investment professionals at firms representing an aggregate of $23 trillion in assets under management. It found that 63% of those surveyed cited inflation risk when asked what they consider to be the “most serious macro conditions” affecting their companies’ investment strategy during the next 12 months. This is a big jump from last year, when inflation risk ranked fifth, with only 46% of insurers saying it worried them the most. Never miss a story — sign up for CIO newsletters to stay up-to-date on the latest institutional investment industry news.  With respondents able to select more than one option, “rising geopolitical tension and fragmentation” was a distant second, with 50% naming it as their biggest concern. A “high-rate environment” was cited by 42%, while “regulatory developments” and “recession risk” were cited by 40% and 35% of respondents, respectively. In last year’s survey, the top concern among insurance companies was regulatory developments, cited by 68% of respondents, followed by rising geopolitical tensions and a high-rate environment at 61% and 58%, respectively, while 50% cited the risk of a recession. This year’s report also found that insurance companies have lost their appetite to increase risk, down to just 12% in 2025 from 60% in 2021. However, they are still eating up private market investments, with 30% of insurers saying they expect to increase their allocation to the asset class over the next 12 months and only 12% reporting they plan to cut back on private assets. Some 79% said they plan to raise their allocation to private markets by 1% to 5%; 13% said they expect to increase their exposure to private markets by 6% to 9%; and 1% said they plan to boost their private assets by at least 10% over the next 12 months. Within private markets, insurance companies reported the most interest in single-strategy direct lending, named by 39% of respondents, followed by special situations/opportunistic investments at 38% and citing infrastructure debt at 37%.

Solana officially joins Bitcoin and Ethereum in the ETF arena as the first U.S. spot Solana ETFs go live. 📌 What Happened Four new crypto ETFs will begin trading this week across Nasdaq and the NYSE, led by Solana, Litecoin, and Hedera. The big headline is Solana, which will see two ETFs go live: The Bitwise ETF will track 100% spot SOL and is designed to participate in staking, meaning it could compound yield through validator rewards over time. The Litecoin and Hedera ETFs, both from Canary Capital, also begin trading Tuesday. This is the first wave of altcoin ETFs to reach U.S. markets after the Bitcoin ETF launch in January and Ethereum ETF rollout in July. 🗣️ What They’re Saying “Confirmed. The Exchange has just posted listing notices for Bitwise Solana, Canary Litecoin and Canary HBAR to launch TOMORROW and grayscale Solana to convert the day after. Assuming there’s not some last min SEC intervention, looks like this is happening.” - Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst for Bloomberg 🧠 Why It Matters Solana enters ETF land with serious momentum. SOL is now a top-5 crypto by market cap, trading near $200, and continues to dominate usage metrics with higher daily transactions than Ethereum. And the Solana ETF unlocks new access to SOL for retirement accounts, wealth advisors, and institutional portfolios that can’t touch crypto directly. It deepens liquidity and puts Solana in the same regulated bucket as BTC and ETH, something nearly unthinkable during the FTX collapse just two years ago. That means inflows and diversification buying is incoming. But, with that said, there is one key difference between these SOL ETFs and BTC & ETH - BlackRock isn’t at the table (yet). BlackRock’s IBIT (BTC) and ETHA (ETH) are the dominant players in their respective categories of ETFs. IBIT has seen $65B in net inflows. The next biggest is FBTC at $12B (so 5x bigger). Similarly, ETHA has seen $14.2B in net inflows. The next biggest is Fidelity’s FETH at $2.69B (also ~5x bigger). So while there is reason to celebrate these new ETFs, especially for SOL - take them with a grain of salt. And pop the champagne when BlackRock announces their SOL ETF… A few Crypto and Web3 headlines that caught my eye: In Corporate Treasuries / ETFs In Memes Here’s a rundown of major token, protocol and airdrop news from the day: Here is the list of other notable headlines from the day in NFTs: Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Buy Or Sell Adobe Stock?

Time Published: 2025-10-28T13:38:35Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Adobe (ADBE) stock warrants your attention. Why? Because it offers thick margins at a reduced price. Here are some statistics. While growth in revenue is beneficial, this should not be viewed merely from a growth perspective. Pricing power along with high margins contributes to consistent and predictable profits and cash flows, which mitigates risk and enables capital to be reinvested. The market typically rewards such stability. Beyond the financials, a couple of structural advantages drive Adobe’s outlook. The company is a leader in digital media and enterprise software, and has pivoted to a subscription model that drives recurring revenue. Its integrated workflow solutions create high switching costs, helping customer retention. The company is also witnessing growing adoption of its creative and enterprise tools enhanced by generative AI. For context, Adobe offers a range of software solutions globally, including its Creative Cloud subscription, catering to enterprise clients across Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing & Advertising sectors. However, do these figures truly paint the complete picture? Explore Buy or Sell ADBE Stock to determine whether Adobe possesses an enduring advantage that remains resilient beneath the surface. Quiz time: Over the past 5 years, which index do you believe the Trefis High Quality Portfolio has outperformed – the S&P 500, S&P 1500 Equal Weighted, or both? The answer may surprise you. Discover how our advisory framework can tilt the odds in your favor. Stocks Like These Can Outperform. Here Is the Data Here’s our selection process: We target stocks with a market cap greater than $10 billion and filter out those exhibiting high CFO (cash flow from operations) margins or operating margins. We also exclusively focus on stocks that have significantly decreased in value over the past year. Below are the statistics for stocks where this selection strategy has been applied since 12/31/2016. However, Consider the Risks That being said, Adobe has encountered substantial declines in difficult times. It fell about 72.5% during the Dot-Com crash and 67% during the Global Financial Crisis. In the 2022 inflation shock, the decline was around 60%. Even the less severe downturns, such as those in 2018 and during the Covid pandemic, resulted in a loss of approximately 25% of its value. Therefore, despite the favorable aspects, Adobe does not escape the impact when markets decline. Nonetheless, the risks are not confined to major market crashes. Stocks can drop even during strong markets – consider events like earnings announcements, business updates, and changes in outlook. Refer to ADBE Dip Buyer Analyses to learn how the stock has bounced back from steep drops in the past. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, has a proven history of consistently outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. What accounts for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; it’s a smoother ride, as demonstrated in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Good morning. Although that's not the case for some Amazon employees. The tech giant just announced that it's cutting 14,000 corporate jobs, marking one of the biggest rounds of layoffs in the company's history. Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti, announced the cuts in a blog post and said the reductions are a continuation of CEO Andy Jassy's drive to operate the company "like the world's largest startup." Speaking of staffing reductions, artificial intelligence's impact on company headcounts remains a top concern for workers. Today we're looking at how a top Wall Street bank and a tech company gave us a preview of what to expect. What's on deck: Markets: A once red-hot corner of commercial real estate has cooled off considerably. Tech: Tesla's chair gave a stark warning about what's at stake if Elon Musk's pay package isn't approved. Business: The scariest part about Halloween might be the price of candy. But first, what does AI mean for ME? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Forget the billions getting invested. Forget fears over a bubble. Most people's biggest question about AI is simple: How will it impact my job? Executives at two very different companies recently offered clues on how corporate America is thinking about AI's impact on its workforce. First, you have Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, who told Axios that AI isn't taking away bankers' jobs. Instead, the tech just means the bank needs "more high-value people." Solomon acknowledged the widely held belief that AI will change how bankers do their job, but he reiterated his previous prediction that the bank will have more employees a decade from now, thanks to AI. Then you have Vercel, which helps developers build and deploy websites and applications. The company reduced a 10-person sales team down to one after a top-performing worker trained an AI agent to do most of the tasks, the firm's COO told BI's Lakshmi Varanasi. The other nine employees weren't fired, though. Instead, they're now focusing on more complex, higher-value sales work, the exec told Lakshmi. Despite one being a prestigious Wall Street bank and the other a relatively new tech company, both shared a common narrative regarding the AI-and-the-worker debate: The tech is here to elevate, not eliminate. Companies' willingness to stick to that mantra remains to be seen. For a while, businesses were in a holding pattern, or a "Great Freeze," BI's Madison Hoff wrote. Numerous uncertainties — tariffs, AI, and the broader economy — meant companies were neither hiring nor firing. But that trend seems to be thawing, as is evident from Amazon's recent news. And there's no guarantee everyone whose job was automated by AI will still have higher-value work to focus on. For every worker who AI enables to work on something more valuable, there will be those who can't find another way to contribute. (Though, perhaps that's more the employees' problem than AI.) There's also AI's business model to consider. As the companies touting these tools face more pressure from investors to generate revenue, the cost of using them may rise. That, in turn, will force companies to reconsider their budgets and headcounts. Even those working on the very AI expected to lead to so much disruption aren't immune. That was evident when Meta cut 600 workers from its Meta Superintelligence Labs. We'll get an even better sense this week about how those with front-row seats to the AI revolution are thinking about headcounts when Big Tech reports earnings. 1. One of the pandemic's real estate bets is now off. Lab space was a hot bet in real estate, especially during COVID, when it played a leading role in combating the disease. Thanks to a pullback in federal research funding and venture capital, compounded with high vacancy rates, the sector is now suffering. 2. Investors are stoked about a reprieve from trade tensions. A US-China trade truce sent stocks to all-time highs, extending the gains logged on Friday. From investors buying chip stocks and treasury yields jumping, here are the five big moves in the market. 3. The Beyond Meat meme investor has a new target. Dimitri Semenikhin is eyeing ETHZilla Corporation, a biotech firm that pivoted to crypto. He told BI that his case for the stock is similar to the reason he thinks Beyond Meat is undervalued. He's also bullish on crypto in general, despite its volatility. 1. Meta's metaverse unit is getting a reshuffling. Gabriel Aul and Ryan Cairns will now lead the company's metaverse efforts, per an internal memo sent by Meta's CTO, which was seen by BI. In a different memo — also seen by BI — Vishal Shah, who has helped lead its metaverse bets over the last four years, announced that he's moving to Meta Superintelligence Labs. 2. Tesla shareholders get an ultimatum. Tesla chair Robyn Denholm sent out a warning to shareholders regarding Elon Musk's coming $1 trillion pay package: Either approve the package or risk losing Musk as Tesla's CEO. The package has seen pushback from proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis. One thing he doesn't have to worry about: where he stands with the president these days. 3. Fake it till you make it. Tech hopefuls are putting San Francisco in their social media bios even if they don't live there. They do it to attract investors, for the clout, and to signal their commitment to the industry. 1. Everybody scream! (At the price of those Twix bars.) Prices of candy and gum have skyrocketed, increasing at a rate much faster than inflation. Tariffs are a contributor, whether on cane sugar, cocoa, or elsewhere. But hey, at least your dentist is probably happy. 2. Why Taylor Sheridan's Paramount departure matters. The guy behind "Yellowstone" is heading to Comcast's NBCUniversal. It's a big loss for Paramount owner David Ellison, who previously signaled that keeping Sheridan is a priority, BI's Peter Kafka writes. Meanwhile, Paramount Skydance is set to lay off over 1,000 employees on Wednesday, a person familiar with the plans confirmed to BI. 3. Lessons about happiness after five years of mood-tracking. BI's Julia Pugachevsky tracked her moods every day for almost five years. She learned a lot about happiness, including one habit that greatly improved her mood than anything else.

Title: Invest $100K In These Funds, Beat Inflation For A Lifetime

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. I hate to see investors (particularly retirees) starving for dividends, especially with inflation stuck around 3% (and you and I both know that the real number is higher—just head down to your local grocery store!). A big myth around dividends is that you have to invest a lot upfront to get anything meaningful in return. It’s easy to see why people feel that way, with the average S&P 500 stock paying a meager 1.1% as I write this. This is where my favorite investments, closed-end funds (CEFs), come in. Using the three we’ll delve into below, you could get a little over $1,000 a month in income, thanks to their double-digit yields. What’s more, this three-fund portfolio mixes stocks and bonds to get us some nice diversification (and the downside protection that comes with it). Let’s start with bonds. The KKR Income Opportunities Fund (KIO) holds over 300 bonds and other loans issued by the likes of JetBlue Airways (JBLU) and United Airlines Holdings (UAL), chemical maker Chemours Co. (CC), Virgin Media and consulting firm Kroll. KIO takes the interest it collects and flips it to investors in the form of that hefty 12.4% dividend. Moreover, nearly all of its bonds are below-investment grade. That’s more of an opportunity than a risk, because that’s where the highest yields, and best bargains, are. Moreover, KIO has been around for over a decade and—despite rising interest rates, a pandemic and other turmoil—has steadily increased its net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) in that time. All of that suggests KIO can keep delivering its high yield. Moreover, it has a 6.7% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its portfolio), so there’s gain potential if that discount shrinks, or flips to a premium, as it did just last year. In other words, you can pick up KIO, wait for its discount to shrink, then sell at a profit. And you get to collect that sweet dividend in the meantime. Now let’s add stocks through the Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA), a CEF holding well-known firms like AI stars NVIDIA (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon.com (AMZN). Even so, this fund is nicely diversified, and management has smartly bought and sold its holdings to drive a big jump in its portfolio, or NAV, since the April selloff. This return is more than enough to cover the fund’s dividend, which yields 11.3% annualized. That return should be rewarded with a premium valuation, yet USA not only trades at a discount, but its discount has widened, creating a rare buying opportunity. USA hasn’t been this cheap since the pandemic! When investors see that they can get NVIDIA, Microsoft and more at a near-10% markdown, expect them to drive this fund’s price up. Buy now and you can get the fund’s huge dividend while you wait. (Though we should note that the fund’s dividend does “float” a bit—which is a good thing: It gives management the opportunity to pick up bargains in a selloff, potentially boosting our long-term gains.) With stocks and bonds together, and an average 11.9% yield between our first two funds, we already have a great portfolio that can withstand years of market volatility. But we’re not done yet. Let’s wrap by adding energy stocks through the NXG Cushing Midstream Energy Fund (SRV). Its 12.8% yield is the biggest of our trio, but its pricing chart is different. With a 2.5% premium, SRV is priced right around where its portfolio’s true value lies. And note how the fund’s market pricing has been rangebound in the last couple years, hovering around par. That’s after SRV traded at an absurd post-pandemic discount, when energy demand wasn’t rising quickly, while at the same time, technology was making energy production easier, causing a surplus. Now, with AI, the story is different: Technology is driving energy demand higher, far beyond the degree to which it’s making energy production easier. Those power prices are likely to stick around, which is why SRV has been priced higher of late. This makes SRV a great fund for shorter-term action; collect the 12.8% dividend, sure, but be prepared to sell if the fund’s premium rises much beyond 5%. Then you can use your returns to buy USA, KIO or another oversold CEF. Then, when that fund gets overbought, sell it at a profit after collecting your dividends and use that to buy another high-yielding CEF. That’s the beauty of CEFs, and in particular CEFs’ discounts to NAV, which tell us exactly when a fund has reached a peak valuation. And then, of course, there are the dividends: As mentioned, the three-fund mini-portfolio we just discussed starts you off with over $1,000 per month in income for every $100K you invest. But over time, you can expect your portfolio to grow—and its income potential to keep rising as it does. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Tesla chairwoman warns Musk could quit if shareholders reject $1tn pay deal
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/work/2025/10/28/tesla-chairwoman-warns-musk-could-quit-if-shareholders-reject-1tn-pay-deal/
Time Published: 2025-10-28T13:10:27Z

Tesla chairwoman Robyn Denholm has stepped up her campaign to win shareholder support for Elon Musk’s $1 trillion (€859 billion) pay package, warning there is no “Elon mark 2” if the carmaker’s board is forced to try to replace the chief executive. Ms Denholm and other Tesla board members are meeting this week with the company’s largest institutional investors, which include Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street, to lobby for the plan in advance of a vote on November 6th. Mr Musk has threatened to walk out if shareholders vote down a new package of stock options that could be worth up to $1 trillion over the next decade. Ms Denholm confirmed that Mr Musk’s public threats had also been communicated privately to the board, but refused to explain Tesla’s contingency plan if shareholders reject the pay deal. Ms Denholm has also written to shareholders warning of his potential departure if his package is not approved. “This is a vote for shareholders on the future of Tesla,” Ms Denholm told the Financial Times. “There’s just not anybody, either inside or outside the organisation, that is Elon today,” she said. Mr Musk’s pay has been the centre of years of controversy and legal wrangling. Last year, shareholders voted in favour of a previous $56 billion pay deal. That package was originally awarded in 2018 but subsequently blocked by a Delaware court, which said the process lacked proper board oversight. The new proposal is expected to face significant opposition after advisory groups Glass Lewis and ISS recommended that shareholders reject the proposals. A group of big pension funds separately issued an open letter opposing the pay plan, claiming the board’s “relentless pursuit” of retaining its chief executive had damaged Tesla’s reputation and led to excessive compensation. On Monday, the head of the New York pension fund called the pay proposal “inflated and poorly designed” and urged investors to vote against it. Mr Musk responded to the criticism on X, the social media site he owns, last week: “Tesla is worth more than all other automotive companies combined. Which of those CEOs would you like to run Tesla? It won’t be me.” The fortune of the world’s richest man is largely tied up in the value of Tesla’s shares, which have more than tripled in value over the past five years as the carmaker’s market capitalisation soared to $1.4 trillion. Asked what the board will do if Tesla loses the vote and cannot retain Mr Musk, Ms Denholm said: “I don’t want to foreshadow anything on that front at this moment, but clearly, as a board, we have discussed what happens and we know that it wouldn’t be a good outcome for shareholders.” “If we don’t have Elon at the helm, or he isn’t as motivated or incentivised to actually create that future, then it’s actually a negative for all shareholders.” She added that she did not believe Mr Musk would do anything “sudden and detrimental” if Tesla loses the vote. Mr Musk has used large quantities of his Tesla shares as security to borrow billions of dollars to fund his other ventures, such as his acquisition of Twitter, now X, in 2022 and the development of his artificial intelligence start-up, xAI. He currently owns a 15 per cent stake in Tesla and is able to vote his shares in favour of the compensation plan. Tesla has warned investors that Mr Musk’s leadership is crucial to a strategic pivot into AI, including through autonomous driving and its plans to build millions of humanoid “Optimus” robots. Mr Musk has argued he needs to control at least a quarter of Tesla’s voting rights to stop its AI products falling into the wrong hands, using the example of him being ousted by activist investors. Last week, Mr Musk branded Glass Lewis and ISS “corporate terrorists” and said: “I just don’t feel comfortable building a robot army and then being ousted because of some asinine recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis who have no freaking clue.” Ms Denholm told the FT that the special committee set up to design the pay package – which was made up of her and director Kathleen Wilson-Thompson – explored whether there was a way to give Mr Musk the voting rights he wanted without the vast payout. “There wasn’t an instrument that you could use that could do that,” she said. “We searched high and low for it, but we ended up using restricted stock, which does have economic rights.” The proposed $1 trillion compensation award includes 12 tranches of restricted stock that are each tied to ambitious milestones for its share price and operational performance. It would grant Mr Musk an additional 12 per cent of Tesla’s shares if he increases its valuation to $8.5tn, boosts earnings 24-fold and sell millions more cars and robots. Achieving even half of those targets could make him the world’s first trillionaire. Shareholders will also vote on a string of other proposals next week, including the reappointment of three directors and whether Tesla can invest in xAI. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said the project has “remarkable early momentum,” in a press release. “Arc presents the opportunity for every type of company to build on enterprise-grade network infrastructure—advancing a shared vision that a more open, inclusive, and efficient global economic system can be built natively on the internet,” he added. A testnet is separate blockchain mimicking the main blockchain network and using simulated assets, enabling developers to test new features without risking the security of the live mainnet. Companies with “billions of users” have participated in the launch, with Wall Street firms and global banks including BNY, Intercontinental Exchange, and State Street joining the Arc testnet. Wall Street giants already on the platform include BlackRock, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, and Standard Chartered. There are also established tech and payments companies participating, including Amazon Web Services, Cloudflare, Mastercard, and Visa. Several crypto exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, and Robinhood, are also taking part in the testnet. The blockchain network, which Circle bills as an "Economic Operating System" for the internet, aims to bring more economic activity onto blockchain infrastructure with features including predictable dollar-based fees, sub-second transaction finality, and optional privacy configurations. Circle said its Arc platform is designed to support financial applications including lending, capital markets, foreign exchange, and global payments. The network integrates with Circle's existing platform and enables the use of stablecoins—digital currencies pegged to traditional currencies. Several regional stablecoin issuers have joined the testnet, including JPYC from Japan, BRLA from Brazil, and QCAD from Canada.

Strap yourself in for another great one. Liz Ann Sonders, chief Investment strategist at Schwab, helping to manage $11 trillion in client assets. What a fascinating career she’s had. She’s been on all of the best of lists. She’s just really insightful. What she does is really kind of unique. She combines top down market analysis with looking at everything from sentiment to economic data to fund flows, to really what the clients of Schwab are, are doing. I know Liz for almost 25 years. Every time I speak with her, it’s always great. This is another conversation that is all also fabulous. With no further ado my discussion with Liz Ann Saunders, Liz Ann Sonders: Always great to see you… Barry Ritholtz: I know it’s always, I always have so much, I’ve 00:01:11 [Speaker Changed] Known each other for a long time, Liz Ann Sonders: A long time. It’s always so much fun chatting with you. I wanna talk about what you’re doing with the podcast and what you’re doing at Schwab, but I have to start with a little bit of your background. Undergraduate economics and poli sci at Delaware, MBA in finance from Fordham, Barry Ritholtz: At the time you went there, was it called Gabelli? Liz Ann Sonders: No, it was not. Barry Ritholtz: It’s now called the Gabelli School of School Business. Was the career plan always Wall Street? Liz Ann Sonders: No, I honestly, I, I think if you brought me back to my college days and asked, what is your career plan? If I was honest, I probably would’ve said not quite sure yet. I, the, the decision to do a double major there was, to keep it very open and broad. All I knew was that I wanted to live and work in New York City. So got out of undergrad, pounded the pavement in New York, but, but across the spectrum of industries, not all Wall Street, I, I interviewed at a sports marketing firm and an ad agency, and I had two interviews in a row at Zweig. Avatar did a lot of research on the company, which by the way, this was in 1986. So doing research on a company meant going to the library, pulling up a microfiche machine, actually cranking the handle I recall, and look at newspaper clippings and was fascinated by Marty Sweig, the, the co-founder and enjoyed the interview process, liked the people with whom I met, and I don’t know, a little voice just said this, this seems to make sense. And Barry Ritholtz: I recall reading a book, Marty’s Zweig wrote, I wanna say in the late nineties, when I was on a trading desk, Winning on Wall Street, Liz Ann Sonders: Late eighties, Barry Ritholtz: Well, I got his book when I started around the time of the Netscape, IPO. Liz Ann Sonders: That’s when I, he, he did, you know, newer versions. He did updated versions, but I think so… Barry Ritholtz: Whatever that version was in ninety six, ninety seven. And I vividly recall that. How did you, how did you get the gig with Marty’s wag? What was that like? Liz Ann Sonders: It, I was a grunt at the outset. I did whatever they needed me to do, but they were a firm that believed in promoting from within and educating their young people. So I saw that as an opportunity. They, they paid for grad school a hundred percent. So I made the easy financial decision to do that at night while still learning a living and having my education paid for. And so many things that I learned from Marty, I could consider him the, the first mentor, whether he realized it or, or not. Barry Ritholtz: People, by the way, people don’t realize, especially the generation that came of age in 2000, what a legend he was. Liz Ann Sonders: Unbelievable legend. Barry Ritholtz: I think at one point in time he owned the, the most expensive apartment in the United States. Is is that true? Liz Ann Sonders: Yes. It was the top three floors of the Pierre, which is now owned by the Commerce Secretary. Barry Ritholtz: That’s amazing. And he was always the answer to, “Hey, do any of these technicians make any money?” And the answer was, yeah, look at Marty Zweig. I mean, for, for the younger folks, go look up Marty Zweig. He was absolutely a legend. I remember him from my early days, because he was on Rukeyser. Liz Ann Sonders: He was one of the originals on, on the original Wall Street Week. Barry Ritholtz: Yep. I mean, back in the day when all of financial media was an hour, that was television a week. Not even Liz Ann Sonders: Was a half hour. That’s 8:30 PM Friday nights. That’s right. On PBS produced by Maryland Public Television. That’s right. And Marty was not only one of the original panelists, he was, I think, the original elf as, as Lou used to describe them, Barry Ritholtz: The people who came back on a regular basis? Liz Ann Sonders: And that’s another thing that intrigued me about joining the firm, is I remember getting a little bit of a, kind of a wink, wink, nod nod from a, an economics professor that I had, not just to me, but to the class. And he made a funny comment about, given that one of the, the jobs that we had as students was to read the Wall Street Journal every day and just keep up on markets and the economy, and that if you had too many late nights at the Stone Balloon, you might wanna just get a really brilliant 30 minute recap by watching Wall Street Week on Friday night before you then go out. So I thought, all right, I’ll see what this Wall Street Week is all about. And so I started watching it before I joined the business, before I started at, at Swg Avatar. And, and then I joined the show in 1997, which was surreal. Barry Ritholtz: So you were not that far outta school when you started? 00:06:03 [Speaker Changed] Well, I was, yeah, I was 11 years. So since you and I have talked about our first experience together, which was on TV years, first, it was my first TVeExperience, first TV appearance on Kudlow. Liz Ann Sonders: And I, I, I went on the show as a special guest. So I remember getting the, the little, you know, pink slip from the receptionist that told you who had called. There was voicemail at that time that said Rich de Roth, the producer of Wall Street Week called They’d like You to come on as a guest. And I thought it was somebody playing a prank on me. Barry Ritholtz: Really? Liz Ann Sonders: Yeah, until I called and it was legit. And I went on as a, a guest. And then in shortly after that, they asked me to become a regular panelist, and it was a thrill. Barry Ritholtz: So you were Zweig for a number of years, [13] you end up go 13 years. Wow. That’s a long time. Liz Ann Sonders: 86 to 99. Barry Ritholtz: How did you end up at US Trust? Liz Ann Sonders: So that was kind of funny. I was on the avatar side of this [Zweig Avatar] broad set of companies, which was the institutional money management side. I was a portfolio manager, co-ran stock selection. But I was always much more intrigued by interested in and with a desire to spend more of my time doing top down macro research Barry Ritholtz: As opposed to bottom up Liz Ann Sonders: The inner voice said, you don’t really love this that much. And there wasn’t really an opportunity for that. I, I, it wasn’t that I was pigeonholed, but, but it was a growing role as a portfolio manager. So I got recruited over to US Trust to co-run their large cap growth area, which, which put me yet again in that position, but felt like the platform was broader. And my inclusion on the investment policy committee, they actually purposely wanted some top down analysis based on my learnings for working Barry Ritholtz: Liz For the ultimate large cap growth means here’s the universe, it’s, it’s a hundred of the S&P 500. Liz Ann Sonders: , and we were a concentrated manager [only owning 30 positions only?] No less than 25 typically, with a four to five year holding period. Barry Ritholtz: So not a closet indexer, a high active share. Liz Ann Sonders: But I also didn’t love the pigeonholing aspect of it. Mm. Where, you know, the mantra had to be large cap growth. I, I, I liked thinking bigger picture and thinking about different parts of the market cycle and what works. So 10 months after I joined US, trust, Schwab acquired us Trust. Barry Ritholtz: That was 2000. And you’ve been with Schwab for a quarter century? Liz Ann Sonders: Since then for, it’ll be 26 years. Wow. At the beginning of next year. And the, the re when I realized I did indeed wanna be adopted by the new parent company was when Chuck Schwab himself came to New York with our CEO at the time, Dave Patrick, and sat with me and said, we would like to create this role of chief investment strategist, which didn’t exist at Schwab before. This was the beginning of our entree into actually giving advice as opposed to just being a platform for, for traders. Barry Ritholtz: So, so let, let’s dive into that. So I was gonna ask you what the process was like, but they acquired us trust for the assets and for the platform. You were a bonus that came along with it, right? Liz Ann Sonders: Well, well, that’s kind of you to say. Well, I mean, they, they did offer me the, the role. It had not existed before. Barry Ritholtz: That’s a big deal. Liz Ann Sonders: And I said, yes, please. Barry Ritholtz: Yeah, absolutely. Liz Ann Sonders: And the rest is 26 years of history. Barry Ritholtz: So let, let’s dive into this. What are the, let, let’s take a look at the numbers on the Schwab platform as a custodian or however Schwab is touching a 401k. How many trillions of dollars are on that platform? Liz Ann Sonders: 11.23 trillion… Barry Ritholtz: All right. So keep working at it. You’ll, get somewhere soon… Liz Ann Sonders: Yeah. That’s trillion with s about a third of the size of the US economy. Wow. Barry Ritholtz: That’s unbelievable. And at the time, what was Schwab? Schwab in 2000? Liz Ann Sonders: Oh gosh. One, something like that. It was less than that. Because I remember getting this little… Barry Ritholtz: Plexiglass plaque? Liz Ann Sonders: Well, no, it was a, it was a holder for sticky notes and it had a star on it, and it said, you know, 1 trillion in client assets. But that was after the, so that’s acquisition of me. Barry Ritholtz: So that’s an incredible growth. Schwab really is a platform that are so many things to so many different people. There’s an institutional business, there’s a business. And full disclosure, we custody right at our firm at Schwab, most of our assets are there. So you custody for RIAs and others, self-directed investors, individuals who doesn’t Schwab work with? It’s pretty much everybody in the industry. Liz Ann Sonders: Well, traditional institutions. So the way we define institutional, when we talk about it and use that term somewhat generically, we’re actually referring to the part of the business that you’re involved with. So independent wealth management firms, RIAs, that, that platform with Schwab via the custody of assets, but a heck of a lot more than just that. So that’s how we defined institutional it of the, and I’m totally using rounded numbers here, but of the 10, of the 11 and a quarter trillion is about evenly divided between individual investors on our platform. Self-directed. Self-directed. And well, not always. Now we have, we have a whole wealth management arm that’s all, that all feeds, not just to the individual investor side of what we do, but to in your world advisor. So advisors on our platform. So that’s about evenly split. And then, then the remainder is workplace services. So stock plans for big companies and managing, managing 4 0 1 Ks. So it’s what we, but we we’re dominated by individual investors, even on the quote institutional side, because most of the advisors on our platform manage money for individuals. Barry Ritholtz: Hmm. That’s really interesing. Liz Ann Sonders: So we would consider the advisor our client, but we’re, we’re providing a platform there for them, you guys, to advise for the most part, individual investors. Barry Ritholtz: And, and I know I’ve told you this story before, but when we launched RWM in 2013, we launched with TD — years later acquired by Schwab. Hold that aside. And we are, were very data driven. We ran a lot of analytics. And every time we didn’t win a prospect when we would go through the list of the reasons, the number one reason is, “Hey, you guys don’t custody with Schwab and my money’s at Schwab and call us if you ever decide to.” Absolutely true. And finally, we all looked at each other, Hey, there’s no reason not to open a second custodian. And so we did. And it caused a flood of new clients and new families joining us because well, well done. But, but the crazy thing is, it’s like I have never seen a financial institution with that much brand loyalty from the audience. From the clients. Because think about it, when you talk to people about Wells Fargo or Citibank or any large financial traditional bank, maybe a little bit at JP Morgan Chase, but for the most part, no one says, oh, “I don’t want to be with you. You are not affiliated with, I’m making up stuff. KeyBank.” But we just heard it so many times. It’s like, all right, you only have to hit me in the head so many times before I realized there’s a, there’s an issue here. Liz Ann Sonders: The, the power of our reputation is really extraordinary. And, Schwab dates back, you know, about 53 years. Wow. 54 years. That’s, that’s amazing. Yeah. Seventies. And, you know, Chuck has, has written about the history of Schwab and his history. His most recent book was called Invested. And it was essentially a, a memoir of, of his time in this business. And Barry Ritholtz: When you say Chuck, Liz Ann Sonders: Chuck Schwab himself, Barry Ritholtz: Chuck Schwab, who people used to think wasn’t a real guy. Liz Ann Sonders: No, it’s a real guy. The guy in the commercials is him. Barry Ritholtz: And he’s still up and about You were telling me he was, he’s just won a golf tournament at 88. Liz Ann Sonders: Yeah. Last year he won the Nantucket Golf Club. That’s unbelievable. Member, member at 87. And he almost won it again this year at at 88. So regularly shoots below his age, still a very active chair of the board. And but the, the, the culture that he has imbued in in Schwab is really second to none. And, you know, our, our sort of corporate for, for lack of a better word, tagline is through client size. And he has fostered this live, eat and breathe. Everything you do has to be from the perspective of of clients. Barry Ritholtz: So you are really the perfect person to ask a question. And I’ll ask it specifically about Schwab, but it’s obviously true about the entire industry. You’ve witnessed a shift from a lot of self-directed investors over to the advisor driven side. What has that process been like at Schwab? Liz Ann Sonders: So it’s not talking about trillions of dollars, right? Not just the advisor side, but investors at Schwab who, who want guidance, who want advice, whether it’s through advisors on our platform or directly with us on our private client side of the, the business. And it’s just the natural evolution of Schwab moving decades ago from a platform for the self-directed to a behemoth that actually provides that guidance and advice now, both directly through certain channels and indirectly through the advisor channel. Barry Ritholtz: So true or false? And, and I love this question ’cause so many people doubt it. We are today in a golden age for investing for individuals. How do you, how do you answer that? Liz Ann Sonders: Can I say yes? Yeah, Barry Ritholtz: True. Liz Ann Sonders: Just yes. No, I didn’t say true. I said yes, yes. Barry Ritholtz: its a Golden age of investing for me. Liz Ann Sonders: Well, I think it’s both true and false depending on how you define, Barry Ritholtz: Okay. Explain Golden age of investing Barry Ritholtz: Liz Ann Sonders:. I think we are, as it relates to individual investors that understand that discipline is such an important part of the process that they don’t think of getting get out as investing strategies. I, I fully agree that those are really gambling on moments in time. You wrote about it brilliantly in Well, thank you. In your book, the emotional side. Right. And so I think it’s true in the sense that a lot of those more seasoned investors that take that disciplined approach are, are more equipped now and have more access to information and guidance and when used in the right way has been to the great benefit of their success. But then you have retail traders, which I’m not here to say that they’re, you know, the ultimate contrarian indicator, but I think the perspective there is one of very short time horizons. The, you know, by the dip mentality, which, you know, to their credit, Barry Ritholtz: That works in a bull market. It works in painful bull market, very painful in a bear market. Liz Ann Sonders: But a lot of the, you know, younger retail trader that was born out of the pandemic era, it’s not that they have blinders on to the long term or the big picture, but they’ve been, they’ve been, I guess so far, anyway, to your point, properly schooled by virtue of, by the tip has worked. But I’m, I’m starting to get some anecdotal evidence that there, I, I’m not sure that there is a full understanding of what a market cycle actually looks like and that there is downside. So I, I think there, there’s more bifurcation and there’s a wider spread in terms of, of how investors are approaching the market or how traders are approaching the market. And they, they, they’re not in conflict, but they’re kind of at different ends of the spectrum from a what works, what doesn’t work, what are the benefits of taking a long-term approach, having those disciplines as opposed to just, you know, FOMO I’m in and, you know, buy every dip. Barry Ritholtz: Think about everybody who was born in the 1990s. By the time they come out of college post-financial crisis, they’ve pretty much only known right? One of the greatest rampaging bull markets in history. Liz Ann Sonders: And, and COVID was, was brutal from an economic three months and market perspective, right? But for, it was five weeks in the case of the market, right? Barry Ritholtz: Mid February To March, Liz Ann Sonders: and it was two months in the case of the recession. Right. So Barry Ritholtz: Although people still didn’t believe it throughout that summer, as, as from the March, 2020 lows till the end of the year, I think the S&P 500 was up 69%. And people fought it the whole way because their personal experience didn’t jive with what they were seeing. Liz Ann Sonders: Right, exactly. Exactly. Barry Ritholtz: In inequities, which, which is fascinating. So Schwab created the market strategist role for you, what does it mean being a market strategist? How does that differ from either a PM on the equity side or an economist more broadly? Liz Ann Sonders: Well, it, it’s certainly differentiated from a PM in that I am not, I’m not picking stocks. I’m not a trader. I don’t analyze individual stocks. So it’s, it’s purely top down 00:20:49 [Speaker Changed] In top down meaning markets economy. Yes. Do you look at sectors? Do you look at fixed income? What 00:20:56 [Speaker Changed] Comes into that? So we have my, my colleague and co-host on our on investment podcast is Kathy Jones. So she’s my counterpart on the fixed income side. She’s our chief fixed income strategist. And I, I say often it sounds like it’s jokingly, but it’s actually quite serious that I was thrilled when we brought Kathy on. ’cause then I was able to stop pretending like I was a deep dive expert in the fixed income side of things. My, my background is on the equity side of things, but what’s unique, I think about this role as it is, as it has existed in the almost 26 years that, that I’ve been at Schwab and have been in this role, is it, it blends the market analysis with the economic analysis. So we don’t have these distinct roles of chief economists and chief investment strategist. And that was always pleasing to me because I, I’m, I, I’m not sure I would either be as effective or enjoy what I do as much if I had to have my market views beholden to economic views that were completely distinct. 00:22:03 I think having that, that overlap and analysis has been a benefit. I also, because our investor base are almost all individual investors, that’s a very different audience that if you’re one of the big investment banking research wirehouse firms, a good chunk of your client base that is, that is a consumer of strategist work being institutions, I think it’s a very different animal in terms of what is valuable, what makes sense. And maybe importantly, again, in keeping with your book, you know, thinking about not just what matters, but what doesn’t matter, what shouldn’t matter. And I, I remember one of the first things that, that Chuck talked to me about 25 years ago was him not being a believer in the whole year end price target, which was music to my ears. Because I think particularly for individual investors, there’s really not that much practical value to that. It’s sort of one point in time every strategist has to adjust those forecasts constantly. It doesn’t tell you about how to manage through market cycles. It’s just one end point to one end point. And so that is certainly one of the differentiators as well, in addition to having that blended market analysis and economic analysis role, not sort of falling into the trap of the way strategists get pitted against one another. 00:23:31 [Speaker Changed] I love that you call it a trap because it’s easy to see what happens when people make a forecast like that and then they tend to marry it regardless of what data comes along. I think it was Ned Davis’ book was called Being Right or Making Money, and he explained how frequently people would just get so hung up on admitting error, right? That they would stay that’s right in the wrong position, the wrong posture, the wrong holdings, rather than admit they were wrong and adjust to whatever 00:24:06 [Speaker Changed] The data is. Yeah. And the trend, you know, one of Marty Zweig was well known for quite a, quite a bit, but you know, he coined the term Don’t Fight the Fed, but he also was known for saying the trend is your friend. And so staying in gear requires constant thinking and rethinking. In fact, I always use as an example of the perils of the year-end price target. If a strategist at the beginning of 1987 basically said the market’s gonna close pretty flat relative to where it ended 1986 by the end of the year, they were right from a point to point, however, to suggest that the market was just boring and flat all year. 00:24:48 [Speaker Changed] So there was that little hiccup in October, 00:24:50 [Speaker Changed] It was just a tiny littles hiccup. 00:24:51 [Speaker Changed] When, 00:24:52 [Speaker Changed] When was the 87 crash? That was Eptember 19th? Yeah, it was September. No, October 19th. October 19th. But there were, you know, there were warning signs and here can I tell you another funny Sure. Early story. So I started in the summer of 86 and as, and we were Marty’s side of the business, which was mutual funds, which was the Wena hedge fund, which is still ongoing onto the leadership of Joe Mena. We would be generically thought of as market timers. We were tactical asset allocators on the avatar institutional side, much more traditional market timing on the Zweig side, particularly the hedge fund. And coming into 87, we were over the cross of strategies, cross strategies were essentially fully invested, but started to get much more pessimistic about the market. In August, 00:25:43 [Speaker Changed] You had a huge run up, huge 00:25:45 [Speaker Changed] Run 00:25:45 [Speaker Changed] Up up until October, August, what was it like 30, 40%? Some crazy, 00:25:49 [Speaker Changed] I think it was more than 40 really? And so we started to adjust allocations down more extreme on the hedge fund side where Marty went, I, I think to anally a net short position 00:26:02 [Speaker Changed] And famously disgusted on Ru Kaiser 00:26:05 [Speaker Changed] The Friday night right before the crash he was on, you can YouTube it now. Yep, yep. And Lou asked him, or or made a comment, he said, Marty, you seem particularly bearish. And, and Marty was seen as this perma bear. Oh really? He was just, but he wasn’t, 00:26:24 [Speaker Changed] I know I don think of him in 00:26:25 [Speaker Changed] That way. He was just, he always was a nervous, he always had a little bit of that, that angst and that humble risk 00:26:30 [Speaker Changed] Aware. 00:26:31 [Speaker Changed] So he would at times be nervous when his view on the market was very bullish. But, so then Lou concluded the question with, do you think we have a bear market ahead of us? And Marty said, well, no, I think it’s more likely to be a crash. And I, 00:26:50 [Speaker Changed] That was Friday night, pretty 00:26:51 [Speaker Changed] Much it could happen any day. And then Monday, and then he not only said that, but then he laid out and I think it could be really ugly. But then I think we, we immediately rally off the low, but then we probably retest the low before we take off again. So here I am, less than a year in the business, we had gone from being almost fully invested in equities down to, I don’t know, 20 or 25% invested in equities. Right. Right before the crash. So the little voice in my head is thinking, what’s the big deal? Why is everybody freaking out? You just figure out before the crash that there’s going to be a crash. You move money out, right? And then you take it back in advantage of cheaper price. You put it back in easy, easy 00:27:34 [Speaker Changed] Peasy pie. Right? Right. 00:27:36 [Speaker Changed] Little did I know. 00:27:37 [Speaker Changed] And, and to just reflect how accurate zoi was, Monday down 22%, a rally that failed the next day. You didn’t quite get back down to the same 00:27:48 [Speaker Changed] Lows. You didn’t fully retest, but, but it 00:27:50 [Speaker Changed] Was pretty ugly again. But you came, you know, 22% in a day is kind excessive. 23%. 20, 22 8. If I, if 00:27:57 [Speaker Changed] All right, I’m rounding. Okay. Yes. 00:27:59 [Speaker Changed] And, and double check those numbers. I could be wrong, but, you know, portfolio insurance was a big part of that. Probably made what was a 10% correction more than double. So maybe that’s why you didn’t retest. And then it was off to the races, the race back to break even 00:28:15 [Speaker Changed] For the year. Right. And, and we had started buying after the, after the crash. So ended the year with just off the charts performance. And again, you know, naive young me is thinking, I don’t know why everybody’s freaking out, out so much. Why 00:28:28 [Speaker Changed] Are these people talking about how difficult this, it’s hard. So the obvious question, how significant was Marty to shaping your framework for understanding markets? 00:28:39 [Speaker Changed] Oh, extraordinarily impactful. Because I, I think the thing that resonated with me the most, and you wrote about it in your book, and it’s the likes of the Sir John Templeton quote about bull markets are born in pessimism, the grown skepticism, mature and optimism die on euphoria. I think that’s such a brilliant way to describe a market cycle, in part because the only terms used in there have to do with emotions. Exactly. There’s nothing in that line about market cycles that has anything to do with what we all obsess about on a day-to-day basis. Monetary policy, fiscal policy, what the next inflation report is going to be, even earnings and, and valuation. And Marty understood that too. And so much of the work that he did was steeped in that sentiment analysis. I, 00:29:20 [Speaker Changed] I love that you brought that up because I, I, so I took the technical analysis training course with Ralph Por, and I don’t really think of myself as a technician, but I certainly wouldn’t buy anything without looking at a chart. Right. It has to be a component, right? I don’t, I don’t need to see an analyst research report, but I have to at least get a sense of is it trend up? Is the trend down? Has this been going sideways for years? And the best technicians I know have always brought in behavioral economics Yes. And sentiment before we called it behavioral finances. Absolutely. And Marty certainly was one of those 00:29:56 [Speaker Changed] People. Absolutely. And so my my maybe sort of added focus on the emotional side, the sentiment side of the market very much was born out of my time working for, for Marty. And I, I still think it’s extraordinarily important. And, and one of the, the messages we always impart to our investors is ideally you don’t figure out the hard way whether there’s a wider or narrow gap between your financial risk tolerance and your emotional risk tolerance. Right? ’cause those two at times can be completely different. And I always describe financial risk tolerance as kind of what’s on the proverbial paper, right? What 00:30:36 [Speaker Changed] Can you, 00:30:36 [Speaker Changed] Your time horizon in, would you need income? What is this money for? Is it for retirement diversification, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But if you are going to, you know, panic and sell everything at the first bear market level declines in your portfolio, you’re maybe not as risk tolerant investors as you, you thought. And it’s, it’s just the vast majority of mistakes that we see. Extreme mistakes purely driven by emotion. 00:31:04 [Speaker Changed] It, you know, there’s a line I remember from when I was on a trading desk that I didn’t really understand then, but it sums up what you, that gap between your financial risk tolerance and your emotional risk tolerance, which is figure out who you are because Wall Street is an expensive place to learn. Exactly right. You don’t know who you are. You don’t know what your emotional pain allowance is. You don’t wanna panic out the word capitulation technically means surrender. So you go to a, a March oh nine, that capitulation meant people just couldn’t take the paint anymore. Make it stop. Just get me out of everything. And that’s how bottoms 00:31:44 [Speaker Changed] Are found. Can I share the March oh nine? Oh 00:31:46 [Speaker Changed] We were talking about? Yes. I, we were talking about 00:31:48 [Speaker Changed] I would love to hear that, but it, we didn’t have microphones in front of us. That’s right. So it was, let’s go back to March 6th, 2009. So I lived in Darien, Connecticut for 22 years. We raised our kids in Darien, and it’s one of the, the hotbeds of Wall Street, in fact, bedroom 00:32:08 [Speaker Changed] Community, short commute to the 00:32:09 [Speaker Changed] City, short commute to the city. Our town made the cover of business week in 2008, the latter part of 2008, as the town most impacted by the financial crisis in the country. And they did it based on the percentage of the working population that worked either on Wall Street in some capacity or in real estate. And so it was, I was surrounded by Wall Street people, not a lot of Wall Street women. It was also a town where most of the, the women who were raising kids were, were stay at home. So I was always steeped in conversation about the markets. And in the role that I had, I would always get peppered with questions. So my husband and I are at a dinner party in Dairy End. It was toward the end dinner and dessert had served maybe about a quarter of the people had left a smaller crowd just sitting around chatting. And the host of the party who was at that time, a 30 plus year veteran of Wall Street, said, Lizanne, I must say I I don’t envy you right now. And he was a bit dramatic, and he kind of paused for effect. And I said, oh, what do you mean? And he said, well, I really think that there’s no chance that the stock market ever gets to another high. I think there’s a decent chance that retail investors will never buy again. Wait, never, never, 00:33:30 [Speaker Changed] Never. Just done. 00:33:31 [Speaker Changed] Which makes me question the, the viability of a company like Schwab. And so I don’t even remember what I said. I I think I did some generic version. Well, I beg to differ, but I, I didn’t, I was also ready to leave. You know, I I, I I, I like a nine handle on my bedtime. So if it’s 1130, I’m like, okay, chop, chop. So I, I just, I, I wanted to end the night. We get in the car unprompted, I, and I haven’t had to embellish a story at all before. My husband puts a key in the car. He looked to me, he said, did you hear it? And I said, the bell ringing. Yep. He said, I knew you were thinking that. So I called my friend the next morning and I said, I am working on a report. And all of my research reports, written research reports, I use rock song titles, right. I’m a rock chick from way back. So I said, I am working on a report that I want a title. Here comes the sun. Can I share the anecdote? No 00:34:27 [Speaker Changed] Name, just the no 00:34:28 [Speaker Changed] Anecdote. I said, I’m not gonna mention name. He said, sure, I think you’re gonna regret it. Every time I see him, he does like the fist to the forehead. Like, oh my gosh. And that was when the last person is standing has gone down. Right. That is, and I think that’s inter what’s interesting about sene is we know sentiment at extremes serves as a contrarian indicator. 00:34:51 [Speaker Changed] Right. Most of the time you could pretty much ignore that middle 00:34:54 [Speaker Changed] Range without, without anything resembling precise timing. That said, as we all learned in the late 1990s, extremely optimistic sentiment can last for a really long time. Right. You know, Greenspan made as a rational exuberance comment in 96, 00:35:08 [Speaker Changed] December 96. 00:35:08 [Speaker Changed] That’s right. And it wasn’t until, you know, three plus years later that the market topped out 00:35:12 [Speaker Changed] March, 2000, almost four years. 00:35:14 [Speaker Changed] That said, when sentiment gets to such an extreme of despair, it’s not a precise contrarian timing, but there’s a narrower window. Pay 00:35:24 [Speaker Changed] Attention. 00:35:24 [Speaker Changed] Yes. Pay more attention to extremes of despair than you do extremes of enthusiasm, because the ladder can last a long 00:35:32 [Speaker Changed] Time. Tops are a process. Yes. Bottoms are a moment. Bottoms are a moment. Exactly. Absolutely. And you know, there are all these old trader cliches and stuff, but they become cliches for a reason. A reason. Absolutely. And, you know, we all experience the world in a very narrow window of 8 billion people on the planet. Our experiences are maybe 10th of a percent of what the rest of the world is experiencing. And so we tend to extrapolate out to the rest of the world. But very often what’s happening in the markets is not a reflecting your personal experience, but after you’ve lived through enough cycles, you start to be able to hear those sort of things. I had a, that was a pure death of equities business we call cover from the late seventies and a year or two later. That was it. It was the next thousand percent route 00:36:28 [Speaker Changed] Market. Yeah, 00:36:29 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. Amazing story. I 00:36:30 [Speaker Changed] Have one other anecdote that’s an interesting one to think about how emotions come into play was out in Silicon Valley area maybe about a year ago, a little less than a year ago, and heard from a client that he had finally given in to his financial consultant suggestion that he trimmed just back about 10% of his NVIDIA holdings. He was an ex-employee, had a lot just, you know, diversification, 00:36:55 [Speaker Changed] Right? We’re gonna leave some money on the table in order to reduce your drawdowns and 00:36:59 [Speaker Changed] Volatility. And he ended up splitting the difference. He didn’t wanna trim any, he trimmed 5% and then the stock went up by 20 some odd percent in the short term. And he, he was mad at the financial consultant that the stock had gone up. And to his, our financial consultant’s credit said, would you really be happier if the 95% you still own went down 20%? 00:37:22 [Speaker Changed] Listen, in the beginning of this year in video lost, but that’s psychology of its value 00:37:26 [Speaker Changed] That they, he was almost more, and he, to his credit, he said, you know what, that’s the way I should think about it. Was more concerned about the top tick, the bottom tick. Right. I trimmed it. Wasn’t I brilliant because then the stock went down 20%. So it it, our emotions play tricks on us in a lot of different directions. 00:37:43 [Speaker Changed] You, you brought up my book, I try not to talk about it on the show. It was a great book. But the regret minimization chapter Yes. Is all about your role as an individual investor is not to outperform the market, right? Or top tick or bottom tick stocks. It’s, Hey, how can you avoid making decisions that you’re gonna say 10 years later? What an idiot. I was. Right. Just, just as Charlie Munger said, what can you do to be less stupid? Right? And if, you know, we see these portfolios that started out as a million or $2 million, but through either smarts or good Luck or some combination. They had a big slug of Nvidia 10 years ago, and now they have a $20 million portfolio, 18 million of which is Nvidia. Hey, do you really wanna ride this up and down? Yeah. You’ve won 20. Yeah, exactly. Think about what $20 million in long-term investing does for you. Do you really wanna ride this down when it takes one of its regular drawdowns? And what I wanna say, it gave up about a trillion dollars in market cap this year before recovering. But 00:38:50 [Speaker Changed] Can I, can I say something else? Not, and I’m not an analyst, I don’t cover Nvidia, but the whole focus, the Uber focus on the magnificent seven, let’s just use that as an example of a cohort. So the, we’re dealing with cap weighted indexes in the case of the s and p and the, and the nasdaq. And I think one of the messages we impart to individual investors is, don’t feel like you have to have the same concentration as what’s embedded in these cap weighted indexes. That’s an institutional problem. If you’re benchmarked against the s and p on a quarterly basis, right. You are at the mercy of the construction of that index. But as a, an example of how I I describe this, Nvidia is the best performing stock within the Mag seven year to date, but it’s the 47th best performing stock in the s and p 500. Wow. It’s the number one contributor to s and p gains by cap by virtue of the multiplier of the cap size. So there’s 46 stocks in the s and p that have out, that are outperforming Nvidia this year. NVIDIA’s, I think rank number 630 something in the nasdaq. Meaning there’s 630 some odd stocks within the NASDAQ that are outperforming the best performing mag seven. So it’s the concentrate, it’s the contribution that sometimes gets conflated with the performance. 00:40:07 [Speaker Changed] I have a buddy who’s a technician who looks at a ratio of the market cap s and p versus the equal weight s and p. And what we’ve been seeing this year is the equal weight, I’m trying to remember where we are now. I haven’t looked at it recently, but when it’s going up, it’s telling you the big caps are faltering. And when the ratio is going down, it’s telling you the big caps are doing well, unless I’m, I’m doing that backwards. It depends on which one is the numerator, which one is the denominator. But clearly the outsized weight market cap wise is, is Nvidia number one or two behind Microsoft or Apple? 00:40:43 [Speaker Changed] It’s number one right now. But it’s been, you know, meta and alphabet have actually been kind of battling. But, and then also Microsoft, those are the four of the mag seven that are outperforming the s and p year to date. The other three are underperforming. And in fact, a few days ago, ’cause I tracked this on a daily basis, apple was down, I think 7% year to date that was, is its worst year to date performance. And it was the 503rd ranked contributor to the s and p. So the multiplier of cap size works in the other direction if, if you’re an underperformer as well. And a lot of people say, well, what do you mean 503? The s and p has 500 stocks, 00:41:19 [Speaker Changed] A and B shares, 00:41:20 [Speaker Changed] Google, 00:41:21 [Speaker Changed] Berk, Berkshire, you have a few big 00:41:23 [Speaker Changed] Companies like that. So 00:41:24 [Speaker Changed] That’s a great trivia question, how many company, how many stocks are 00:41:27 [Speaker Changed] In? How many stocks are in the s and p 500? And there’s also not 2000 in the Russell 2000 00:41:31 [Speaker Changed] Or the Wilshire 5,000. It’s like 3,400. 00:41:33 [Speaker Changed] Well there yeah, the WIL 5,000 used to be about 8,000 stocks, and now there’s just fewer stocks that are 00:41:39 [Speaker Changed] Publicly traded. Yep, absolutely. Coming up, we continue our conversation with Liz Ann Saunders, market strategist for Schwab, discussing the current environment. I’m Barry Riol, you’re listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. 00:42:05 I’m Barry Ritholtz, your listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. My extra special guest this week is Liz Ann Saunders. She is the Chief market strategist at Schwab, helping to oversee $11 trillion in change in client assets. So I went back and looked at my notes the last time we had a conversation like this was spring of 2024. It was six months before the election. I don’t think the election surprised many people. Right. It sort of felt like that was inevitable. Maybe that’s a little bit of hindsight bias. How has this year played out since January 20th relative to expectations? 00:42:47 [Speaker Changed] Well, you know, let, let’s focus on not so much the beginning of the year, but the setup going into April 2nd. I think that was a pivotal point because we knew tariffs were coming, but I think there was complacency as to what the announcement would be on April 2nd. An assumption that okay, 10% across the board, tariffs, it’s kind of built into expectations. 00:43:08 [Speaker Changed] You call it complacency. I, I call it a failure of imagination. Yeah. Because afterwards, a 00:43:13 [Speaker Changed] Failure to imagine the Cheesecake Factory menu being held up and reciprocal tariffs of a massive size. Right? Yeah. 00:43:21 [Speaker Changed] Right. Because you think about it, he talked about tariffs. He’s, I called himself tariff man, it’s the most beautiful in the dictionary. None of us imagined that he would just 00:43:31 [Speaker Changed] Overturn the order. And that, and that reciprocity wasn’t about tariffs that other countries had as part of their policy, but reciprocity relative to trade deficits. And the confusion that that brought about, when you think about there are many countries, particularly smaller, 00:43:47 [Speaker Changed] Vietnam is the classic example, 00:43:49 [Speaker Changed] But also, you know, the Madagascar and Bangladesh, right? We’re never going to have a trade surplus. They can’t afford, they buy teen their teeny. And in the case of, you know, a, a place like Madagascar, they produce most of the vanilla in the world that gives them literally and figuratively in industry. And they can’t afford to buy what we export, which is much more value add. So I think that was a big surprise factor. 00:44:13 [Speaker Changed] A math a, it’s effectively a conceptual math error. Yeah. 00:44:17 [Speaker Changed] And of course, running trade deficits. The other side of that is a, a capital account surplus. So we export dollars into the rest of the, the world, right? And those dollars have to be put to work and they get put in treasury 00:44:29 [Speaker Changed] Here, some paper we printed us. 00:44:31 [Speaker Changed] And so I think that became a, a significant concern. I also have been really shocked, Barry, at how the general public doesn’t understand literally who pays the tariffs. 00:44:45 [Speaker Changed] It’s a VAT tax, it’s evaluated tax on consumption’s. 00:44:48 [Speaker Changed] The first time I decided, I was speaking to an audience in Naples, Florida in the spring, that well to do audience. So assuming they have some investment expertise, but we’re not, we’re not deep in the import export business. And I decided, let me just lay out the actual definition of tariffs. I said, notwithstanding the shorthanded headlines of tariffs on China, tariffs on Mexico, fill in the blank. Tariffs are paid by the US company importing the goods. They’re not paid by the targeted country. It is not the case that, as I’ve heard from friends who didn’t understand how this worked, that in order for China to export goods into the United States, China has to pay a tariff to the United States. Barry, do you know how many people came up to me after that event and said, I had no idea. And that’s what’s a little frustrating because there’s still that shorthand. And at times when there are comments made by the administration that, you know, China, again, fill in the blank of the country, paying us more in tariffs. It’s the US company. It’s a tax on US companies. Now, a valid debate is who ultimately bears the cost and is it the exporters that will lower their price to offset the tariff that the US company has to pay? Very little indication that that is happening. And then of course it’s do companies eat it in their profit margins or do they pass it on to 00:46:09 [Speaker Changed] Consumers? But, but either way, either companies are gonna have lower profits, which means the stock market could support a lower PE multiple, or there’s only so many dollars. It’s finite. Right. If, if they’re, so what we saw, we saw this is taking place in three steps in anticipation of the tariffs going into effect. And especially with the 90 day pause on April. 00:46:31 [Speaker Changed] Well, so that was the thing that happened. 00:46:33 [Speaker Changed] So ton of excess import inventory bills 00:46:35 [Speaker Changed] In one week from April 2nd to the intraday low on April 9th. There was sort of a complete about face. So what none of us can do is try to gauge what the next social media post is going to be. Right. There’s been so many fits and starts from a tariff perspective, whether it’s delays, tariffs coming down, exceptions. This has been a, an elongated process. It was certainly wasn’t a moment in time kind of thing. But what we can analyze, especially as a, as a strategist, are the setups. So we already talked about the setup going into April 2nd. Well, the setup shifted very quickly. So you went from complacent sentiment to despairing sentiment. You, 00:47:18 [Speaker Changed] You had a VIX in the low teens that spiked up, spiked to 30, and I want, on the eighth, I wanted to buy. And I’m like, I have no idea what the hell the next tweet is gonna be. Right? Can I really put money in my personal account, put money on at risk that could be destroyed by a 00:47:35 [Speaker Changed] Tweet. But then, then you had the market, technically oversold breath had fully washed out. So then you, that was the attraction was really just incrementally positive news intraday on April 9th off to the races and off to the races, right? But then you had the power of the retail trader and that cohort has become unbelievably power powerful representing somewhere in the 20 to 25% of daily trading volume. And that by the dip mentality was such a fuel for the market. What concerns me a little bit now is if I, I track a lot of the baskets that track like micro baskets of, of stocks. Goldman has a lot of them. UBS has the meme stock basket. You go back to that intraday low on April 9th. And it’s baskets like the memes, non-profitable tech, heavily shorted stocks. That is the perfect example of retail traders kind of powering this market higher. And in the heavily shorted piece of that, it’s also suggestive maybe of retail traders with a little bit of the stick it to the man, which, which drove the initial meme stock CRAs back, back 00:48:36 [Speaker Changed] In 2021 sort of GameStop thing. 00:48:39 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And it’s, it’s alive and well again, it it, it actually has forced institutions in some cases to cover shorts, which has added to the, the fuel. Now, I think as we think about the setup, we’re arguably back in a similar pre-AP April 2nd, a bit of complacency and which may means some vulnerability to the extent you get some sort of negative 00:49:02 [Speaker Changed] Catalyst. So, so that’s where I wanted to go. Since we’re talking about the current environment. It felt like a lot of savvy companies loaded up on inventory in that 90 day pause front, ran the tariffs and Right. Exactly. And then they were capable until that ran down of not really being affected by tariffs. And then even as the tariffs started to bite, they seem, it seemed like they were eating the increase and not passing it along. But that can only go on for so long. It feels like the next phase is consumers are gonna pick it up. 00:49:38 [Speaker Changed] And to your point, Barry, there, there wasn’t much of that eating it at the early stages because of that inventory build by front running the tariffs and building inventories at a low cost basis, providing some time flexibility around when to make the decision of eating it in the profit margins or passing it on to the consumers. We’re now starting to see attempts to pass on to the consumer. But the, maybe the more interesting thing to consider right now is so much focus on goods that are impacted by tariffs. What’s the rate of inflation in those goods? Trying to gauge the tariff impact on the inflation statistics. But what we’re, we’re also starting to see is demand destruction and switching on the part of consumers. So I think we have to analyze the impact of tariffs in a parallel fashion, not just gauging what the inflation impact is. And you can do that by separating out goods and services within the goods categories of an inflation metric like CPI look at those that are directly impacted by tariffs, not impacted by tariffs, but there’s the demand destruction side of things. So we track the weekly consumer spending data, and if you separate that into tariff impacted categories, that’s where you’re seeing a compression in that spending. 00:50:54 [Speaker Changed] So to be fair, when you look at the US as a 30, $31 trillion economy, when you look at the value of imported, and, and by the way, that economy is much more services than goods oriented. And then you look at the percentage of goods that are imported, it’s a trillion or 2 trillion out of, i, I know it sounds crazy to say, yeah, what’s a trillion, but it’s a trillion out of 30 plus trillion dollars. So the worst case scenario is it, it takes a quarter or half a point outta GDP, but probably doesn’t tip us into a recession. Is that a a fair way to describe that? 00:51:30 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, in and of itself it probably doesn’t. But there’s, you know, the feedback loop that happens if company rate labor where if companies, because they don’t have that ability to pass most of it on to consumers in part because of the demand destruction that I’m talking about, then there’s that eating in profit margins. And then does that feed into the labor market side of things? I think that’s why the Fed did what it did. The risk little insurance, the risk management, the insurance cut to try to stem any weakness in the labor market. 00:51:58 [Speaker Changed] So, so let’s talk about those crosscurrents, since you do both markets and the economy. We’ve had a softening labor market at least the past few months. And then the whole, i, I don’t know if that re statement is precise, but it certainly makes it clear we were too optimistic about the labor market over the past four quarters. Inflation, sort of residual sticky inflation that hasn’t come down to the fed’s 2% target. We can argue about whether that really should be a 3% target. But hold that aside. Yet at the same time we sort see corporate profits continue to grow and markets making new all times highs, which that combination expanding profits all time price highs tends to be bullish historically. How do you navigate all of these positives and negatives? Well, 00:52:49 [Speaker Changed] Here’s one way to to think about the connectivity between the market and the economy. I think it’s very circular right now. Or maybe chicken and egg. And what does make me harken back to the late 1990s as a bit of a comp to the current environment is not so much is it a bubble? And there’s more there. There in the AI world, a 00:53:10 [Speaker Changed] Lot of revenue, a lot of process. There’s 00:53:11 [Speaker Changed] Actual denominator in the valuation equation, which not 00:53:14 [Speaker Changed] The clicks case and eyeballs, 00:53:15 [Speaker Changed] Right? Not clicks and eyeballs. Not every company just adding.com, you know, to the end of their name. But the wealth effect and it’s chicken and egg. And what makes me think back to the late 1990s is in that 99 blow off into the peak in 2000, whether it was valuation metrics like the buffet model, which looks at total market cap of all US stocks as a share of total GDP, 00:53:41 [Speaker Changed] Which is at all time highs now, 00:53:43 [Speaker Changed] Which, and way higher than it was back at the peak in 99 or 2000 at the time, households exposure to equities as a share of their financial assets. Well, at an all time high, significantly higher. So if we remember when the market topped out in March of 2000, and then we started what was a two and a half year bear market, we ended up getting a recession declared in 2001. It was a very mild recession. It was one of the proof points, which for what I always say drives me crazy that people think of recession as traditionally or classically defined as two quarters in a row of GDP. That’s never been the definition right. Of recession. Hundred percent. NBER is, that’s 00:54:21 [Speaker Changed] A pet peeve of mine 00:54:22 [Speaker Changed] As well. It drives me crazy. And in fact, oh, one with the benefit of revisions wasn’t two quarters in a row of negative 00:54:28 [Speaker Changed] GDP. That’s right. Same, same thing in 2022 people were talking about it. Right. The revision, the 00:54:33 [Speaker Changed] Revision took out that one plus quarter 00:54:36 [Speaker Changed] Plus when you have a spike in inflation, it’s not that the economy is contracting, it’s that we back out price increases. Right, exactly. The economy is so hot. Exactly. That inflation makes it look negative, right. It’s not, it’s not a contraction, it’s just a price problem. 00:54:51 [Speaker Changed] But that oh one recession was actually very mild, began 00:54:55 [Speaker Changed] In March. I think it ended in October. 00:54:57 [Speaker Changed] It ended in October, right. Short. It was mild. There were, there was not really a financial system crisis for sure. It wasn’t a credit crunch. I think it was the weakness in the stock market caused the economy to contract because of the wealth effect at the time. 00:55:12 [Speaker Changed] I’m gonna take it just a step further. I have vivid recollections of speaking to people, speaking to clients or other people’s clients in 96, 97, 98, 99, who had been in the market for 15, 20 years. Hey, we want to trade up to an ISA house. Hey, we want to buy a beach house, a lake house, a vacation property. And the person said, I’m, I’m not sure if the market’s gonna go higher from here, but I want to pull half a million outta my account and buy real estate. It’s like, Hey, you’re gonna have that house for the next 25, 30 years, even if the market keeps going higher, who cares? You’re sitting on such profits, why not? And so I kind of got a sense that it wasn’t so much the wealth effect as people had already done the big buys before the market crash, which tends to freeze people in place. Yeah. So I saw a lot of rotation out of equities just because people were sitting on, look, from 82 to 2000, the Dow gained a thousand percent. People were taking a little of the house money off the table and letting less the rest ride. And then the.com implosion, I wanna say 82, 80 3% peaked a TR on, on nasdaq. On the queues. Yeah. 00:56:33 [Speaker Changed] 57% on the s and p, you know, 00:56:35 [Speaker Changed] 80 plus percent. And the Dow held up the best because it was least exposed back then. Right, right. Least exposed that before Microsoft and Intel went 00:56:42 [Speaker Changed] Into Intel and price, weight did not cap, right? 00:56:43 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, that’s right. Yeah. So the 00:56:45 [Speaker Changed] World, so I just think we, and again, it’s a bit circular in that, you know, if and when we get another bear market, we essentially had one this year, just missed it on the s and p 00:56:58 [Speaker Changed] 19%. 00:56:58 [Speaker Changed] Think at the index level. Yeah. But the, here’s, here’s another set of statistics. The average max, the average member, maximum drawdown for the s and p year to date is 24%. Hmm. So the average member has had a bear market. Huh. That’s interesting. The average, average member within the NASDAQs maximum drawdown is 47%. Wow. Now you want 00:57:19 [Speaker Changed] Cap weighted. 00:57:21 [Speaker Changed] Well, the average member, just each individual member. So not cap weight, what was there? No, ’cause it’s individual members, right? You just track what each member maximum drawdown was at any point, and then take an average of that. But here’s the maybe more interesting one. In an environment since the April 9th intraday low, we haven’t had much of any kind of pullback in either the s and p or the nasdaq. But just since that low, in an environment where the s and p hasn’t even had a 2% pullback, the average member within the s and p since the closing low on April 8th, has had a 14% maximum draw down. Hmm. And within the NASDAQ has had a 32% maximum drawdown. Wow. So there’s a lot of rotation and churn under the surface, which you don’t pick up if you’re only focused on the index level, which has that cap bias to it. 00:58:07 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. That’s amazing. So last question before I get to my favorites. We we’re talking about a lot of things that are in the headlines. What do you think investors are not thinking about or talking about, but perhaps should be? What topics, assets, data points, you know, are getting overlooked? 00:58:26 [Speaker Changed] There was one I thought about this morning, and it’s not so much what people aren’t talking about, so I’m gonna answer in a different way. It’s what I hear a lot of people talking about that isn’t quite the right way to think about it. And that is the cash on the sidelines argument. Ugh. 00:58:41 [Speaker Changed] So it’s y hated that, and I’m not a fan either, 00:58:44 [Speaker Changed] But it often, the specificity around that has to do with the amount of money in money market, 00:58:49 [Speaker Changed] Seven point something 00:58:51 [Speaker Changed] Trillion, seven 7 trillion in change. Yeah. And that, that is sitting there as either, if not imminent, but ample fuel that if that money decides to repatriate from money markets into the equity market, boy, we go off to the races. 00:59:06 [Speaker Changed] Didn’t that money mostly come from bonds? It 00:59:08 [Speaker Changed] Did. 00:59:08 [Speaker Changed] You’re getting such low yield and bond. So my, 00:59:11 [Speaker Changed] I think a lot of it’s 00:59:12 [Speaker Changed] Sticky. My Schwab money market account last summer, so we bought a house, a beach property in February last summer. I was getting like 5 3, 5 2 in, in the Schwab, what is it? Snacks. Snacks. I don’t even remember the symbol. I’m like, why do I need to mess around with 10 or 20 year bonds when I’m getting much better? 00:59:31 [Speaker Changed] But here’s the other angle to that. If you think of $7 trillion as some massive fuel for the market, you need to look at it as a ratio relative to the total right market capitalization. And 00:59:45 [Speaker Changed] It’s gone up less than the stock 00:59:47 [Speaker Changed] Market has. It’s, it’s only 12%. The all time low in that, in the history that we have for that data is 11%. To put that in context, in oh 8, 0 9, when money was flying into money markets, because it was fleeing the equity market at the peak money market assets relative to the size of the stock market was more than 60%. Huh. 01:00:11 [Speaker Changed] That’s 01:00:11 [Speaker Changed] Huge. Now we’re only at about 12%. So the math is such that even if all $7 trillion was to leave on mass and go into the equity market as a fuel at 12% of total market cap versus say, you know, 63% of total market cap in oh nine, that’s a very different, not to mention back to our initial point, I think a lot of that money is sticky. That was money that was forced out the risk spectrum into other categories within the fixed income market in order to pick up yield when there was none to be had. So I, I don’t think we should consider that some sidelines cash that is just itching to find its way back into the riskier asset classes. 01:00:52 [Speaker Changed] Someone once debunked the cash on the sideline argument, and it might have even been Marty Sweig in winning on Wall Street by explaining it this way. Hey, I’m gonna buy a million dollars worth of stock. It means I have a million dollars worth of cash, but no stock. I buy a million of the SPY, now I have the SPY. Right? And, and, and they have a million on of cash 01:01:16 [Speaker Changed] For every buyer. There’s a seller. The 01:01:18 [Speaker Changed] The, there’s no cash on the sideline. It just changes hands. It just changes the same dollar amount. So it’s been one of those things that has persisted forever. 01:01:25 [Speaker Changed] And that also the more buyers than sellers. No, no, no, no. 01:01:29 [Speaker Changed] So that you, you are tagging all my, my favorite pet peeves. 01:01:33 [Speaker Changed] I mean, there’s maybe more enthusiasm on the buy side versus the enthusiasm, but there’s no more buyers and sellers or vice versa for every buyer 01:01:41 [Speaker Changed] That’s a seller. But my head trader used to say, there are more buyers and sellers at this level. And now you go up to the nice price next price level where there are matching number of buyers and sellers and the price stabilizes. Right. If a price is going up, okay, at that particular do at at 27 55, there may be more buyers in stock for sale. But at 27 75, then you, you’ve, that’s how you end up with price stability. So yeah. More buyers and sellers. No, no. They’re an equal amount of buyers and sellers. That’s how the other line I love has been trade takes place where there’s a disagreement about value, but an agreement on price. Hmm. And that seems to really Yeah. E explain that. Yeah. All right. I like that one. I have to get you out to, to catch your plane. So I only have you for a limited amount of time. Let’s, let’s speed through our favorite questions. Starting with, tell us about your mentors who help helped shape your career. I’m pretty sure I know the two 01:02:37 [Speaker Changed] Shocker. Marty Zweig. Yeah. Chuck Schwab. 01:02:40 [Speaker Changed] Okay. And 01:02:41 [Speaker Changed] In the world 01:02:41 [Speaker Changed] Of, by the way, not not too shabby 01:02:43 [Speaker Changed] Mentors. Right. Not too shabby mentors. Yeah. Boy was I lucky. And I will say in the world of media, another name we’ve already touched on, Louis Ru Kaiser. One of the best pieces of advice he gave me was, was one, I was on the show for the first time as a guest, and he was saying hello to me for the first time, welcomed me onto the show. This was off camera. And he asked me whether my parents were still alive and whether they were finance people. And I said, Nope, far from it. He said, okay, when you come out here and do the interview with me, get them to understand what you’re talking about. And that was such a, a moment of, okay, get people to understand what you’re talking 01:03:19 [Speaker Changed] About. That’s so funny. You say that. Great advice. You say that my mom was a real estate agent. My wife is an art teacher. And it’s always make them understand it. Yeah. Right. Don’t, don’t don’t clutter it up with jargon. That’s right. Make it hundred percent. That’s interesting that it was, it was Ru Kai who said that. Let’s talk about books. I mentioned Wags winning on Wall Street. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading right 01:03:40 [Speaker Changed] Now? So, my favorite, so I’m not reading a book right now. I, I must say I don’t have a lot of time. I read constantly. I drink from a fire hose of information, but it tends to be, you know, like reports 01:03:51 [Speaker Changed] And 01:03:52 [Speaker Changed] Analysis reports and deep dive fed research. And, but my favorite book of all time, and it is market related, is reminiscences of a Stock Operator. Sure. Absolute favorite. I I tell young people to buy it all the time. It still resonates today. And you 01:04:07 [Speaker Changed] Substitute AI for railroads and telegraphs. Exactly. And it, it’s the same story. 01:04:13 [Speaker Changed] It’s the same. It’s the same story. But I am a big podcast listener, so that’s the longer form way, including masters in business. Well, thank you that I absorb information beyond the traditional drivers that come into my inbox. Literally. 01:04:30 [Speaker Changed] It’s easy when you’re traveling, if you’re on a plane or a car. I just find it so easy. Yeah. Alright, so you told us what you’re, what po what other podcasts are you listening to? What are you watching on Hulu and Netflix or 01:04:40 [Speaker Changed] Amazon? Well, I, I listen to Masters in business. I love Grant Williams series of podcasts. I love ’em because they’re long form and they’re big picture and top down. My, my favorite non-inverting podcast is Smartless. I just love those 01:04:55 [Speaker Changed] Guys. Those guys are great. They’re 01:04:56 [Speaker Changed] Great. They’re, they’re so fun. 01:04:58 [Speaker Changed] I’m gonna tell you, I listened. I’ve had Michael Lewis on the podcast at Dawson 01:05:03 [Speaker Changed] Times. I have, I have met and have interviewed Michael Lewis on stage at Schwab’s Impact Conference. 01:05:08 [Speaker Changed] And, and the story he told, and I’m not even gonna mention it, the story he told on Smartless about a family tragedy was just, it 01:05:17 [Speaker Changed] Was unbelievable. And what Right. What his friend said to him, or his therapist said to him, the reason why you’re so exhausted after this life’s tragedy is in your mind, you’re rewriting the future without, without her. Without her. Right. It’s crazy. And that was such a, a, a moment of Wow. But yeah, that was one of the most impactful interviews 01:05:36 [Speaker Changed] I’ve heard that, that I, that stayed with me for a long time 01:05:38 [Speaker Changed] In terms of what I’m watching. Well, morning Show just started back up again. Yeah. So we get back into that four four, and I loved Department Q. 01:05:46 [Speaker Changed] So did I. That was so good. 01:05:47 [Speaker Changed] It was intense. 01:05:48 [Speaker Changed] It was a little slow, but they really, it really paid off, if you like Department Q There’s a movie, I wanna say it’s on Netflix called Black Bag. That’s the same I’ve heard about it. Same sort of I’ve heard about it. Espionage thing. Yes. Yeah. And I walked in on my wife watching Killing Eve. 01:06:10 [Speaker Changed] That was great. 01:06:11 [Speaker Changed] Which she’s like, told it was great. Like, I’m like, oh, 01:06:14 [Speaker Changed] This is Queen Gambit was great. 01:06:15 [Speaker Changed] There’s, there’s been a ton of stuff. Yeah. We, we just finished the Gilded Age, which is 01:06:19 [Speaker Changed] Oh yeah. Which, that’s 01:06:20 [Speaker Changed] Feels modern. 01:06:22 [Speaker Changed] I’m obsessed with that era in New York City. Oh really? I have every book written about it. I’m just so, so that is so right up my alley. 01:06:30 [Speaker Changed] So we watched The Crown, but we never watched Doubt Abbey. And people said, oh, loved it. Loved it. Oh, you like Gilded Age in the Crown. Doubt Abbey is, absolutely. So that’s on my, and during the Pandemic, I had never seen a single episode of Mad Men. And that was mind blowing to watch that. Yeah, that’s a good one. That felt like more like a documentary. Yeah. It’s fun 01:06:48 [Speaker Changed] To go back and watch some of the old 01:06:49 [Speaker Changed] Shows. Yeah, absolutely. All right, our last two questions. Okay. We’ll get you outta here on time. A recent college grad is interested in the career in investing or doing market strategy. What sort of adv advice would you give them? 01:07:01 [Speaker Changed] Well, the world you live in and indirectly I live in on the advisor side, that’s an incredible growth area in the broader realm of financial services, independent RIAs, wealth management firms, even the wealth management divisions at the big wirehouse firms because it’s essentially a first generation business. And so there’s a lot of succession planning happening right now. And I, I think for young investors, that’s such a great avenue to go in more generic advice that I give young people, especially as they embark on the networking and interview part of the process is be way more focused on being interested than being interesting. Hmm. Don’t go in there and say, here’s all the fabulous things have I done? Especially if it’s, that’s limited to an undergraduate education, but be interested, ask questions, be engaged, show the enthusiasm. That way you’re not bringing something into the mix by virtue of what you know, econ, you know, 2 0 8 course you took that they think, oh God, we have to hire this person. ’cause we don’t know anything about that. So we’re bringing it’s is be interested. 01:08:06 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really interesting. And our final question. What do you know about the world of investing today? You wish you knew back in the 1980s when, when you were first getting started? 01:08:17 [Speaker Changed] It, it seemed to be a little bit easier to analyze markets in that day using kind of traditional stuff. Models to think now about how much more of an influence there is of geopolitics and macro and how much more complicated an ecosystem. Not to mention the channels of information that occur through social media. I, I kind of wish it was back to what at the time didn’t feel terribly simple, but I think then was a little bit more simple and more concrete in terms of what drives markets. I think there’s more psychology now with a wider band of what that means and what that represents. And it would’ve been interesting to kind of know that in advance the little birdie landing on your shoulder saying here, here’s what, here’s what I don’t know. If I would’ve believed that 40 years from that point, I’d still be doing this, but just how much more complex an ecosystem that the markets live in these days. Huh. 01:09:19 [Speaker Changed] Really interesting. Lizanne, as always delightful. Thank you so much for being 01:09:23 [Speaker Changed] So generous 01:09:24 [Speaker Changed] With your time.

Strap yourself in for another great one. Liz Ann Sonders, chief Investment strategist at Schwab, helping to manage $11 trillion in client assets. What a fascinating career she’s had. She’s been on all of the best of lists. She’s just really insightful. What she does is really kind of unique. She combines top down market analysis with looking at everything from sentiment to economic data to fund flows, to really what the clients of Schwab are, are doing. I know Liz for almost 25 years. Every time I speak with her, it’s always great. This is another conversation that is all also fabulous. With no further ado my discussion with Liz Ann Saunders, Liz Ann Sonders: Always great to see you… Barry Ritholtz: I know it’s always, I always have so much, I’ve 00:01:11 [Speaker Changed] Known each other for a long time, Liz Ann Sonders: A long time. It’s always so much fun chatting with you. I wanna talk about what you’re doing with the podcast and what you’re doing at Schwab, but I have to start with a little bit of your background. Undergraduate economics and poli sci at Delaware, MBA in finance from Fordham, Barry Ritholtz: At the time you went there, was it called Gabelli? Liz Ann Sonders: No, it was not. Barry Ritholtz: It’s now called the Gabelli School of School Business. Was the career plan always Wall Street? Liz Ann Sonders: No, I honestly, I, I think if you brought me back to my college days and asked, what is your career plan? If I was honest, I probably would’ve said not quite sure yet. I, the, the decision to do a double major there was, to keep it very open and broad. All I knew was that I wanted to live and work in New York City. So got out of undergrad, pounded the pavement in New York, but, but across the spectrum of industries, not all Wall Street, I, I interviewed at a sports marketing firm and an ad agency, and I had two interviews in a row at Zweig. Avatar did a lot of research on the company, which by the way, this was in 1986. So doing research on a company meant going to the library, pulling up a microfiche machine, actually cranking the handle I recall, and look at newspaper clippings and was fascinated by Marty Sweig, the, the co-founder and enjoyed the interview process, liked the people with whom I met, and I don’t know, a little voice just said this, this seems to make sense. And Barry Ritholtz: I recall reading a book, Marty’s Zweig wrote, I wanna say in the late nineties, when I was on a trading desk, Winning on Wall Street, Liz Ann Sonders: Late eighties, Barry Ritholtz: Well, I got his book when I started around the time of the Netscape, IPO. Liz Ann Sonders: That’s when I, he, he did, you know, newer versions. He did updated versions, but I think so… Barry Ritholtz: Whatever that version was in ninety six, ninety seven. And I vividly recall that. How did you, how did you get the gig with Marty’s wag? What was that like? Liz Ann Sonders: It, I was a grunt at the outset. I did whatever they needed me to do, but they were a firm that believed in promoting from within and educating their young people. So I saw that as an opportunity. They, they paid for grad school a hundred percent. So I made the easy financial decision to do that at night while still learning a living and having my education paid for. And so many things that I learned from Marty, I could consider him the, the first mentor, whether he realized it or, or not. Barry Ritholtz: People, by the way, people don’t realize, especially the generation that came of age in 2000, what a legend he was. Liz Ann Sonders: Unbelievable legend. Barry Ritholtz: I think at one point in time he owned the, the most expensive apartment in the United States. Is is that true? Liz Ann Sonders: Yes. It was the top three floors of the Pierre, which is now owned by the Commerce Secretary. Barry Ritholtz: That’s amazing. And he was always the answer to, “Hey, do any of these technicians make any money?” And the answer was, yeah, look at Marty Zweig. I mean, for, for the younger folks, go look up Marty Zweig. He was absolutely a legend. I remember him from my early days, because he was on Rukeyser. Liz Ann Sonders: He was one of the originals on, on the original Wall Street Week. Barry Ritholtz: Yep. I mean, back in the day when all of financial media was an hour, that was television a week. Not even Liz Ann Sonders: Was a half hour. That’s 8:30 PM Friday nights. That’s right. On PBS produced by Maryland Public Television. That’s right. And Marty was not only one of the original panelists, he was, I think, the original elf as, as Lou used to describe them, Barry Ritholtz: The people who came back on a regular basis? Liz Ann Sonders: And that’s another thing that intrigued me about joining the firm, is I remember getting a little bit of a, kind of a wink, wink, nod nod from a, an economics professor that I had, not just to me, but to the class. And he made a funny comment about, given that one of the, the jobs that we had as students was to read the Wall Street Journal every day and just keep up on markets and the economy, and that if you had too many late nights at the Stone Balloon, you might wanna just get a really brilliant 30 minute recap by watching Wall Street Week on Friday night before you then go out. So I thought, all right, I’ll see what this Wall Street Week is all about. And so I started watching it before I joined the business, before I started at, at Swg Avatar. And, and then I joined the show in 1997, which was surreal. Barry Ritholtz: So you were not that far outta school when you started? 00:06:03 [Speaker Changed] Well, I was, yeah, I was 11 years. So since you and I have talked about our first experience together, which was on TV years, first, it was my first TVeExperience, first TV appearance on Kudlow. Liz Ann Sonders: And I, I, I went on the show as a special guest. So I remember getting the, the little, you know, pink slip from the receptionist that told you who had called. There was voicemail at that time that said Rich de Roth, the producer of Wall Street Week called They’d like You to come on as a guest. And I thought it was somebody playing a prank on me. Barry Ritholtz: Really? Liz Ann Sonders: Yeah, until I called and it was legit. And I went on as a, a guest. And then in shortly after that, they asked me to become a regular panelist, and it was a thrill. Barry Ritholtz: So you were Zweig for a number of years, [13] you end up go 13 years. Wow. That’s a long time. Liz Ann Sonders: 86 to 99. Barry Ritholtz: How did you end up at US Trust? Liz Ann Sonders: So that was kind of funny. I was on the avatar side of this [Zweig Avatar] broad set of companies, which was the institutional money management side. I was a portfolio manager, co-ran stock selection. But I was always much more intrigued by interested in and with a desire to spend more of my time doing top down macro research Barry Ritholtz: As opposed to bottom up Liz Ann Sonders: The inner voice said, you don’t really love this that much. And there wasn’t really an opportunity for that. I, I, it wasn’t that I was pigeonholed, but, but it was a growing role as a portfolio manager. So I got recruited over to US Trust to co-run their large cap growth area, which, which put me yet again in that position, but felt like the platform was broader. And my inclusion on the investment policy committee, they actually purposely wanted some top down analysis based on my learnings for working Barry Ritholtz: Liz For the ultimate large cap growth means here’s the universe, it’s, it’s a hundred of the S&P 500. Liz Ann Sonders: , and we were a concentrated manager [only owning 30 positions only?] No less than 25 typically, with a four to five year holding period. Barry Ritholtz: So not a closet indexer, a high active share. Liz Ann Sonders: But I also didn’t love the pigeonholing aspect of it. Mm. Where, you know, the mantra had to be large cap growth. I, I, I liked thinking bigger picture and thinking about different parts of the market cycle and what works. So 10 months after I joined US, trust, Schwab acquired us Trust. Barry Ritholtz: That was 2000. And you’ve been with Schwab for a quarter century? Liz Ann Sonders: Since then for, it’ll be 26 years. Wow. At the beginning of next year. And the, the re when I realized I did indeed wanna be adopted by the new parent company was when Chuck Schwab himself came to New York with our CEO at the time, Dave Patrick, and sat with me and said, we would like to create this role of chief investment strategist, which didn’t exist at Schwab before. This was the beginning of our entree into actually giving advice as opposed to just being a platform for, for traders. Barry Ritholtz: So, so let, let’s dive into that. So I was gonna ask you what the process was like, but they acquired us trust for the assets and for the platform. You were a bonus that came along with it, right? Liz Ann Sonders: Well, well, that’s kind of you to say. Well, I mean, they, they did offer me the, the role. It had not existed before. Barry Ritholtz: That’s a big deal. Liz Ann Sonders: And I said, yes, please. Barry Ritholtz: Yeah, absolutely. Liz Ann Sonders: And the rest is 26 years of history. Barry Ritholtz: So let, let’s dive into this. What are the, let, let’s take a look at the numbers on the Schwab platform as a custodian or however Schwab is touching a 401k. How many trillions of dollars are on that platform? Liz Ann Sonders: 11.23 trillion… Barry Ritholtz: All right. So keep working at it. You’ll, get somewhere soon… Liz Ann Sonders: Yeah. That’s trillion with s about a third of the size of the US economy. Wow. Barry Ritholtz: That’s unbelievable. And at the time, what was Schwab? Schwab in 2000? Liz Ann Sonders: Oh gosh. One, something like that. It was less than that. Because I remember getting this little… Barry Ritholtz: Plexiglass plaque? Liz Ann Sonders: Well, no, it was a, it was a holder for sticky notes and it had a star on it, and it said, you know, 1 trillion in client assets. But that was after the, so that’s acquisition of me. Barry Ritholtz: So that’s an incredible growth. Schwab really is a platform that are so many things to so many different people. There’s an institutional business, there’s a business. And full disclosure, we custody right at our firm at Schwab, most of our assets are there. So you custody for RIAs and others, self-directed investors, individuals who doesn’t Schwab work with? It’s pretty much everybody in the industry. Liz Ann Sonders: Well, traditional institutions. So the way we define institutional, when we talk about it and use that term somewhat generically, we’re actually referring to the part of the business that you’re involved with. So independent wealth management firms, RIAs, that, that platform with Schwab via the custody of assets, but a heck of a lot more than just that. So that’s how we defined institutional it of the, and I’m totally using rounded numbers here, but of the 10, of the 11 and a quarter trillion is about evenly divided between individual investors on our platform. Self-directed. Self-directed. And well, not always. Now we have, we have a whole wealth management arm that’s all, that all feeds, not just to the individual investor side of what we do, but to in your world advisor. So advisors on our platform. So that’s about evenly split. And then, then the remainder is workplace services. So stock plans for big companies and managing, managing 4 0 1 Ks. So it’s what we, but we we’re dominated by individual investors, even on the quote institutional side, because most of the advisors on our platform manage money for individuals. Barry Ritholtz: Hmm. That’s really interesing. Liz Ann Sonders: So we would consider the advisor our client, but we’re, we’re providing a platform there for them, you guys, to advise for the most part, individual investors. Barry Ritholtz: And, and I know I’ve told you this story before, but when we launched RWM in 2013, we launched with TD — years later acquired by Schwab. Hold that aside. And we are, were very data driven. We ran a lot of analytics. And every time we didn’t win a prospect when we would go through the list of the reasons, the number one reason is, “Hey, you guys don’t custody with Schwab and my money’s at Schwab and call us if you ever decide to.” Absolutely true. And finally, we all looked at each other, Hey, there’s no reason not to open a second custodian. And so we did. And it caused a flood of new clients and new families joining us because well, well done. But, but the crazy thing is, it’s like I have never seen a financial institution with that much brand loyalty from the audience. From the clients. Because think about it, when you talk to people about Wells Fargo or Citibank or any large financial traditional bank, maybe a little bit at JP Morgan Chase, but for the most part, no one says, oh, “I don’t want to be with you. You are not affiliated with, I’m making up stuff. KeyBank.” But we just heard it so many times. It’s like, all right, you only have to hit me in the head so many times before I realized there’s a, there’s an issue here. Liz Ann Sonders: The, the power of our reputation is really extraordinary. And, Schwab dates back, you know, about 53 years. Wow. 54 years. That’s, that’s amazing. Yeah. Seventies. And, you know, Chuck has, has written about the history of Schwab and his history. His most recent book was called Invested. And it was essentially a, a memoir of, of his time in this business. And Barry Ritholtz: When you say Chuck, Liz Ann Sonders: Chuck Schwab himself, Barry Ritholtz: Chuck Schwab, who people used to think wasn’t a real guy. Liz Ann Sonders: No, it’s a real guy. The guy in the commercials is him. Barry Ritholtz: And he’s still up and about You were telling me he was, he’s just won a golf tournament at 88. Liz Ann Sonders: Yeah. Last year he won the Nantucket Golf Club. That’s unbelievable. Member, member at 87. And he almost won it again this year at at 88. So regularly shoots below his age, still a very active chair of the board. And but the, the, the culture that he has imbued in in Schwab is really second to none. And, you know, our, our sort of corporate for, for lack of a better word, tagline is through client size. And he has fostered this live, eat and breathe. Everything you do has to be from the perspective of of clients. Barry Ritholtz: So you are really the perfect person to ask a question. And I’ll ask it specifically about Schwab, but it’s obviously true about the entire industry. You’ve witnessed a shift from a lot of self-directed investors over to the advisor driven side. What has that process been like at Schwab? Liz Ann Sonders: So it’s not talking about trillions of dollars, right? Not just the advisor side, but investors at Schwab who, who want guidance, who want advice, whether it’s through advisors on our platform or directly with us on our private client side of the, the business. And it’s just the natural evolution of Schwab moving decades ago from a platform for the self-directed to a behemoth that actually provides that guidance and advice now, both directly through certain channels and indirectly through the advisor channel. Barry Ritholtz: So true or false? And, and I love this question ’cause so many people doubt it. We are today in a golden age for investing for individuals. How do you, how do you answer that? Liz Ann Sonders: Can I say yes? Yeah, Barry Ritholtz: True. Liz Ann Sonders: Just yes. No, I didn’t say true. I said yes, yes. Barry Ritholtz: its a Golden age of investing for me. Liz Ann Sonders: Well, I think it’s both true and false depending on how you define, Barry Ritholtz: Okay. Explain Golden age of investing Barry Ritholtz: Liz Ann Sonders:. I think we are, as it relates to individual investors that understand that discipline is such an important part of the process that they don’t think of getting get out as investing strategies. I, I fully agree that those are really gambling on moments in time. You wrote about it brilliantly in Well, thank you. In your book, the emotional side. Right. And so I think it’s true in the sense that a lot of those more seasoned investors that take that disciplined approach are, are more equipped now and have more access to information and guidance and when used in the right way has been to the great benefit of their success. But then you have retail traders, which I’m not here to say that they’re, you know, the ultimate contrarian indicator, but I think the perspective there is one of very short time horizons. The, you know, by the dip mentality, which, you know, to their credit, Barry Ritholtz: That works in a bull market. It works in painful bull market, very painful in a bear market. Liz Ann Sonders: But a lot of the, you know, younger retail trader that was born out of the pandemic era, it’s not that they have blinders on to the long term or the big picture, but they’ve been, they’ve been, I guess so far, anyway, to your point, properly schooled by virtue of, by the tip has worked. But I’m, I’m starting to get some anecdotal evidence that there, I, I’m not sure that there is a full understanding of what a market cycle actually looks like and that there is downside. So I, I think there, there’s more bifurcation and there’s a wider spread in terms of, of how investors are approaching the market or how traders are approaching the market. And they, they, they’re not in conflict, but they’re kind of at different ends of the spectrum from a what works, what doesn’t work, what are the benefits of taking a long-term approach, having those disciplines as opposed to just, you know, FOMO I’m in and, you know, buy every dip. Barry Ritholtz: Think about everybody who was born in the 1990s. By the time they come out of college post-financial crisis, they’ve pretty much only known right? One of the greatest rampaging bull markets in history. Liz Ann Sonders: And, and COVID was, was brutal from an economic three months and market perspective, right? But for, it was five weeks in the case of the market, right? Barry Ritholtz: Mid February To March, Liz Ann Sonders: and it was two months in the case of the recession. Right. So Barry Ritholtz: Although people still didn’t believe it throughout that summer, as, as from the March, 2020 lows till the end of the year, I think the S&P 500 was up 69%. And people fought it the whole way because their personal experience didn’t jive with what they were seeing. Liz Ann Sonders: Right, exactly. Exactly. Barry Ritholtz: In inequities, which, which is fascinating. So Schwab created the market strategist role for you, what does it mean being a market strategist? How does that differ from either a PM on the equity side or an economist more broadly? Liz Ann Sonders: Well, it, it’s certainly differentiated from a PM in that I am not, I’m not picking stocks. I’m not a trader. I don’t analyze individual stocks. So it’s, it’s purely top down 00:20:49 [Speaker Changed] In top down meaning markets economy. Yes. Do you look at sectors? Do you look at fixed income? What 00:20:56 [Speaker Changed] Comes into that? So we have my, my colleague and co-host on our on investment podcast is Kathy Jones. So she’s my counterpart on the fixed income side. She’s our chief fixed income strategist. And I, I say often it sounds like it’s jokingly, but it’s actually quite serious that I was thrilled when we brought Kathy on. ’cause then I was able to stop pretending like I was a deep dive expert in the fixed income side of things. My, my background is on the equity side of things, but what’s unique, I think about this role as it is, as it has existed in the almost 26 years that, that I’ve been at Schwab and have been in this role, is it, it blends the market analysis with the economic analysis. So we don’t have these distinct roles of chief economists and chief investment strategist. And that was always pleasing to me because I, I’m, I, I’m not sure I would either be as effective or enjoy what I do as much if I had to have my market views beholden to economic views that were completely distinct. 00:22:03 I think having that, that overlap and analysis has been a benefit. I also, because our investor base are almost all individual investors, that’s a very different audience that if you’re one of the big investment banking research wirehouse firms, a good chunk of your client base that is, that is a consumer of strategist work being institutions, I think it’s a very different animal in terms of what is valuable, what makes sense. And maybe importantly, again, in keeping with your book, you know, thinking about not just what matters, but what doesn’t matter, what shouldn’t matter. And I, I remember one of the first things that, that Chuck talked to me about 25 years ago was him not being a believer in the whole year end price target, which was music to my ears. Because I think particularly for individual investors, there’s really not that much practical value to that. It’s sort of one point in time every strategist has to adjust those forecasts constantly. It doesn’t tell you about how to manage through market cycles. It’s just one end point to one end point. And so that is certainly one of the differentiators as well, in addition to having that blended market analysis and economic analysis role, not sort of falling into the trap of the way strategists get pitted against one another. 00:23:31 [Speaker Changed] I love that you call it a trap because it’s easy to see what happens when people make a forecast like that and then they tend to marry it regardless of what data comes along. I think it was Ned Davis’ book was called Being Right or Making Money, and he explained how frequently people would just get so hung up on admitting error, right? That they would stay that’s right in the wrong position, the wrong posture, the wrong holdings, rather than admit they were wrong and adjust to whatever 00:24:06 [Speaker Changed] The data is. Yeah. And the trend, you know, one of Marty Zweig was well known for quite a, quite a bit, but you know, he coined the term Don’t Fight the Fed, but he also was known for saying the trend is your friend. And so staying in gear requires constant thinking and rethinking. In fact, I always use as an example of the perils of the year-end price target. If a strategist at the beginning of 1987 basically said the market’s gonna close pretty flat relative to where it ended 1986 by the end of the year, they were right from a point to point, however, to suggest that the market was just boring and flat all year. 00:24:48 [Speaker Changed] So there was that little hiccup in October, 00:24:50 [Speaker Changed] It was just a tiny littles hiccup. 00:24:51 [Speaker Changed] When, 00:24:52 [Speaker Changed] When was the 87 crash? That was Eptember 19th? Yeah, it was September. No, October 19th. October 19th. But there were, you know, there were warning signs and here can I tell you another funny Sure. Early story. So I started in the summer of 86 and as, and we were Marty’s side of the business, which was mutual funds, which was the Wena hedge fund, which is still ongoing onto the leadership of Joe Mena. We would be generically thought of as market timers. We were tactical asset allocators on the avatar institutional side, much more traditional market timing on the Zweig side, particularly the hedge fund. And coming into 87, we were over the cross of strategies, cross strategies were essentially fully invested, but started to get much more pessimistic about the market. In August, 00:25:43 [Speaker Changed] You had a huge run up, huge 00:25:45 [Speaker Changed] Run 00:25:45 [Speaker Changed] Up up until October, August, what was it like 30, 40%? Some crazy, 00:25:49 [Speaker Changed] I think it was more than 40 really? And so we started to adjust allocations down more extreme on the hedge fund side where Marty went, I, I think to anally a net short position 00:26:02 [Speaker Changed] And famously disgusted on Ru Kaiser 00:26:05 [Speaker Changed] The Friday night right before the crash he was on, you can YouTube it now. Yep, yep. And Lou asked him, or or made a comment, he said, Marty, you seem particularly bearish. And, and Marty was seen as this perma bear. Oh really? He was just, but he wasn’t, 00:26:24 [Speaker Changed] I know I don think of him in 00:26:25 [Speaker Changed] That way. He was just, he always was a nervous, he always had a little bit of that, that angst and that humble risk 00:26:30 [Speaker Changed] Aware. 00:26:31 [Speaker Changed] So he would at times be nervous when his view on the market was very bullish. But, so then Lou concluded the question with, do you think we have a bear market ahead of us? And Marty said, well, no, I think it’s more likely to be a crash. And I, 00:26:50 [Speaker Changed] That was Friday night, pretty 00:26:51 [Speaker Changed] Much it could happen any day. And then Monday, and then he not only said that, but then he laid out and I think it could be really ugly. But then I think we, we immediately rally off the low, but then we probably retest the low before we take off again. So here I am, less than a year in the business, we had gone from being almost fully invested in equities down to, I don’t know, 20 or 25% invested in equities. Right. Right before the crash. So the little voice in my head is thinking, what’s the big deal? Why is everybody freaking out? You just figure out before the crash that there’s going to be a crash. You move money out, right? And then you take it back in advantage of cheaper price. You put it back in easy, easy 00:27:34 [Speaker Changed] Peasy pie. Right? Right. 00:27:36 [Speaker Changed] Little did I know. 00:27:37 [Speaker Changed] And, and to just reflect how accurate zoi was, Monday down 22%, a rally that failed the next day. You didn’t quite get back down to the same 00:27:48 [Speaker Changed] Lows. You didn’t fully retest, but, but it 00:27:50 [Speaker Changed] Was pretty ugly again. But you came, you know, 22% in a day is kind excessive. 23%. 20, 22 8. If I, if 00:27:57 [Speaker Changed] All right, I’m rounding. Okay. Yes. 00:27:59 [Speaker Changed] And, and double check those numbers. I could be wrong, but, you know, portfolio insurance was a big part of that. Probably made what was a 10% correction more than double. So maybe that’s why you didn’t retest. And then it was off to the races, the race back to break even 00:28:15 [Speaker Changed] For the year. Right. And, and we had started buying after the, after the crash. So ended the year with just off the charts performance. And again, you know, naive young me is thinking, I don’t know why everybody’s freaking out, out so much. Why 00:28:28 [Speaker Changed] Are these people talking about how difficult this, it’s hard. So the obvious question, how significant was Marty to shaping your framework for understanding markets? 00:28:39 [Speaker Changed] Oh, extraordinarily impactful. Because I, I think the thing that resonated with me the most, and you wrote about it in your book, and it’s the likes of the Sir John Templeton quote about bull markets are born in pessimism, the grown skepticism, mature and optimism die on euphoria. I think that’s such a brilliant way to describe a market cycle, in part because the only terms used in there have to do with emotions. Exactly. There’s nothing in that line about market cycles that has anything to do with what we all obsess about on a day-to-day basis. Monetary policy, fiscal policy, what the next inflation report is going to be, even earnings and, and valuation. And Marty understood that too. And so much of the work that he did was steeped in that sentiment analysis. I, 00:29:20 [Speaker Changed] I love that you brought that up because I, I, so I took the technical analysis training course with Ralph Por, and I don’t really think of myself as a technician, but I certainly wouldn’t buy anything without looking at a chart. Right. It has to be a component, right? I don’t, I don’t need to see an analyst research report, but I have to at least get a sense of is it trend up? Is the trend down? Has this been going sideways for years? And the best technicians I know have always brought in behavioral economics Yes. And sentiment before we called it behavioral finances. Absolutely. And Marty certainly was one of those 00:29:56 [Speaker Changed] People. Absolutely. And so my my maybe sort of added focus on the emotional side, the sentiment side of the market very much was born out of my time working for, for Marty. And I, I still think it’s extraordinarily important. And, and one of the, the messages we always impart to our investors is ideally you don’t figure out the hard way whether there’s a wider or narrow gap between your financial risk tolerance and your emotional risk tolerance. Right? ’cause those two at times can be completely different. And I always describe financial risk tolerance as kind of what’s on the proverbial paper, right? What 00:30:36 [Speaker Changed] Can you, 00:30:36 [Speaker Changed] Your time horizon in, would you need income? What is this money for? Is it for retirement diversification, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But if you are going to, you know, panic and sell everything at the first bear market level declines in your portfolio, you’re maybe not as risk tolerant investors as you, you thought. And it’s, it’s just the vast majority of mistakes that we see. Extreme mistakes purely driven by emotion. 00:31:04 [Speaker Changed] It, you know, there’s a line I remember from when I was on a trading desk that I didn’t really understand then, but it sums up what you, that gap between your financial risk tolerance and your emotional risk tolerance, which is figure out who you are because Wall Street is an expensive place to learn. Exactly right. You don’t know who you are. You don’t know what your emotional pain allowance is. You don’t wanna panic out the word capitulation technically means surrender. So you go to a, a March oh nine, that capitulation meant people just couldn’t take the paint anymore. Make it stop. Just get me out of everything. And that’s how bottoms 00:31:44 [Speaker Changed] Are found. Can I share the March oh nine? Oh 00:31:46 [Speaker Changed] We were talking about? Yes. I, we were talking about 00:31:48 [Speaker Changed] I would love to hear that, but it, we didn’t have microphones in front of us. That’s right. So it was, let’s go back to March 6th, 2009. So I lived in Darien, Connecticut for 22 years. We raised our kids in Darien, and it’s one of the, the hotbeds of Wall Street, in fact, bedroom 00:32:08 [Speaker Changed] Community, short commute to the 00:32:09 [Speaker Changed] City, short commute to the city. Our town made the cover of business week in 2008, the latter part of 2008, as the town most impacted by the financial crisis in the country. And they did it based on the percentage of the working population that worked either on Wall Street in some capacity or in real estate. And so it was, I was surrounded by Wall Street people, not a lot of Wall Street women. It was also a town where most of the, the women who were raising kids were, were stay at home. So I was always steeped in conversation about the markets. And in the role that I had, I would always get peppered with questions. So my husband and I are at a dinner party in Dairy End. It was toward the end dinner and dessert had served maybe about a quarter of the people had left a smaller crowd just sitting around chatting. And the host of the party who was at that time, a 30 plus year veteran of Wall Street, said, Lizanne, I must say I I don’t envy you right now. And he was a bit dramatic, and he kind of paused for effect. And I said, oh, what do you mean? And he said, well, I really think that there’s no chance that the stock market ever gets to another high. I think there’s a decent chance that retail investors will never buy again. Wait, never, never, 00:33:30 [Speaker Changed] Never. Just done. 00:33:31 [Speaker Changed] Which makes me question the, the viability of a company like Schwab. And so I don’t even remember what I said. I I think I did some generic version. Well, I beg to differ, but I, I didn’t, I was also ready to leave. You know, I I, I I, I like a nine handle on my bedtime. So if it’s 1130, I’m like, okay, chop, chop. So I, I just, I, I wanted to end the night. We get in the car unprompted, I, and I haven’t had to embellish a story at all before. My husband puts a key in the car. He looked to me, he said, did you hear it? And I said, the bell ringing. Yep. He said, I knew you were thinking that. So I called my friend the next morning and I said, I am working on a report. And all of my research reports, written research reports, I use rock song titles, right. I’m a rock chick from way back. So I said, I am working on a report that I want a title. Here comes the sun. Can I share the anecdote? No 00:34:27 [Speaker Changed] Name, just the no 00:34:28 [Speaker Changed] Anecdote. I said, I’m not gonna mention name. He said, sure, I think you’re gonna regret it. Every time I see him, he does like the fist to the forehead. Like, oh my gosh. And that was when the last person is standing has gone down. Right. That is, and I think that’s inter what’s interesting about sene is we know sentiment at extremes serves as a contrarian indicator. 00:34:51 [Speaker Changed] Right. Most of the time you could pretty much ignore that middle 00:34:54 [Speaker Changed] Range without, without anything resembling precise timing. That said, as we all learned in the late 1990s, extremely optimistic sentiment can last for a really long time. Right. You know, Greenspan made as a rational exuberance comment in 96, 00:35:08 [Speaker Changed] December 96. 00:35:08 [Speaker Changed] That’s right. And it wasn’t until, you know, three plus years later that the market topped out 00:35:12 [Speaker Changed] March, 2000, almost four years. 00:35:14 [Speaker Changed] That said, when sentiment gets to such an extreme of despair, it’s not a precise contrarian timing, but there’s a narrower window. Pay 00:35:24 [Speaker Changed] Attention. 00:35:24 [Speaker Changed] Yes. Pay more attention to extremes of despair than you do extremes of enthusiasm, because the ladder can last a long 00:35:32 [Speaker Changed] Time. Tops are a process. Yes. Bottoms are a moment. Bottoms are a moment. Exactly. Absolutely. And you know, there are all these old trader cliches and stuff, but they become cliches for a reason. A reason. Absolutely. And, you know, we all experience the world in a very narrow window of 8 billion people on the planet. Our experiences are maybe 10th of a percent of what the rest of the world is experiencing. And so we tend to extrapolate out to the rest of the world. But very often what’s happening in the markets is not a reflecting your personal experience, but after you’ve lived through enough cycles, you start to be able to hear those sort of things. I had a, that was a pure death of equities business we call cover from the late seventies and a year or two later. That was it. It was the next thousand percent route 00:36:28 [Speaker Changed] Market. Yeah, 00:36:29 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. Amazing story. I 00:36:30 [Speaker Changed] Have one other anecdote that’s an interesting one to think about how emotions come into play was out in Silicon Valley area maybe about a year ago, a little less than a year ago, and heard from a client that he had finally given in to his financial consultant suggestion that he trimmed just back about 10% of his NVIDIA holdings. He was an ex-employee, had a lot just, you know, diversification, 00:36:55 [Speaker Changed] Right? We’re gonna leave some money on the table in order to reduce your drawdowns and 00:36:59 [Speaker Changed] Volatility. And he ended up splitting the difference. He didn’t wanna trim any, he trimmed 5% and then the stock went up by 20 some odd percent in the short term. And he, he was mad at the financial consultant that the stock had gone up. And to his, our financial consultant’s credit said, would you really be happier if the 95% you still own went down 20%? 00:37:22 [Speaker Changed] Listen, in the beginning of this year in video lost, but that’s psychology of its value 00:37:26 [Speaker Changed] That they, he was almost more, and he, to his credit, he said, you know what, that’s the way I should think about it. Was more concerned about the top tick, the bottom tick. Right. I trimmed it. Wasn’t I brilliant because then the stock went down 20%. So it it, our emotions play tricks on us in a lot of different directions. 00:37:43 [Speaker Changed] You, you brought up my book, I try not to talk about it on the show. It was a great book. But the regret minimization chapter Yes. Is all about your role as an individual investor is not to outperform the market, right? Or top tick or bottom tick stocks. It’s, Hey, how can you avoid making decisions that you’re gonna say 10 years later? What an idiot. I was. Right. Just, just as Charlie Munger said, what can you do to be less stupid? Right? And if, you know, we see these portfolios that started out as a million or $2 million, but through either smarts or good Luck or some combination. They had a big slug of Nvidia 10 years ago, and now they have a $20 million portfolio, 18 million of which is Nvidia. Hey, do you really wanna ride this up and down? Yeah. You’ve won 20. Yeah, exactly. Think about what $20 million in long-term investing does for you. Do you really wanna ride this down when it takes one of its regular drawdowns? And what I wanna say, it gave up about a trillion dollars in market cap this year before recovering. But 00:38:50 [Speaker Changed] Can I, can I say something else? Not, and I’m not an analyst, I don’t cover Nvidia, but the whole focus, the Uber focus on the magnificent seven, let’s just use that as an example of a cohort. So the, we’re dealing with cap weighted indexes in the case of the s and p and the, and the nasdaq. And I think one of the messages we impart to individual investors is, don’t feel like you have to have the same concentration as what’s embedded in these cap weighted indexes. That’s an institutional problem. If you’re benchmarked against the s and p on a quarterly basis, right. You are at the mercy of the construction of that index. But as a, an example of how I I describe this, Nvidia is the best performing stock within the Mag seven year to date, but it’s the 47th best performing stock in the s and p 500. Wow. It’s the number one contributor to s and p gains by cap by virtue of the multiplier of the cap size. So there’s 46 stocks in the s and p that have out, that are outperforming Nvidia this year. NVIDIA’s, I think rank number 630 something in the nasdaq. Meaning there’s 630 some odd stocks within the NASDAQ that are outperforming the best performing mag seven. So it’s the concentrate, it’s the contribution that sometimes gets conflated with the performance. 00:40:07 [Speaker Changed] I have a buddy who’s a technician who looks at a ratio of the market cap s and p versus the equal weight s and p. And what we’ve been seeing this year is the equal weight, I’m trying to remember where we are now. I haven’t looked at it recently, but when it’s going up, it’s telling you the big caps are faltering. And when the ratio is going down, it’s telling you the big caps are doing well, unless I’m, I’m doing that backwards. It depends on which one is the numerator, which one is the denominator. But clearly the outsized weight market cap wise is, is Nvidia number one or two behind Microsoft or Apple? 00:40:43 [Speaker Changed] It’s number one right now. But it’s been, you know, meta and alphabet have actually been kind of battling. But, and then also Microsoft, those are the four of the mag seven that are outperforming the s and p year to date. The other three are underperforming. And in fact, a few days ago, ’cause I tracked this on a daily basis, apple was down, I think 7% year to date that was, is its worst year to date performance. And it was the 503rd ranked contributor to the s and p. So the multiplier of cap size works in the other direction if, if you’re an underperformer as well. And a lot of people say, well, what do you mean 503? The s and p has 500 stocks, 00:41:19 [Speaker Changed] A and B shares, 00:41:20 [Speaker Changed] Google, 00:41:21 [Speaker Changed] Berk, Berkshire, you have a few big 00:41:23 [Speaker Changed] Companies like that. So 00:41:24 [Speaker Changed] That’s a great trivia question, how many company, how many stocks are 00:41:27 [Speaker Changed] In? How many stocks are in the s and p 500? And there’s also not 2000 in the Russell 2000 00:41:31 [Speaker Changed] Or the Wilshire 5,000. It’s like 3,400. 00:41:33 [Speaker Changed] Well there yeah, the WIL 5,000 used to be about 8,000 stocks, and now there’s just fewer stocks that are 00:41:39 [Speaker Changed] Publicly traded. Yep, absolutely. Coming up, we continue our conversation with Liz Ann Saunders, market strategist for Schwab, discussing the current environment. I’m Barry Riol, you’re listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. 00:42:05 I’m Barry Ritholtz, your listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. My extra special guest this week is Liz Ann Saunders. She is the Chief market strategist at Schwab, helping to oversee $11 trillion in change in client assets. So I went back and looked at my notes the last time we had a conversation like this was spring of 2024. It was six months before the election. I don’t think the election surprised many people. Right. It sort of felt like that was inevitable. Maybe that’s a little bit of hindsight bias. How has this year played out since January 20th relative to expectations? 00:42:47 [Speaker Changed] Well, you know, let, let’s focus on not so much the beginning of the year, but the setup going into April 2nd. I think that was a pivotal point because we knew tariffs were coming, but I think there was complacency as to what the announcement would be on April 2nd. An assumption that okay, 10% across the board, tariffs, it’s kind of built into expectations. 00:43:08 [Speaker Changed] You call it complacency. I, I call it a failure of imagination. Yeah. Because afterwards, a 00:43:13 [Speaker Changed] Failure to imagine the Cheesecake Factory menu being held up and reciprocal tariffs of a massive size. Right? Yeah. 00:43:21 [Speaker Changed] Right. Because you think about it, he talked about tariffs. He’s, I called himself tariff man, it’s the most beautiful in the dictionary. None of us imagined that he would just 00:43:31 [Speaker Changed] Overturn the order. And that, and that reciprocity wasn’t about tariffs that other countries had as part of their policy, but reciprocity relative to trade deficits. And the confusion that that brought about, when you think about there are many countries, particularly smaller, 00:43:47 [Speaker Changed] Vietnam is the classic example, 00:43:49 [Speaker Changed] But also, you know, the Madagascar and Bangladesh, right? We’re never going to have a trade surplus. They can’t afford, they buy teen their teeny. And in the case of, you know, a, a place like Madagascar, they produce most of the vanilla in the world that gives them literally and figuratively in industry. And they can’t afford to buy what we export, which is much more value add. So I think that was a big surprise factor. 00:44:13 [Speaker Changed] A math a, it’s effectively a conceptual math error. Yeah. 00:44:17 [Speaker Changed] And of course, running trade deficits. The other side of that is a, a capital account surplus. So we export dollars into the rest of the, the world, right? And those dollars have to be put to work and they get put in treasury 00:44:29 [Speaker Changed] Here, some paper we printed us. 00:44:31 [Speaker Changed] And so I think that became a, a significant concern. I also have been really shocked, Barry, at how the general public doesn’t understand literally who pays the tariffs. 00:44:45 [Speaker Changed] It’s a VAT tax, it’s evaluated tax on consumption’s. 00:44:48 [Speaker Changed] The first time I decided, I was speaking to an audience in Naples, Florida in the spring, that well to do audience. So assuming they have some investment expertise, but we’re not, we’re not deep in the import export business. And I decided, let me just lay out the actual definition of tariffs. I said, notwithstanding the shorthanded headlines of tariffs on China, tariffs on Mexico, fill in the blank. Tariffs are paid by the US company importing the goods. They’re not paid by the targeted country. It is not the case that, as I’ve heard from friends who didn’t understand how this worked, that in order for China to export goods into the United States, China has to pay a tariff to the United States. Barry, do you know how many people came up to me after that event and said, I had no idea. And that’s what’s a little frustrating because there’s still that shorthand. And at times when there are comments made by the administration that, you know, China, again, fill in the blank of the country, paying us more in tariffs. It’s the US company. It’s a tax on US companies. Now, a valid debate is who ultimately bears the cost and is it the exporters that will lower their price to offset the tariff that the US company has to pay? Very little indication that that is happening. And then of course it’s do companies eat it in their profit margins or do they pass it on to 00:46:09 [Speaker Changed] Consumers? But, but either way, either companies are gonna have lower profits, which means the stock market could support a lower PE multiple, or there’s only so many dollars. It’s finite. Right. If, if they’re, so what we saw, we saw this is taking place in three steps in anticipation of the tariffs going into effect. And especially with the 90 day pause on April. 00:46:31 [Speaker Changed] Well, so that was the thing that happened. 00:46:33 [Speaker Changed] So ton of excess import inventory bills 00:46:35 [Speaker Changed] In one week from April 2nd to the intraday low on April 9th. There was sort of a complete about face. So what none of us can do is try to gauge what the next social media post is going to be. Right. There’s been so many fits and starts from a tariff perspective, whether it’s delays, tariffs coming down, exceptions. This has been a, an elongated process. It was certainly wasn’t a moment in time kind of thing. But what we can analyze, especially as a, as a strategist, are the setups. So we already talked about the setup going into April 2nd. Well, the setup shifted very quickly. So you went from complacent sentiment to despairing sentiment. You, 00:47:18 [Speaker Changed] You had a VIX in the low teens that spiked up, spiked to 30, and I want, on the eighth, I wanted to buy. And I’m like, I have no idea what the hell the next tweet is gonna be. Right? Can I really put money in my personal account, put money on at risk that could be destroyed by a 00:47:35 [Speaker Changed] Tweet. But then, then you had the market, technically oversold breath had fully washed out. So then you, that was the attraction was really just incrementally positive news intraday on April 9th off to the races and off to the races, right? But then you had the power of the retail trader and that cohort has become unbelievably power powerful representing somewhere in the 20 to 25% of daily trading volume. And that by the dip mentality was such a fuel for the market. What concerns me a little bit now is if I, I track a lot of the baskets that track like micro baskets of, of stocks. Goldman has a lot of them. UBS has the meme stock basket. You go back to that intraday low on April 9th. And it’s baskets like the memes, non-profitable tech, heavily shorted stocks. That is the perfect example of retail traders kind of powering this market higher. And in the heavily shorted piece of that, it’s also suggestive maybe of retail traders with a little bit of the stick it to the man, which, which drove the initial meme stock CRAs back, back 00:48:36 [Speaker Changed] In 2021 sort of GameStop thing. 00:48:39 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And it’s, it’s alive and well again, it it, it actually has forced institutions in some cases to cover shorts, which has added to the, the fuel. Now, I think as we think about the setup, we’re arguably back in a similar pre-AP April 2nd, a bit of complacency and which may means some vulnerability to the extent you get some sort of negative 00:49:02 [Speaker Changed] Catalyst. So, so that’s where I wanted to go. Since we’re talking about the current environment. It felt like a lot of savvy companies loaded up on inventory in that 90 day pause front, ran the tariffs and Right. Exactly. And then they were capable until that ran down of not really being affected by tariffs. And then even as the tariffs started to bite, they seem, it seemed like they were eating the increase and not passing it along. But that can only go on for so long. It feels like the next phase is consumers are gonna pick it up. 00:49:38 [Speaker Changed] And to your point, Barry, there, there wasn’t much of that eating it at the early stages because of that inventory build by front running the tariffs and building inventories at a low cost basis, providing some time flexibility around when to make the decision of eating it in the profit margins or passing it on to the consumers. We’re now starting to see attempts to pass on to the consumer. But the, maybe the more interesting thing to consider right now is so much focus on goods that are impacted by tariffs. What’s the rate of inflation in those goods? Trying to gauge the tariff impact on the inflation statistics. But what we’re, we’re also starting to see is demand destruction and switching on the part of consumers. So I think we have to analyze the impact of tariffs in a parallel fashion, not just gauging what the inflation impact is. And you can do that by separating out goods and services within the goods categories of an inflation metric like CPI look at those that are directly impacted by tariffs, not impacted by tariffs, but there’s the demand destruction side of things. So we track the weekly consumer spending data, and if you separate that into tariff impacted categories, that’s where you’re seeing a compression in that spending. 00:50:54 [Speaker Changed] So to be fair, when you look at the US as a 30, $31 trillion economy, when you look at the value of imported, and, and by the way, that economy is much more services than goods oriented. And then you look at the percentage of goods that are imported, it’s a trillion or 2 trillion out of, i, I know it sounds crazy to say, yeah, what’s a trillion, but it’s a trillion out of 30 plus trillion dollars. So the worst case scenario is it, it takes a quarter or half a point outta GDP, but probably doesn’t tip us into a recession. Is that a a fair way to describe that? 00:51:30 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, in and of itself it probably doesn’t. But there’s, you know, the feedback loop that happens if company rate labor where if companies, because they don’t have that ability to pass most of it on to consumers in part because of the demand destruction that I’m talking about, then there’s that eating in profit margins. And then does that feed into the labor market side of things? I think that’s why the Fed did what it did. The risk little insurance, the risk management, the insurance cut to try to stem any weakness in the labor market. 00:51:58 [Speaker Changed] So, so let’s talk about those crosscurrents, since you do both markets and the economy. We’ve had a softening labor market at least the past few months. And then the whole, i, I don’t know if that re statement is precise, but it certainly makes it clear we were too optimistic about the labor market over the past four quarters. Inflation, sort of residual sticky inflation that hasn’t come down to the fed’s 2% target. We can argue about whether that really should be a 3% target. But hold that aside. Yet at the same time we sort see corporate profits continue to grow and markets making new all times highs, which that combination expanding profits all time price highs tends to be bullish historically. How do you navigate all of these positives and negatives? Well, 00:52:49 [Speaker Changed] Here’s one way to to think about the connectivity between the market and the economy. I think it’s very circular right now. Or maybe chicken and egg. And what does make me harken back to the late 1990s as a bit of a comp to the current environment is not so much is it a bubble? And there’s more there. There in the AI world, a 00:53:10 [Speaker Changed] Lot of revenue, a lot of process. There’s 00:53:11 [Speaker Changed] Actual denominator in the valuation equation, which not 00:53:14 [Speaker Changed] The clicks case and eyeballs, 00:53:15 [Speaker Changed] Right? Not clicks and eyeballs. Not every company just adding.com, you know, to the end of their name. But the wealth effect and it’s chicken and egg. And what makes me think back to the late 1990s is in that 99 blow off into the peak in 2000, whether it was valuation metrics like the buffet model, which looks at total market cap of all US stocks as a share of total GDP, 00:53:41 [Speaker Changed] Which is at all time highs now, 00:53:43 [Speaker Changed] Which, and way higher than it was back at the peak in 99 or 2000 at the time, households exposure to equities as a share of their financial assets. Well, at an all time high, significantly higher. So if we remember when the market topped out in March of 2000, and then we started what was a two and a half year bear market, we ended up getting a recession declared in 2001. It was a very mild recession. It was one of the proof points, which for what I always say drives me crazy that people think of recession as traditionally or classically defined as two quarters in a row of GDP. That’s never been the definition right. Of recession. Hundred percent. NBER is, that’s 00:54:21 [Speaker Changed] A pet peeve of mine 00:54:22 [Speaker Changed] As well. It drives me crazy. And in fact, oh, one with the benefit of revisions wasn’t two quarters in a row of negative 00:54:28 [Speaker Changed] GDP. That’s right. Same, same thing in 2022 people were talking about it. Right. The revision, the 00:54:33 [Speaker Changed] Revision took out that one plus quarter 00:54:36 [Speaker Changed] Plus when you have a spike in inflation, it’s not that the economy is contracting, it’s that we back out price increases. Right, exactly. The economy is so hot. Exactly. That inflation makes it look negative, right. It’s not, it’s not a contraction, it’s just a price problem. 00:54:51 [Speaker Changed] But that oh one recession was actually very mild, began 00:54:55 [Speaker Changed] In March. I think it ended in October. 00:54:57 [Speaker Changed] It ended in October, right. Short. It was mild. There were, there was not really a financial system crisis for sure. It wasn’t a credit crunch. I think it was the weakness in the stock market caused the economy to contract because of the wealth effect at the time. 00:55:12 [Speaker Changed] I’m gonna take it just a step further. I have vivid recollections of speaking to people, speaking to clients or other people’s clients in 96, 97, 98, 99, who had been in the market for 15, 20 years. Hey, we want to trade up to an ISA house. Hey, we want to buy a beach house, a lake house, a vacation property. And the person said, I’m, I’m not sure if the market’s gonna go higher from here, but I want to pull half a million outta my account and buy real estate. It’s like, Hey, you’re gonna have that house for the next 25, 30 years, even if the market keeps going higher, who cares? You’re sitting on such profits, why not? And so I kind of got a sense that it wasn’t so much the wealth effect as people had already done the big buys before the market crash, which tends to freeze people in place. Yeah. So I saw a lot of rotation out of equities just because people were sitting on, look, from 82 to 2000, the Dow gained a thousand percent. People were taking a little of the house money off the table and letting less the rest ride. And then the.com implosion, I wanna say 82, 80 3% peaked a TR on, on nasdaq. On the queues. Yeah. 00:56:33 [Speaker Changed] 57% on the s and p, you know, 00:56:35 [Speaker Changed] 80 plus percent. And the Dow held up the best because it was least exposed back then. Right, right. Least exposed that before Microsoft and Intel went 00:56:42 [Speaker Changed] Into Intel and price, weight did not cap, right? 00:56:43 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, that’s right. Yeah. So the 00:56:45 [Speaker Changed] World, so I just think we, and again, it’s a bit circular in that, you know, if and when we get another bear market, we essentially had one this year, just missed it on the s and p 00:56:58 [Speaker Changed] 19%. 00:56:58 [Speaker Changed] Think at the index level. Yeah. But the, here’s, here’s another set of statistics. The average max, the average member, maximum drawdown for the s and p year to date is 24%. Hmm. So the average member has had a bear market. Huh. That’s interesting. The average, average member within the NASDAQs maximum drawdown is 47%. Wow. Now you want 00:57:19 [Speaker Changed] Cap weighted. 00:57:21 [Speaker Changed] Well, the average member, just each individual member. So not cap weight, what was there? No, ’cause it’s individual members, right? You just track what each member maximum drawdown was at any point, and then take an average of that. But here’s the maybe more interesting one. In an environment since the April 9th intraday low, we haven’t had much of any kind of pullback in either the s and p or the nasdaq. But just since that low, in an environment where the s and p hasn’t even had a 2% pullback, the average member within the s and p since the closing low on April 8th, has had a 14% maximum draw down. Hmm. And within the NASDAQ has had a 32% maximum drawdown. Wow. So there’s a lot of rotation and churn under the surface, which you don’t pick up if you’re only focused on the index level, which has that cap bias to it. 00:58:07 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. That’s amazing. So last question before I get to my favorites. We we’re talking about a lot of things that are in the headlines. What do you think investors are not thinking about or talking about, but perhaps should be? What topics, assets, data points, you know, are getting overlooked? 00:58:26 [Speaker Changed] There was one I thought about this morning, and it’s not so much what people aren’t talking about, so I’m gonna answer in a different way. It’s what I hear a lot of people talking about that isn’t quite the right way to think about it. And that is the cash on the sidelines argument. Ugh. 00:58:41 [Speaker Changed] So it’s y hated that, and I’m not a fan either, 00:58:44 [Speaker Changed] But it often, the specificity around that has to do with the amount of money in money market, 00:58:49 [Speaker Changed] Seven point something 00:58:51 [Speaker Changed] Trillion, seven 7 trillion in change. Yeah. And that, that is sitting there as either, if not imminent, but ample fuel that if that money decides to repatriate from money markets into the equity market, boy, we go off to the races. 00:59:06 [Speaker Changed] Didn’t that money mostly come from bonds? It 00:59:08 [Speaker Changed] Did. 00:59:08 [Speaker Changed] You’re getting such low yield and bond. So my, 00:59:11 [Speaker Changed] I think a lot of it’s 00:59:12 [Speaker Changed] Sticky. My Schwab money market account last summer, so we bought a house, a beach property in February last summer. I was getting like 5 3, 5 2 in, in the Schwab, what is it? Snacks. Snacks. I don’t even remember the symbol. I’m like, why do I need to mess around with 10 or 20 year bonds when I’m getting much better? 00:59:31 [Speaker Changed] But here’s the other angle to that. If you think of $7 trillion as some massive fuel for the market, you need to look at it as a ratio relative to the total right market capitalization. And 00:59:45 [Speaker Changed] It’s gone up less than the stock 00:59:47 [Speaker Changed] Market has. It’s, it’s only 12%. The all time low in that, in the history that we have for that data is 11%. To put that in context, in oh 8, 0 9, when money was flying into money markets, because it was fleeing the equity market at the peak money market assets relative to the size of the stock market was more than 60%. Huh. 01:00:11 [Speaker Changed] That’s 01:00:11 [Speaker Changed] Huge. Now we’re only at about 12%. So the math is such that even if all $7 trillion was to leave on mass and go into the equity market as a fuel at 12% of total market cap versus say, you know, 63% of total market cap in oh nine, that’s a very different, not to mention back to our initial point, I think a lot of that money is sticky. That was money that was forced out the risk spectrum into other categories within the fixed income market in order to pick up yield when there was none to be had. So I, I don’t think we should consider that some sidelines cash that is just itching to find its way back into the riskier asset classes. 01:00:52 [Speaker Changed] Someone once debunked the cash on the sideline argument, and it might have even been Marty Sweig in winning on Wall Street by explaining it this way. Hey, I’m gonna buy a million dollars worth of stock. It means I have a million dollars worth of cash, but no stock. I buy a million of the SPY, now I have the SPY. Right? And, and, and they have a million on of cash 01:01:16 [Speaker Changed] For every buyer. There’s a seller. The 01:01:18 [Speaker Changed] The, there’s no cash on the sideline. It just changes hands. It just changes the same dollar amount. So it’s been one of those things that has persisted forever. 01:01:25 [Speaker Changed] And that also the more buyers than sellers. No, no, no, no. 01:01:29 [Speaker Changed] So that you, you are tagging all my, my favorite pet peeves. 01:01:33 [Speaker Changed] I mean, there’s maybe more enthusiasm on the buy side versus the enthusiasm, but there’s no more buyers and sellers or vice versa for every buyer 01:01:41 [Speaker Changed] That’s a seller. But my head trader used to say, there are more buyers and sellers at this level. And now you go up to the nice price next price level where there are matching number of buyers and sellers and the price stabilizes. Right. If a price is going up, okay, at that particular do at at 27 55, there may be more buyers in stock for sale. But at 27 75, then you, you’ve, that’s how you end up with price stability. So yeah. More buyers and sellers. No, no. They’re an equal amount of buyers and sellers. That’s how the other line I love has been trade takes place where there’s a disagreement about value, but an agreement on price. Hmm. And that seems to really Yeah. E explain that. Yeah. All right. I like that one. I have to get you out to, to catch your plane. So I only have you for a limited amount of time. Let’s, let’s speed through our favorite questions. Starting with, tell us about your mentors who help helped shape your career. I’m pretty sure I know the two 01:02:37 [Speaker Changed] Shocker. Marty Zweig. Yeah. Chuck Schwab. 01:02:40 [Speaker Changed] Okay. And 01:02:41 [Speaker Changed] In the world 01:02:41 [Speaker Changed] Of, by the way, not not too shabby 01:02:43 [Speaker Changed] Mentors. Right. Not too shabby mentors. Yeah. Boy was I lucky. And I will say in the world of media, another name we’ve already touched on, Louis Ru Kaiser. One of the best pieces of advice he gave me was, was one, I was on the show for the first time as a guest, and he was saying hello to me for the first time, welcomed me onto the show. This was off camera. And he asked me whether my parents were still alive and whether they were finance people. And I said, Nope, far from it. He said, okay, when you come out here and do the interview with me, get them to understand what you’re talking about. And that was such a, a moment of, okay, get people to understand what you’re talking 01:03:19 [Speaker Changed] About. That’s so funny. You say that. Great advice. You say that my mom was a real estate agent. My wife is an art teacher. And it’s always make them understand it. Yeah. Right. Don’t, don’t don’t clutter it up with jargon. That’s right. Make it hundred percent. That’s interesting that it was, it was Ru Kai who said that. Let’s talk about books. I mentioned Wags winning on Wall Street. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading right 01:03:40 [Speaker Changed] Now? So, my favorite, so I’m not reading a book right now. I, I must say I don’t have a lot of time. I read constantly. I drink from a fire hose of information, but it tends to be, you know, like reports 01:03:51 [Speaker Changed] And 01:03:52 [Speaker Changed] Analysis reports and deep dive fed research. And, but my favorite book of all time, and it is market related, is reminiscences of a Stock Operator. Sure. Absolute favorite. I I tell young people to buy it all the time. It still resonates today. And you 01:04:07 [Speaker Changed] Substitute AI for railroads and telegraphs. Exactly. And it, it’s the same story. 01:04:13 [Speaker Changed] It’s the same. It’s the same story. But I am a big podcast listener, so that’s the longer form way, including masters in business. Well, thank you that I absorb information beyond the traditional drivers that come into my inbox. Literally. 01:04:30 [Speaker Changed] It’s easy when you’re traveling, if you’re on a plane or a car. I just find it so easy. Yeah. Alright, so you told us what you’re, what po what other podcasts are you listening to? What are you watching on Hulu and Netflix or 01:04:40 [Speaker Changed] Amazon? Well, I, I listen to Masters in business. I love Grant Williams series of podcasts. I love ’em because they’re long form and they’re big picture and top down. My, my favorite non-inverting podcast is Smartless. I just love those 01:04:55 [Speaker Changed] Guys. Those guys are great. They’re 01:04:56 [Speaker Changed] Great. They’re, they’re so fun. 01:04:58 [Speaker Changed] I’m gonna tell you, I listened. I’ve had Michael Lewis on the podcast at Dawson 01:05:03 [Speaker Changed] Times. I have, I have met and have interviewed Michael Lewis on stage at Schwab’s Impact Conference. 01:05:08 [Speaker Changed] And, and the story he told, and I’m not even gonna mention it, the story he told on Smartless about a family tragedy was just, it 01:05:17 [Speaker Changed] Was unbelievable. And what Right. What his friend said to him, or his therapist said to him, the reason why you’re so exhausted after this life’s tragedy is in your mind, you’re rewriting the future without, without her. Without her. Right. It’s crazy. And that was such a, a, a moment of Wow. But yeah, that was one of the most impactful interviews 01:05:36 [Speaker Changed] I’ve heard that, that I, that stayed with me for a long time 01:05:38 [Speaker Changed] In terms of what I’m watching. Well, morning Show just started back up again. Yeah. So we get back into that four four, and I loved Department Q. 01:05:46 [Speaker Changed] So did I. That was so good. 01:05:47 [Speaker Changed] It was intense. 01:05:48 [Speaker Changed] It was a little slow, but they really, it really paid off, if you like Department Q There’s a movie, I wanna say it’s on Netflix called Black Bag. That’s the same I’ve heard about it. Same sort of I’ve heard about it. Espionage thing. Yes. Yeah. And I walked in on my wife watching Killing Eve. 01:06:10 [Speaker Changed] That was great. 01:06:11 [Speaker Changed] Which she’s like, told it was great. Like, I’m like, oh, 01:06:14 [Speaker Changed] This is Queen Gambit was great. 01:06:15 [Speaker Changed] There’s, there’s been a ton of stuff. Yeah. We, we just finished the Gilded Age, which is 01:06:19 [Speaker Changed] Oh yeah. Which, that’s 01:06:20 [Speaker Changed] Feels modern. 01:06:22 [Speaker Changed] I’m obsessed with that era in New York City. Oh really? I have every book written about it. I’m just so, so that is so right up my alley. 01:06:30 [Speaker Changed] So we watched The Crown, but we never watched Doubt Abbey. And people said, oh, loved it. Loved it. Oh, you like Gilded Age in the Crown. Doubt Abbey is, absolutely. So that’s on my, and during the Pandemic, I had never seen a single episode of Mad Men. And that was mind blowing to watch that. Yeah, that’s a good one. That felt like more like a documentary. Yeah. It’s fun 01:06:48 [Speaker Changed] To go back and watch some of the old 01:06:49 [Speaker Changed] Shows. Yeah, absolutely. All right, our last two questions. Okay. We’ll get you outta here on time. A recent college grad is interested in the career in investing or doing market strategy. What sort of adv advice would you give them? 01:07:01 [Speaker Changed] Well, the world you live in and indirectly I live in on the advisor side, that’s an incredible growth area in the broader realm of financial services, independent RIAs, wealth management firms, even the wealth management divisions at the big wirehouse firms because it’s essentially a first generation business. And so there’s a lot of succession planning happening right now. And I, I think for young investors, that’s such a great avenue to go in more generic advice that I give young people, especially as they embark on the networking and interview part of the process is be way more focused on being interested than being interesting. Hmm. Don’t go in there and say, here’s all the fabulous things have I done? Especially if it’s, that’s limited to an undergraduate education, but be interested, ask questions, be engaged, show the enthusiasm. That way you’re not bringing something into the mix by virtue of what you know, econ, you know, 2 0 8 course you took that they think, oh God, we have to hire this person. ’cause we don’t know anything about that. So we’re bringing it’s is be interested. 01:08:06 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really interesting. And our final question. What do you know about the world of investing today? You wish you knew back in the 1980s when, when you were first getting started? 01:08:17 [Speaker Changed] It, it seemed to be a little bit easier to analyze markets in that day using kind of traditional stuff. Models to think now about how much more of an influence there is of geopolitics and macro and how much more complicated an ecosystem. Not to mention the channels of information that occur through social media. I, I kind of wish it was back to what at the time didn’t feel terribly simple, but I think then was a little bit more simple and more concrete in terms of what drives markets. I think there’s more psychology now with a wider band of what that means and what that represents. And it would’ve been interesting to kind of know that in advance the little birdie landing on your shoulder saying here, here’s what, here’s what I don’t know. If I would’ve believed that 40 years from that point, I’d still be doing this, but just how much more complex an ecosystem that the markets live in these days. Huh. 01:09:19 [Speaker Changed] Really interesting. Lizanne, as always delightful. Thank you so much for being 01:09:23 [Speaker Changed] So generous 01:09:24 [Speaker Changed] With your time. My pleasure. Always really, really interesting. We have been speaking with Liz Ann Saunders. She is the Chief investment strategist at Schwab, helping to oversee $11 trillion in client funds.

Reuters 28/10/2025 09h41 • Atualizado 1 dia atrás 28/10/2025 09h41 • Atualizado 1 dia atrás Publicidade (Reuters) – Os Estados Unidos continuarão a atrair a grande maioria dos fluxos de investimento e os riscos de uma desaceleração na maior economia do mundo são exagerados, disseram chefes de algumas das principais empresas financeiras em uma conferência na Arábia Saudita nesta terça-feira. Os mercados acionários dos EUA atingiram recordes de alta, à medida que enormes somas de dinheiro são investidas no país para apostar na IA, levando alguns executivos e banqueiros centrais a alertar sobre riscos crescentes de uma bolha e de uma correção do mercado. Outros investidores se preocupam com a crescente dívida do governo sob o comando do presidente Donald Trump e com o impacto de suas tarifas comerciais. Ainda assim, executivos da Future Investment Initiative (FII), em Riad, passaram a maior parte do tempo falando com entusiasmo sobre perspectivas para os EUA, dizendo que o país se compara favoravelmente à Europa e a partes da Ásia. O presidente-executivo da BlackRock, a maior administradora de ativos do mundo, disse que o dinheiro tem voltado para os Estados Unidos principalmente nos últimos dois meses, revertendo uma saída de ativos em dólares no início do ano. “A maioria dos investidores globais tem um grande excesso de peso nos EUA e esse é o lugar para manter seu excesso de peso nos próximos 18 meses”, disse Larry Fink. Continua depois da publicidade O presidente-executivo do Goldman Sachs, David Solomon, disse que a “grande maioria da alocação de capital” está em ativos em dólares e que não há um catalisador óbvio para uma desaceleração econômica nos Estados Unidos nos próximos 6 a 12 meses. O presidente-executivo da Blackstone, Stephen Schwarzman, disse estar confiante de que os EUA e a China farão um progresso significativo para a conclusão de um acordo comercial, com Trump se reunindo com o primeiro-ministro chinês nesta semana. O fundador da Pershing Square Capital Management, Bill Ackman, minimizou preocupações com os níveis de endividamento do governo dos EUA, destacando a força e a escala dos ativos do governo, enquanto todos se concentram em seus passivos.

Title: Michael Dell’s son aims to transform the home power business by selling electricity and backup battery power like a Costco membership
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/10/28/michael-dell-son-zach-base-power-electricity-backup-battery-power-costco-membership/
Time Published: 2025-10-28T12:30:00Z
Full Content:
Jordan Blum is the Energy editor at Fortune, overseeing coverage of a growing global energy sector for oil and gas, transition businesses, renewables, and critical minerals. Zach Dell watched his father Michael become one of the richest men in the world building a home computing and tech empire, and now he’s aiming to revolutionize the home electricity business with his Base Power. Austin, Texas-headquartered Base, which just completed a $1 billion fundraising round in October, takes the “Costco membership” route by offering a one-stop shop for the home: electricity and a backup-power solution courtesy of a battery storage system, not a standard gas generator. “We’re addressing a very acute problem that consumers face, which is that electricity has gotten more expensive and less reliable,” Zach Dell, 29, told Fortune. “It’s totally crazy if you think of all the things that have gotten better over the last decade, and our power has gotten noticeably worse. Batteries, paired with software and a unique business model, can make your power more reliable and less expensive.” U.S. power demand is rapidly rising thanks to the AI boom and, when coupled with aging grid infrastructure and rising occurrences of wildfires and natural disasters, backup power is becoming more desirable for many homeowners. Base’s business model offers standard retail electricity, a monthly membership fee of $19, and a leased battery system for a one-time cost of $695—as opposed to a whole-home, backup generator system that can cost upward of $15,000. Base customers may pay more per month because of the membership fee, which covers ongoing services and software battery power management, but they avoid paying the massive one-time cost of a whole-home generator system. “We’re just dramatically more affordable. Do you want the Lamborghini or the [Toyota] Corolla?” Dell said. “We make a product that is reliable, it’s safe, it’s affordable. It’s really a mass-market product. The other companies in the space are selling a premium product to very wealthy folks. Our product is more designed for the mass market.” His Dell Technologies founder and CEO father, Michael, is not involved in Base. Top investors include the venture capital firm Addition, Thrive Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Andreessen Horowitz, Alphabet’s CapitalG, and many more. Thus far, Base only operates in Texas, including the Austin, Houston, and Dallas regions. But Base, which was founded in 2023, is pivoting from startup mode to ramped-up growth mode, and the tentative plan is to begin expanding outside of Texas in 2026, Dell said. “We have this big, fast-growing business in Texas,” Dell said, “but the long-term ambition is to bring Base to every household in America.” Base Power has deployed over 100 megawatt-hours of residential battery capacity and is building its first battery factory in downtown Austin. A second factory is planned as well. The vertical integration model will further drive costs down over time, Dell said. “The capital will really be used to invest in this vertical integration strategy and get to scale so we can deliver the most affordable product on the market,” he said. “This is our first-generation [battery] product. As we come out with new versions of the product, prices will go down because our economics will get better.” While Michael Dell is not directly involved in Base, he does regularly offer business advise to his only son, who seemingly inherited the entrepreneurship gene. “He’s an extremely valuable mentor” Zach Dell said. “I’m inspired by him not because of how much money he’s made or the stock price, but because of the joy it brings him to build something and to solve hard problems and work on interesting puzzles. I’m very lucky that I get to spend my days solving really hard and complicated puzzles with smart people.” Zach Dell grew up in the Austin area before attending the University of Southern California. He dabbled in startups before joining Blackstone and then working at Thrive Capital. He started to study energy markets and saw the energy transition moving toward solar power coupled with battery storage. Dell said Base is focusing on battery storage in part because the technology is advancing, it’s scalable, and it’s easy to install for homeowners. And the stored power in the battery keeps your home powered when outages occur. A second battery is offered at a deeply discounted rate for larger homes. Prices are kept relatively lower because, when your power is working normally, the battery can store power and then provide electricity back to the grid when demand is at its highest. In the event of a prolonged power outage, Base customers can even buy a smaller, roughly $500 generator to power just the battery system if it runs out of juice on its own. “With that integration, it’s effectively an infinite backup product,” Dell said. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Check out the five favored candidates, including a big Wall Street name. Rundown But first, step up and spin the market wheel. Love Business Insider? Log into Google and make us a preferred source. Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up now Market musings In the market, entire weeks can pass without any real catalyst. Inspiration can run thin, which can lead to traders talking themselves into tepid moves based on minimal information. This is definitely not one of those weeks. In fact, every single one of the four main narratives is in play concurrently, setting up an unpredictable period of trading. After all, the market is not a kung-fu movie, dispatching developments in orderly fashion, one at a time. It's more like John Wick, with complications constantly coming from all angles, often multiple at once. Let's recap the landscape, and how each driver could shape markets in the near term: Catalyst 1: The Fed The next FOMC meeting kicks off today, with the culmination on Wednesday, when the central bank announces its latest interest-rate decision. The Fed is overwhelmingly expected to cut rates by 25 basis points, followed by a press conference from Chair Jerome Powell. What could happen: A single rate cut is priced in with 98% certainty, so any volatility will result from Powell's comments. If he laments that inflation is peskily high, that could dent rate-cut hopes and send stocks lower. But if he complains about any other struggling economic force — like the labor market — that could stoke expectations of more aggressive cuts, giving stocks a boost. Catalyst 2: AI fever The latest big development in this space came on Monday as Qualcomm threw its hat in the ring by announcing new chips and computers. This sent the company's stock surging (see below) and lifted chip names overall. Another week, another shuffling of major AI players — and this time OpenAI wasn't even involved. What could happen: Even if the Qualcomm-adjacent stock moves are limited to a single day, the company's announcement further raises investor antennae for new products and cross-company collaborations — all of which have been rocket fuel for associated stocks. Catalyst 3: Earnings season This week is as big as it gets. Across Wednesday and Thursday, the following mega-cap tech giants report: Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple. That's 25% of the S&P 500 right there. What could happen: At risk of stating the obvious, strong results should lead to stock gains. The question then becomes: what constitutes "strong"? For this group, which is enmeshed in the AI race, strength can be defined in a couple ways, namely: (1) better-than-expected future earnings forecasts and (2) tangible results of massive AI spending. Catalyst 4: Trade progress This is last chronologically, but certainly not least, since a reported US-China treaty was the main source of record highs for stocks on Monday. The main event comes on Thursday, with Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping set to meet. What could happen: Looking at the index level, trade-war progress is unabashedly positive. Fewer tariffs and more global collaboration is a good thing, especially for US exporters. At the sector and single-stock level, it's a bit more unpredictable, although there has been an unwinding of trades that benefited from US-China gridlock. For instance, safe-haven assets like gold and US Treasurys gave up some gains on Monday, while US-affiliated rare-mineral stocks took a tumble. Expect this to continue if further progress is solidified. Let's play a game: Can you tell the exact moment that Qualcomm announced its new lineup of semiconductor chips, with the intention of challenging Nvidia? All kidding aside, this was a momentous moment not just for the share price, but for the whole AI race broadly. While Qualcomm is a comparatively late entrant to the battle for AI supremacy, the company argues that its existing mobile technology will differentiate its chips. The market certainly seemed to agree, lifting shares 11% on the day, up 22% at intraday highs. Interestingly, Nvidia didn't take a dive on the increased competition, and was instead pulled higher alongside other chipmaker stocks. Even when someone comes at the king, the king still wins. Today's chart comes from Torsten Slok, the chief economist at Apollo. It shows that the US currently has more data centers built than all other major countries combined. It has 5,425, more than 10 times Germany, which is in a distant second place. "The bottom line is that the rest of the world is far behind the US when it comes to AI," Slok wrote. Be sure to browse Business Insider's interactive map, which shows where data centers are all across the US. And check out the full investigation here. Business Insider's Will Edwards highlights investing recommendations pegged to the biggest trends in markets. There's been plenty of recent chatter — and debate — about a potential AI bubble. Lance Roberts, the CIO at RIA Advisors, is leaning into the "not a bubble" narrative. He says the next few months are actually a good time to buy mega-cap tech stocks leading the AI trade, and he offers three main reasons why. The first is earnings, with Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple scheduled to report this week. "They should all be good because we came into the earnings season with estimates brought down a bit," Roberts told BI about the bevy of tech stocks reporting. Second is buybacks, which have historically been a way for companies to engineer stock gains and signal to investors that they think their stock is affordable. Repurchases are up 16% year-over-year, and companies that do them have been rewarded, Goldman Sachs data shows. "We're going to have about $6 to $7 billion a day in corporate buybacks starting in early November," Roberts said. "That's going to provide an uplift." Third, he points out that discretionary traders from institutions like hedge funds are underweight tech stocks at the moment. Roberts thinks their re-entry can fuel a rebound. "There's going to be a catch-up run, particularly in AI, as we approach the year-end reporting period," he said. For investors looking to follow his advice, funds like the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (MGK) and the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) offer exposure to mega-cap tech names. We're maintaining the First Trade index, an equal-weighted basket of five stocks that will be adjusted each week. After one rebalancing, we ended up with this group: Amazon, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan, Microsoft, and Tesla. Each week, you'll vote one stock out, and one in. Last week we added Tesla, and this week we'll be sliding in Nvidia. It doesn't have earnings this week, but it's wildly popular with retail traders and has been absolutely scorching for the past few years. Its inclusion will come at the expense of J&J, which will be removed. And with that, our portfolio has gotten even more tech-heavy, and more levered towards the AI theme that's ruled markets. How will it work out? Check back next Monday, Nov. 3, for an update. The First Trade team: Joe Ciolli, executive editor and anchor, in Chicago. Akin Oyedele, deputy editor, in New York.

October 28, 2025 05:35 ET | Source: MOVA MOVA DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, Oct. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- At the Palazzo Versace Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, MOVA successfully hosted the “Vision 2030: Global Digital Economy & Brand Excellence Summit.” Distinguished guests attending the summit included:Mr. Mohammed Al Ahbabi from the UAE Ministry of Economy and Tourism;Mr. Shehab Bin Nouri from the Al Maktoum Royal Family Private Office;Mr. Khalifa Al Mazrouei from UAE Capital Group;Mr. Peter Hacham, representative of Mubadala’s Hub71 sovereign fund;Professor Peter Knez, former Investment Director at BlackRock (USA) and Chairman of Palm Global (Abu Dhabi);Mr. Samir M. Suleymanov from the World Bank’s New Economy Industry Department;Ms. Nancy Guan, Secretary-General of the International Olympic Arts Development Committee;Mr. Eric Lee, CEO of Bithumb (Korea Exchange);Mr. Bobby Zhou, Co-founder of Aqua Labs;and Ms. Christina Wang, Chief Representative of PIF China. (USD1SWAP members with Bithumb CEO Eric Lee) The summit brought together global industry leaders, capital institutions, and technology innovators to discuss the future of RWA (Real World Asset) tokenization, public blockchain ecosystems, and brand digitalization. Beyond exploring global trends in the digital economy, the event also provided an important platform for USD1SWAP and the MOVA ecosystem to showcase their latest developments. USD1SWAP: Bridging the Real and Digital Asset Worlds As a key player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, USD1SWAP became one of the highlights of the event. USD1SWAP’s Chief Marketing Officer, Smith, delivered a keynote speech elaborating on the project’s strategic positioning within the global digital economy—particularly focusing on liquidity solutions and decentralized financial infrastructure built on the MOVA blockchain. Smith emphasized that USD1SWAP aims to provide a secure and transparent channel for global asset exchange through innovative cross-chain liquidity protocols and intelligent risk control systems. “In the future, USD1SWAP will be more than just a decentralized trading platform—it will become a vital bridge between traditional finance and the Web3 world,” said Smith. As a major application on the MOVA chain, USD1SWAP is driving the tokenization of real-world assets, opening new possibilities for the circulation of digital assets worldwide. Global Collaboration in RWA Tokenization and Brand Digitalization The summit centered on two major themes: RWA tokenization and brand digital transformation—both of which align with USD1SWAP’s long-term strategic direction. Smith noted that as stablecoin models and cross-chain technologies mature, traditional assets such as real estate, energy, and commodities are entering a new era of digital transformation. “Digital assets are no longer confined to cryptocurrencies—they are increasingly linked to real-world asset value, forming an entirely new global capital structure,” Smith explained. Through its RWA on-chain protocol, USD1SWAP enables liquidity and value mapping for real assets, helping traditional financial assets transition smoothly into the decentralized digital economy. This strategy complements the MOVA ecosystem, jointly advancing asset digitalization and public blockchain development—ultimately creating a seamless, secure cross-chain value exchange network for users worldwide. MOVA: Strategic Partnership Empowering USD1SWAP’s Growth As a core component of the MOVA blockchain, USD1SWAP collaborates closely with MOVA on asset mapping, cross-chain liquidity, and brand digitalization initiatives. MOVA CEO Wael Muhaisen also delivered an inspiring address at the summit, highlighting the pivotal role of the MOVA chain in advancing decentralized finance and brand ecosystems. Wael noted that MOVA is not just a smart contract platform—it is the foundational engine for global decentralized asset exchange and ownership verification. The distinguished guests at the summit discussed the latest trends in RWA tokenization and cross-chain liquidity in the global financial market, offering strategic insights and validation for the USD1SWAP and MOVA ecosystems. By fostering deep integration among global capital markets, governments, and technology sectors, USD1SWAP is not only laying the technological groundwork for decentralized finance but also providing strong momentum for the convergence of capital and innovation. About Mova Mova is a next-generation blockchain engineered for high performance, institutional-grade trust, and a versatile modular architecture — setting the new standard for compliant and scalable Web3 infrastructure.

Title: Here’s What Trump’s Ballroom Donors Want

Full Content:
The cost of Donald Trump’s garish ballroom that’s replacing the East Wing of the White House keeps increasing, from $200 million to $300 million and now $350 million in a matter of days. That’s because the cost of construction isn’t nearly as important as having an inventory of donations available for corporate America to pony up. These contributions—or if you prefer, bribes—work in two directions. One, they represent cash that companies can give to secure favors from the government. Two, they serve as a disciplining function from Trump: People giving to his ballroom can’t easily speak out against his abuses of power. It’s no real surprise that the formal editorial page of The Washington Post offered a limp defense of the ballroom, when the company founded by the Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos, is one of the donors. The White House has said it would allow ballroom donors to remain anonymous, but they’re the ones who put out all the names of the donors. The double game of bribery and disciplining only works if the names are public, and it certainly wouldn’t do for Trump to pay for his own ballroom out of a $230 million extortion from the Justice Department; that wouldn’t leave any room to demand tribute from the corporate sector. More from David Dayen The result is among the most corrupt displays in American history, with a president agreeing to do corporations’ bidding in exchange for financing a personal shrine and staying aligned for the duration of his presidency. We’ve seen other instances of personal self-aggrandizement and favor-trading, from pardoning convicted felons who partner with his crypto company to handing out contracts to businesses linked to his family to letting personal friends and patrons fund the Defense Department. (That’s all just in the last week!) But the ballroom is literally being built on a foundation of corruption, as a monument to it, on the very grounds of the White House. Which raises the question: What do all these companies in on the ground floor, so to speak, really want? Most of the companies that officially donated to the Trump ballroom have been in the Prospect’s crosshairs for some time, and in going back through our archives we can divine why they’re debasing themselves to play this corrupt game. Here’s a rundown: The first thing that jumps off the page is that the nation’s five largest tech companies—Google, Amazon, Meta, Apple, and Microsoft—are all on the donor list. Google’s money comes from a settlement with Trump for taking him off YouTube after January 6th. Even before this, Trump had been the tech industry’s personal lobbyist abroad, shaking down foreign nations to drop their taxes and regulations on U.S. tech firms in trade deals. Trump’s attorney general was an Amazon lobbyist. And he exempted Apple from tariffs after getting a ridiculous statue from CEO Tim Cook. So why are these firms giving cash to someone who already is serving them well? That’s simple: ongoing maintenance. Google has been found liable for being a monopoly on multiple occasions in Justice Department cases; there’s an imminent ruling on its advertising technology business after Obama-appointed judge Amit Mehta delivered a light remedy on Google’s search monopoly. Meta recently wrapped up a trial in a monopolization case against the Federal Trade Commission, and a ruling is expected shortly; Apple and Amazon face monopolization lawsuits against the government as well, and Apple has lost private antitrust litigation. All of these cases could be withdrawn or settled by the president. In addition, all of these companies are spending fantastic sums in the global AI race. They need a government that will weaken state regulations and allow data centers to be built nationwide, as well as being willing to provide a backstop if the AI stock bubble collapses. (NextEra Energy, which is also a donor, is resurrecting an Iowa nuclear facility to power a Google data center; it will help to have the government in its corner.) There’s evidence that Meta’s appeasement of the Chinese government actually facilitated that country’s AI developments; Apple is exposed on aiding Chinese tech’s superpower status as well. Buying Trump’s loyalty helps him overlook these betrayals. Finally, Amazon is in the midst of trying to get the National Labor Relations Board declared unconstitutional, and wants to keep the Trump administration out of that fight. Like with Big Tech, the crypto industry has already made its purchase of the inner sanctums of the government. Trump is literally a crypto mogul; his administration is allowing crypto in 401(k) plans and potentially as collateral for mortgages; nearly all of the overlapping civil and criminal investigations against crypto companies have been withdrawn; and Congress passed a stablecoin law that eases up on regulation and could facilitate private currencies. It is party time in the crypto world. Among the ballroom donors are Coinbase, Ripple, and Tether. Among individual donors are the Winklevoss twins, who own the crypto exchange Gemini, and Charles Cascarilla, CEO and co-founder of blockchain infrastructure firm Paxos. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is also a donor; he made his fortune running Cantor Fitzgerald, which was the banker for Tether. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. Again, this is about ongoing maintenance and future results. Coinbase and Ripple have been among the largest crypto spenders in politics since the 2024 elections. The Winklevoss twins recently interceded to get Trump to change his choice to run the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which the industry wants to become the lead digital assets regulator. But they need market structure legislation to make that happen, and Congress is in turmoil. Spending on the ballroom could be a way to go back to Trump and get him to pressure his Republican underlings to pass what the industry wants. Crypto titans also want the barely-alive Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to make it easier for customers to move their money out of banks and to their apps; that requires more quid pro quo relationships with D.C. power brokers. It may have been jarring to see printer manufacturer Hewlett-Packard on the list. It’s a pretty Democratic firm in terms of campaign spending. But one of its business lines, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, has been in the news lately. HPE successfully got a merger approved with Juniper Networks that the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division initially challenged. It turned out that HPE paid MAGA lobbyists to get top DOJ officials to overrule the Antitrust Division, in what ousted Antitrust Division officials later described as rank pay-to-play corruption. There’s likely to be a forthcoming judicial proceeding about the merger, which could reveal some very unseemly things about HPE. They’re likely paying Trump to try to keep a lid on this scandal. In addition, HPE’s dominance in enterprise networks could see them soar in the data center building boom, so keeping Trump happy makes sense there as well. Separately, Blackstone, the private equity firm run by ballroom donor Stephen Schwarzman, just announced an $18.3 billion deal alongside TPG to take mammogram rollup Hologic private, which presumably Schwarzman wants the government to approve. One decidedly old-school donor on the list was Union Pacific. But in July, the company announced a historic $85 billion proposed merger with Norfolk Southern, which would for the first time in American history put one company in control of a railroad that can travel coast-to-coast. Even Jay Gould couldn’t get a single transcontinental railroad done during the first Gilded Age. But Union Pacific’s dream would touch 43 states, and end the gentlemen’s agreement whereby two Eastern and two Western railroads split up the country. That merger needs to be approved … by the Trump administration’s Surface Transportation Board. So you get the picture here. Throwing down millions of dollars for a ballroom is a small price to pay for monopolizing freight rail commerce. One old-school member of the military-industrial complex showed up on the list, as did one new-school member. Lockheed Martin is in line for at least some of the hundreds of billions of dollars in new contracts available after Congress topped up military spending in the Big Beautiful Bill. Palantir thinks it can get a substantial share of that money as part of the defense tech push, as well as funding for surveillance operations at the border. Meanwhile, national-security contractor Booz Allen Hamilton gave to the ballroom, an indicator of the continuing drift of rule by contractor in the Trump era. Sharp-eyed Prospect readers were sure to notice the presence of José and Emilia Fanjul on the list. The Fanjul dynasty, as we reported last month, has been a dominant fixture in American life since the 19th century, cleaning up in the sugar industry with favorable rules and tariff structures and the like. When Trump secured a deal with Coca-Cola to produce their soft drink with cane sugar, he was enriching the Fanjuls. And keeping sugar flowing from their plantation in the Dominican Republic that employs something approaching forced labor, which Trump secured with a quiet regulatory change this year, is a top priority. There are a few individual donors who are closely associated with the companies they run. Stephen Schwarzman and Blackstone have tons of business before the federal government, from housing to AI, and Pam Bondi was also that company’s lobbyist. The Adelson family has essentially dictated Trumpian policy in the Middle East. Fracking mogul Harold Hamm is a close associate of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and helped map out the administration’s energy policy. A little extra for the ballroom helps keep that on the right path. It was interesting to see cigarette manufacturers Altria and R.J. Reynolds International on the list. Cigarette companies’ stocks did fall when Trump’s Food and Drug Administration kept e-cigarettes on shelves in July. Altria once had a significant investment in Juul, the top e-cigarette maker, but divested in 2023. So maybe this is just a pitch for Big Sin to get back in the game with the administration. Less puzzling is the role of Caterpillar, the farm machinery manufacturer. Trouble in the agricultural sector is a direct threat to Caterpillar’s bottom line; a little investment in Trumpian relations to get better outcomes than a farm bailout (whereby farmers are paid not to produce, and therefore not use Caterpillar equipment) is in order. Caterpillar also has a big plant in Mexico that has been alleged to have committed significant labor violations; maybe this is buying off Trump to look the other way at an America Last company. Finally, your guess is as good as mine as to why Hard Rock International appears here. Maybe Trump has an old friend at Hard Rock from his casino days; or maybe Hard Rock wants the concession contract, or a few slot machines in the gilt-edged foyer. But there’s one more option; Hard Rock is among the firms trying to win a New York City license to install a casino in one of the five boroughs. Trump doesn’t have much clout in New York, but I guess every bit of leverage helps, should Trump decide to trade funding for a rail tunnel for a casino license for his favorite pals.

Title: The Next Chapter For Crypto: Legislative Clarity, Institutional Support Set Stage For Major Growth

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The crypto market, despite experiencing throughout the year major price fluctuations, security incidents, and legal hurdles, has experienced remarkable growth. This can be attributed to the expansion of digital asset treasuries (DATs), increased institutional adoption, and new initiatives aimed at integrating digital assets, particularly stablecoins, into traditional financial sectors. Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) recently shared their projections for the crypto landscape for the remainder of the year and years to come, highlighting nine key trends expected to be major catalysts for the industry. Firstly, market structure legislation in the US is expected to emerge as a critical priority for policymakers and Congress, establishing a clear regulatory framework that supports crypto developers. The passage of the GENIUS Act in July of this year also marked a pivotal moment, garnering bipartisan support and providing builders with much-needed certainty in their endeavors. Secondly, the adoption of stablecoins is set to accelerate as network effects take hold among financial institutions, merchants, and consumers, thereby enhancing the global standing of the US dollar. Furthermore, major players like JPMorgan, Citi, BlackRock, and Fidelity are amplifying their crypto offerings through new product launches, partnerships, and acquisitions. The infrastructure supporting blockchain technology is also advancing rapidly. Current networks can process over 3,400 transactions per second, marking a 100-fold increase over the past five years. Moreover, a new wave of real-world assets (RWAs) is transitioning onto the blockchain as the worlds of crypto and traditional finance converge. The market for tokenized real-world assets has expanded to nearly $30 billion, with significant contributions from Treasuries, money market funds, and private credit. In parallel, the crypto sector is attracting a growing pool of talent, driven by a more favorable regulatory environment and the emergence of new opportunities for developers. The focus on revenue generation is also shifting within the token ecosystem. More tokens are implementing fee mechanisms, redirecting attention toward fundamental value. In the past year, users have paid $33 billion in fees, resulting in $18 billion for projects and $4 billion for token holders. Innovative consumer products are also expected to drive the next wave of crypto adoption. Although approximately 716 million people now own cryptocurrency, only 40 to 70 million are considered active users. Ultimately, 2025 is poised to lay the groundwork and establish the foundations for the years to come. It is expected to be a transformative year for the crypto industry, characterized by widespread institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and tangible utility.

Title: The Reason Caterpillar's Stock Is 'Priced for Perfection'—And Beating Nvidia in 2025

A company known for its distinctive yellow construction equipment and its iconic logo has become an AI darling. Yes, we mean Caterpillar (CAT)—which through Monday's close has the best-performing stock in the Dow, ahead of companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT), thanks to an AI-driven metamorphosis. Caterpillar has lately seen stalling earnings growth in 2025, with its past two quarterly reports missing expectations. Still, its shares are up more than 45% year-to-date, more than the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund's (XLI) 18% gain, the S&P's 17%, and Nvidia's 38%. And when Caterpillar reports third-quarter earnings pre-market tomorrow morning, investors are likely to focus on a key driver of its future growth: data centers' surging demand for electricity. That trend is shifting the spotlight to Caterpillar's energy and transportation segment from its construction and resources segments, which have been challenged. The latter—bulldozers, excavators, and mining trucks—will "take a backseat" as the former—backup and primary power generation sets, solar turbines, and gas pipelines—drives earnings in the coming years, according to BofA Global Research analysts, who have a "buy" rating on the stock. The E&T segment accounts for roughly 40% of Caterpillar's sales, according to BofA. Businesses within the segment, including its power generation business, "continue to outgrow the overall business," Bank of America wrote in June. Last year, E&T chipped in about $29 billion of the company's roughly $65 billion in total sales, more than either of the construction and resources units. Caterpillar's stock has been a beneficiary of investor penchant for AI-themed investments. Its next earnings report, due Wednesday morning, will be the latest opportunity for investors to determine whether the company's data center power-play narrative can endure. Can the stock keep rising? Morgan Stanley analyst Angel Castillo recent said Caterpillar shares, sitting near all-time highs, were "priced for perfection." Wall Street analysts, on average, have a price target of about $497, 6% below Monday's close of $527. More evidence of an oversupplied construction market and the firm's cautious views on non-residential construction activity, Castillo said, will put pressure on its construction segment. Without strength in other segments to offset that weakness, he said, there's the risk of negative earnings revisions. Still, growth in E&T could be a potent mood booster. "Any amount of sequential growth is enough to keep sentiment positive," he wrote in a report last week. The firm has a bearish rating on the stock.

Stocks rallied to more records Monday ahead of a week packed with potentially market-moving events. The S&P 500 rose 83.47 points, or 1.2%, to 6,875.16. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 337.47 points, or 0.7%, to 47,544.59. The Nasdaq composite rose 432.59 points, or 1.9%, to 23,637.46. Stocks also climbed to strong gains in Asia ahead of a meeting on Thursday between the leaders of the United States and China. The hope is that the talks could clear rising tensions between the world's two largest economies, the AP reports. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said there's "a framework" for President Trump and Xi Jinping to discuss at their meeting, while Trump said, "We feel good" about working things out with China. Keurig Dr Pepper climbed 7.6% Monday after reporting profit for the latest quarter that matched analysts' expectations. The company behind Canada Dry and Green Mountain coffee said it benefited from higher prices for K-Cup products, among other things. Some of Wall Street's most influential stocks are set to report their results this week, including Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft on Wednesday, and Amazon and Apple on Thursday. They'll need to deliver big growth and justify big spending underway in artificial-intelligence technology.

Worries have been rising that AI may be in the midst of a bubble, similar to the dot-com bonanza that ended up bursting in 2000. Nvidia's stock is up 42.3% for the year so far, for example, and Qualcomm soared 11.1% Monday after unveiling AI products for data centers Announcements of mergers and buyouts also helped move stocks on Monday. Cadence Bank rose 4.4% after Huntington Bancshares said it would buy the bank with locations across Texas and the South for $7.4 billion in stock. Huntington fell 2.7%. Avidity Biosciences leaped 42.4% after Novartis agreed to buy the biopharmaceutical company based in San Diego for $12 billion, after Avidity spins off its early-stage precision cardiology programs.

October 27, 2025 15:00 ET | Source: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. News Highlights SANTA CLARA, Calif., Oct. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) today announced two next-generation systems at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) designed to expand America’s leadership in artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC), the Lux AI supercomputer and the Discovery supercomputer. Discovery and Lux will be DOE flagship supercomputers designed to drive breakthroughs in science, energy, and national security. Both systems directly support the U.S. AI Action Plan by accelerating AI-enabled science, strengthening national competitiveness, and advancing secure, sovereign AI infrastructure for the nation. Together with the U.S. government, ORNL and industry partners, AMD will deliver advanced computing platforms that help national researchers, agencies, and innovators tackle pressing challenges in energy, medicine, health, and national security. When fully deployed, the Lux and Discovery systems will represent a combined $1billion investment of private and public funding which will enable the DOE to build a secure, federated and standards-based infrastructure for sovereign U.S. AI and science. “We are proud and honored to partner with the Department of Energy and Oak Ridge National Laboratory to accelerate America’s foundation for science and innovation,” said Dr. Lisa Su, chair and CEO, AMD. “Discovery and Lux will leverage AMD’s high-performance and AI computing technologies to advance the most critical U.S. research priorities in science, energy, and medicine – demonstrating the power of public-private partnership at their best.” The Lux AI supercomputer – co-developed by ORNL, AMD, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and HPE and powered by AMD Instinct™ MI355X GPUs, AMD EPYC™ CPUs and AMD Pensando™ advanced networking technologies – will be deployed in early 2026, making it the first US AI Factory supercomputer setting the stage for novel public and private partnerships. The Lux system will address the immediate needs to expand the DOE’s AI leadership and accelerate progress and innovation in the areas of AI, energy research, materials, medicine and advanced manufacturing. The Discovery supercomputer deepens the collaboration between the DOE, ORNL, HPE and AMD. At the heart of Discovery are next-gen AMD EPYC CPUs, codenamed “Venice,” and AMD Instinct™ MI430X GPUs— a new MI400 Series accelerator engineered specifically for sovereign AI and scientific computing. MI430X extends the leadership AMD architecture for AI and HPC, enabling the U.S. to train, simulate, and deploy AI models on domestically built systems that protect national data and scientific competitiveness. “Winning the AI race requires new and creative partnerships that will bring together the brightest minds and industries American technology and science has to offer,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. “That’s why the Trump administration is announcing the first example of a new commonsense approach to computing partnerships with Lux. We are also announcing, as part of a competitive procurement process, Discovery. Working with AMD and HPE, we’re bringing new capacity online faster than ever before, turning shared innovation into national strength, and proving that America leads when private-public partners build together.” “The Discovery system will drive scientific innovation faster and farther than ever before,” said ORNL Director Stephen Streiffer. “ORNL’s leadership in supercomputing has dramatically shortened researchers’ time from problem to solution across a host of fields and industries. With Discovery, the integration of high-performance computing and AI promises breakthroughs at the accelerated speed and scale necessary for continued U.S. leadership in an increasingly competitive global environment.” “We are proud that the partnership between HPE and AMD is at the forefront of advancing the next generation of supercomputing in the AI era for Oak Ridge National Laboratory,” said Antonio Neri, president and CEO at HPE. “HPE’s newest supercomputing solutions harness converged AI and HPC architectures, enabling the lab to achieve unprecedented productivity and scale. This collaboration also reinforces American leadership in applying AI to science, energy and national security.” “Oracle is honored to work alongside the Department of Energy to help drive breakthroughs in science, energy, and national security,” said Mahesh Thiagarajan, executive vice president, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. “Oracle will deliver sovereign, high-performance AI infrastructure that will support the co-development of the Lux AI cluster.” Lux AI Supercomputer: Advancing U.S. AI Leadership Lux at ORNL is the nation’s first dedicated AI Factory for science, energy, and national security—purpose-built to train, fine-tune, and deploy AI foundation models that will accelerate discovery and engineering innovation. Lux is designed to accelerate AI-driven science through its advanced architecture, optimized for data-intensive and model-centric workloads. As a critical resource for the DOE and the National Laboratory system, Lux will give the United States an early and decisive advantage in deploying frontier AI capabilities that transform the pace and scale of scientific innovation. By dramatically expanding the nation’s capacity for scientific AI, Lux strengthens U.S. leadership, accelerates AI-for-Science, and helps ensure that the breakthroughs of the AI era are discovered, developed, and deployed in America. Lux will unleash a new generation of scientific capabilities across the DOE’s mission to, reveal nature’s hidden structure, discover breakthrough materials, accelerate energy innovation, transform biology and biosecurity, and advance national security and resilience. Discovery: America’s Next Leap in Scientific Computing Purpose‑built for AI and science, Discovery features a “Bandwidth Everywhere” design that allows science and AI applications to run efficiently and deliver productive results. Importantly, Frontier laid the foundation for this work, and together with HPE Cray Supercomputing GX5000 – its next-generation supercomputing platform – Discovery builds on that success with a consistent programming environment to ensure an easy transition for users. Discovery will be the DOE’s next flagship supercomputer at ORNL, arriving in 2028, and will extend U.S. leadership in HPC and AI. Advancing America’s innovation agenda, Discovery reflects a strong, public‑private commitment to keep the United States at the forefront of AI and scientific innovation. Building on the breakthroughs of Frontier—the world’s first exascale system—Discovery is designed to deliver dramatically higher performance, energy efficiency, and AI capabilities. Discovery will drive breakthroughs in energy, biology, advanced materials, national security, and manufacturing innovation. It will help design next-generation reactors, batteries, catalysts, semiconductors, and critical materials. Key Points of Discovery: ORNL is expected to take delivery of Discovery in 2028, with user operations expected in 2029. Once online, Discovery will serve as a cornerstone of the American AI Stack, advancing the science, security, and innovation goals that define the nation’s next decade.

Title: Geraldine Weiss Had An Interesting Formula

ByJohn Dorfman, Contributor. When a stock sports a dividend yield above its own historical average, one of two things has happened. The company may have raised its dividend – usually a good sign. Or, the dividend yield may have gone up because the stock’s price went down. That suggests there’s been bad news, but it hints at a possible bargain. Some investment professionals seek out stocks whose dividend yield is above their own normal level. Probably the best-known practitioner of this approach was the late Geraldine Weiss, who wrote a book called Dividends Don’t Lie. I wrote a column about the Geraldine Weiss approach in September 2024. The five stocks I selected returned 23.4% in the ensuing year, beating the Standard & Poor’s 500 at 17.6%. Those figures are total returns, both price gain (or loss) and dividends. Bear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn’t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn’t predict the future. I’d like to give Weiss’s approach another try. Here are four stocks that look good to me now, based on her method. The infamous Enron Corp., which went down in the flames of accounting fraud in 2001, has several surviving children. One is EOG Resources Inc. (EOG); the initials once stood for Enron Oil & Gas. Based in Houston, EOG produces the equivalent of more than one million barrels of oil a year. Its mix is about 31% natural gas and 69% oil and natural-gas liquids. Over the past ten years, EOG’s typical dividend yield has been about 1.8%. Today the yield is 3.7%. Geraldine Weiss fans, take note. EOG has been increasing its dividend rapidly in recent years. In 2019 the dividend was $1.01 a share. In the past four quarters the payout has been $3.77. Molson Coors Beverage Co., a brewer based in Golden, Colorado, has averaged a 2.5% dividend yield over the past decade. Today the stock yields 4%. The shares have done miserably over the past ten years, losing close to half of their value. Many investors think that beer is a buggy-whip industry. U.S. beer sales have been declining, and imports are grabbing an increasing share of a shrinking pie. Sensibly, Molson is trying to diversify away from beer, offering hard cider, hard seltzer, canned cocktails and energy drinks. These days, many investors think of Novo Nordisk AS (NVO), which is based in Denmark, primarily as a weight-loss drug maker. I, however, think of it primarily as a leader in diabetes medications. The stock peaked at about $147 last year, and has descended all the way to $53 as Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY) has moved to the front in weight-loss drugs. After its fall, Novo Nordisk shares yield 3.3%, well above the ten-year median of 1.9%. The company’s net profit margin is above 35% and its return on stockholders’ equity is about 81%. Even if those figures decline some, I think the stock is a bargain, selling for about 14 times earnings. Based in New York City, Interparfums Inc. makes and sells perfume and cologne under a wide variety of licensed brands, such as Coach, Karl Lagerfeld, Montblanc and Van Cleef & Arpels. Its dividend yield has normally been about 1.7%. Now it’s 3.2%. The stock has declined, partly because sales and earnings growth have slowed, and perhaps partly because investors fear a recession. It peaked at about $158 five years ago, and now sells for around $96. I think the decline is overdone. Growth was still pretty good in the past year, with sales up 7% and earnings up 17%. My maiden column discussing Geraldine Weiss’s approach was encouraging, as three of my five picks beat the S&P 500’s return, and all five were profitable. The best performer was UGI Corp. (UGI), which distributes natural gas, propane and electricity, mostly in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. It returned 43% (including dividends). Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA) attracted a takeover offer from a private equity firm, Sycamore Partners. It returned more than 37%. Also beating the index, but by a narrower margin, was Magna International Inc. (MGA), a Canadian auto parts maker. Considering the trade frictions (and other frictions) between the U.S. and Canada, I’m pleasantly surprised. US Bancorp. (USB) and Greif Inc. (GEF.B) returns 10% and 4% respectively, trailing the index. Disclosure: I own Novo Nordisk personally and for most of my clients. Katharine Davidge, my wife and a portfolio manager, owns EOG personally and for clients.

Qualcomm is joining the competition to supply chips for AI data centers. Qualcomm (QCOM), which has largely focused on chips for mobile phones, laptops and other consumer devices to date, on Monday unveiled two AI accelerator chips for data centers: the AI200, which is set for release in 2026, and the AI250, which is planned for 2027. Shares of Qualcomm were up more than 13% in recent trading, pacing gainers in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. With Monday's gains, they've added about one-quarter of their value in 2025. Qualcomm's expansion into the market for data center chips comes as a growing number of companies look to capitalize on booming demand for AI with products catering to data centers. The share prices of many of those companies have surged, helping power the broader stock market to record highs. The move marks a big step for Qualcomm, which said that it will be committed to a data center roadmap with an annual cadence for major releases or updates going forward. It could also mean more competition for leading AI chipmakers such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), with several analysts suggesting in recent weeks that they see Nvidia's dominant market share diminishing over time as competition and demand grows. Shares of Nvidia were up 2.5% in recent trading amid a broader market rally, while AMD shares were up slightly after hitting an all-time high at the open.

VANCOUVER, BC, Oct. 27, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- USA News GroupNews Commentary – Gold prices held above $4,100 per ounce through late October 2025, extending a year that has delivered over 25% gains since January and positioned the precious metal for its strongest annual performance since 1979[1]. This sustained rally at elevated levels drove mining profit margins to unprecedented territory[2], with producers seeing margins effectively double as operational costs remain relatively stable while gold continues to commands prices above $4,000 per ounce. Against this backdrop of record bullion values and enhanced economics, exploration and development companies across multiple jurisdictions are accelerating programs, among them Lake Victoria Gold (TSXV: LVG) (OTCQB: LVGLF), First Mining Gold Corp. (TSX: FF) (OTCQX: FFMGF), Andean Precious Metals Corp. (TSX: APM) (OTCQX: ANPMF), U.S. GoldMining Inc. (NASDAQ: USGO), and Nova Minerals Limited (NASDAQ: NVA). Bank of America raised its 2026 gold forecast to $5,000 per ounce, citing unorthodox fiscal policies and rising debt levels as persistent tailwinds for the metal[3]. Meanwhile, JPMorgan projects prices averaging $3,675 per ounce by Q4 2025 before climbing toward $4,000 by mid-2026[4], with sustained central bank purchasing and investor demand averaging 710 tonnes quarterly underpinning the forecast, creating compelling timing advantages for companies advancing high-grade projects toward production. Lake Victoria Gold (TSXV: LVG) (OTCQB: LVGLF) has reported continued exploration success at its Tembo-area licences, where Barrick Gold's Bulyanhulu joint venture completed 12 reverse-circulation holes totaling 1,380 metres during Q2 2025. The results confirm the geological continuity between Barrick's flagship Tanzanian mine and LVG's 100%-owned adjacent ground. "Barrick's methodical exploration is confirming the geological architecture we've interpreted on our licence area," said Marc Cernovitch, President and CEO of LVG. "As they advance, LVG benefits from both the direct geological insights and the potential for substantial contingent payments—creating a rare opportunity of value addition through a combination of near-term potential production development at Imwelo and the Tembo project, and discovery leverage through the Buly exploration." The Q2 drilling confirmed favorable geology, intersecting mafic metavolcanics (greenstone) and quartz porphyry dykes, which display weak to moderate deformation and have associated silica-sericite alteration, and localized disseminated pyrite and quartz veining—promising indicators for gold mineralization in this highly productive district. Rock-chip samples from artisanal workings near zones of strong chlorite-sericite alteration, indicate the presence of potentially mineralized structures. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement executed in 2022, LVG may receive up to US $45 million in contingent payments from Barrick, subject to future discoveries or defined resource thresholds on these licences. The results reinforce the geological continuity between the Bulyanhulu Mine and the Tembo Project area, validating LVG's long-standing interpretation of the belt's broader potential. "We are encouraged to see Barrick's sustained exploration momentum and technical validation across the Tembo-area licences," said Simon Benstead, Executive Chairman and CFO of Lake Victoria Gold. "Their work continues to confirm the fertility of this part of the Lake Victoria Goldfields, where LVG remains a significant stakeholder through both our adjacent 100%-owned Tembo Project and the contingent upside tied to future discoveries." This strategic exposure comes as LVG accelerates its fully permitted Imwelo Gold Project toward construction. The company recently commenced drilling at Area C, the highest-grade zone within the project located just 12 kilometers from AngloGold Ashanti's flagship Geita mine. The approximately 24-hole, 4,000-metre program at Area C is designed to finalize pit design, strengthen resource confidence, and test for extensions at what management views as the priority starting point for mining. Previous drilling at Area C has returned high-grade results, including 6.8 metres at 14.6 g/t gold from 32 metres and 2.0 metres at 7.5 g/t from 22 metres, confirming strong production potential. The drill mobilization follows LVGachieving a pivotal agreement in principle with the Government of Tanzania on the government's statutory minimum 16% free carried interest. This fulfills a core regulatory condition. Together with environmental approval of the Updated Environmental and Social Management Plan, the regulatory pathway is now cleared for construction advancement. Imwelo operates under a 10-year renewable mining license with metallurgical recoveries surpassing 90%. This translates to an exceptional 90 cents of recoverable value per dollar of contained gold. Critically, Lake Victoria Gold is targeting first gold within 12 months of breaking ground. Financial momentum accelerated in September as LVGofficially closed an oversubscribed $6 million financing alongside a $2 million concurrent private placement. Proceeds fund work programs satisfying conditions for a pre-paid forward purchase facility with Monetary Metals to finance mine construction capital. Beyond Imwelo, the Tembo Project delivers additional optionality. A planned 3,000m drilling program at Ngula 1 is scheduled, where historical intercepts of 28.57 g/t gold over 3 metres signal toll milling opportunity. The timing proves strategic. Lake Victoria Gold is mobilizing equipment at a fully permitted project in one of Africa's premier gold districts precisely when high-grade ounces command maximum value.

(TSX: FF) (OTCQX: FFMGF) is expanding its newly discovered Miroir target at its Duparquet Gold Project in Quebec's Abitibi region, with drill hole DUP25-064 returning 3.23 g/t Au over 25.9 m, including 11.20 g/t Au over 2.0 m and 10.16 g/t Au over 1.4 m. The company has completed approximately 16,000 m of drilling in 2025, with 20 holes totaling ~4,450 m at Miroir alone, extending mineralization to 100 m depth while expanding the interpreted geophysical fold target to a 140 m strike length. "The Miroir target continues to deliver new discoveries within the largely underexplored volcanic setting of the Duparquet Project," stated Dan Wilton, CEO of First Mining. "The strong grades and widths encountered to date provide new and exciting opportunities in our review of development scenarios that can now include near-surface, higher grade mineralization potential." Drilling at Miroir follows initial discovery hole DUP24-048, which returned 3.12 g/t Au over 19.35 m in 2024, with recent step-out hole DUP25-066 delivering 1.37 g/t Au over 30.6 m approximately 45 m east of the headline intercept. The Duparquet Project currently hosts 3.44 million ounces Au in the Measured & Indicated category at 1.55 g/t, plus 2.64 million ounces Inferred at 1.62 g/t across a 19 km strike along the prolific Destor-Porcupine Fault Zone. Andean Precious Metals Corp. (TSX: APM) (OTCQX: ANPMF) has expanded its 2025 exploration program at Golden Queen by an additional 3,800 metres following positive Phase 3 drilling results, with core holes at Hilltop intersecting 1.94 g/t Au and 27 g/t Ag over 4.4 m and 5.11 g/t Au and 11 g/t Ag over 1.5 m, bringing total planned 2025 drilling to 8,100 metres. At San Bartolome in Bolivia, the company has secured environmental exploration permits and social licenses in partnership with COMIBOL under a long-term agreement to purchase up to 7.0 million tonnes of oxide ore, with 5,500 metres of shallow core drilling set to begin in Q4 2025 targeting approximately 800,000 tonnes grading 150-250 g/t Ag across multiple projects including Turqui, Tacobamba, Ánimas, Santa Isabel, and Trapiche. "Our exploration teams have made strong progress this year at both Golden Queen and San Bartolome," said Yohann Bouchard, President of Andean Precious Metals. "At Golden Queen, Phase 3 drilling has intersected encouraging mineralized intervals that confirm continuity and support potential mine-life extensions, while upcoming infill work at the Starlight Vein is designed to further expand Main Pit 2. In Bolivia, our partnership with COMIBOL is advancing multiple targets under a long-term ore supply agreement that secures access to up to 7 million tonnes of oxide ore. This program is designed to extend San Bartolome's mine life and maximize throughput of the existing 5,000 tpd mill without major capital spend." The Golden Queen program has drilled 3,903 metres across 20 core holes at Hilltop to date, with all holes intersecting projected low-sulfidation cryptocrystalline quartz veins that extend mineralization up to 280 metres along strike, while infill drilling at the Starlight Vein will support expansion of Main Pit 2, which is currently in production. The company anticipates releasing an updated mineral resource and reserve statement with supporting NI 43-101 technical report in the first half of 2026, integrating new geological data from the expanded drilling program that collectively positions Andean as a growing Americas-focused precious metals producer with quality assets across its California and Bolivia operations. U.S. GoldMining Inc. (NASDAQ: USGO) has successfully completed its 2025 exploration program at the Whistler Gold-Copper Project in Alaska, executing 169 scout auger drill holes across the 7.5 km by 4.5 km Whistler Orbit and completing systematic mapping and sampling at the Muddy Creek intrusion-related gold system. The program identified multiple new porphyry intrusive occurrences at top-of-bedrock and determined that much of the till overburden is shallower than previously interpreted, positioning drill-ready targets closer to surface across the 514 km² property located 150 km northwest of Anchorage. "We are pleased to have successfully completed our 2025 exploration program at the Whistler Project in line with our objective to develop a pipeline of targets for potential future discoveries that will underpin growth opportunities for the Project," said Tim Smith, Chief Executive Officer of U.S. GoldMining. "We also welcome the recent U.S. Federal decision to approve the Ambler Road in north central Alaska, which further supports our belief that the prevailing political tailwinds at all levels of government will help to expedite the successful permitting and ultimate development of the proposed West Susitna Access Road, which is expected to connect the Company's 100% owned Whistler Gold-Copper Project to transportation infrastructure near Anchorage, Alaska." The Whistler Project contains over 20 advanced gold and copper prospects including the Whistler and Raintree deposits, which host a combined mineral resource estimate of 294 Mt at 0.68 g/t AuEq for 6.48 Moz AuEq Indicated, plus 198 Mt at 0.65 g/t AuEq for 4.16 Moz AuEq Inferred. Mapping at Muddy Creek identified new zones of increased quartz vein density containing abundant to massive sulphides including antimony-bearing minerals, with 106 rock grab samples and 7 silt samples collected across a 5 km by 2.5 km area, with assays pending from both the Whistler Orbit scout drilling program and Muddy Creek surface sampling. Nova Minerals Limited (NASDAQ: NVA) has been engaged by Australian Ambassador to the United States, His Excellency The Hon Dr Kevin Rudd AC, to provide a comprehensive briefing on its Estelle Gold and Critical Minerals Project ahead of the October 20, 2025 meeting between Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington DC. The briefing follows the company's recent US$43.4 million award from the U.S. Department of War to accelerate development of a fully integrated U.S. antimony supply chain, targeting military-spec antimony production by 2026/27, with the Estelle Project's 514 km² land package hosting over 20 advanced gold and antimony prospects across a 35 km mineralized corridor in Alaska's Tintina Gold Belt. "Being invited to brief the Australian Government for this high-level meeting between Prime Minister Albanese and President Trump is a testament to the strategic importance of the Estelle Project," said Christopher Gerteisen, CEO of Nova Minerals. "With antimony recognized as a critical mineral and our gold resources adding significant value, Nova is well-positioned to contribute to both U.S. and Australian critical minerals strategies. The US$43.4 million DoW award and our secured land at Port MacKenzie underscore our commitment to building a secure, domestic supply chain for antimony and supporting U.S. defense and industrial needs." The company's proposed antimony refinery at Port MacKenzie, supported by a secured 42.81-acre land use permit, will produce antimony trisulfide, antimony trioxide, and antimony metal for military and industrial applications. Nova's strategic positioning has been reinforced by antimony's inclusion on the U.S. Department of the Interior's Draft 2025 Critical Minerals List and the recent U.S. Federal Government approval of the Ambler Road, signaling increased policy support for responsible resource development in Alaska and alignment with the proposed West Susitna Access Road that would connect the Estelle Project to transportation infrastructure near Anchorage.

Title: Time To Book Profits In CRWD Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/27/time-to-book-profits-in-crwd-stock/
Time Published: 2025-10-27T13:38:16Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CrowdStrike stock (NASDAQ: CRWD) has experienced an impressive performance, increasing by 10% in just the last week and hitting a peak of $522 on October 23, 2025. This surge has brought its year-to-date gains to an impressive 50%. The recent upward trend is primarily due to a series of analyst upgrades and increased price targets. This favorable sentiment follows the company's robust performance and strategic developments showcased at its recent Fal.Con event in September. With the stock currently valued around $520, investors are enjoying significant gains. The key question now is: After this remarkable rise, is CRWD stock still a worthwhile buy? While there are minimal fundamental concerns regarding CRWD stock, we view it as a costly choice at its current trade price of approximately $520. The major concern is that its current valuation seems very high. We arrived at this conclusion by comparing CRWD's present valuation with its operating performance over the past few years and its current and historical financial conditions. Our examination of CrowdStrike across essential metrics—Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience—indicates that the company maintains a strong operating performance and financial situation, as elaborated below. That said, if you are looking for upside with reduced volatility than holding an individual stock like CRWD, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark—a mixture of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has delivered returns exceeding 105% since inception. Why is this the case? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded better returns with less risk than the benchmark index; providing less of a roller-coaster experience, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Let’s confront the obvious issue first – valuation. When evaluating the price per dollar of sales or cash flow, CrowdStrike appears extraordinarily expensive. These ratios imply that investors are paying a substantial premium for anticipated growth. The question arises whether that growth can warrant such elevated valuations. Here’s where the narrative takes an intriguing turn. CrowdStrike's revenue growth has been nothing less than impressive, making a strong argument for why investors might accept those elevated multiples. This persistent high-growth trajectory in the crucial cybersecurity sector indicates that CrowdStrike has discovered a successful model. The company continues to outpace the wider market significantly. This is where CrowdStrike's story becomes more intricate. In spite of remarkable revenue growth, conventional profitability metrics reveal a troubling situation. This contrast suggests that CrowdStrike is investing heavily in growth while generating solid cash flows. The company seems to be focusing on expanding market share over immediate profitability. Despite challenges to profitability, CrowdStrike's balance sheet is robust and offers essential flexibility for its growth strategy. What contributes to the strength of the balance sheet? The financial stability metrics are outstanding: This financial robustness enables CrowdStrike to persist with aggressive investments without being concerned about funding limitations. Assessing CrowdStrike's performance during downturns aids in understanding its resilience as a long-term investment. CrowdStrike tends to undergo more dramatic fluctuations but demonstrates substantial recovery capacity, likely due to the vital role of cybersecurity services. Check out our dashboard on – How Low Can CRWD Stock Really Go – for more information. Additionally, investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be perilous. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has surpassed its all-cap stock benchmark (the combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver strong returns for investors. Why is this? The quarterly rebalanced mixture of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has provided a proactive method to capitalize on favorable market conditions while mitigating losses during downturns, as outlined in RV Portfolio performance metrics. CrowdStrike poses a classic conflict between growth and value. The company merges outstanding growth with robust financial stability, categorizing it as a high-quality business. However, its current valuation around $520 seems excessive, even for a firm with such remarkable fundamentals. Naturally, we could be mistaken in our evaluation, and investors might continue to be willing to pay 30 times or more for CRWD stock revenues. Nonetheless, investors should also consider the associated risks. We believe that waiting for a more favorable entry point may be the better option, as the existing price seems to reflect a lot of anticipated future success.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Shopify (SHOP) shares have surged 21% in the last month and are currently priced at $172.95. Our algorithm-based multi-factor evaluation indicates that it may be advisable to lower exposure to SHOP shares at this time. Our main concern lies in the current valuation, as a price point of $121 may not be unattainable. We believe there is minimal risk in SHOP stock given its overall Strong operational performance and financial standing. However, due to its Very High valuation, the stock seems Relatively Expensive. Here is our analysis: SHOP stock has increased significantly lately, making it appear relatively expensive at this time. Although this might seem like a chance, there are substantial risks associated with investing in a single stock. Conversely, a broader diversified strategy, as practiced with Trefis High Quality Portfolio, offers considerable value. Additionally, contemplate how the long-term performance of your portfolio could be enhanced by including 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto alongside equities. Let’s delve into the details of each of the factors evaluated, but first, for a quick overview: With a market capitalization of $224 Bil, Shopify delivers a global commerce platform that enables merchants to showcase, manage, promote, and sell products across various sales channels. This table illustrates how SHOP is growing in comparison to the broader market. For further details see: SHOP Revenue Comparison This table illustrates how SHOP's profitability compares against the broader market. For more details see: SHOP Operating Income Comparison SHOP has performed worse than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. This assessment takes into account both (a) the magnitude of the stock's decline and, (b) the speed of its recovery. 2022 Inflation Shock 2020 Covid Pandemic However, the risks are not confined to significant market crashes. Stocks can decline even during favorable market conditions—consider events such as earnings announcements, business updates, and outlook changes. Review SHOP Dip Buyer Analyses to understand how the stock has bounced back from sharp declines in the past. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a history of consistently outperforming benchmarks that include all three—S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. Why is this the case? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; it has been a smoother ride, as illustrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

October 27, 2025 08:15 ET | Source: 24/7 Market News and VENU 24/7 Market News and VENU DENVER, Oct. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 247marketnews.com, a pioneer in digital media dedicated to the swift distribution of financial market news and information, reports that the construction of VENU’s (NYSE American: VENU) $350 million Sunset Amphitheater in McKinney, Texas, is progressing on schedule, marking a major milestone in the company’s mission to redefine the live entertainment landscape through real estate–backed, community-integrated entertainment campuses. The state-of-the-art, 20,000-seat premium amphitheater is projected to begin its inaugural concert season in 2026, which could grow to more than 80 shows annually, in its first full year, featuring premier global talent. Strategically located at the intersection of US 75 and the Sam Rayburn Tollway, the Sunset Amphitheater sits within a 30-minute drive of nearly 4 million residents and just over an hour from almost 10 million people, one of the most lucrative and demographically dynamic catchment zones in the nation. The amphitheater’s 46-acre site is designed to function year-round with a multi-season configuration, hosting 20,000 attendees in warm months, and reconfiguring to seat 5,000 guests in the winter with heated flooring and a partially enclosed roof and wind walls to maintain comfort in colder weather. Key features include: A Model Designed for Scale Drawing on experience from its Ford Amphitheater in Colorado Springs, VENU continues to refine its construction process to deliver on-demand fulfillment of premium entertainment facilities with increased speed and efficiency. This approach underpins the Company’s growing portfolio, now over $5 billion in total pipeline, with $1.3 billion currently under construction across multiple states and 38 municipalities actively negotiating for future campuses. “From day one, we’ve been clear about how we intend to fund expansion — through public-private partnerships, FireSuite sales, and sale-leasebacks,” said CEO and Chairman J.W. Roth. “Our growth is accelerating faster than we expected, and the foundation we’ve laid is designed for scale.” FireSuites: The Backbone of VENU’s Expansion Central to VENU’s business model are its Luxe FireSuites, real estate–backed, triple-net-leased VIP ownership experiences offering an anticipated 11% cap rate. Each FireSuite accommodates four to ten guests, featuring VIP entry, premium parking, and in-suite hospitality. Sales momentum remains strong: $23 million in FireSuite revenue booked in just 60 days, up 250% year-over-year, with company-wide inventory nearly 49% sold across Tulsa ($80M), McKinney ($147M), and El Paso ($106M). Economic and Institutional Tailwinds According to D Magazine, the McKinney project is expected to generate $3.8 billion in local economic impact over the next decade. The project also benefits from growing institutional confidence, Vanguard Group and 23 other institutions now hold nearly 5% of VENU’s float, signaling market recognition of its scalable, asset-backed model. With strategic partnerships spanning Tixr (ticketing), AEG Presents (touring), Aramark (hospitality), Ryan LLC (PPP structuring), and Sands Investment Group (sales), VENU continues to execute on a low-debt, high-leverage growth model that generates recurring revenue before the first ticket is even sold. Looking Ahead As the live music industry is projected by Goldman Sachs to grow at a 7.2% compound annual rate through 2030, VENU’s focus on premium, flexible, and artist-friendly venues places it at the epicenter of this expansion. The McKinney Sunset Amphitheater is the blueprint for the next era of experiential entertainment.

The rapid rise of the fintech sector in India has enabled Indian investors to explore investment opportunities overseas, especially in booming markets like the United States. Global equities have become more accessible for Indian investors due to the proliferation of Portfolio Management Services (PMS), global trading platforms and fintech apps. As the US stocks have reached record highs in the last few days, it could be an opportune time for Indian investors to gain from the booming US market. Indian investors can explore a wide range of options from stocks of top global tech giants like Apple, Google and Meta to popular ETFs and index funds. The key US stock indices reached record high levels on Friday, after the potential China trade deal progress and anticipation of another interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve. The Dow closed above 47,000 for the first time on Friday after September’s Consumer Price Index data showed annual inflation had heated up but less than expected, as per a CNN report. Key indices, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, also rallied to new record highs on Oct. 24. The S&P 500 Index rose by 0.79% while the Dow Jones Industrials Index rallied1.01%. On the other hand, the Nasdaq 100 Index advanced 1.04%. Amid the boom in the US market, Indian investors can explore the opportunities to reap benefits through the new-age digital trading platforms that offer simple and secure ways to invest in US equities. · To start investing in US stocks, Indian investors need to follow a few simple steps: · Open a global trading account with a registered brokerage firm · Complete the KYC verification by submitting documents like identity proof, address proof, PAN and bank account details. · Some trading platforms may also ask for additional documents for compliance and legal requirements. · Once the account is set up, you can add funds and start trading in American stocks. Many international brokers are also offering overseas trading accounts for Indian investors. · Access to top global companies across industries offers an opportunity to minimise risks through diversification, while maximising returns from their growth. · Exposure to US stocks may help to minimise risks during a downturn in domestic markets. · Many brokers are allowing the opening of free trading accounts for Indian investors. · Investments in American stocks can be made starting at as little as $10. · For long-term investors, investments at regular intervals also minimise risks due to the advantage of dollar-cost averaging. Before investing in US stocks, it’s important for Indian investors to know about regulatory restrictions, compliance norms and transaction-related guidelines. Currency exchange rates and capital gains taxes could also reduce your actual returns from the US stocks. Tax compliance in both countries could be a tedious task for many investors. Market volatilities arising from global economic factors and geopolitical issues could also pose a serious risk for investors. It’s also advisable to consistently monitor currency exchange rates as they can impact the overall value of your portfolio in rupee terms. To conclude, Indian investors can easily access American stocks with today’s tech-driven trading platforms. It’s advisable to take a balanced approach and remain watchful of all key factors while ensuring compliance as per Indian laws and RBI rules for seamless investing.

S&P 500 and Nasdaq are both higher — and traders are betting on a major Fed rate cut this week. Markets are now turning their focus to Trump’s high-stakes Asia trip.

Across Asia, stocks are exploding higher. Japan’s Nikkei 225 smashed through 50,000 for the first time ever. Kospi, Hang Seng, and Shanghai Composite are all in the green.

Title: Exit dialogue: What would you consider a decent severance pay?

She rolled her eyes. Pay discussions are sensitive, but easier when you do it before joining, hence I ignored her non-friendly body language and pursued, “I mean, if you terminate me in the first year, will there be a special severance pay?” That conversation went on for another 45 minutes without leading to any conclusion, and she then had to pass it on to her CEO for a resolution. Are you wondering why I was spoiling my chances of being employed as a CEO? I had my reasons — the risk factors were big. The enterprise in question had the dubious distinction of asking two people before me to leave in the first year of appointment; and, if anointed, I would have been their fifth leader in seven years. I had asked for a year’s compensation if my employment contract were to be ended by the organisation in the first year. They didn’t have a formal retrenchment policy and were hence hesitant. Well, that was more than 15 years ago; today, most progressive organisations have a formal retrenchment policy, and the formulas are fixed. According to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), several countries offer some sort of a redundancy pay. The ILO’s Employment Protection Legislation (EPLex) database covers 116 countries, and lists the severance pay in months, based on tenure. Guess where India features in this? You will be surprised to note that India, along with countries like Japan, is at the top of the list, recommending 20 months of severance pay for employees serving 20 years. However, countries like the US, which dish out attractive severances to their ousted CEOs, recommend nothing, as per the ILO database. In a way, for every year of service, one month of severance pay is considered acceptable. According to the website TrueUp, which tracks tech layoffs, May and July saw the most number of layoffs — 24,000 and 46,000, respectively. It says the layoffs at tech companies have impacted 158,993 people so far in 2025. That’s about 541 people per day. Sounds like a lot? But then, if you compare with 2024, it was about 653 per day. All of us criticise enterprises that lay off people. But does it affect their brand worth? We know Wall Street rewards headcount reduction and even CEO firings. Remember, the stock price of Starbucks went up by 20 per cent when it replaced the last CEO. Let’s name the 10 brands that laid off employees in 2025 and ask ourselves whether we would be willing to recommend our near and dear ones to work there in the future? According to the platform Intellizence, leading companies that announced layoffs in 2025 include UPS (20,000), Dell (12,000), Nissan (12,000), Intel (10,000), HBC (8,300), Chevron (8,000), DHL (8,000), BP (7,700) and Audi (7,500). As per company filings cited by Bloomberg, Reliance Retail laid off 38,000 employees in 2024. Will anyone refuse to join these enterprises if they are recruiting again? We know severance pay is a question of intent and affordability for an enterprise. When Meta laid off 11,000 employees in 2022, the company paid $975 million in severance, about $88,000 per person on average. In a subsequent regulatory filing, the Facebook parent said “the impact of these costs was not material” as it was offset by what it saved in payroll and other employee benefits. A Bloomberg review of Russell 3000 companies that made layoffs between 2022 and 2024 showed that, on average, each laid-off worker received a severance pay of $40,000. The report also highlighted an extreme example of a healthcare company with an average payout of almost $212,000 per laid-off worker. Back home, when TCS recently announced its severance package for the 12,000-odd employees it intends to lay off, most of us termed the offer as generous. According to reports, affected employees will be offered a minimum of six months’ pay while those who have served 20 years will be given two years’ pay. Would you prefer a six-month or two-year salary paid upfront, rather than continuing with your job? It may depend on your personal and professional context. What if you don’t get your next job within the next six months? After 20 years in a single company that laid you off for want of better skills, what are the chances of getting a suitable job in two years? One can call the severance pay attractive if the laid-off person is able to secure a job before the money runs out. A severance paycheque is a ticking time bomb till you get your next job offer. Picture this: one gets a job well in time, and there is a handsome additional amount in the bank after getting laid off, thanks to the severance pay. Will you trade the money in the bank for feeling unwanted by your former employer? Are the uncertainties you had to go through, the anxieties, and the feeling of rejection caused during the redundancy period worth the money you received in the end? Let’s face it — in today’s world, the scars of layoffs are inevitable. Let’s believe that the scars show us where we have been and don’t dictate where we are going!

Title: You've Been Warned: Consumer Reports Says These Cheap TVs Aren't Worth Your Money

We may receive a commission on purchases made from links. If you're on the lookout for cheap TVs, you may want to hold back on buying certain brands and models, lest you risk missing out on getting your money's worth. At least, that's the thought behind a warning from Consumer Reports, which wants customers to avoid spending money on televisions that just aren't worth the investment. Yes, even if they come with a very low price tag. The cost of a new television is often remarkably affordable, regardless of the size and resolution of the product in question. This frequently gets attributed to factors such as decreased public demand and high inventory levels. It's also crucial to note that competition is a factor, and some companies produce good-quality TVs that customers feel are worth the investment. The trick for many shoppers is to figure out which brands those are and what price constitutes a good deal. There are a few cheap TV models that Customer Reports repeatedly warns Americans to avoid, and in some cases, a few companies that the review website suggests shoppers should give serious thought to before considering any of their products. That said, not everyone is so harsh on these low-cost offerings. Some reviewers and customers shared positive experiences and comments. Ultimately, it's best to do your own research concerning product specifications, verified user reviews, and available deals. With these thoughts in mind, here are the budget TVs that Consumer Reports has cautioned customers about purchasing. Vizio's TVs are cheap to purchase, thanks in large part to the company's decision to outsource upwards of 99% of its manufacturing. But while that may give Vizio's bottom line a significant boost, the same can't always be said for the quality of their televisions. That was the case for the M65Q6M-K04 model, a 65-inch 4K UHD smart TV, which Consumer Reports warned suffers from deficient contrast, which negatively affects the product's image quality. While some customers were pleased with the LED picture quality relative to the pricing, some customers experienced bizarre glitches, such as horizontal lines, despite their television being relatively new. One buyer complained the M65Q6M-K04 "wouldn't hold a sync." Meanwhile, one perplexed customer said the TV would sometimes turn on by itself. The Vizio M65Q6M-K04 received decent marks from RTINGS for its low input lag, VRR support, and decent response time when gaming. However, the same review found the product to offer a bland viewing experience when watching sports, TV shows, and movies; it could work as a computer monitor, though RTINGS called out its refresh rate of 60Hz. These TVs are sold for as low as $270. Still, this purchase might not be worth it if you are willing to pay a little more to guarantee excellent video quality. Moreover, you might want to pay careful attention to your warranty should you notice any unusual glitches early on. The Toshiba 75C350KU or 75-Class C350 Series is a prime example of the dip in quality that the brand reportedly suffered following its acquisition from Hisense in November 2017. Though Toshiba was previously known for excellent products, such as the still much-loved Satellite laptops, this was not the case with TVs like the 75C350KU model. Currently, you can buy this item starting at $324.99 through Best Buy or $399 at Amazon; the 65-inch version is more cost-friendly at $325 through Amazon. Despite having a 2160p resolution, Consumer Reports gave these 75-inch televisions low marks for poor image quality and mediocre High Dynamic Range (HDR) capabilities. CR weren't alone in their observation, with reviewers from RTINGS.com and PC Mag also calling out issues with the model. For instance, RTINGS shared that the 2023 release had "low peak brightness in SDR and HDR," and "noticeably darker edges on bright scenes of uniform color." Even with such negative reviews, not everything about the 75-Class C350 Series gets discussed negatively. In addition to Amazon Alexa voice control, the Toshiba TV also featured low input lag, an invaluable feature for dedicated gamers. While the cheap price tag and big screen size might make this model seem worth the price, it might be a good idea to compare its specs to similarly sized and priced models from rival brands. RCA is another once-popular brand that Consumer Reports mentioned as having seen better days. As CR notes, RCA was actually responsible for helping to establish the NTSC standards for color television. Yet, things are much different in the 21st century, and this brand is no longer near the top of the pecking order when it comes to TV viewing experience. This is reflected in the reception of the RCA RNSMU6036, a 60-inch LCD 4K UHD TV. In reviewing the TV, Consumer Reports stated that the "HD picture quality falls short," and "near-white highlights are overly peaked, and contrasty." CR also found that the HDR performance was insufficient. "When playing HDR content, the TV does not trigger new picture settings that are optimized for HDR." Although certain audio and visual specs weren't necessarily up to par, CR did give the product credit for having good motion performance, despite lacking a blur reduction feature. This model isn't readily in stock, though in the past it's reportedly been sold for around $300. If you come across this RCA TV for sale, likely at a discount, you might be able to get it even cheaper. However, the scarcity of this product may signal that it's better to find a more positively reviewed alternative that is readily in stock. Westinghouse TVs are often very cheap to buy, and the 24-inch WD24HX1201 is no exception. However, Consumer Reports doesn't think too much of the brand in terms of overall quality. In an article critiquing specific brands, CR acknowledged Westinghouse as a "historic U.S. electronics name" under the ownership of ViacomCBS. Per Consumer Reports, the brand's television sets are licensed through a Chinese company named TongFang, which manufactures Westinghouse TVs through a California factory. Sometimes, customers will see a name and be unaware of any changes that CR warns could impact the actual end product that makes it to market. The Westinghouse WD24HX1201 is extremely cost-friendly, having gone for as low as $51.99 through some retailers. Its small size also makes it ideal for spaces where owning a huge smart HD TV just isn't practical, such as a tiny studio apartment or college dorm room. Despite its convenient size and pricing, some notable issues might be hard to overlook. For instance, while some viewers are pleased with the viewing experience, others reportedly believe the product does not meet full HD standards comparable to other models currently available. Meanwhile, one customer complained that the "sound is terrible," describing it as "tinny" in nature. While CR and similar review sites believe Westinghouse's quality is compromised, the customer will ultimately have the final say regarding experience and value for money. If you prioritize size, convenience, and pricing over quality, this model could be worth it. Otherwise, you may want to look elsewhere for a better-quality TV. In Consumer Reports' breakdown of the 55-inch Vizio M65Q6-L4, the reviewer deemed the HDR performance to be largely "ineffective," stating, "In our tests, the display did not have the peak brightness capability necessary (by HDR standards) to reproduce the extended contrast on our HDR content." Unfortunately, this isn't the only area where CR felt the product fell short, as the reviewer noted that contrast was bad during dark scenes, which made the image appear "flat with no sense of depth." Visual experience aside, Consumer Reports did give the model positive marks for motion blur performance. They also found the TV's sound quality to be about average compared to similar products. The Vizio M65Q6-L4, also known as the Vizio Quantum QLED, was first released in 2023, but since then, review sites like CR and RTINGS have ultimately deemed it to be a mediocre product. RTINGS gave it a 6.5 out of 10 score, noting that the product is highly suitable for use as a PC monitor, but is only a fair to average option for watching TV shows, movies, or gaming. RTINGS did side with Consumer Reports regarding the TV's inferior HDR capabilities, while also mentioning its subpar selection of streaming applications. Despite such criticisms, the Vizio M65Q6-L4 is relatively cheap to buy, priced at $378 on Walmart's website. Whether this purchase will be worth it ultimately comes down to your budget and needs, but for the price, there's a good chance you can find a better bargain. If you were hoping to recommend the Vizio V555-J01 as an alternative to the poorly received M65Q6-L4, then Consumer Reports' review of this particular model could give you pause. Part of the V5 series of Vizio smart TVs, this product unfortunately has similar design issues to the Quantum QLED. For example, CR found it to have poor HDR performance with flat screen imagery. However, the V555-J01 model also has some sound quality issues. Consumer Reports said the audio performance might work for typical television viewing, but that "its shortcomings would be obvious with movie soundtracks and music." Even with the warnings from review sites like CR, some customers found the Vizeo TV to be worth the purchase. The product is currently selling at $311.99 at Best Buy, where customers rate the model 4.4 out of 5. Satisfied buyers reportedly love the price and the ease of setup. Interestingly, most customers outright disagreed with Consumer Reports' take on the image quality, finding it to be very good. This reception could of course be tied to perceived value for money and what many purchasers expect for the related price tag. This is likely going to be a situation where your desire for a bargain will impact your perception of a brand and its products. Vizio has established itself as a brand that sells very affordable TVs. If you prefer cheap TVs, you may be satisfied here. That said, if you are seeking better reviewed TVs with higher end specifications, you will likely want to try a different brand and TV model. The Westinghouse WD24HX1201 is a 24-inch model with a 768p resolution that ultimately left a lot to be desired. According to Consumer Reports, the TV has only a single HDMI and USB port, which is notable since smaller laptops often come with more USB ports. If the connection options leave you unimpressed, the viewing experience might not be much better. CR felt the color accuracy was below the quality demonstrated by rival brands, and that the "black levels were merely okay." Contrast was also below standards compared to the results found testing similar TVs. Lastly, Consumer Reports found the model to have a narrow viewing angle that offered a "below average performance" relative to other televisions. Although Consumer Reports finds the Westinghouse brand to be lacking compared to top TV brands, customers are willing to overlook quality issues and have given the TV positive feedback on the official website. They not only uploaded images of their TVs, but also repeatedly praised the model for being easy to set up and use. There were also repeated mentions of how satisfied they were with the product for the purchase price. Similar sentiments were expressed by customers who bought the television through Best Buy. While availability can vary, the WD24HX1201 model can be found for sale starting at $115.99 on websites like Walmart and Amazon. As was the case with Vizio, it may be that Westinghouse is a brand that consumers associate with bargain shopping, and so aren't going to hold it to the rigorous standards applied by Consumer Reports. That said, quality-minded shoppers will probably heed CR's warning and pass on this Westinghouse product. Consumer Reports isn't impressed with RCA, despite many of its TVs being affordably priced. Although the site has not directly reviewed the 50-inch RLDED5098-UHD model, CR's past warnings about RCA's brand and related quality appear to reflect how purchasers have come to see this television. For example, over 2,000 Walmart customers gave the TV an overall rating of 3.7 out of 5. Some customers were highly unsatisfied with the 2160p LED TV, opting to leave scathing 2- and 1-star reviews. Some purchasers complained about sound quality. A reviewer named Patricia, who left a 2-star review, claimed that the audio "was going in and out." Other 2-star reviewers complained about the difficulty in picking up channels and found the accompanying remote to be too small. Other notable reviews mentioned a terrible "burning" smell. More than half of the reviews for the RLDED5098-UHD were ultimately quite positive, with many bringing up the low price as a plus. That aside, the complaints about various shortcomings strongly reflect overall quality issues that Consumer Reports has mentioned that some brands like RCA struggle with, especially as ownership of the brand name has passed to companies that do not consistently produce top quality TVs.

Title: S&P 500 Surges: Magnificent 7 Earnings, Rate Cut, And AI Boom Drive Q3
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/10/26/sp-500-surges-magnificent-7-earnings-rate-cut-and-ai-boom-drive-q3/
Time Published: 2025-10-26T09:53:54Z
Full Content:
ByBill Stone, Contributor. The third-quarter earnings season begins its busiest week, which includes an earnings report from five of the Magnificent 7 and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B). 173 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Boeing (BA), Kraft Heinz (KHC), ServiceNow (NOW), Merck (MRK), Mastercard (MA), Chevron (CVX), and Exxon Mobil (XOM). With 29% of companies reporting so far, 86% have beaten consensus earnings estimates. The earnings season preview from last week contains more details about the underlying drivers of earnings. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 9.2% year-over-year, above the expectations of 7.9% at the end of the quarter. The expected earnings growth rate for calendar years 2025 and 2026 is unchanged at 11.0% and 13.9%, respectively. The continuation of the strong earnings season helped lift the S&P 500 last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week. In addition, the better-than-expected consumer inflation reading opened the door to a Federal Reserve rate cut this week, which helped stocks, particularly banks. The lack of additional “cockroaches” last week helped regional banks snap back from concerns over reported loan fraud. Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. Tesla’s (TSLA) earnings were below expectations last week, and it was the only member of the Magnificent 7 that saw a stock price decline last week. Five of the Magnificent 7 report earnings this week: Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) after the close on Wednesday; Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) after the close on Thursday. According to FactSet data, the positive earnings surprises from companies in the financials, information technology, and industrials sectors were the most significant contributors to the S&P 500’s earnings growth rate increase last week. Within financials, Capital One Financial (COF) and Chubb (CB) were the most significant positive drivers. Intel (INTC) was the most crucial positive surprise in technology, while RTX (RTX) and GE Aerospace (GE) were the most notable positive surprises in industrials. Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. If the third-quarter nominal year-over-year GDP growth estimate of 4.8% is correct, there could be downside to expected sales growth. However, sales growth at 7.0% is running well above expectations. So far this earnings season, the consumer discretionary and financials sectors have been the most critical drivers of improved sales growth. The government shutdown delayed September consumer inflation (CPI) readings, but the headline and core, excluding food and energy, were better than expected. The headline and core CPI were 3% year-over-year. The top-line numbers were more favorable than expected, despite concerns about price pressure from tariffs. In addition, the details were similarly comforting, with the pace of price gains for services and housing slowing. The 3-month annualized rate of CPI growth held steady, suggesting the recent inflation acceleration might be subsiding. With the government shutdown dragging on and delaying or withholding many US economic releases, the focus will be on the busiest week of the earnings season. In addition, five of the Magnificent 7 companies report earnings. This group has an outsized impact on the S&P 500’s expected earnings growth rate. It is also an essential bellwether for gauging the health of the artificial intelligence boom and the technology sector as a whole. Despite the government shutdown, tariffs, and a cooling labor market, the economy continues to hold up well, with the betting odds of a US recession in 2025 falling to 4%. President Trump is scheduled to meet with China’s President Xi this week, and markets anticipate some thawing in tensions between the countries, though a full-scale trade deal is unlikely. The friendlier inflation data last week sealed the deal for another 25 basis point (0.25%) rate cut from the Federal Reserve (Fed) at their meeting on Wednesday. Financial markets expect another cut at the December meeting. Given the additional economic visibility issues arising from the government shutdown, management’s forward earnings guidance will be even more closely watched. Since the Fed rate cut is a virtual certainty, Chair Powell’s comments about the future path of monetary policy will be closely watched. He is unlikely to be forceful in his views, given the lack of visibility into the health of the labor market, but shouldn’t buck expectations for another Fed easing in December.

The third-quarter earnings season begins its busiest week, which includes an earnings report from five of the Magnificent 7 and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B). 173 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Boeing (BA), Kraft Heinz (KHC), ServiceNow (NOW), Merck (MRK), Mastercard (MA), Chevron (CVX), and Exxon Mobil (XOM). With 29% of companies reporting so far, 86% have beaten consensus earnings estimates. The earnings season preview from last week contains more details about the underlying drivers of earnings. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 9.2% year-over-year, above the expectations of 7.9% at the end of the quarter. The expected earnings growth rate for calendar years 2025 and 2026 is unchanged at 11.0% and 13.9%, respectively. The continuation of the strong earnings season helped lift the S&P 500 last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week. In addition, the better-than-expected consumer inflation reading opened the door to a Federal Reserve rate cut this week, which helped stocks, particularly banks. The lack of additional “cockroaches” last week helped regional banks snap back from concerns over reported loan fraud. Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. Tesla’s (TSLA) earnings were below expectations last week, and it was the only member of the Magnificent 7 that saw a stock price decline last week. Five of the Magnificent 7 report earnings this week: Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) after the close on Wednesday; Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) after the close on Thursday. According to FactSet data, the positive earnings surprises from companies in the financials, information technology, and industrials sectors were the most significant contributors to the S&P 500’s earnings growth rate increase last week. Within financials, Capital One Financial (COF) and Chubb (CB) were the most significant positive drivers. Intel (INTC) was the most crucial positive surprise in technology, while RTX (RTX) and GE Aerospace (GE) were the most notable positive surprises in industrials. Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. If the third-quarter nominal year-over-year GDP growth estimate of 4.8% is correct, there could be downside to expected sales growth. However, sales growth at 7.0% is running well above expectations. So far this earnings season, the consumer discretionary and financials sectors have been the most critical drivers of improved sales growth. The government shutdown delayed September consumer inflation (CPI) readings, but the headline and core, excluding food and energy, were better than expected. The headline and core CPI were 3% year-over-year. The top-line numbers were more favorable than expected, despite concerns about price pressure from tariffs. In addition, the details were similarly comforting, with the pace of price gains for services and housing slowing. The 3-month annualized rate of CPI growth held steady, suggesting the recent inflation acceleration might be subsiding. With the government shutdown dragging on and delaying or withholding many US economic releases, the focus will be on the busiest week of the earnings season. In addition, five of the Magnificent 7 companies report earnings. This group has an outsized impact on the S&P 500’s expected earnings growth rate. It is also an essential bellwether for gauging the health of the artificial intelligence boom and the technology sector as a whole. Despite the government shutdown, tariffs, and a cooling labor market, the economy continues to hold up well, with the betting odds of a US recession in 2025 falling to 4%. President Trump is scheduled to meet with China’s President Xi this week, and markets anticipate some thawing in tensions between the countries, though a full-scale trade deal is unlikely. The friendlier inflation data last week sealed the deal for another 25 basis point (0.25%) rate cut from the Federal Reserve (Fed) at their meeting on Wednesday. Financial markets expect another cut at the December meeting. Given the additional economic visibility issues arising from the government shutdown, management’s forward earnings guidance will be even more closely watched. Since the Fed rate cut is a virtual certainty, Chair Powell’s comments about the future path of monetary policy will be closely watched. He is unlikely to be forceful in his views, given the lack of visibility into the health of the labor market, but shouldn’t buck expectations for another Fed easing in December.

Title: Chipmakers Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom are slapping 'golden handcuffs' on workers to meet demand for the AI boom

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It's cuffing season for chipmakers. As their valuations skyrocket on the back of the AI boom, so do pay packages for employees whose compensation is tied to stock price. Some are anticipating paydays worth millions of dollars. There's one catch: Stock payouts unlock over time, rewarding employees who stay with the company longer — and penalizing those who skip out sooner. One Nvidia employee who plans to leave when their equity vests told Business Insider that doing so before would have a "big cost," adding, "If I wanted to leave now, I do not think I can command the salary I have now with another company." It's a tactic that tech giants, such as Amazon and Google, have used for years to retain employees. Now that chipmakers are striking big deals to meet the growing demand for powering AI, the golden handcuffs at the US's three largest — Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom — are tightening. Business Insider spoke about the impact of these packages with six current and former employees at Nvidia and Broadcom who are not authorized to speak to the press. Since both companies have over 36,000 employees receiving a variety of compensation structures, we also worked with Levels.fyi, which tracks employee compensation more broadly in Silicon Valley. It could take up to four years for some to get the full payout. However, the skyrocketing value of stock awards means some employees are already earning buckets of compensation, which in Nvidia's case has tipped some to coast into a "semi-retirement" mode. "A lot of them have families," one Nvidia employee said, "and they probably think logically like, 'Who am I to walk away from this job that guarantees that my kids will never have student debt?'" The stock growth of chipmakers Broadcom, Nvidia, and AMD since January 2023 has outpaced that of other tech giants, such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. "Aside from Meta, even the 'poorest' performing AI chip company (AMD) has outpaced the rest of Big Tech in these past two years," said Hakeem Shibly, a data analyst at Levels.fyi. One Broadcom employee, who estimated that their restricted stock units, or RSUs, are valued at over six times their salary, said, "Given the recent rise of the share price, people who have been able to hold on to their shares will now be looking forward to a very comfortable retirement." In one case, an equity package of $488,000 given to an Nvidia employee in 2023 is now worth more than $2.2 million, according to Levels data. Even a more modest $66,000 RSU package reported by a Broadcom employee in 2023 has jumped in value to around $265,000. Business Insider spoke to a former Broadcom employee who said they lost unvested RSUs when they were let go from the company last year. They estimate their vested RSUs are now worth half a million dollars, but if they were still at Broadcom, their total RSU package would now be worth about $3 million. In some of the user-submitted data provided by Levels.fyi, the value of several Nvidia employees' equity grants has risen over 350% since their hire date in 2023, but because they're not fully vested, they would risk walking away from more than $500,000. Likewise, at Broadcom, the grants of several employees have increased by over 300% since 2023, with many holding RSU packages worth millions, according to Levels data. Two Broadcom employees said theirs were worth over $6 million each. One Nvidia employee said RSUs have created a "lottery winner syndrome," meaning that it feels unlikely to find a similarly lucrative opportunity elsewhere. "The golden handcuffs are RSUs," the former Broadcom employee said. "No one's going to put in their notice now to go to other opportunities." Leaders inside the chip giants are well aware of how powerful these packages are for retaining talent. Nvidia said that "RSUs promote retention" in its annual sustainability report and said its turnover rate has more than halved, from 5.3% in 2023 to 2.5% in 2025. CEO Jensen Huang has boasted about making employees wealthy, and the company said that 20% of employees have been there for 10 years, while 40% have been there for more than five years. Likewise, Broadcom reported that its global voluntary attrition rate last year was 6.2%, which is "below the technology industry benchmark." It cited equity awards as a "powerful long-term retention incentive," saying it has "historically granted these awards to the substantial majority of our employees." The Nvidia employees said that since the RSUs of longer-time employees are worth more than those of newer employees, the disparities are sometimes openly discussed. One employee said some managers who have been with the company for a long time — and whose shares are worth exponentially more — "are just resting and vesting." The other employee said that those whose RSUs are worth more could be more incentivized to go above and beyond, including working more intensely or being less likely to push back in meetings. According to Levels data, Nvidia has started using a method used by Google, Uber, DoorDash, and Pinterest in recent years, which is to "front-load" its vesting schedules. This means employees receive the biggest chunk of their equity in their first year at the company. Similar to a signing bonus, front-loading can be a valuable tool for attracting top talent. It also ties financial rewards more closely to employee performance, as tech employees often receive additional stock awards after their first year of work. After that, if an employee's performance is poor, they're more likely to see diminished payouts. Smaller pay packages handed out at these AI hardware companies have also become incredibly lucrative. Employees may get more equity in lieu of a higher salary or bonuses — and for some of those working at the chip giants right now, that's OK. "In private conversations I've had with others," another former Broadcom employee said, "they're quite pleased with RSUs." Jump to

Title: New Trump Administration Energy Rule Would Enable Data Centers with ‘Large Loads’
URL: https://gizmodo.com/ai-large-loads-2000676957
Time Published: 2025-10-25T14:00:39Z
Full Content:
Reading time: Reading time 3 minutes Data centers are being built with unprecedented gusto all over the U.S. The reason for this is fairly well known: the AI business requires gargantuan amounts of electricity and computing power. Every time you use an app like DALL-E to, say, make one of those dumb AI-generated images of Mickey Mouse committing the 9/11 terrorist attacks, you’re apparently using as much energy as it takes to charge an iPhone. Now picture how much electricity is being used if millions of Americans do it at the same time. The Trump administration has made it known that it’s a friend to the AI industry (it recently launched the AI infrastructure initiative Stargate) and so, it makes perfect sense that its Energy Secretary, Chris Wright, has decided to cut the red tape when it comes to hooking data centers up to the electrical grid. In a statement published Friday, the Energy Department announced its plan to amend current rules to allow organizations that consume a lot of electricity to connect to the grid much faster: “U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright directed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) today to initiate rulemaking procedures with a proposed rule to rapidly accelerate the interconnection of large loads, including data centers, positioning the United States to lead in AI innovation and in the revitalization of domestic manufacturing.” Hear that, guys? Chris Wright is apparently such a big fan of large loads that, in a bout of deregulatory fervor, he’s now helping to usher in a new era of easier data center connection. While the specifics of Wright’s proposed rule are a little bit complicated, the obvious takeaway seems to be an effort to make the regulatory process less onerous on people who want to hook up a lot of servers to the grid. The Register notes that one proposed rule is to “limit the time taken to review connection decisions to 60 days,” ostensibly so applicants don’t get bogged down in a lengthy review process. In a letter about the proposed rule change published to the government’s website, Wright wrote: “To usher in a new era of American prosperity, we must ensure all Americans and domestic industries have access to affordable, reliable, and secure electricity. To do this, large loads, including AI data centers, served by public utilities must be able to connect to the transmission system in a timely, orderly, and non-discriminatory manner. This is an urgent issue that requires prompt attention.” He added: “This Administration is committed to revitalizing domestic manufacturing/ and driving American AI innovation.’ both of which will require unprecedented and extraordinary quantities of electricity and substantial investment in the Nation’s interstate transmission system. We must do so efficiently, fairly, and expeditiously.” The data center industry is booming, and, despite all that “bubble” talk when it comes to the AI business, it shows no signs of slowing down. Companies like Nebiusâwhich most of us had never heard of twelve months agoâare in the process of making themselves essential to large parts of the digital economy. Nebius, which is an AI infrastructure provider (it operates data centers), recently netted a deal with Microsoft, and went in on a robotaxi firm with Uber. Its stock price has also erupted some 350 percent this year, so, suffice to sayâfor the momentâit really pays to have a lot of servers.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 While insider buying is typically slower when markets are near all-time highs and when earnings-reporting season is in full swing, it never seems to dry up altogether. A few notable purchases in the past week or so attest to this. A beneficial owner took advantage of a public offer to increase a stake in a gold and silver miner, while another showed some love for a struggling offshore driller. The chief executives of a biotech also continued acquiring shares. Let’s take a quick look at these notable transactions in the past week or so. What does insider buying tell us? A well-known adage reminds us that corporate insiders and 10% owners really only buy shares of a company because they believe the stock price will rise and they want to profit from it. Thus, insider buying can be an encouraging signal for potential investors. This is all the more so during times of uncertainty in the markets, and even when markets are near all-time highs. With the third-quarter earnings-reporting season underway, many insiders are prohibited from buying or selling shares. Below are some of the most notable insider purchases that were reported recently, starting with the largest and most prominent. This transaction was part of a public offering of Hycroft Mining Holding Corp. (NASDAQ: HYMC) stock that raised approximately $150 million. The Nevada-based miner subsequently announced that it had extinguished all its remaining debt. The stock is almost 88% higher than 90 days ago and was last seen trading almost a dollar per share higher than the buyer’s purchase price. The share price is up 167.6% year over year. The stock has little analyst coverage and no Buy ratings. Yet, the consensus price target is up at $13.61. Note that this Canadian billionaire previously purchased $62 million worth of the shares this summer. Sable Offshore Corp. (NYSE: SOC) stock recently sank to a 52-week low below $12 as the Houston-based company faces multiple legal and regulatory issues. Shares were last seen trading well below the purchase price range above. The offshore oil and gas field operations provider has a mean price target of $39.20, which would be a gain of 207.9% in the next 12 months. All five analysts who cover the stock recommend buying shares. Roth Capital recently reiterated its Buy rating. Note that this buyer’s stake is up to more than 10.9 million shares. Also note that about 24% of all shares are held short. These transactions were part of a private placement. Summit Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: SMMT) posted a wider-than-expected loss for the third quarter, and the stock has retreated 8.1% in the past week. The Miami-based biopharmaceutical company also recently announced the expansion of Phase 3 trials of its colorectal cancer treatment. Despite recent declines, the stock is still up 8.2% year to date and trading for more than the purchase price above. The $31.80 mean price target is less than the $36.91 52-week high, but that target represents a gain of 60.0% in the coming year. Analysts on average recommend buying shares. Co-CEOs Bob Duggan and Maky Zanganeh also purchased shares last month. catnap72 / Getty Images These were not the only notable insider purchases of the past week or so. Here’s a quick look at some others. Recently, some smaller insider buying was reported at Commercial Metals, Denny’s, Fastenal, Fifth Third Bancorp, Heico, Synovus Financial, Toll Brothers, and Uber, as well.

Title: Wall Street Is Worried About an AI Bubble—Here's the Sector Where Stock Prices Really Stand Out

AI boom or AI bubble? That's been one of the most pressing debates on Wall Street of late. Some investors see echoes of the Dotcom Bubble in Nvidia's (NVDA) and OpenAI's recent circular dealmaking bonanza and soaring stock prices. Others note the AI boom is being financed by hugely profitable tech companies, whose valuations aren't nearly as high as their Dotcom peers. As Big Tech's AI spending has ballooned, so have the ranks of companies claiming a piece of the pie. The AI buildout has turbocharged the sales of unsexy, slow-and-steady businesses and transformed their stocks into buzzy growth names. It has also juiced the stocks of nascent companies that are years from self-sufficiency, creating pockets of exceptional froth within a pricey AI ecosystem. The stocks that gain the most during sharp market rallies are often the stocks that, when sentiment turns negative, have the farthest to fall. That is especially true of young companies that, without substantial sales, rely on debt and equity markets to fund their growth. To understand where the AI trade has become most bubbly, Investopedia identified 75 companies regularly referred to as "AI beneficiaries" by Wall Street analysts, and sorted each into one of five categories: cloud computing providers; semiconductor makers; software companies; power providers; and networking, storage, and cooling equipment makers. A few companies, like Microsoft (MSFT), fit in multiple categories, in which case we've placed them in the one that feels most central to their AI business today. At present, Microsoft's cloud revenue is the best metric for assessing its AI business, so it's classified as a cloud provider instead of a software company. All five categories have seen their valuations rise over the past few years, but none more than power providers. The median price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of our power basket in 2025 is 4.53, nearly three times the median in 2023 (1.52). The next largest P/S expansions over that period were in networking, storage and cooling (4.45 in 2025 vs. 2.09 in 2023) and cloud providers (10.5 vs 6.34). (Cloud providers have a higher P/S ratio in absolute terms because the category is composed of tech stocks that have historically commanded higher valuations. This is why we've compared change over the past three years rather than absolute P/S ratios.) Power also has more unprofitable companies than any other category—so many in fact that we’re using price-to-sales as our benchmark valuation metric rather than the more common price-to-earnings ratio. Five of the 14 companies in our power basket are expected to report a loss this calendar year. No other category has more than one unprofitable company. The race to build the data centers that train and run AI models has set off an equally frenzied race to generate and transmit the vast amounts of electricity those data centers consume. Nuclear energy has attracted interest from tech companies for its efficiency and small carbon footprint. Microsoft, Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG), and Meta (META) have all signed multi-billion dollar deals with nuclear power plant operators like Constellation Energy Corp. (CEG) and Vistra (VST), both of which have seen their stocks surge over the past two years. But in their rush to bring reliable sources of electricity online, tech companies and investors have also thrown money at nuclear tech upstarts, some without operational generators or regulatory approvals. Shares of small modular reactor maker NuScale Power (SMR) doubled in value between January and mid-October. At the stock’s peak earlier this month, the company, which reported $37 million in revenue last year and isn’t expected to be profitable until 2029, was valued at more than $15 billion. Meanwhile, nuclear tech startup Oklo’s (OKLO) market capitalization peaked at $25.7 billion earlier this month, a 720% increase from the start of the year. Oklo is the only company of the 75 we’ve included in our analysis that is expected to report no revenue this year. Analysts forecast it will turn a profit for the first time in 2030. Though it’s not just nuclear businesses that have achieved rich valuations. Fermi (FRMI), the developer of a massive AI data center campus in the Texas Panhandle, was founded in January and went public in early October at a valuation of more than $19 billion. Fermi plans to build 11 gigawatts of computing capacity powered by on-site nuclear, natural gas, wind, and solar generators. It expects to break ground on its first data center in March, and hopes to have about 1 GW of capacity online by the end of 2026. AI power stocks just finished a volatile week that may underscore the extent to which their prices are driven by fickle sentiment. Constellation Energy and Vistra both shed more than 10% of their value in the first half of the week, as did GE Vernova (GEV), whose turbines are in high demand from data center clients seeking to draw on the South’s ample supply of natural gas. All three finished the week little changed. The upstarts were hit even harder. NuScale, Oklo, and Fermi all lost more than 25% of their value between Monday's open and midday Wednesday. But they too rebounded, finishing the week with losses in the low- to mid-teens.
