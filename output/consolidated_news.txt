Title: Ondo turns to Figure’s stablecoin with $25M investment to back tokenized fund

Time Published: 2025-11-24T18:37:20Z

The investment broadens Ondo Finance’s onchain Treasury reserves and comes amid a renewed push into crypto-backed lending across fintechs, lenders and exchanges. Ondo Finance bought $25 million worth of YLDS, a yield-bearing stablecoin issued by Figure Technology Solutions, to diversify the assets backing its tokenized US Treasurys fund. The company said Monday that YLDS will be added to a reserves portfolio that already includes tokenized Treasury products from major asset managers, including funds issued by BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton and WisdomTree. Designed for institutional investors, the Ondo Short-Term US Government Bond Fund (OUSG) offers onchain exposure to Treasurys with 24/7 redemptions and an estimated annual return of 3.68%. The tokenized fund had about $777 million in total value locked (TVL) as of this writing. Figure runs lending and capital-markets infrastructure on the Provenance blockchain, and has originated more than $19 billion in loans across home-equity lines, mortgage products, and crypto-backed credit. The deal follows Figure’s completion of its Nasdaq IPO earlier this year. According to DefiLlama data, its YLDS stablecoin has a market capitalization of around $100 million. Ondo Finance is a US-based platform founded in 2021 that tokenizes traditional financial assets. In October, the company expanded its tokenized asset lineup to BNB Chain, adding more than 100 tokenized Wall Street stocks and exchange-traded funds onchain. On Wednesday, the platform received regulatory approval from the Liechtenstein Financial Market Authority (FMA) to offer tokenized stocks in Europe. Figure’s stock price was up nearly 4% in early trading on Monday, according to Yahoo Finance data. Related: Ondo Finance to SEC: Hold off on Nasdaq’s tokenized securities plan Crypto-backed lending is gaining traction globally, and the trend has accelerated in 2025 as more lenders revive and expand crypto-collateralized loan products. In July, Block Earner introduced Bitcoin-backed home loans in Australia, offering borrowers cash worth up to half a property’s value, with the crypto collateral safeguarded by Fireblocks. On Tuesday, stablecoin issuer Tether announced an investment in Ledn, a platform that provides Bitcoin-backed consumer loans. In the third quarter, Ledn reported originating over $390 million in BTC-backed loans. Centralized exchanges are also expanding into this space and broadening their offerings beyond Bitcoin (BTC). On Thursday, Coinbase rolled out Ether-backed loans for US customers, letting users borrow up to $1 million in USDC against their Ether (ETH) holdings. Coinbase’s onchain lending markets have handled about $1.28 billion in loan originations since launching earlier this year, according to Dune data.

Title: Wall Street Just Upgraded NVDA, AMZN, and MP Again

Investing Bernstein, which reiterated an outperform rating on NVDA, says the data center opportunity is still significant and still early, with further upside likely. Goldman Sachs reiterated its buy rating on Amazon, noting that it’s well-positioned for the holidays. Sending You to Google News in 3 © mezzotint / Shutterstock.com Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is still one of the top stocks to own, according to analysts at Bernstein. The firm, which reiterated an outperform rating on NVDA, says the data center opportunity is still significant and still early, with further upside likely. Remember, NVDA just posted EPS of $1.30, which beat estimates by four cents. Revenue of $57 billion, up 62.5% year over year, beat by $1.91 billion. Data center revenue of $51.2 billion was up 25% quarter over quarter, and up 66% year over year. Analysts only expected NVDA to post EPS of $1.25 on $54.83 billion in sales, which would be a 56% jump year over year. Moving forward, Nvidia expects to generate $65 billion in revenue, which would be above expectations of $61.98 billion. Goldman Sachs reiterated its buy rating on Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), noting that it’s well-positioned for the holidays. In most years, Amazon is a no-brainer stock to buy and hold for the holiday rush. In fact, except for 2022, the e-commerce giant has historically pushed higher heading into the holidays, which we expect to happen again this year. Part of the reason for that is that, according to Adobe Analytics: Also, analysts at BMO just upgraded MP Materials (NYSE: MP) to an outperform rating, noting that the dip is a buying opportunity. Remember, with China’s tight control over rare earths and U.S. demand soaring, rare earth stocks are again center stage. And, as noted by CNBC, “Beijing will not allow the export of rare earth materials for use by foreign militaries, China’s Ministry of Commerce announced on Oct. 9. These are the first restrictions imposed by China that specifically target the defense sector, according to Gracelin Baskaran, a critical minerals expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.” All of which is fueling upside in MP Materials, which operates the Mountain Pass mine in California. Two, the U.S. Department of Defense announced it was buying $400 million worth of MP’s preferred stock – positioning itself as the company’s biggest shareholder. And three, MP signed a $500 million deal with Apple, which agreed to buy rare earth magnets from it.

Title: A few hundred employees working on "self-directed projects" has made Valve one of the world's most profitable-per-person companies, on track to top $17 billion this year and shame the likes of Google and Meta

You get a yacht, and you get a yacht When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Analyst estimates of Valve's annual revenue is already around 6% higher than the whole of 2024, meaning it is on track to surpass $17 billion by the end of the year. While this number is already staggering, it is even more impressive in context of how many people the company employs, with likely less than 400 staff members working at the gaming giant. Steam's owner Valve is one of the few independent gaming companies of its size, and this means that despite how much money it makes, it's able to hold its cards close to its chest. This is where analysts help us out, with Alinea Analytics estimating that the company has already earned more than $16.3 billion in the first 11 months of this year. Steam has generated $16B+ in revenue so far this year (@alineaanalytics estimates)That's already up 5.7% from 2024's final total!Taking Valve's cuts into account (and 100% cuts of its own juggernauts CS2 and Dota 2), Valve itself has made over $4B+ this year from Steam. pic.twitter.com/PlMCjDEEgDNovember 13, 2025 Despite Valve's momentous revenue, it only has a few hundred employees. The last time employee information was made public was in 2024, when court documents from 2021 that weren't properly redacted were discovered. As reported by The Verge, the company claimed to have just 336 employees on the payroll, but has likely expanded due to the launch of the Steam Deck. Working with estimates, Valve likely earns $40 - 50 million per employee, blowing companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft out of the water. The Xbox parent company makes the most of the three (I'm sure in no small part due to its history of mass layoffs), but it isn't even close to big daddy Valve at just $18 million per staff member. Valve has been aware that it's on to a winning formula since at least 2012 when it wrote some industry-standard-breaking statements in its still available employee handbook. Not only does the book inform employees that "100%" of their work will be "self-directed projects", but that their pay will be directly correlated with what they produce. "Valve pays people very well compared to industry norms," the book states. "Our profitability per employee is higher than that of Google or Amazon or Microsoft, and we believe strongly that the right thing to do in that case is to put a maximum amount of money back into each employee’s pocket. Valve does not win if you’re paid less than the value you create. And people who work here ultimately don’t win if they get paid more than the value they create." While this last statement looks like a way of paying Valve staff less than desireably, the above mentioned court documents showed that the average Valve employee earned $1.3 million per year back in 2021. Might not be the $50 million that Valve is raking in per person, but Gabe Newell needs to buy his yachts somehow, eh? Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more Steam Machine price "more in line with what you might expect from the current PC market," confirms Valve – but "ideally we'd be pretty competitive with that and have a pretty good deal."

For more information, please contact: Sequana Medical Investor relationsE: IR@sequanamedical.com T: +44 (0) 797 342 9917 About Sequana Medical Sequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload, a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease, heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality, repeated hospitalizations, severe pain, difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care, they become ineffective, intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options, resulting in poor clinical outcomes, high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing "diuretic resistant" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload, and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients, while reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024, following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. In Sequana Medical's POSEIDON study, a landmark study across 18 centers in the US and Canada, the pivotal cohort of 40 patients implanted with the alfapump showed at 6 and 24 months post-implantation the virtual elimination of therapeutic paracentesis and an improvement in quality of life1,2. Sequana Medical is commercializing the alfapump through a specialty commercial team initially targeting US liver transplant centers – 90 of these centers perform more than 90% of US liver transplants annually. In August 2025, CMS announced that it approved the New Technology Add-on Payment for the alfapump when performed in the hospital inpatient setting as of October 1, 2025. Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE, a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study, have been successfully treated with DSR, resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements3. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients, which is dependent on securing additional financing. Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent, Belgium. For further information, please visit www.sequanamedical.com.

Title: AMD to raise graphics card prices by at least 10% in 2026 — price surge attributed to ongoing AI-related DRAM supply crisis

Rising memory prices blamed as GPUs look set to become more expensive in 2026. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. After weeks of hints and speculation, it's now (almost) official: AMD has told its supply partners that it will raise graphics cards prices by at least 10% in the new-year due to rising memory prices, as per analyst Dan Nystedt (via UDN). This is reportedly the second time AMD has raised its prices in recent months, though the first was kept internal and just ate into AMD's margins. This time though, it's passing it on to the partners, who will in turn pass it on to consumers. AMD has notified supply chain partners it will raise graphics card prices 10% across the entire product line due to rising memory chip prices, media report. It will reportedly be AMD’s 2nd such price increase. $AMD $NVDA #Semiconductors https://t.co/pi2hsmmhCANovember 24, 2025 The subject of graphics card pricing has been a contentious one for a number of years now. Prices and power draw have risen generation upon generation, and cryptocurrency-induced shortages have occasionally spiked demand and the cost of a new GPU in turn. 2025 started with something similar, though that seemed to be more down to deliberately constrained supply — or perhaps a shift of Nvidia and AMD's focus to AI. That's only become more apparent throughout the year, and as data centers the world over ate up GPUs, CPUs, memory, storage, and anything else they could get their hands on (including entire power plants), prices for most components have risen in turn. None quite so much as memory, though, which has jumped close to 200% per stick in recent months, and that shortage is now making its way into other industries: most notably, graphics cards. PowerColor recently warned that GPU price rises were coming, and AMD seems to have now confirmed it to its suppliers and board partners. In the translated text, UDN's sources claim it'll be by at least 10%, suggesting that could be the floor of AMD's potential price rises. However, Mr Nystedt suggests that 10% is the figure, so we'll have to wait and see how it shakes out or for an official announcement from AMD, to know for sure. This is unfortunate timing for AMD which has struggled to get the price of its flagship RX 9070 XT even close to its recommended retail price throughout the year. It just managed it this week, hitting $599 for the first-time since release as part of Black Friday. But that seems likely to be incredibly short-lived. Not least because that's a decent deal for a great graphics card. AMD is unlikely to be alone in its GPU prices rises either. Nvidia is expected to have delayed the launch of an RTX 50 Super series of graphics cards because of memory shortages, and unlikely to lose profit on its graphics cards when selling to gamers since it makes so much selling them to data center developers. If you're keen to get ahead of the price rises and want to buy a graphics card before the end of the year, here's our list of the best graphics cards out there right now.

Title: Jeff Bezos' Grim US Economy Prediction Is Coming True

It's hard to turn around without encountering a grim financial prediction these days, and many well-known figures in the finance sphere have had something to say about it. Between the budgetary impact tariffs have on families, the rising cost of groceries, and a higher cost of living for most Americans, even some of the wealthiest people in the country are feeling uneasy. While the economy may not ever be grinding too hard on Amazon founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos, that doesn't change the fact that he made a grim economic prediction that is now coming true. In a 2023 interview with CNN, Bezos warned, "The economy does not look great right now. Things are slowing down. You're seeing layoffs in many, many sectors of the economy." While this observation may not have predicted the sweeping job losses due to 2025's DOGE job and budget cuts, the labor market has hit a brick wall. Per analysis by Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, hiring frequency is the lowest it's been in 14 years. The company's November 2025 reporting stated the United States had cut more than 1 million jobs by October 2025, the highest layoff total since the COVID-19 pandemic was in full swing in 2020. However, Bezos' fortune-telling didn't stop there. Bezos warned consumers and small business owners to "play the probabilities" by cutting big spending. He suggested it might be preferable to have some cash reserves, rather than new gear or appliances, if things get even worse — advice that still rings darkly true in 2025. Bezos did not predict economic recession, but his interview confirms the complex nature of what was to come. Even so, in his CNN interview, he clearly pushed risk aversion across the board, saying, "Try to reduce some risk in your business or your life." Bezos floats near the top of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and despite being one of the richest men in the world, the advice he gave feels applicable to people in many economic classes. For business owners, Bezos warned, "Maybe delay some capital purchases. Do you really need that new piece of equipment? Maybe it could wait a little bit," before going on to say that even small precautions like that delay could be what keeps a business afloat amid economic turmoil. Investors in the market have seen wild volatility in 2025, making Bezos' words seem relevant to pretty much all financial sectors. However, the market bursts as much as it sags, and both small and large investments could have significant weight on many individuals' financial situations. Bezos's suggestion that small business owners avoid risky business also goes against much of what he's done to build his own empire. Bezos is obsessed with taking risks, and he's preoccupied with absorbing competition. In fact, part of why Amazon is so massive is the amount of investment the company made in taking over so many competitors in its path. Americans spend a ton on Amazon every month, so listening to Bezos' business advice might make sense. However, he founded Amazon out of a garage, as a bookselling operation. He's now backing an AI company to program proteins. That doesn't happen without risk. Bezos has been accused of underpaying workers, sneakily underpaying himself, and doing everything to avoid taxes. It takes more than greed and avarice to succeed, but a close look at Bezos's early history shows a degree of strategy beyond using brutish amounts of cash to buy up everything around him. "Take as much risk off the table as you can for yourself," Bezos insisted at the end of his CNN interview. Frugality and austerity may work for surviving the toughest of economic times, but no one knows an individual business better than the owner. Penny pinching too heavily can be the reason a small business fails, rather than thrives. Not purchasing a desperately needed new appliance like a fridge could mean a lot of food and energy goes to waste, and money would go along with it. Everyone must try to best weigh their own economic decisions with their own reality. For some, it might work out to follow some of Bezos' actions rather than his words. After all, if you invested in Amazon 20 years ago, you would be very wealthy now.

Title: BlackRock and Wall Street titans dump MicroStrategy shares in major crypto shake-up - what went wrong?

Wall Street funds, including BlackRock , have been cutting MicroStrategy exposure because the original “high-beta Bitcoin proxy” trade has broken down and the risk/reward on MSTR now looks worse than just owning Bitcoin or Bitcoin ETFs directly. A mix of aggressive dilution, leverage, governance concerns, and looming index/mandate issues has turned what was a clean proxy into something closer to a complex, quasi-closed-end Bitcoin fund with rising structural risks.

Title: A massive tech update will bring faster, cheaper trading to Wall Street. Get ready for stocks on a blockchain
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/24/a-massive-tech-update-will-bring-faster-cheaper-trading-to-wall-street-get-ready-for-stocks-on-a-blockchain/
Time Published: 2025-11-24T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
In early 2021, an army of retail traders made massive bets on meme stocks and briefly melted down the market. Trading volume swelled to such a huge extent that popular brokerage Robinhood had to halt buy orders for stocks like GameStop for a few days in order to escape a liquidity crisis. At the time, the situation led to claims of a conspiracy, but the reason for the meltdown was more mundane: Wall Street’s creaky infrastructure could not settle trades fast enough. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev and others called for an overhaul, and since then there has already been progress, as stock trades now settle a day sooner than in 2021. But the financial industry is also pushing ahead with a more radical solution: turning stocks into digital assets that can be traded and settled instantly on a blockchain. It is not just crypto firms and fintech players leading this charge for “tokenization.” Big banks like J.P. Morgan are also using blockchains to facilitate trades in certain assets and, in doing so, transforming the financial ecosystem more broadly. Already, tokenization—which Tenev has described as a “freight train” poised to eat Wall Street—has brought fundamental changes to how stocks and other assets are traded. The potential upsides to tokenization are huge, but significant questions remain over how to implement it. Meanwhile, some fear the coming train could undermine some protections for individual “retail” investors and destabilize a U.S. equities market whose reliability has for decades been the envy of the world. The tokenization wave isn’t the first push to overhaul Wall Street’s under-the-hood operations. In the 1970s, traders confronted what became known as the “paperwork crisis,” which saw stock markets, drowning in orders, shut down mid-week simply to keep up with recordkeeping. Repeated work stoppages finally led to a computer-based solution. “Once upon a time there were leather-bound journals that said who owns all the stock,” explains Robert Leshner, a former economist who now runs the tokenization firm Superstate. “Then, people said, ‘This is too hard, let’s not update anymore,’ so they decided to create a legal fiction that assigned ownership of all the stock to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation,” or DTCC. The DTCC regime, which has been in place for decades, means it’s no longer necessary to record every single share transfer. Instead, the clearinghouse keeps track of the stock held by different brokerages on behalf of their customers and settles up transactions between those brokerages the next business day. Under this system, the brokerages nominally own the stock, but all the rights that attach to it—dividends, voting privileges, and so on—remain with the customers. The system has worked pretty well over the decades, and for those who insist on doing things the old-fashioned way, DTCC means they can still demand physical copies of their shares. (This option is popular with “GameStop truthers,” who believe reverting to paper will thwart a Wall Street conspiracy against retail investors.) Now, though, the current DTCC system of “T+1”—in which the clearinghouse closes out trades the next business day by reconciling accounts among brokerages—has come to feel outdated in an age when so much business is conducted instantly and around the clock. This has prompted companies like Leshner’s Superstate to offer a faster alternative. The startup is working with companies to issue versions of their shares that trade on a blockchain, an arrangement under which the firms don’t have to rely on intermediaries to hold or track their stock. It also means stock trades can be settled instantly, while allowing firms to interact with their shareholders more directly. Outside the U.S., tokenized assets are already helping investors avoid big trading commissions and invest in private companies like SpaceX Other firms are approaching tokenization in a different fashion. Robinhood, for example, doesn’t help firms tokenize their stocks, but instead takes stocks available on the open market and offers them in a blockchain “wrapper” as a sort of derivative. These offerings are currently available only in Europe, where stock owners can buy and sell the “Stock Tokens” alongside assets like Bitcoin. Retail investors unfamiliar with tokenization may be surprised, and possibly alarmed, to discover that a company they own is trading in the crypto-verse. For now, at least, it’s not something to worry about.Currently, even tokenization boosters say the new blockchain system will exist alongside the old one rather than replace it. So why do all this in the first place? For the average investor who trades only from time to time, the arrival of tokenized assets won’t mean much. Active traders, though, will appreciate the move to blockchain, since it opens the door for more trading after hours and on weekends. The new regime will also be appealing to institutional investors, since it will free up collateral that might otherwise be tied up waiting for settlement. “Imagine you’re a hedge fund and want to buy $1 million of Tesla stock,” says Johann Kerbrat, SVP of Robinhood Crypto. “You buy it on Friday, so you don’t have the money anymore, but you don’t get the shares in your account until Monday. So for three days, you can’t do anything.” It’s not just stocks being tokenized. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, working with Superstate’s tokenization rival Securitize, offers access to money-market funds and U.S. Treasuries via blockchain, and has already grown to $2 billion in assets under management. Meanwhile,J.P. Morgan is offering tokenized versions of private equity assets on its in-house Kinexys blockchain, in part because the process makes capital calls easier to track and manage. This is likely just the beginning. Rob Hadick, a partner at venture capital firm Dragonfly Capital, notes that other realms of finance like credit and fixed income are still conducted primarily in pre-digital fashion, with some transactions still made official by means of a fax. A switch to tokenization could enable such transactions to settle faster and more reliably. Hadick says it will also produce savings for banks and brokerages since it will reduce the ranks of back-office staff and disrupt specialized middlemen who handle tasks like loan origination and servicing fees. Meanwhile, for traders of all sorts, tokenized assets will be easier to move across brokerages or post as collateral. It is still early days, especially in the U.S., where the Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to give the green light to tokenized equities. As of mid-November, the total value of such assets worldwide was about $660 million, according to research site RWA.xyz; the most popular ones include tokenized versions of index-tracking ETFs and Big Tech stocks such as Tesla, Nvidia, and Alphabet. But that nascent state hasn’t stopped brokerages from pushing forward, including crypto shop Kraken, whose tokenized versions of select U.S. stocks are doing a brisk trade in markets like Brazil and South Africa, where traders still pay hefty commissions that can amount to 10% or more, even as such fees have largely been eliminated in the U.S. Robinhood, meanwhile, got its hands on shares of privately held OpenAI and SpaceX, and has given away tokenized versions of them to European customers. As for the DTCC, it would be easy to assume the clearinghouse opposes the tokenization wave. Quite the opposite: According to two sources familiar with the company, the outfit is eager to move into blockchain, partly because it offers a potential way to expand into private markets. Asked for comment, the DTCC did not provide details but did suggest it is embracing the technology. “DTCC believes in the power and potential of tokenization to evolve and modernize market infrastructure. We are actively working to enable capabilities that further our products and services,” said Brian Steele, DTCC’s president of clearing and securities services. Not everyone is convinced a rush to tokenization is a good thing. Those urging caution include Citadel Securities, which has asked the SEC to adopt a go-slow approach. According to a source close to the firm, the trading giant fears that some crypto-aligned firms want to use the rulemaking process around tokenization to gain exemptions from long-standing consumer protection obligations. The person also expressed concern that a rapid shift could undermine trust in a U.S. equities market that is the biggest in the world and has been fine-tuned for decades. This concern may not be unfounded. Already, there have been notable discrepancies between the prices of traditional shares of a company’s stock and the prices of tokenized versions offered by the likes of Kraken. Meanwhile, it’s unclear if every firm offering tokenized equities has put in place adequate guardrails when it comes to custody and fiduciary obligations to the customer. What happens, for instance, in the event of a crypto firm going bankrupt while holding tokenized shares of a customer’s stock? And while every financial institution appears to view blockchain as the technology of the future, they may not agree as to which blockchain. Robinhood, among others, is relying on the open-source Ethereum chain to build out its tokenization business, while J.P. Morgan appears wedded to its own proprietary chain. According to Hadick, the venture capitalist, this situation could slow adoption, since, he says, other big firms like Goldman Sachs will be reluctant to rely on a blockchain controlled by a rival. Hadick adds, though, that any impasse is unlikely to last long, since “one thing blockchains do well is coordinate trust.” This article appears in the December 2025/January 2026 issue of Fortune with the headline: “Get ready to own a tokenized portfolio.” This article is part of Fortune’s 2025 Investor’s Guide.

Retail investors unfamiliar with tokenization may be surprised, and possibly alarmed, to discover that a company they own is trading in the crypto-verse. For now, at least, it’s not something to worry about.Currently, even tokenization boosters say the new blockchain system will exist alongside the old one rather than replace it. So why do all this in the first place? For the average investor who trades only from time to time, the arrival of tokenized assets won’t mean much. Active traders, though, will appreciate the move to blockchain, since it opens the door for more trading after hours and on weekends. The new regime will also be appealing to institutional investors, since it will free up collateral that might otherwise be tied up waiting for settlement. “Imagine you’re a hedge fund and want to buy $1 million of Tesla stock,” says Johann Kerbrat, SVP of Robinhood Crypto. “You buy it on Friday, so you don’t have the money anymore, but you don’t get the shares in your account until Monday. So for three days, you can’t do anything.” It’s not just stocks being tokenized. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, working with Superstate’s tokenization rival Securitize, offers access to money-market funds and U.S. Treasuries via blockchain, and has already grown to $2 billion in assets under management. Meanwhile,J.P. Morgan is offering tokenized versions of private equity assets on its in-house Kinexys blockchain, in part because the process makes capital calls easier to track and manage. This is likely just the beginning. Rob Hadick, a partner at venture capital firm Dragonfly Capital, notes that other realms of finance like credit and fixed income are still conducted primarily in pre-digital fashion, with some transactions still made official by means of a fax. A switch to tokenization could enable such transactions to settle faster and more reliably. Hadick says it will also produce savings for banks and brokerages since it will reduce the ranks of back-office staff and disrupt specialized middlemen who handle tasks like loan origination and servicing fees. Meanwhile, for traders of all sorts, tokenized assets will be easier to move across brokerages or post as collateral. It is still early days, especially in the U.S., where the Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to give the green light to tokenized equities. As of mid-November, the total value of such assets worldwide was about $660 million, according to research site RWA.xyz; the most popular ones include tokenized versions of index-tracking ETFs and Big Tech stocks such as Tesla, Nvidia, and Alphabet. But that nascent state hasn’t stopped brokerages from pushing forward, including crypto shop Kraken, whose tokenized versions of select U.S. stocks are doing a brisk trade in markets like Brazil and South Africa, where traders still pay hefty commissions that can amount to 10% or more, even as such fees have largely been eliminated in the U.S. Robinhood, meanwhile, got its hands on shares of privately held OpenAI and SpaceX, and has given away tokenized versions of them to European customers. As for the DTCC, it would be easy to assume the clearinghouse opposes the tokenization wave. Quite the opposite: According to two sources familiar with the company, the outfit is eager to move into blockchain, partly because it offers a potential way to expand into private markets. Asked for comment, the DTCC did not provide details but did suggest it is embracing the technology. “DTCC believes in the power and potential of tokenization to evolve and modernize market infrastructure. We are actively working to enable capabilities that further our products and services,” said Brian Steele, DTCC’s president of clearing and securities services. Not everyone is convinced a rush to tokenization is a good thing. Those urging caution include Citadel Securities, which has asked the SEC to adopt a go-slow approach. According to a source close to the firm, the trading giant fears that some crypto-aligned firms want to use the rulemaking process around tokenization to gain exemptions from long-standing consumer protection obligations. The person also expressed concern that a rapid shift could undermine trust in a U.S. equities market that is the biggest in the world and has been fine-tuned for decades. This concern may not be unfounded. Already, there have been notable discrepancies between the prices of traditional shares of a company’s stock and the prices of tokenized versions offered by the likes of Kraken. Meanwhile, it’s unclear if every firm offering tokenized equities has put in place adequate guardrails when it comes to custody and fiduciary obligations to the customer. What happens, for instance, in the event of a crypto firm going bankrupt while holding tokenized shares of a customer’s stock? And while every financial institution appears to view blockchain as the technology of the future, they may not agree as to which blockchain. Robinhood, among others, is relying on the open-source Ethereum chain to build out its tokenization business, while J.P. Morgan appears wedded to its own proprietary chain. According to Hadick, the venture capitalist, this situation could slow adoption, since, he says, other big firms like Goldman Sachs will be reluctant to rely on a blockchain controlled by a rival. Hadick adds, though, that any impasse is unlikely to last long, since “one thing blockchains do well is coordinate trust.” This article appears in the December 2025/January 2026 issue of Fortune with the headline: “Get ready to own a tokenized portfolio.” This article is part of Fortune’s 2025 Investor’s Guide.

MAGA Liz Wolfe | 11.24.2025 9:30 AM Trumpworld schism: On Friday night, MAGA Queen Marjorie Taylor Greene announced her resignation from Congress. "I've always represented the common American man and woman as a member of the House of Representatives, which is why I've always been despised in Washington, D.C. and just never fit in. Americans are used by the political industrial complex of both political parties, election cycle after election cycle, in order to elect whichever side can convince Americans to hate the other side more," the Georgia Republican said in her resignation video: My message to Georgia's 14th district and America.Thank you. pic.twitter.com/tSoHCeAjn1 — Marjorie Taylor Greene ???????? (@mtgreenee) November 22, 2025 Greene struck predictably populist America First notes ("Americans' hard-earned tax dollars always fund foreign wars, foreign aid, and foreign interests") and mapped her disagreements with the president ("H1Bs replacing American jobs, AI state moratoriums, debt for life 50 year mortgage scams, standing strongly against all involvement in foreign wars, and demanding the release of the Epstein files") while touting her loyalty. Read her full statement here. The Reason Roundup Newsletter by Liz Wolfe Liz and Reason help you make sense of the day's news every morning. Until recently, Greene and President Donald Trump seemed to be thick as thieves. But the Epstein files tore them asunder, with Greene positioning herself as an ardent advocate for full transparency while Trump (until recently) refused to go along. The president, pissed off by Greene's adamance, disavowed her and started publicly musing about how someone should mount a primary challenge, calling his once-loyal acolyte a "ranting lunatic." The Epstein issue wedged the door open for Greene to raise more grievances with Trump, especially the idea that he's been getting distracted from his domestic agenda and hasn't delivered much financial relief to the American people. The conflict came to a head during the recent government shutdown. "I don't see political party lines," said Greene, discussing health care and the many Americans who could soon see premiums spiking. Greene criticized her own side for having no workable plan in place to prevent these higher costs. "I don't know what happened to Marjorie," said Trump recently. "Nice woman, but I don't know what happened. She's lost her way, I think." Many of her constituents are still behind her. "I feel like she has stood her ground," Meredith Rosson, a 43-year-old paralegal and the chairwoman of the Republican Party in Chattooga County, told The New York Times. The Republican Party in Floyd County, also in Greene's district, issued a statement of "unwavering support" for Greene as soon as she announced her resignation. "She's realized, 'I need to do what's right for my community and for people who are mostly in the middle ground,'" cocktail bar/gun store owner Brandon Pledger told the Times. Scenes from New York: "Violent crime is overwhelmingly the work of a small group of repeat offenders—that is, it is highly concentrated. The remedy, as [James Q.] Wilson argued half a century ago in his classic book Thinking About Crime, is not social engineering but incapacitation: keeping the violent few from striking again," argues Tal Fortgang in City Journal. "In 2022, the New York Times reported that 'nearly a third of all shoplifting arrests in New York City…involved just 327 people,' or 0.004 percent of the population, who had been 'arrested and rearrested more than 6,000 times.'" Q: Are you affirming that you think President Trump is a fascist? MAMDANI: I've spoken about-- TRUMP: That's okay. You can just say yes.

November 24, 2025 08:30 ET | Source: AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. Chicago, Nov. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global low fat cheese market was valued at US$ 121.6 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach US$ 160.1 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 3.1% from 2025–2033. Stakeholders in the low fat cheese market must recognize that vague health claims no longer satisfy consumers; specific nutrient density is the new currency. For instance, Babybel Light has set a strict calorie-controlled benchmark with exactly 50 calories per piece, while Sargento Reduced Fat Sharp Cheddar directly addresses lipid concerns by delivering just 5 grams of fat per serving. Concurrently, protein maximization is reshaping formulation strategies, evidenced by Arla Protein Lite Cheddar slices offering a substantial 20 grams of protein per serving. Similarly, Horizon Organic Lowfat Cottage Cheese provides a robust 14 grams of protein per half-cup serving. Arla’s innovation extends further, boasting 40% less fat than standard cheddar, proving that consumers demand high functionality without dietary compromise. Request Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/low-fat-cheese-market Beyond macronutrients, sodium reduction has become a precise science within the low fat cheese market. Standard Swiss cheese naturally leads with a low 53 milligrams of sodium per ounce, setting a high bar for processed alternatives. In the cooking segment, Ricotta cheese averages 123 milligrams of sodium per half-cup serving, whereas newer low-salt white cheese formulations in 2024 have reached 400 milligrams of sodium per 30-gram serving. Manufacturers like Sargento are also fortifying these reduced-fat matrices with Vitamin A Palmitate to restore lost nutritional density. These meticulous specifications highlight a shift where every milligram counts in the consumer's decision-making process. Key Findings in Low Fat Cheese Market Global Production Capabilities are Shaping Supply Chain Availability Supply volume acts as the backbone of the growing low fat cheese market, with global cheese production forecast to reach a massive 22.55 million metric tons in the 2024/2025 marketing year. Within the United States, total cheese production was projected to hit 6.55 million metric tons in 2024, providing ample base material for nutritional modification. Specifically, Italian-type cheese production—critical for low-fat mozzarella variants—totaled 499 million pounds in August 2024 alone. Notably, US Mozzarella production accounts for 79.5% of the total Italian cheese category, significantly outpacing American-type cheese production, which totaled 478 million pounds in the same month. Regional production hubs in the low fat cheese market are adjusting their outputs to feed this global appetite. Australia's cheese production is projected to reach 435,000 metric tons in 2024, while New Zealand produced 400,000 tons in the 2023/2024 cycle to meet export needs. Domestically, US per capita cheese consumption reached nearly 42 pounds per person in the 2024 reporting cycle, signaling robust demand. Trends indicate that Mozzarella sticks will see the fastest segment growth through 2034, while Ricotta cheese held the largest product segment share in 2024. Such volume data confirms that the market is supported by a highly active global production network. Inventory Deficits Signal Tightening Conditions For Market Stakeholders Recent data suggests a tightening of supply that could increase urgency within the low fat cheese market. US natural cheese stocks in cold storage dropped by 33 million pounds in September 2024, a significant contraction relative to expectations. Furthermore, the US$A revised its August 2024 stock figures downward by 6.6 million pounds, compounding the deficit. American cheese stocks specifically fell by 29 million pounds in September 2024. These reductions imply that demand is outpacing immediate storage capabilities, creating potential pinch points for retailers seeking consistent inventory flow. However, contrasting inventory signals present a complex landscape for buyers. Total butter stocks exceeded forecasts by 7 million pounds in September 2024, creating a divergence between fat and protein commodities. Forward-looking projections for December 2024 showed a potential 19 million pound surplus in cheese stocks, suggesting relief may be on the horizon. In related protein sectors, pork bellies stocks dropped 25% in August 2024, while overall US natural cheese supplies ended August 2024 1% lower than the previous month. Stakeholders in the low fat cheese market must navigate these mixed inventory signals to optimize procurement strategies. Volatile Wholesale Costs are Directly Influencing Retail Margin Structures Fluctuations in raw material costs are currently dictating the profitability of the low fat cheese market. On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Cheddar block prices traded at US$ 1.79 per pound for the week ending November 15, 2025, showing distinct volatility compared to the US$ 1.50 per pound recorded in January 2024. Meanwhile, Cheddar barrel prices reached US$ 2.005 per pound in August 2024, creating an unusual dynamic where processing cheese cost more than blocks. The price gap between block and barrel cheese stood at 4.75 cents in August 2024, a metric that processors watch closely when calculating margins for shredded low-fat blends. International auctions reflect similarly high valuations for key ingredients. Global Cheddar cheese prices at the Global Dairy Trade auction averaged US$ 4,973 per metric ton in November 2024, while Mozzarella prices averaged US$ 4,607 per metric ton. Additionally, Dry whey prices—often used in protein fortification—averaged 62.6 cents per pound in November 2025. These input costs force manufacturers in the low fat cheese market to balance premium pricing with competitive value propositions. Rising wholesale indices suggest that cost containment will remain a primary challenge for the remainder of the fiscal year. Premium Retail Pricing Reflects Strong Demand For Healthy Variants Retailers are successfully maintaining premium price points, validating the value-add nature of the low fat cheese market. Horizon Organic Lowfat Cottage Cheese, for example, retails for US$ 6.49 per 16-ounce tub, positioning it as a high-tier option. In the snacking aisle, Babybel Reduced Fat commands approximately US$ 4.99 at major US retailers, while Knudsen Lowfat Cottage Cheese holds a similar price point of US$ 4.99 for a 16-ounce container. These consistent price floors indicate that health-conscious consumers are willing to absorb higher costs for perceived nutritional benefits. Convenience formats further enhance margin potential for retailers in the low fat cheese market. Sargento Balanced Breaks retail for US$ 4.99 per 3-pack unit, capitalizing on the intersection of health and portability. Similarly, Frigo Cheese Heads in the string cheese segment retail for US$ 6.49 for a 10-ounce pack. Even in the meal category, Amy’s Kitchen Light in Sodium Macaroni & Cheese retails for US$ 3.79 per 9-ounce package, while Organic Valley 2% Milk—a key input proxy—retails for US$ 5.99 per gallon. These figures confirm that the market supports robust pricing structures across diverse product categories. Expanding International Trade Volumes are Reshaping Export Demand Channels in Low Fat Cheese Market Export markets are absorbing a significant portion of production, acting as a vital release valve for the market. US cheese exports totaled 42,459 metric tons in August 2024 alone. Impressively, cumulative US cheese exports for the first eight months of 2024 reached roughly 60,146 metric tons above the previous year's baseline. Mexico remains a primary partner, with exports increasing by 2,256 metric tons in August 2024. Within that flow, exports of "Other Cheese"—a category often housing processed and low-fat blends—rose by 1,942 metric tons, highlighting specific demand for versatile formulations. Global appetite extends beyond North America low fat cheese market, influencing long-term trade forecasts. US cheese exports to the MENA region increased by 1,245 metric tons in August 2024. Looking ahead, Japan is forecast to import an additional 6,886 metric tons of US cheddar-type cheeses between 2025 and 2026, adding to a total import volume that exceeded 251,913 metric tons. However, shifts are evident; Cheddar exports to Japan fell by 1,742 metric tons in August 2024, suggesting a pivot toward other varieties. With total US cheese exports for 2024 forecast to hit a record 508,808 metric tons, international trade remains a pillar of the market. Major Market Players Face Intense Competition From Private Label The competitive landscape of the low fat cheese market is defined by a battle between legacy brands and store-brand dominance. Sargento Foods remains a powerhouse, reporting peak annual revenue of US$ 1.3 billion in 2024, with shredded unit sales recorded at 116 million units. However, Kraft continues to lead in volume, with shredded unit sales reaching 266 million units. Despite these massive branded numbers, Private Label shredded cheese—often the entry point for budget-conscious low-fat shoppers—achieved a staggering 1.25 billion unit sales, dwarfing individual branded competitors. Smaller segments show equally fierce positioning battles. Tillamook recorded 42 million unit sales in the natural cheese category, carving out a premium niche. In the shelf-stable arena, Sargento holds the position of the No. 8 seller, while Mondelēz International saw cheese unit sales of 13 million. These metrics illustrate that while brand equity drives revenue, volume in the low fat cheese market is heavily swayed by private label accessibility. Brands must therefore innovate relentlessly to justify their price premiums against generic alternatives. Looking for Country-Level or Section-Wise Data? Customize This Report: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/report-walkthrough/low-fat-cheese-market Product Innovations and Dietary Inclusivity Define Future Growth Vectors Innovation in 2024 has focused heavily on "permissible indulgence" and dietary inclusivity. Arla Foods launched a new line of organic low-fat cottage cheese in February 2024, catering to the clean-label demographic. Similarly, Saputo Inc. introduced LightLife Mozzarella Shreds for foodservice, while Horizon Organic introduced a new organic low-fat cheese product in April 2024. These launches underscore the industry's pivot toward functional, high-quality offerings that elevate the perception of the low fat cheese market. Europe’s market value of US$ 38.9 billion in 2024 further validates the scale of this opportunity. Beyond traditional dairy, allergen-free attributes are expanding the addressable market. Babybel Plant-Based contains 0 grams of lactose, appealing to those with sensitivities, while Bel Brands expanded its dairy-free distribution to major retailers like Costco in 2024. Ricotta cheese held the largest product segment share in 2024, driven by its versatility in healthy cooking. Furthermore, gluten-free and lactose-free claims were key drivers in Arla's 2024 product expansions. These diverse innovation vectors ensure that the low fat cheese market remains dynamic and relevant to evolving consumer lifestyles.

Title: Strong Earnings Highlight Growing Investor Confidence in Hospitality Automation

November 24, 2025 08:30 ET | Source: AINewsWire AINewsWire AUSTIN, Texas, Nov. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AINewsWire Editorial Coverage: Amid persistent inflation, cautious capital markets and uneven industry performance, investors are placing heightened importance on one metric above all: whether a company can deliver credible, measurable earnings improvement. This scrutiny is especially pronounced in fast-growing fields such as artificial intelligence and service robotics, where technological breakthroughs are plentiful but true financial execution is less common. That distinction helps explain why Nightfood Holdings Inc. (NGTF) (Profile) stands out following its most recent quarterly results, which reported an approximately $91.5 million increase in temporary equity. The gain stems from the company’s strategic hotel acquisitions, designed to accelerate deployment of its AI-driven robotics model. According to Nightfood, completing and converting these transactions is expected to materially strengthen the company’s balance sheet and support its progress toward uplisting, marking a significant milestone in its evolution into a data-centric hospitality automation platform. In doing so, the company is emerging as a leader at the intersection of hospitality, artificial intelligence and robotics, alongside other innovators in the AI and automation space, including Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD), Pegasystems Inc. (NASDAQ: PEGA), Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE: TSM). Click here to view the custom infographic of the Nightfood Holdings editorial. Automation Race Sharpens, Financial Performance Becomes True Differentiator As automation reshapes service industries worldwide, the hospitality market has become a real-time testing ground for AI-driven robotics. With wages rising, staffing shortages persisting and hotels requiring 24/7 operational consistency, demand for automated systems capable of handling guest services, logistics and routine workflows continues to climb. Independent analysts point to accelerating adoption. Grand View Research projects the global service robotics sector to expand from roughly $47 billion in 2023 to about $107.8 billion by 2030, propelled by increased uptake in hospitality, logistics, healthcare and retail. For hotel operators, AI-enhanced automation has quickly shifted from “emerging technology” to competitive requirement. Robots are being deployed for food and beverage delivery, restocking, housekeeping support and customer interaction. One industry survey found that 78% of hotel leaders expect to increase technology spending over the next three years, highlighting the sector’s push toward workflow automation, digital guest services and AI-enabled efficiency. These investments are motivated by more than operational convenience. Research indicates that companies integrating robotics into labor-intensive processes can achieve 20–30% cost reductions, especially in repetitive and high-turnover functions. Yet financial markets remain wary of automation firms that lack measurable traction. Despite impressive engineering, many robotics companies remain in pilot phases or prerevenue. In contrast, a smaller set of innovators is beginning to demonstrate tangible balance sheet improvement, recurring revenue opportunities and scaling capability. In today’s macroeconomic climate, quarterly financial performance serves as a vital indicator of credibility and separates viable automation platforms from unproven concepts. Strategic Acquisitions Drive $91.5M Equity Improvement Nightfood reported an estimated $91.5 million improvement in temporary equity for the quarter ending September 30, 2025. This momentum can be directly tied to two major hotel portfolio acquisitions that the company views as foundational infrastructure for its AI-driven Robots-as-a-Service (RaaS) strategy. On September 18, Nightfood closed a $31 million transaction for a 155-room Holiday Inn property, describing it as an AI hospitality innovation hub. This location functions as a living laboratory where the company can refine its robotics systems, measure efficiency gains and demonstrate real-world utility. Soon after, Nightfood announced an agreement involving a $52.8 million Hilton Garden Inn portfolio, further broadening its operational base. These hospitality assets are intended not only to support robotics deployment but to eventually convert into perpetual equity, reducing financing costs and strengthening long-term capital efficiency. The dual outcome, operational scale and stronger capitalization, is a key component of the company’s strategy. Unlike robotics firms relying exclusively on external clients, Nightfood’s approach integrates technology into properties it owns or operates. This allows the company to collect performance data, trial new automation tools and capture the economic upside produced by efficiency improvements. It also positions the company to iterate faster, validate commercial use cases and ultimately expand with a more compelling value proposition. Equity Conversion Poised to Lift Shareholder Value Nightfood has stated that much of the newly consolidated temporary equity is expected to convert to perpetual equity upon uplisting, an inflection point that may materially strengthen long-term financial stability. Transforming temporary financing structures into permanent equity reduces uncertainty, improves debt-to-equity ratios and enhances valuation metrics that institutional investors closely monitor. “These transactions enhance our platform with substantial assets, revenue streams and operational capacity,” the company stated. “More importantly, the consolidation of these entities resulted in the recognition of $91.5 million in additional temporary equity, dramatically strengthening our balance sheet.” “Management believes that a significant portion of this temporary equity will convert to perpetual equity upon the company’s anticipated uplisting, further enhancing long-term shareholder value,” the announcement continued. “But beyond the financial impact, these acquisitions are cornerstones of our strategy to build a vertically integrated robotics ecosystem. By combining automation innovation with hard real estate assets, we are creating a unique model where our robotics technology can be deployed, tested, and scaled within our own properties, while simultaneously generating recurring hospitality revenue.” The company further emphasized that converting this equity upon uplisting could help establish a vertically integrated robotics ecosystem, where automation technology is deployed and scaled across company-controlled hotel environments. This model allows Nightfood to test, optimize and commercialize its robotics systems while generating recurring hospitality revenue and building long-term enterprise value. Advancing Toward Uplisting and Institutional-Grade Financial Standards The company’s strengthened financials support its next strategic objective: readiness for uplisting to a national exchange. Such a transition typically requires more rigorous governance, stronger balance sheet fundamentals and enhanced disclosure standards. For AI and robotics companies competing for market share, uplisting represents a powerful differentiator. Access to institutional capital markets is especially valuable for automation platforms that require sustained investment to scale hardware, software and deployment infrastructure. Firms operating solely on over-the-counter markets may face higher capital costs and reduced investor visibility. By restructuring its financial position and pursuing uplisting, Nightfood aims to align itself with companies capable of meeting institutional expectations, an increasingly important signal in an environment where investors are scrutinizing fundamentals more closely than ever. Strengthened Financials Support RaaS Acceleration Nightfood’s improved capital position is intended to fuel expansion of its RaaS platform, a subscription-driven business model that deploys autonomous robots across hotel operations. RaaS allows customers to adopt robotics with minimal upfront cost, while generating predictable recurring revenue for the provider, a useful model in industries facing labor instability. This milestone aligns with the company’s larger plan to transition under its robotics brand and operate as an asset-backed automation enterprise built around scalable hotel-based deployment centers. The company’s vertically integrated approach enables it to deploy robots for delivery, cleaning and operational analytics within its own properties, using these facilities as controlled testbeds for real-world optimization. In addition, strengthening the capital structure enhances Nightfood’s ability to secure future funding and advance its uplisting objectives. By retaining control, Nightfood can iterate more quickly, measure system performance and capture more of the economic gains associated with automation. These hotel hubs effectively function as distributed robotics development and deployment centers. Capital Strength Positions Company for High-Growth Market Expansion The company’s bolstered capital structure provides a runway for growth in the wider commercial automation sector. Service robotics are increasingly becoming mission-critical components of business operations, particularly in environments challenged by workforce shortages. Multiple industry research suggests that companies adopting robotics outperform peers during recovery cycles, due in part to efficiency gains and operating leverage associated with automation. With Nightfood’s expanding hospitality automation hubs and reinforced balance sheet, the company aims to establish a defensible position in this accelerating market. By combining real estate-backed deployment infrastructure, a recurring RaaS model and a strengthened financial foundation, Nightfood is positioning itself to participate meaningfully in the multibillion-dollar service robotics market. As automation shifts from experimental to essential across hospitality and commercial sectors, the company’s financial progress signals not only operational traction but a growing role in shaping the future of AI-powered hotel automation. Global Leaders Accelerate Innovation Across AI Landscape Artificial intelligence continues to evolve at a rapid pace as major innovators worldwide deepen their investments in infrastructure, enterprise-grade platforms and transformative real-world deployments. From large-scale data center expansion to new AI-driven productivity tools and advanced computing rollouts, the latest developments reflect a sector moving quickly into its next phase of global integration. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) will join a joint venture (JV) aimed to support the development of Saudi Arabia’s position as a leading provider of world-class AI solutions for regional and global customers. The company will partner with Cisco and HUMAIN, a PIF company delivering global full-stack AI solutions in the JV. According to the AMD, the three companies will serve as founding investors in the effort, which is expected to begin operations in 2026 with plans to combine HUMAIN’s state-of-the-art data centers with AMD and Cisco technology, delivering modern data-center capacity with efficient power and lower capital expenditures. AMD and Cisco will act as exclusive technology partners to the joint venture, contributing their portfolio of products and services to its development of up to 1 GW of AI infrastructure by 2030. Pegasystems Inc. (NASDAQ: PEGA) announced the general availability of Pega Infinity '25, the industry’s first agentic enterprise transformation platform to deliver trustworthy, predictable AI agents at scale. New features empower organizations to reimagine legacy systems, automate work with reliable AI agents and boost productivity. According to the company, enterprise leaders modernizing legacy systems with AI are finding most agentic AI solutions fall short, with new MIT research revealing that 95% of enterprise AI initiatives fail. Pega Infinity takes a fundamentally different approach, harnessing AI’s creative potential while promoting dependable execution for enterprise-grade reliability. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) is working with Arizona State University (ASU) to make it the first Division I NCAA football program in the nation to deploy a fleet of AI PCs during the 2025-26 off season. Piloting this technology will give coaches, players and staff a competitive edge on and off the field, transforming how the team recruits, prepares and engages its fan base. ASU is deploying a fleet of Lenovo ThinkPad X9-14 Gen 1 PCs, powered by the Intel vPro(R) platform, to its football program to evaluate how on-device AI can help the team work smarter and optimize their performance. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE: TSM) plans to expand its investment in advanced semiconductor manufacturing in the United States by an additional $100 billion. Building on the company’s ongoing $65 billion investment in its advanced semiconductor manufacturing operations in Phoenix, Arizona, TSMC’s total investment in the U.S. is expected to reach $165 billion. The expansion includes plans for three new fabrication plants, two advanced packaging facilities and a major R&D team center, solidifying this project as the largest single foreign direct investment in U.S. history. These advancements illustrate how rapidly the AI ecosystem is expanding and how diverse its applications have become. As these initiatives move from planning to full deployment, they will help define the capabilities, competitiveness and global reach of AI technologies in the decade ahead.

Landlords in Foxrock, Co Dublin, are commanding the highest average rents in the State at almost €4,000 a month, latest data from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) shows. Renting a home in the south Dublin neighbourhood in the first quarter of this year would set a household back an average of €3,718 a month, said the CSO. Areas in south Dublin had the top 10 highest rents at the start of the year, with Goatstown in second place (€3,104 per month), followed by Dalkey, Killiney, Glenageary, Sandymount, Booterstown, Blackrock, Ballsbridge and Donnybrook, where average rents were €2,547. Outside Dublin the highest rents were in Greystones and Delgany, both in Co Wicklow (€2,331 and €2,077 per month), Bishopstown, Co Cork (€2,043) and Barna, Co Galway (€1,961). Across local authority housing, there was a 6 per cent increase in rents on average over the 12 months to September 2025. The rental figures, drawn from Residential Tenancies Board statistics, are among a wealth of information collated on the CSO’s housing information hub, including property prices, housing commencements and completions, planning permissions and vacant dwellings numbers. Property prices continued to increase this year compared with last, though by almost twice as much outside Dublin (9.4 per cent) as in the capital (5.3 per cent). On new homes, the number of dwellings granted planning permission was down 13 per cent – from 8,513 units in the third quarter of last year to 7,447 in 2025. However, the number of dwelling completions was up 13 per cent in the first three quarters of the year, standing at 24,325, compared with the same period in 2024. There were 177,600 people working in the construction industry. Among these, 67 per cent mainly worked on new housing developments or renovations. Average hourly labour costs for the sector were €34.22 in third quarter of this year, up from €30.85 in the second quarter of last year. Data shows that home heating fuels of choice are changing. As of the third quarter this year the most common main heating fuel across all dwellings was gas (35 per cent), followed by heating oil and electricity. For homes built since 2015 however, the most common heating fuel was electricity. Homes constructed from 2020 to the third quarter of this year were 93 per cent electrically heated, with 6 per cent using gas and less than 1 per cent using oil. Statistics on building energy ratings (BERs) show Kildare had the highest proportion of A-rated homes (28 per cent), followed by Meath (27 per cent) and Dublin county (27 per cent), while the lowest were in Leitrim and Cork city (both 5 per cent). The highest proportions of G-rated dwellings were in counties Roscommon and Leitrim (11 per cent). [ ‘I don’t think Balbriggan was ready for this amount of people’: The challenges facing a Dublin commuter townOpens in new window ] In the Dublin postal districts, the highest proportions of A-rated homes were in Dublin 18 which includes Foxrock, Sandyford and Stepaside (43 per cent), Dublin 13 including Sutton and Howth (31 per cent), and Dublin 20 including Chapelizod and Palmerstown (28 per cent). The lowest level of A ratings in the capital was 7 per cent in Dublin 7, which includes Cabra, Phibsborough and Smithfield. In the last three months of 2023, the estimated national vacancy rate was 3.3 per cent based on low to zero electricity consumption in a dwelling. The local authorities with the highest vacancy rates this period were Leitrim (8.5 per cent), Roscommon (6.5 per cent) and Mayo (6.4 per cent).

Title: Crypto is getting punched in the face again—but this is no 2022
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/11/24/bitcoin-price-today-fundamentals-crypto-markets-down/
Time Published: 2025-11-24T12:35:56Z

Jeff John Roberts is the Finance and Crypto editor at Fortune, overseeing coverage of the blockchain and how technology is changing finance. It’s getting ugly out there. On Friday, Bitcoin’s latest swoon saw it fall to $82,000, marking a drop of around 32% from its all-time high of $126,000. That high came just last month, but it now feels like a distant memory as exchanges liquidate over-leveraged traders, and retail buyers curse the day a cousin gave them that tip about Bonk coin. So just how much lower will prices drop? There’s a good chance that $82,000 is not the bottom. While prices have rallied in the last few days, with Bitcoin trading around $86,000 on Monday morning, it’s easy to envision scenarios where it drops to $70,000 or lower. A jolt of dour macro-economic news or a major scandal (more on that in a second), and we could be right back in Crypto Winter. As for how we got here, it’s pretty clear that Oct. 10 was the catalyst for the current malaise. That was the day that saw around $19 billion of forced liquidations—underscoring the perils that go with allowing crypto cowboys to leverage their positions by as much as 100x. That wipeout, in turn, spooked the many institutional investors that rushed into the sector amid the euphoria that came with President Donald Trump’s favorable regulatory policies. It turned out that it was just as easy for them to rush out again. The crypto industry’s painful financial month, one of its worst on record, is also bad for its already-tarnished reputation. Longtime haters will be keen to jump in with the familiar narrative that crypto is little more than a nest of fools and swindlers, and that it’s the Sam Bankman-Fried era all over again. That view, however, is mistaken. The crypto collapse of 2022, which saw Bitcoin fall as low as $16,000, was indeed touched off by a wave of fraud. The villains included not only Bankman-Fried, but figures like stablecoin scammer Do Kwon and Alex Mashinsky, who ran a “trusted” centralized platform for crypto deposits. Conversely, there is no major scandal driving crypto’s current woes—though we could, of course, see some nasty stuff get exposed if prices keep falling. All of this, though, can make it easy to overlook just how much bigger the crypto industry is today, and how much its underlying infrastructure has matured. Sure, some institutional investors have gotten cold feet about buying tokens, but there are a lot of very big names—think BlackRock and now Citadel Securities—which have made clear they are in for the long haul. The fact of the matter is that blockchain technology is simply superior to the legacy software that most of the financial system relies on, and Wall Street is ready for an upgrade. This process is just beginning, and it will ensure ongoing adoption of marquee crypto projects like Ethereum and Solana. It also won’t be long until DeFi systems become interwoven with the broader financial system. As my lawyer pal Marvin Ammori noted, the daily trading volume on the DeFi exchange Uniswap is equal to a month of trading volume on Kalshi, which is being treated as the hottest thing in town. The bottom line here is that crypto is taking its lumps right now, but things are not as bad as they seem. The downturn will serve to wash some of the worst grifters out of the industry, and force those left to step up and prove they are building something of value. This will happen but it could be a while before we see Bitcoin at $126,000 again. Jeff John Roberts jeff.roberts@fortune.com@jeffjohnroberts Another TradFi convert: Citadel Securities, the market making giant owned by mega-billionaire Ken Griffin, is investing $200 million into Kraken. The deal suggests Citadel, which had previously avoided crypto, sees a future in tokenization. (Fortune) SPACs smacked: A bid by Pomp to take his DAT public through a reverse merger got rebuffed when the partner vehicle called off the deal on the grounds it was bad for shareholders. Other would-be crypto SPACs are also facing skepticism—a far cry from 2021 when the gimmick was widely used to enrich insiders at the expense of retail investors. (Bloomberg) Jamie debanks Jack: Strike CEO Jack Mallers complained on Twitter that JPMorgan Chase terminated his accounts over unspecified “concerning activity,” leading crypto figures Bo Hines to complain that the outspoken Bitcoin maxi had been debanked. (Decrypt) Dirty money bonanza: A major global news investigation found at least $28 billion worth of criminal funds from pig butchers, North Korean hackers and others have flowed into Binance, OKX and other exchanges in the last two years, in part from ask-no-question storefronts. (New York Times) DePIN drone network: The sector known as decentralized physical infrastructure has been in the dog house since the Helium debacle. Now a drone-tracking startup wants to build out its network by selling $949 sensors and paying out a new type of token for contributing to its network. Sure, but why not just use stablecoins instead? (Fortune) Former JPM exec and noted ‘permabull’ Tom Lee takes the main character crown this week for his bullish or perhaps delusional assurances that everything is great, even as his leading Ethereum DAT is badly underwater. Points for staying on message, Tom. The timeline is suddenly full of McDonald’s memes—a mainstay of bear markets as crypto bros joke about being so ruined they have to sling fries. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Saudi Aramco Weighs Raising Billions Of Dollars From Its Biggest Disposals Yet

Time Published: 2025-11-24T12:28:49Z
Full Content:
Saudi Aramco is considering plans to raise billions of dollars by selling a range of assets, people familiar with the matter said, deals that could rank as its most significant disposals ever. The firm is weighing the sale of a stake in its oil export and storage terminals as part of the plans, the people said, declining to be identified as the information is confidential. Banks have been asked to pitch for roles on feasibility studies for the disposals, which could fetch more than $10 billion, they said. Aramco is eying options including raising fresh equity from the deal, the people said. It could also pursue a structure similar to the recent $11 billion lease transaction with a group led by BlackRock Inc.’s Global Infrastructure Partners for assets linked to the Jafurah gas project, they said. That sale drew interest from firms around the world and bankers have since pitched several asset disposal plans given increasing demand from investors, one of the people said. Aramco’s terminals business is seen as a lucrative asset and the company could kick off a formal sales process as soon as early next year, the person said. At the same time, the oil giant is considering selling part of its real estate portfolio, some of the people said. Those assets will also likely be worth billions of dollars and will be seen as attractive at a time when the kingdom is advancing plans to allow foreign ownership. Discussions are at an early stage and no final decisions have been made. Representatives for Aramco didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Aramco’s main oil storage and export infrastructure is located at Ras Tanura on the Persian Gulf and the company has similar terminals on the Red Sea. Internationally, the firm owns stakes in product terminals in the Netherlands and leases crude as well as product storage at main trade hubs in Egypt and at Okinawa in Japan. Oil prices have dropped by roughly a fifth this year and while that decline has somewhat been tempered by higher output, Aramco has delayed some projects and looked to sell assets to free up cash for investments. The deals now being considered would mark a step up from previous transactions that were focused on stakes in pipeline infrastructure. The world’s biggest oil exporter is a lynchpin of the Saudi economy. Revenue from energy sales and the firm’s hefty dividend payouts help support the kingdom’s expensive economic revamp, some elements of which have been hamstrung by growing costs. Meanwhile, Aramco is continuing to invest in big-ticket projects like Jafurah, which is set to start production this year and reach full capacity in 2030.

Title: Novo Nordisk A/S: Evoke phase 3 trials did not demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in Alzheimer's disease progression

November 24, 2025 06:21 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 24 November 2025 – Novo Nordisk today announced the top-line results from the 2-year primary analysis of evoke and evoke+ phase 3 trials in early-stage symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease. The two trials were randomised, double-blinded, enrolled a total of 3808 adults and evaluated the efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide compared to placebo on top of standard of care. The decision to pursue an Alzheimer’s disease indication with semaglutide was based on real-world evidence studies, pre-clinical models as well as post-hoc analyses from diabetes and obesity trials. The evoke and evoke+ trials did not confirm superiority of semaglutide versus placebo in the reduction of progression of Alzheimer’s disease, as measured by the change in Clinical Dementia Rating – Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score compared to baseline. While treatment with semaglutide resulted in improvement of Alzheimer’s disease-related biomarkers in both trials, this did not translate into a delay of disease progression. In the evoke trials with patients aged 55-85, suffering from mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease, semaglutide appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile consistent with previous semaglutide trials. To date, more than 37 million patient-years of semaglutide exposure have occurred across diverse patient populations. “Based on the significant unmet need in Alzheimer’s disease as well as a number of indicative data points, we felt we had a responsibility to explore semaglutide’s potential, despite a low likelihood of success. We are proud to have conducted two well-controlled phase 3 trials in Alzheimer’s disease that meet the highest standards of research and rigorous methodology,” said Martin Holst Lange, chief scientific officer and executive vice president of Research and Development at Novo Nordisk. “We sincerely thank all participants and their caregivers for their meaningful contributions. While semaglutide did not demonstrate efficacy in slowing the progression of Alzheimer’s disease, the extensive body of evidence supporting semaglutide continues to provide benefits for individuals with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and related comorbidities.” The 1-year extension period in the evoke and evoke+ trials will be discontinued based on the efficacy results observed in the overall study population. Topline results from the evoke/evoke+ trials will be presented at the Clinical Trials in Alzheimer’s Disease (CTAD) conference on 3 December 2025, and full results at the 2026 Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Diseases Conferences (AD/PD) in March 2026. About Alzheimer’s diseaseAlzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 60-80% of all dementia cases worldwide. Dementia is a general term for memory loss and other cognitive abilities serious enough to interfere with daily life. Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive disease, where symptoms gradually worsen over time. Each stage of the disease presents different challenges for those living with the disease and their care partners. There is a significant unmet need for new treatment options that can slow down the progression of Alzheimer’s disease and reduce the overall burden on people affected and on society. About Clinical Dementia Rating – Sum of BoxesThe Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR) is a global measure of cognition and function obtained by interviewing both patient and care partner, commonly used staging tool for Alzheimer’s disease in research settings. It measures six areas covering cognition and function, where each area is scored between 0 (no dementia) and 3 (severe dementia). The summary score of the six areas (maximum score of 18), referred to as sum of boxes (CDR-SB) has been applied to clinical trials in Alzheimer’s disease to track progression and assess disease severity. In the evoke and evoke+ trials, the change in CDR-SB for semaglutide compared to placebo was measured from baseline to week 104. About the evoke/evoke+ studiesEvoke and evoke+ are large-scale trials investigating the disease-modifying potential of semaglutide in people with Alzheimer’s disease. They are global, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled confirmatory phase 3 trials investigating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of once-daily oral semaglutide 14 mg versus placebo in early-stage symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease. The trials included men or women aged 55–85 years with MCI (defined as CDR global of 0.5) or mild dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (defined as CDR global score of 1.0) with confirmed amyloid positivity. In the evoke and evoke+ trials, 1,855 and 1,953 people respectively, were randomised 1:1 to semaglutide or placebo for 156 weeks (104-week main treatment phase and 52-week extension).

Title: Chatbots To Checkout: How AI And BNPL Are Rewriting Holiday Shopping

ByCatherine Erdly, Contributor. By the time peak holiday shopping deals land in inboxes this year, a lot of shoppers will already have a digital co-pilot. Some will be asking AI tools to shortlist gifts, while others will be planning Buy Now, Pay Later repayments before they ever hit “buy.” Christmas 2025 is shaping up to be the most digitally assisted festive season yet, with software influencing how people decide what to buy and how to pay for it. What’s new isn’t just the technology, but the way people are using it. Convenience, confidence, and control now sit at the center of the holiday journey. Shoppers are happy to let algorithms shoulder some of the work—as long as they keep their hands on the steering wheel. That appetite for digital backup isn’t hypothetical; it’s already showing up in the numbers. Checkout.com’s latest research finds that 46% of UK consumers would be open to using an AI agent to help with their Christmas shopping, and those who are interested would allow an average “trust threshold” of £200 for the AI to spend on their behalf. In fact, 42% of respondents admit to already using tools like ChatGPT for gift ideas. Jenny Hadlow, chief operating officer at Checkout.com, believes this could mark a real turning point. “Every year there’s a new trend shaping how we shop for Christmas, and this year, agentic AI could transform how we find, choose and buy our festive essentials,” she says. “The real potential of agentic shopping lies in its ability to navigate the vast landscape of options—comparing deals, scanning holiday sales, and optimising for the best consumer outcomes, from price to personal preference.” That doesn’t mean the concerns have disappeared though. Checkout.com’s research highlights fear of losing control, missing the personal touch, and worries about fraud and privacy as the main reasons people hesitate to let AI do more. When asked what would build trust, shoppers point to secure systems, easy returns and refunds, spending limits they can set themselves, and instant purchase alerts. In other words, they want AI to filter the noise and surface smarter choices—not to make opaque decisions in the background. Beyond fully “agentic” systems, AI is already reshaping how people research products long before they reach the checkout. Jen Pollard, Senior Analyst at Visualsoft, believes that generative AI shopping, like Shopify-ChatGPT Instant Checkout and Google AI search, “may have an early impact.” However, Pollard is hesitant to label this shopping season as “transformational” and is instead leaning more towards “experimental.” But Klaviyo takes a different stance, describing Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2025 as the first truly “AI-fueled” holiday shopping season. The company reports that more than half of consumers say they’ll use AI tools to compare deals or plan purchases. Instead of one frantic sales day, Klaviyo sees spending spread across a 16-day window that begins roughly 10 days before Black Friday. Shopify’s Global Holiday Retail Report points in a similar direction. The company finds that 64% of shoppers expect to use AI for at least one task in their holiday journey, while 88% of businesses are investing in AI-driven discovery tools. At the same time, 73% of consumers still value human interaction somewhere in the process. Even as more shoppers rely on AI tools and digital wallets, they still anchor decisions in trust, loyalty, and connection. Research from LoyaltyLion shows that 71% of Gen Z and Millenials say they feel more emotionally connected to brands through loyalty programs, while Antavo’s data suggests roughly seven in ten shoppers join those programs primarily for rewards, discounts, or cash back, with a meaningful share also motivated by personalized offers and perks like free shipping or early access. For smaller businesses, that blend of automation, loyalty, and humanity is particularly important. Andrew Goodacre, CEO of the British Independent Retailers Association, argues that artificial intelligence has moved from buzzword to practical tool. “AI is no longer a distant concept requiring huge investment or technical expertise,” he says. “It’s readily accessible, often affordable, and increasingly user-friendly. For independent retailers, this is transformative.” He also stresses that AI should sit alongside human service, not replace it. The strongest model is “AI plus human”: digital tools handle stock management, basic queries, and marketing, while staff focus on personalized service which keeps people coming back. If AI is changing how people decide what to buy, BNPL is quietly changing how they decide when and with what means to pay. Clearpay’s Festive Insights Wrapped report finds that more than a third of shoppers are planning to use BNPL this season to give them extra flexibility, with adoption strongest among Gen Z and Millennial consumers. Their motivations are mostly pragmatic. Clearpay reports that 63% of those who plan to use BNPL cite convenience as a key reason, 58% point to reliability, 52% to flexibility, and 51% to speed. Many shoppers are not trying to expand their overall budget; they are looking to smooth out the impact of big-ticket purchases or spread the cost of multiple family commitments over several paychecks. Rich Bayer, CEO at Clearpay, sees that as a defining pattern for 2025. “The festive season is always a special time, but 2025 brings fresh financial challenges for many households,” he says. “What we’re seeing is a pragmatic approach; people are still planning to celebrate, but they’re planning earlier, being practical with their budgets, prioritising self-care, and turning to tools like BNPL to help them manage their spending responsibly.” However, that pragmatism doesn’t eliminate risk. Used thoughtlessly, BNPL can still encourage overspending or lead to missed payments and fees. As BNPL becomes standard at checkout, retailers and providers will both be judged on how transparent they are with shoppers. This holiday season, AI, BNPL, and one-click checkout are no longer nice-to-haves; they’re must-haves as the modern-day consumer expects smart recommendations, flexible ways to pay, and a checkout that feels instant. But even still, shoppers gravitate toward brands they recognize, clear terms at checkout, and real humans when something goes wrong. The retailers that will stand out aren’t the ones with the flashiest tech, but the ones that combine digital speed with transparency, loyalty, and a human tone, making holiday shopping feel both effortless and genuinely worth returning to.

Title: Crypto treasuries facing $130 billion value reckoning as ETFs reshape market

EFT impact and "crypto-per-share" focus redefine corporate treasury strategies in the crypto market. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Investors long paid premiums for Digital Asset Treasury firms, seeing them as practical substitutes for holding Bitcoin when direct access was limited. That approach worked when regulated channels were scarce and corporate balance sheets offered the closest approximation to holding the asset itself. But according to Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, the conditions that once supported those valuations have fundamentally changed. In a valuation framework released on Nov. 23, Hougan argued that the $130 billion sector now faces a structural shift. While the forces pushing DATs below the value of their crypto holdings, illiquidity, operating costs, and execution risk, are constant across the model, the factors that can lift valuations above parity are limited and uncertain. The natural state of a passive treasury, he wrote, is a discount. Hougan’s analysis challenges the assumptions that fueled the rise of companies such as Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and Metaplanet Inc., which built investment cases around holding large quantities of Bitcoin. His model treats spot-value parity as the starting point and subtracts three predictable valuation drags. The first is illiquidity. Bitcoin held inside a corporation cannot be redeemed directly by shareholders, and the friction between ownership and access typically results in a discount. Hougan described this gap as the price investors assign to delayed or constrained delivery of the underlying asset. The second is operating expense. Public companies incur recurring costs, including compensation, audits, custody arrangements, and legal services. Those expenses reduce net asset value on a continuous basis, meaning a dollar of Bitcoin held by a corporation is inherently worth less than a dollar held directly. The third is execution risk. Investors must account for the possibility that management will misallocate capital, misjudge markets, or face regulatory setbacks. Because the probability is non-zero, markets generally factor this risk into pricing. Hougan wrote: “Most of the reasons they should trade at a discount are certain and most of the reasons they might trade at a premium are uncertain…Expenses and risk compound over time.” Taken together, these factors form the baseline markdown that applies to most DAT structures before any upside levers are considered. The downward pressure on DAT valuations has intensified with the expansion of spot Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds. Before ETF approvals, corporate treasuries served as the primary entry point for institutions and retail investors seeking regulated exposure without the custody complexity. That scarcity allowed some DAT stocks to trade well above their underlying holdings. The introduction of spot ETFs removed that structural advantage. BlackRock Inc., Fidelity Investments, and other issuers now offer low-fee products that track Bitcoin and ETH directly, with intraday liquidity and daily creations and redemptions. Nate Geraci, the president of NovaDius Wealth, called spot ETFs “DAT killers,” arguing that they closed the regulatory arbitrage that once justified premium pricing. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas added that ETFs perform the same function as DATs “with good tracking,” providing cleaner exposure while avoiding the overhead of a corporate structure. He acknowledged that some institutions can hold only equities or bonds, which gives companies like MicroStrategy residual appeal. Still, he noted that this group is “not enough for a bunch of them to thrive.” With the premium model eroding, Hougan argues that a DAT’s valuation now depends on its ability to increase crypto per share. Only four strategies reliably support that objective: issuing debt to buy more crypto, lending assets for yield, using options strategies, and acquiring assets at a discount. Issuing debt is historically the most powerful tool, particularly when credit markets are favorable and Bitcoin is appreciating. If the asset consistently outperforms the interest burden, shareholders can achieve accretive gains. But the strategy relies on timing, balance-sheet strength, and access to capital markets. Lending, structured products, and options generate incremental returns but introduce counterparty or strategy risk. Mergers and acquisitions can increase scale, lowering financing costs and expanding the set of transactions a DAT can pursue. Hougan said “scale matters” because larger firms can access cheaper capital and better deal flow. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley expects these pressures to accelerate consolidation. “We’re in the early innings of what DATs will become,” he said, predicting that surviving firms will evolve into operating companies that buy private crypto businesses and generate revenue rather than relying solely on treasury appreciation. Considering this, Hougan concluded: “Going forward, I think there will be more differentiation. A few will execute well and trade at a premium, and many will execute poorly and trade at a discount. This model is one way to think about which is which.” The move toward more disciplined valuation coincides with losses across Bitcoin treasury stocks. Research from 10X Research estimates that retail investors lost about $17 billion in recent months as markets repriced corporate holdings. The firm attributed these losses to the collapse of what it described as “financial alchemy,” where share issuance created the appearance of expanding upside until volatility erased the effect. Data from CryptoRank indicates sector-wide dispersion. Treasuries with high operating costs, limited scale, or large sell-side overhangs have underperformed, while firms focused on crypto-per-share expansion have been more resilient. Taken together, these shifts suggest that DATs must now compete directly with ETFs on cost, liquidity, and transparency. The period in which corporate balance sheets commanded automatic premiums is no longer supported by market structure. For the largest players, the challenge is proving they operate businesses rather than functioning as static balance-sheet vehicles. Firms that cannot offset expense drag or grow crypto-per-share are likely to trade at structural discounts, while those adopting active strategies may retain a valuation advantage. As ETFs capture a larger share of institutional flows, the market is sending a clear signal: simply holding Bitcoin is no longer enough. A DAT must demonstrate it can generate value beyond its treasury, or its equity will reflect the underlying arithmetic. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Big pay, bigger influence: How Wall Street's war for AI talent is shaping new power dynamics

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The hottest job on Wall Street right now isn't a trader or dealmaker. It belongs to the human minds who specialize in building the digital ones. Bank chiefs have been touting how adopting artificial intelligence at scale will help employees work smarter and cut costs, and they're putting serious money behind those AI ambitions. Goldman Sachs' CEO David Solomon said in October that he wished the firm's $6 billion annual tech budget was even higher, while Bank of America dedicated $4 billion this year to "new technology initiatives," according to the company. A chunk of that investment is directed at building out battalions of tech professionals to realize those strategies. However, the demand for that talent is driving salaries for technologists who specialize in AI — from rank-and-file engineers to executive and C-suite tech strategists — to soar at banks, according to insiders. "There's certainly not enough people" to keep pace with hiring demand, said recruiter Ryan Bulkoski, the global head of the AI, data, and analytics practice at the search firm Heidrick & Struggles. Recruiters and executives across financial services companies told Business Insider the result is a full-blown talent war pitting Wall Street banks against hedge funds, private asset managers, and Silicon Valley startups. The senior-level or C-suite AI leader who can steer corporate strategy "is the hottest job in the market" right now, forcing financial services firms to cough up "stretch offers," Chris Connors, a principal at the compensation consultancy Johnson Associates, told Business Insider. "If you are a high-caliber talent, you are more desirable than virtually every other role in the market," Connors added, noting that some firms have extended special, non-standard awards to lure top-tier talent or prevent them from leaving. Competition across the industry is fierce, as hedge funds and other asset managers have even issued incremental equity or long-term awards, Connors said — they often range from $500,000 to $1 million, typically vesting across three to four years. Some firms have offered "significant upfront sign-on grants," often in excess of $200,000, delivered off the bat as cash or equity, he said. For banks, especially, it has created a conundrum — how to extend big-ticket offers while adhering to their often rigid, standardized compensation bands. Hiring managers are forking over "some uncomfortable hiring packages" which are vaulting recipients into "a completely different stratosphere," Bulkoski explained, noting that top compensation packages for senior-level AI leaders are reaching the high seven- and even eight-figure range. "Nobody's leaving for less than 30%" pay increases if they're coming from companies where they're already "heads-down and doing well," he said. "No one's going to move for the historical 10, 15, or even 20% bump in compensation." AI hiring in the financial services industry grew in 2025 to 10 times its level at the start of January 2022, according to an analysis by workforce data provider Revelio Labs. To assemble the data, Revelio examined finance job postings for roles like "AI engineer," "machine learning engineer," and "computer vision engineer," among others. Six of the largest US banks — including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley — have collectively posted more than 2,000 AI roles in the past 12 months, Revelio's data showed. That surging demand for AI talent is driving paychecks higher. The average salary for AI professionals in finance, excluding C-suite roles, had risen to about $180,000 from $142,000 in 2020. That increase of more than 25% puts them on par with what conventional tech firms tend to pay for these roles, Revelio said. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley declined to comment, while others did not respond to requests for comment. "What we have seen with banks over the past few years is they've had to really reframe and reimagine those comp ranges, especially for a lot of this type of talent," Ben Hodzic, head of North America at the recruiting firm Selby Jennings, told Business Insider. That's especially true as they're coming up against multistrategy hedge funds and high-frequency systematic trading firms that are "paying whatever they need to pay to get people," he said. But money alone isn't enough, insiders said. These technologists also want something else: power. Insiders said the AI race has elevated the voices of technology chiefs at banks and asset managers, giving them a perch at powerful tables that steer firms' overall strategy. Bulkoski said that, for prospective AI chiefs, wielding greater levels of influence in the boardroom alongside other C-suite leaders is an appealing prospect unto itself. "It could trump another number on the sheet," he said. The nature of the work is attracting a broad swathe of professionals eager to exploit the breach. "Go on LinkedIn and look at the number of people who just changed their title from data scientist to AI scientist," Bulkoski said. "It's kind of unbelievable." Candidates for senior-level roles are skewing younger, he continued. Some AI-savvy talent in their early- to mid-20s are pulling high-six to seven-figure offers, he said. To suss out who is a fit and who isn't, Bulkoski said his team assesses "whether they have a real track record" of constructing original AI or machine learning products at scale, and if they can channel that knowledge into creating commercial or operational value. "Most are in the early phases of developing executive maturity," he said, "but the best of them can already influence senior leaders by grounding every conversation in architecture, data, and measurable impact." With access to the board and stepped-up influence and responsibility, some Wall Street insiders are betting they can offer something Big Tech companies generally can't: a steadier, more clearly defined climb up the professional ranks. With tech firms consolidating and fears of an AI bubble mounting, recruiters say some technologists are increasingly drawn to the stability and hierarchy that the financial services industry is known for. "There's been a lot less volatility with jobs in the finance industry compared to the tech industry," said Selby Jennings' Hodzic, adding that finance offers a more well-worn, clearly defined pathway. He said Wall Street had been insulated from the kind of mass layoffs that have roiled Big Tech. Amazon, for instance, cut about 14,000 corporate jobs in 2025. Recruiters say the flames fanning the talent war aren't dissipating anytime soon, and that the next phase of the hiring race is already underway. "In 2025, it's almost like Gen AI is in the past," Bulkoski said. "We're actually now working on searches that have 'agentic AI' in the title." Jump to

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “Science cannot solve the ultimate mystery of nature” — Max Planck Number of the Week: ~4.5 mm/year v. 1-2 mm/year THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: This TWTW begins with an essay by SEPP director David Legates rebutting a claim that today’s complex global climate models accurately forecast climate. TWTW discusses a version of uncertainty proposed by John Ridgway. TWTW discusses Ross McKitrick’s paper of a statistically acceptable way of climate fingerprinting. Then, TWTW discusses an essay and a speech by two commentators on UK energy policy. TWTW closes with an effort by the UNFCCC to impose censorship. ********************* General Patterns v. Specific Details: NOAA research scientist Nadir Jeevanjee claims that today’s complex global climate models accurately forecast climate. As evidence, he offers five forecasts for which the early simple models in a lab of the U.S. Weather Bureau were accurate. The laboratory became the NOAA-financed Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at Princeton. Jeevanjee claims that the report by five independent scientists (John Christy, Ph.D., Judith Curry, Ph.D., Steven Koonin, Ph.D., Ross McKitrick, Ph.D., Roy Spencer, Ph.D.) published by the Department of Energy in July 2025 claimed that the complexity of current global climate models as the primary reason why the models cannot be trusted. Jeevanjee gave five major examples why current models can be trusted. Writing for the Cornwall Alliance, climatologist David Legates rebutted each example. As posted in WUWT, Legates states [the graph is not shown here but is in the text, boldface added]: Okay, let’s revisit history—because those who can’t remember history correctly are destined to get it wrong. First, we need to get one fact correct. The recent Department of Energy report did not simply cite the complexity of climate models as the primary reason they cannot be trusted. It goes into detail as to why current climate models cannot be trusted: namely, they cannot reproduce current conditions. For example, models are not capable of determining the equilibrium climate sensitivity to increasing carbon dioxide concentrations. As shown in this graph from the DOE report, they tend to ‘run hot,’ or overstate surface warming. [graph not shown here] They also overstate warming of the tropical troposphere, and their simulation of stratospheric cooling is inconsistent. With regards to the tropical troposphere, the excessive warming was noted as a problem in the first United States National Climate Assessment and has been noted in every Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report since. This problem has become more extreme over time—i.e., simulations from later models, despite decades of ‘improvements’ costing billions of dollars, deviate farther from observations than earlier models—and its spatial extent now encompasses the entire globe. But the article asserts that early climate model forecasts about global warming were correct decades before the forecasts could be evaluated. It concludes, ‘it is this track record of success that gives us confidence in interpreting the changes we’re seeing now, as well as predicting changes to come.’ It then lists five forecasts the early models made that underscore how well even those early models could reproduce Earth’s climate. Now, let’s give credit where credit is due, but let’s not reward models for getting the basics of climate correct. In other words, models should not be praised for figuring out that the Poles are cold and the Equator is warm. They should not be given credit for simulating the Hadley Cell circulation or demonstrating that oceans have a moderating effect on climate, for examples. These basic premises of climate are obvious and must have been a product of the simulation; otherwise, the models would have been discarded before they were even published. So, let’s test the article’s evaluation of the models. Forecast number 1: early models correctly simulated surface global warming from increased carbon dioxide. Yes, but this was obvious long before the first models were created. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and thus the more of it added to the atmosphere, the higher surface temperature should rise. Way back in 1896, Svante Arrhenius (1859–1927) showed that an increase in carbon dioxide would increase global temperatures. The question always has been, and still is, how much should the temperature rise from, say, a doubling of carbon dioxide? Early models argued that the temperature rise would be between 2.0 and 3.5 degrees Celsius. These numbers are actually closer to reality than estimates provided by later model simulations, but they are still higher than data-driven estimates using historical and paleoclimate data. Verdict? Early models would have been discarded if they had simulated cooling or had no effect. That they simulated warming from increased greenhouse gases is no proof of their reliability. Forecast number 2: the models predicted stratospheric cooling from adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. This should also have been relatively obvious. If outgoing terrestrial radiation is being intercepted by more carbon dioxide at the surface, and some of it is radiated back to the surface, then less will reach the stratosphere and, consequently, the stratosphere should cool. Again, the question that demands an answer is, ‘How much cooling?’—and even current climate models cannot simulate this correctly or consistently. Forecast number 3: Arctic amplification. The Conversation suggests that it was surprising that the early models accurately predicted that rising carbon dioxide concentrations would warm the Arctic more than the Tropics. But that was no surprise at all. Given a warming planet, the Arctic will warm faster than the Equator due to six factors. Therefore, a greater warming of the Arctic was obvious to climatologists even before the first climate model was created. That models simulate it is no big feat. Forecast number 4: land-ocean contrast. The article notes that the coupled atmosphere-ocean model ‘led to a slew of insights, including the observation that land generally warms more than ocean, by a factor of about 1.5.’ While this may sound impressive to the uninitiated, climatologists have long known the moderating effect of the oceans, again due to their high specific heat. Consider San Diego and Dallas, at about the same latitude of 33 degrees north. The annual temperature range in San Diego is about 8 degrees Celsius, while that in Dallas is about 22 degrees—a factor of almost three. Extending any transect to both coasts indicates that the annual temperature range—and the diurnal temperature range, for that matter—increases with distance from the coast. To anyone who understands the Earth’s climate, the central Plains have a much greater temperature range than either coast, for example. So, why would this have been a novel finding back in 1979? Any competent climatologist would have known this, so it must have been a basic component of any climate model worth its salt at the time. Forecast number 5: delayed warming of the Southern Ocean around Antarctica. This issue arises from the supposedly novel fact that the Arctic has a greater warming signal than that of the Southern Ocean. But why is that surprising? The change in albedo is not as great in Antarctica, since there is little land area exposed by melting snow and ice, while there is much in the Arctic. Sea ice dynamics differ considerably in the Southern Hemisphere, and the loss of sea ice isn’t as dramatic to warming Antarctica. Moreover, the Southern Ocean is bounded by a hemisphere of ocean, which has a moderating effect on the climate as mentioned earlier. Thus, important contributions to Arctic warming are not present in the Southern Ocean, and so we would have expected the Southern Ocean to be different from the Arctic. The take-home message? If early climate models missed any of these supposed climate novelties, climate modeling wouldn’t have gotten off the ground. What early climate modeling showed was that the basics of climate could be replicated with simple mathematical approximations. But that’s the basics. The details are that climate is still very complex, and while the general patterns can be simulated accurately, specific details as to how climate varies spatially and how it is likely to change under various scenarios are still a far-off challenge. The article concludes: ‘Climate models have their limitations, of course. For instance, they cannot predict regional climate change as well as people would like. But the fact that climate science, like any field, has significant unknowns should not blind us to what we do know.’ I agree, but I would also note that we were not blind to these facts before the advent of climate models. Syukuro Manabe deserves credit for demonstrating that the basics of climate can be reproduced with a rudimentary computer program run on early computers. But the fact remains that current model simulations still deviate significantly from real-world observations. And let’s not lose sight of the fact that early climatologists understood quite a bit about how the Earth’s climate works. Yes, there were climatologists before the climate modelers, and they knew an awful lot about the Earth’s climate. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ********************* Uncertainty: As David Legates writes above, the global climate models are highly inconsistent and generally greatly overestimate the warming of the atmosphere. Modelers often dismiss criticism of the inconsistency and the overestimate as the result of “initial conditions.” If the initial conditions are accurate, part of the inconsistency in modeling results can be attributed to initial conditions, but the overestimates may be from the use of the wrong data to detect the greenhouse effect. In two essays posted on Judith Curry’s Climate Etc. and one in Climate Scepticism (English spelling) John Ridgway addresses the issues of uncertainty. In the second essay posted in Climate Etc. “Natural Selection of Bad Science. Part II,” Ridgway discusses “Distinguishing Two Dimensions of Uncertainty” by Craig Fox and Gülden Ülkümen. The issues arise from the fact that modeling is not measurement and the efforts to attach probability estimates on a range of modeling results are without any foundation in classical probability and statistics. For example, if modelers state the results are a of range of 1.5 – 4.5°C, they don’t have a sound statistical basis for attaching probabilities to these estimates. In a long post on Curry’s website, Ridgway address this issue and efforts to minimize it. He states: “…the problem didn’t go away, and we now live in a world where it is common practice for climate scientists to confuse epistemic and aleatory uncertainty by trying to treat the spread of model outputs as if dealing with a measurement problem that can be characterized using probability distributions. It’s possible that some climate scientists are simply unaware of the issue, but many others deliberately ignore it because they recognize the expedience of pretending that the epistemic uncertainties involved can be analyzed as if they were aleatory.” [Boldface added.] Here Ridgway introduces terms that may be from philosophy: “epistemic uncertainties” and “aleatory uncertainties.” Epistemic uncertainty arises for a lack of knowledge (incomplete understanding in a model) and possibly could be resolved by gathering more data or better data. Aleatoric uncertainty arises because of the unpredictable, random nature of the physical system (randomness and noise). This uncertainty cannot be resolved by more and better data. The distinction is useful because it may be helpful to address issues that arise when global climate modelers dismiss criticisms of the inconsistency of their work as resulting from “initial conditions.” For example, turbulence is a vexing problem in fluid dynamics that no one has solved. Turbulence can be considered an aleatory uncertainty, it is random. In climate modeling, turbulence will produce different results with different initial conditions. However, the use of surface-air temperature data for modeling is not an aleatory uncertainty. It is the wrong data to use if one is forecasting the influence of greenhouse gases that exist in the atmosphere. Further, surface-air data is subject to many other human influences that have no relationship with greenhouse gases, such as the urban heat island effect, roadways, runways, landscape changes, etc. The variation between surface-air temperature trends and atmospheric temperature trends cannot be dismissed as aleatory uncertainty, random. The differences are epistemic, lacking appropriate knowledge. Yet the appropriate knowledge exists but is ignored by the global climate modeling community. There is no justification for saying the difference is the result of initial conditions. Under Problem number 1: The converted meteorologist in “More on the Uncertainty Monster” Ridgway writes: “’Internal variability, part of the natural variability of the climate system, can be estimated from high-resolution simulators, but it is only a tiny part of total uncertainty. Over centurial scales, it is negligible compared to our combined uncertainty of the behavior of the icesheets, and the marine and terrestrial biosphere.’ As a consequence, the road to improved forecasting is markedly different for the two challenges. For meteorology, improvement is traditionally gained by using simulations of greater fidelity and granularity, powered by extra computer and physical perturbation ensembles of increasing size. For climate science, the solution lies more in gaining a greater understanding of the complexities and feedbacks involved and how they operate in the long term. The distinction is essentially that which exists between variability and incertitude, and hence between the aleatory and epistemic approaches. However, there is always a danger that an individual steeped in the traditions of the former may not be able to fully adjust when engaged in the latter. If Monte Carlo simulations and similar stochastic sampling techniques have proved immensely effective within their realm, the temptation might be to believe that the realm of the epistemic could be similarly tamed. One individual who may fit this description is Professor Tim Palmer, an academic who has done as much as anyone in pioneering and finessing the techniques that underpin modern-day weather forecasting. In his book, The Primacy of Doubt, these successes are described in chapters such as ‘Chaos, Chaos Everywhere,’ ‘The Geometry of Chaos,’ ‘Noisy, Million-Dollar Butterflies’ and ‘The Two Roads to Monte Carlo.’ However, in the chapter ‘Climate Change,’ he states the following when discussing climate change multi-model ensembles: ‘This provides a natural ‘ensemble of opportunity’ to study climate change. It is an example of the so-called multi-model ensemble mentioned in Chapter 5. Each model differs from the others in the precise computational techniques used to solve the Navier-Stokes equation, and, more importantly, in the parameterization formulae for unresolved processes.’ There is nothing in the above to suggest that the aleatory sampling techniques he had described in Chapter 5 (Monte Carlo simulation) are anything other than fully applicable to the ensembles he now describes. And yet, Chapter 5 was predominantly about the modelling of variability, whereas now we have moved on to matters of incertitude, as characterized by models of varied structure. Just to reinforce the suspicion that Palmer sees nothing wrong with the adoption of aleatory methods to treat such epistemic uncertainty, on page 121 he reproduces a histogram showing the various estimates of climate sensitivity resulting from an ensemble of differently structured models. Over this he fits a probability distribution curve, seemingly unconcerned that this takes no account of the histogram’s decidedly non-stochastic representation of the space of possible model structures. This is precisely the normative practice to which I have referred above, and yet there is no hint in his book that he sees it as a pragmatic (albeit sub-optimal) expedient, or as a probabilistic treatment adopted only for the benefit of the policymakers. Indeed, he goes on to justify its legitimacy by reference to the concept of the ‘wisdom of the crowds.’ But this is a concept that only applies when the crowd acts entirely independently and is statistically representative. Of course, neither of these conditions apply to the currently available ‘crowd’ of climate models.” Ridgway identifies a major problem with the ensemble method advocated by Tim Palmer and widely used today – the method mixes different types of uncertainties some of which can be resolved with better data while others cannot. Additionally, Palmer writes some ideas of what his technique can resolve that are farfetched. Ridgway writes: “Armed with an ensemble of such models, Palmer sees great potential in tackling the epistemic uncertainties appertaining to our shared future: ‘Of course, such a digital ensemble twin would not only be able to tackle the socioeconomic problems of climate geoengineering, it should be able to provide credible estimates of future migration, future conflict, future health risks, future food supplies, the future health of the oceans and so on.’ Of course? It is far from obvious to me that a reliable ‘model of global society’ can be created by extending a stochastic model designed to forecast the outcome of a system’s variability.” Under “Problem number 2: The denial of subjectivity” Ridgway writes about “Personalist” interpretation of uncertainty that has no bearing in physical science. Physical science deals with verifiable, objective properties independent from one’s individual beliefs. The essays are useful in identifying types of uncertainties, some of which may reduce with more data or the use of appropriate data. Other uncertainties, such as turbulence, probably cannot be reduced even with better and faster computers. The knowledge does not exist. Additionally, our understanding of the formation and dissipation of clouds is lacking.

Earlier, Allen and Tett (1999) claimed that the work satisfied the conditions of the Gauss-Markov theorem and the estimates are BLUE, [the Best (minimum variance), Linear, Unbiased, Estimator] for the calculation of the coefficient of the desired variable. Writing in the same Journal, Climate Dynamics, Ross McKitrick (2022) showed that the method did not produce BLUE results; the results were not unbiased and consistent estimates of the desired coefficient. A major problem is the lack of consistency of the error term, heteroscedasticity. In discussing Ross McKitrick’s latest work, John Robson writes: “A lot of observers including us have long suspected that the IPCC’s knack for always finding CO2 responsible for everything was probably an artifact of dodgy statistical practice rather than real-world effects. [Ross] McKitrick’s new analysis confirms our suspicions and adds to the evidence that in the real world outside climate models CO2 is not the control knob on global climate and natural variability matters a lot more than we’ve been told. And confirms our suspicions that far from being ‘settled,’ rigorous and, oh yeah, ‘simple,’ climate science neglects basic tools of the trade from the statistical to the testing of hypotheses to try to disprove them not to confirm them at all costs.’ See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ********************* In the Mire: In “Fixing the electricity system” Andrew Montford of Net Zero Watch addressed a main problem in the UK – the high and increasing cost of electricity to consumers and industry. His essay begins with [boldface added]: “The UK has the highest industrial electricity prices in the developed world, despite paying only average prices for gas. Independent research shows that years of high energy costs have made the cost-of-living voters’ top concern, fueling public anger and political polarization. Yet even sceptics of the renewables agenda often misunderstand the core problem. Cutting subsidies alone will not lower prices. As Octopus Energy and E.ON told Parliament’s Energy Security and Net Zero Committee, even if gas prices halved or fell to zero, electricity bills would still rise. But why? The reason lies in so-called ‘non-commodity costs’ – the cost of managing a grid rather than of generating the power. Because renewables are weather-dependent, spatially diffuse, and often located far from where power is needed, and moreover because they undermine the economics of the gas-fired fleet – vital for when the wind is not blowing – these costs are soaring. Energy experts, including Professors Dieter Helm and Gordon Hughes, have argued that such system costs are now the main driver of bills and – unlike with thermal power systems – will keep rising as more renewables are added. Cancelling subsidies might bring short-term relief, but, as long as intermittent generation grows, balancing and capacity market costs will escalate. Britain cannot reduce the cost of living, revive productivity, or restore economic growth without fixing its electricity system. To do this, UK politicians must confront not only subsidies, but the physical and contractual structures that make energy permanently expensive.” Energy consultant Kathryn Porter had a similar, grim question “How do we keep the lights on with 12 GW net firm capacity at risk of retirement by 2030?” in a speech to the Institution of Power Engineers. Paul Homewood summarizes key points with: “A total of 56 GW, facing peak winter demand of 48 GW. That capacity cannot be guaranteed 24/7, so 50 GW is more realistic. Moreover that 7 GW of batteries, plus 2.7 GW of pumped storage can only supply for an hour or so – enough to meet peak demand, but worthless for longer periods. As a result, we are already totally dependent on imported power at the times when wind power cannot meet demand. But the real value of Kathryn’s analysis is that she has identified how much gas power capacity we could potentially lose in the next few years. Not only is 12 GW at risk of closure by 2030, but another 6 GW could go by 2035.” See links under Questioning European Green. ********************* Literacy Through Censorship: The 30th Conference of Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) concluded November 21, a new threat has emerged to modern civilization – UN censorship. Jo Nova links to a November 12 UN press release that states: “The Global Initiative for Information Integrity on Climate Change today launched the Declaration on Information Integrity on Climate Change at COP30, establishing shared international commitments to address climate disinformation and promote accurate, evidence-based information on climate issues. The Declaration commits signatories to promote the integrity of information related to climate change at international, national, and local levels, in line with international human rights law and the principles of the Paris Agreement. Drafted in collaboration with civil society members of the Global Initiative Advisory Group, the Declaration has been endorsed by ten countries so far – Brazil, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, and Uruguay. ‘Climate change is no longer a threat of the future; it is a tragedy of the present,’ said President of Brazil Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in Belém. ‘We live in an era in which obscurantists reject scientific evidence and attack institutions. It is time to deliver yet another defeat to denialism.’” Charles Rotter has additional views on the subsequent: “Declaration on Information Integrity on Climate Change.” See links under Censorship. ********************* Number of the Week: ~4.5 mm/year v. 1-2 mm/year. A paper in Nature Communications, Earth & Environment states: Over the past three decades, satellites have provided continuous, accurate measurements of sea level on near-global scales. Here, we show that since satellites began observing sea surface heights in 1993 until the end of 2023, global mean sea level has risen by 111 mm. In addition, the rate of global mean sea level rise over those three decades has increased from ~2.1 mm/year in 1993 to ~4.5 mm/year in 2023. If this trajectory of sea level rise continues over the next three decades, sea levels will increase by an additional 169 mm globally, comparable to mid-range sea level projections from the IPCC AR6. The reported satellite estimates are inconsistent with tidal gauge measurements taken at geological stable locations. Ole Humlum reports: “Tide gauges along coasts indicate a typical global sea level increase of about 1-2 mm/yr. Coastal sea level change rate last 100 year has essentially been stable, but with periodic variations.” See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy and Defending the Orthodoxy – Bandwagon Science.

VanDeveer, Professor of Global Governance & Human Security, The Conversation, Nov 14, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] The world has affordable renewable energy technologies with which to replace coal-fired electricity generation. Shifting to renewable energy also has added benefits: It’s much less harmful to the health of those who live and work nearby than mining and burning coal is. [SEPP Comment: Mining cobalt and lithium is clean and healthy?] Biden EPA Official: Trump’s EPA Is Knee-Capping U.S. Energy Dominance By Cynthia Giles, Real Clear Energy, Nov 19, 2025 Importing countries want oil and gas that hit three key benchmarks: reduced emissions from production and distribution, a robust system to curtail super-emitters – which are responsible for as much as 50% of emissions – and reliable monitoring and reporting so emission claims can be verified. That’s what EU rules require, and what other big importing countries are quickly moving toward.

Not modern satellite imagery, not historical data, not even the meteorological literature available before the book was published. If anyone still doubts how easily Solomon’s interpretation can be disproved, consider this: a single infrared satellite image is enough to show why her core assumption—that Corner Camp and Scott’s Last Camp always experience storms together—is scientifically untenable.

An unhealthy dose of unreality By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Nov 19, 2025 Not just a new plan, a new model. Or a plan to come up with a model. Not that they don’t have a bunch of words hovering in the shape of a plan: “the GFI [Green Finance Institute] is proposing a new model of so-called structured coordination that it’s dubbed “transactions to transitions.” COP30 is the world’s biggest trade show By David Wojick, CFACT, Nov 17, 2025 On the funny side, a few COPs ago, the UN started asking registrants about their ties to oil and gas companies. There turned out to be well over a thousand per COP, which is as many, or more than, the number of negotiators. I am sure a lot of oil and gas deals get started here. In fact, at COP28, the COP president, himself an oil executive, got yelled at for talking about making such deals. On that Flood of Fossil Fuel Lobbyists at COP30 How dare they! By Jit, Climate Scepticism, Nov 22, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] Probably, if you screwed your eyes up tightly, you could make out about half of the 1600 as having more than the most tenuous connection to fossil fuels.

Its history is littered with floods every bit as bad as this week’s. It might seem a daft place to build a town, but the Normans built the castle and town specifically because of those three rivers, allowing them to exert control over the river crossings. Since then, it continued to thrive because of its communication links. #HaveItBothWays: Drought in the UK By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Nov 19, 2025 Whether the UK gets wetter or drier in the future, you can rest assured that climate science predicted it and you’re to blame either way.

Lowering Standards The BBC: My Part In Its Downfall By Iain Macwhirter, The Daily Sceptic, Nov 14, 2025 As critical friends like the former BBC politics presenter Andrew Marr and the former defence correspondent Mark Urban have pointed out, there is now a generation of activist-minded graduates running BBC programs who think that they should, like broadcasters in wartime, be taking sides. They think the BBC should be promoting social justice, opposing environmental catastrophe and depriving anti-immigrant populists of the oxygen of publicity. Only they cannot do this and still be the BBC proper. Iain Macwhirter, a former BBC political correspondent and TV presenter, is a columnist for the Times and the author of Disunited Kingdom. Oh heh heh that transition By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Nov 19, 2025 The International Energy Agency [IEA], which does seem to have become the International Anti-Energy Agency recently, has the good grace to admit that zealotry had overwhelmed judgement. Well, they didn’t put it that way. EXCLUSIVE: New Freedom of Information Request and the UK Met Office has to Rewrite its Temperature Explanations Again By Chris Morrison, The Daily Sceptic, Nov 16, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] The UK Met Office’s excuses for its invented temperature data from non-existent stations get more fanciful by the day. Explanation after explanation fails to live up to rigorous examination, with statutory Freedom of Information (FOI) requests leading to frequent rewriting and new things to believe before breakfast.

From Eschenbach: If you want to monitor the AMOC, measure it directly. Don’t use proxy tea leaves from a noisy, complex region, filtered through biased models, and call it a “superior fingerprint.” Climate Scientists Claim That Global Warming Is Going To Cause A New Ice Age? By Tyler Durden, Zero Hedge, Nov 18, 2025 [H/t S.J. Cvrk] One thing that is true is that global cooling would be more dangerous to the Earth than global warming. The most recent Ice Age was a devastating event that is projected to have killed up to 150,000 non-microbe species. On a grand scale of Earth-time, we have barely exited that disaster which ended 11,000 years ago.

By Francis Menton, Manhattan Contrarian, Nov 15, 2025 So, they have actually calculated that the attempt to reach “net zero” emissions on the statutorily-mandated schedule will cost consumers an extra $42 billion per year by 2040. They don’t give us numbers for other years, but presumably other years would be comparable. So, figure, $42 billion per year. Let’s say that that is slightly different from wind and solar being “cheaper” than our existing fossil fuel infrastructure. The true source of civilization’s future is energy wisdom By Ronald Stein, Armando Cavanha, & Yoshihiro Muronaka, America Out Loud News, Nov 17, 2025 For an engineer, the distinction between efficiency and saving is fundamental. Efficiency is a design challenge: achieving a task with the minimum input through better engineering. Saving, on the other hand, is often a behavioral practice: using less through habit or restraint. Non-Green Jobs Wirtschaftlicher Selbstmord [Economic Suicide] By Willis Eschenbach, WUWT, Nov 20, 2025 Adjusted for population size, that’s as if in six months every single factory worker in North Carolina lost their job. The Germans thought they could run a post-industrial society on hope, regulations, and a few clouds of solar panels—but you can’t repeal the laws of economics, any more than you can run a steel mill on good intentions. Now the bill is coming due. Funding Issues An unhealthy fixation By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Nov 19, 2025 It is to some people, apparently. The same ones who think it’s all fun and games for some otherwise undistinguished politician to redo the Industrial Revolution and get it better this time… until someone loses a pension fund. The Political Games Continue A momentary outbreak of sensibleness in Australia By Jo Nova, Her Blog, Nov 21, 2025 A new day dawns Downunder For the first time in years, the Opposition doesn’t sound like a schoolgirl (well, not all the time). And, suddenly the government has realized they shouldn’t go burning $2 billion on a COP31 All of this pain has achieved nothing. When the Coalition left office, emissions were 28 per cent below 2005 levels. Today they are just 28.7 per cent below 2005 levels. Labor talks tough on climate but has delivered virtually no emissions reductions and higher costs. This is abject policy failure.

There is only one answer to the problem of looming blackouts – begin immediately on a large-scale rollout of new CCGT power stations. If we do that, of course, there is no economic value in building any further wind and solar capacity, so AR7 and future CfD rounds need to be cancelled.

They’ve sent a Special Rapporteur, Astrid Puentes Riano, to join three cases in Federal Courts in an amicus curiae role. She is here to cast a spell and see if she gets lucky and scores some shake-down-money in reparations. It was only a few months ago the International Court of Climate Justice (ICJ) declared that nice weather was a “human right”, thus supposedly allowing the whole world to sue everyone else, ad infinitum for bad weather. Energy Issues — US Rising Electricity Prices: The Missing Link By Jonathan Lesser, Real Clear Energy, Nov 20, 2025 The reality is that many factors are contributing to rising electricity rates, especially the rapid increases that households and businesses have experienced over the last five years. But the various studies have overlooked a key factor: the changing mix of generating resources, as traditional fossil fuel and nuclear plants have been replaced by wind and solar ones. When Energy Is Done Right, a Rising Tide Will Lift All Boats By Gary Abernathy, Real Clear Energy, Nov 18, 2025 As China launches an AI Manhattan Project, US AI Support is buckling under High Energy Prices By Eric Worrall, WUWT, Nov 21, 2025 Developing the technology alone is not enough. The USA didn’t start the current AI push. The University of Toronto developed the critical breakthrough which made the current AI revolution possible in 2012. But aside from some Canadian islands of research excellence, Canada is not a serious player in the AI race. Canada’s obsession with green energy and moribund economy gave the USA the edge – an edge the USA is now in danger of losing to China.

It would replace a Biden administration-era plan that proposed just three offshore lease sales, all in the Gulf of Mexico, between the years 2024 and 2029. Nuclear Energy and Fears A Nuclear Resurgence, But Major Obstacles Remain By Steve Goreham, Master Resource, Nov 20, 2025 Artificial intelligence needs 24-hour, 7-day, always-on power, which intermittent wind and solar can’t provide.

The future of solar now depends on innovation, transparency, and adaptability to thrive no matter what policies are put in our way. Renewable energy is cheaper and healthier – so why isn’t it replacing fossil fuels faster? By Jay Gulledge, The Conversation, Nov 17, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] A decade ago, the cheapest way to meet growing demand for electricity was to build more coal or natural gas power plants. Not anymore. Solar and wind power aren’t just better for the climate; they’re also less expensive today than fossil fuels at utility scale, and they’re less harmful to people’s health. Yet renewable energy projects face headwinds, including in the world’s fast-growing developing countries. I study energy and climate solutions and their impact on society, and I see ways to overcome those challenges and expand renewable energy – but it will require international cooperation.

Alternative, Green (“Clean”) Vehicles Ever Diminishing Vehicles We’re winning so hard, it hurts By JIT, Climate Scepticism, Nov 18, 2025 [Bernie Kepshire] The final figure shows the total car production in the UK, as reported by the SMMT, whether for domestic supply or export, by month. I think I see a trend there. If you put a line through the data since the ZEV [Zero-Emissions Vehicle mandate] began, the slope is -6500 cars per month per year. That puts the UK car industry as extinct by 2035. Health, Energy, and Climate Counting the Dead: Media Drama Warps Reality By Chuck Dinerstein, MD,, ACSH, Nov 14, 2025 Link to article: Does the news reflect what we die from? What do Americans die from, and what do the New York Times, Washington Post, and Fox News report on? By Hannah Ritchie, Tuna Acisu, and Edouard Mathieu, Our World in Data, Oct 6, 2025 From Dinerstein: The data exposes a sobering truth: the media landscape no longer reflects the statistical reality of the world but the emotional reality of what captures attention. Headlines reflect not the greatest dangers to our lives, but the strongest reactions of our hearts When the media amplifies the rare and sensational, it warps our collective sense of risk, steering fear and policy toward the exceptional instead of the everyday. From Hype to Evidence: Rethinking Microplastic Pollution in Our Foods By Chuck Dinerstein, MD, ACSH, Nov 17, 2025 Public concern about microplastics has grown rapidly—often outpacing the evidence. The European Food Safety Agency’s comprehensive review shows that while microplastics can indeed be released from food contact materials, the quantities are far lower than many early studies suggested, and most data on nanoplastics are still unreliable or missing altogether. Much of the apparent risk has been amplified by inconsistent testing methods, contamination, and the misidentification of non-plastic residues as plastic particles. This does not mean we should dismiss the issue. It means we should keep it in proportion. The science to date tells us that microplastic release from everyday packaging is a real but limited phenomenon, not a looming public health crisis. A healthy dose of reality By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Nov 19, 2025 Like those at the Globe & Mail who just wrote “For the health of Canadians, the health care sector must decarbonize now”. Right, that’s the priority. Millions of Canadians have no family doctor, and the population faces some of the world’s longest waits for essential surgeries. Other News that May Be of Interest The Congressional Minerals Mandate By Rich Nolan, Real Clear Energy, Nov 17, 2025 Why the chemtrail conspiracy theory lingers and grows – and why Tucker Carlson is talking about it By Calum Lister Matheson, The Conversation, Nov 14, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] Conspiracies are dramatic and exciting, with clear lines of good and evil, whereas real life is boring and sometimes scary. The chemtrail theory is ultimately prideful. It’s a way for theorists to feel powerful and smart when they face things beyond their comprehension and control. Conspiracy theories come and go but responding to them in the long-term means finding better ways to embrace uncertainty, ambiguity and our own limits alongside a new embrace of the tools we do have; logic, evidence and even humility. BELOW THE BOTTOM LINE Satellite-Borne Mirrors Would Light Up the Skies at Night to Boost Solar Power By Bonner Russell Cohen, Real Clear Energy, Nov 19, 2025 The orbital dynamics of rapidly moving satellites — orbiting the Earth at a speed of 4.7 miles per second — further undermine the efficiency of “sunlight on demand.” “To a static location on the ground, as computed by astronomers Michael J. I. Brown and Matt Kenworthy, that means each satellite will be within 1000 km [621 miles] of a given location on the ground for no more than 210 seconds (or 3.5 minutes) per orbit,” Siegel adds. “And you’d need thousands of them, all reflecting sunlight to the same location on the ground, to generate any power at all.” COP30 On Fire! By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Nov 20, 2025 Video Doctors dance at COP30 to demand a fossil fuel phase-out Video from AP, Via WUWT, Nov 19, 2025 A group of Canadian doctors danced to hip-hop at the U.N. climate talks in Brazil, calling for a global phase-out of fossil fuels. They say clean energy isn’t just a climate issue, it’s a public health one.

Type your email… Subscribe “Yes, but this was obvious long before the first models were created. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and thus the more of it added to the atmosphere, the higher surface temperature should rise.” Conclusion by inference. About as basic a violation of the scientific method as is possible, Sorry David, but in Immediately conceding the central ground of the dispute, the plot has been lost Some here may not forgive me the analogy, but what was done here is as though an atheist in a dispute began with, ‘yeah, the bible is true, but …’ One should study David Dibbell’s video showing the ERA5 Reanalysis Energy Conversion in the Atmosphere, to gain the critical view of increased carbon dioxide. Spoiler alert: the energetic impact of all emitted CO2 is about 10% of the width of the zero-tick, in a energy-dynamic traversing (+/-)10,000 W/m^2. The climatological effect of CO2 is revealed to be indistinguishable from zero. And climate model uncertainty? The physical theory deployed in climate models is critically deficient. A model tuned to speciously reproduce a warming trend will successfully extrapolate the future trend so long as the trend continues. Empirical extrapolations are not predictions in any scientific sense. As Chris Essex long ago noted, tuned parameters are ad hoc conservation laws that have no basis in physics. They impose climate stasis. Ad hoc laws and deficient theory make both simulations of future climate and air temperature projections themselves physically meaningless, no matter model statistical skill in extrapolation. The models are utterly unreliable – a fact already known. Pace David, but in hard ball, one doesn’t concede a home run. Thanks, Pat – I had the exact same issue with Dave’s analysis of ‘Forecast number 1’ last week: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2025/11/19/just-how-good-were-the-early-climate-models/#comment-4133138 Thanks right back, Frank. So far as I can see, your view is dead-on. But the article asserts that early climate model forecasts about global warming were correct decades before the forecasts could be evaluated. That is much like claiming that a Volkswagen has an acceleration identical to a Ferrari. It is a qualitative assessment recognizing that both can gain speed over time, but purposely ignores that the quantitative increases over time are very dissimilar. Qualitatively, they share a positive slope; however, quantitatively the accelerations are very different. Alarmists commonly wave their arms around to attract attention, but then fail to provide measurements to support their claims. It is said that mathematics is the language of science. Innumerate claims supported only by poorly-defined ‘lawyer words’ demonstrate that the claims are not supported by science. Something cannot be right and wrong at the same time. One or the other must be right, not both at the same time. The defining characteristic of a change like warming is the rate of change of the temperature with respect to time, which is the instantaneous change defined as the slope or the tangent to the temperature function at a particular time. I would submit that “early climate model forecasts” were not correct. Some were so wrong quantitatively as to be absurd. To claim that they all were correct suggests that those making such a claim never took a calculus class. The collection of early forecasts, all being quite different, serves to prove that nobody knew what they were talking about, even as late as 1988 when Hansen produced several different scenarios, all giving different results based on different assumptions. The only conclusion justified by the qualitative claims is that Earth has been warming for about 20,000 years and will probably continue to for at least a similar length of time. However, quantitatively, warming 1 degree C over the next century is not the same as warming 10 or 20 degrees in the same amount of time. It is sophistry to suggest that they are the same. Xeno’s Paradox has similarly been proven to be illogical by calculus. “…the world’s most viewed climate website” – Fred Pearce The Climate Files: The Battle for the Truth about Global Warming “…invaluable” – Steven F.

November 24, 2025 04:00 ET | Source: WeRide Inc. WeRide Inc. NEW YORK, Nov. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WeRide Inc. (“WeRide” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: WRD, HKEX:0800), a global leader in autonomous driving technology, today announced its unaudited financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2025. Financial and Operational Highlights Global Commercialization - Robotaxis Tier-1 Cities, China Abu Dhabi, UAE Zurich, Switzerland Other Global Cities Global Commercialization – Other L4 Product Lines One-Stage End-to-End L2+ Solutions Management Commentary Tony Han,WeRide's Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "In 3Q 2025, WeRide's regulatory and commercial achievements spanning eight countries demonstrated the convergence of advanced technology and global execution capabilities. We've achieved a number of significant milestones, most notably securing the fully driverless commercial robotaxi permit in Abu Dhabi, with our operations there soon reaching unit economics breakeven, a critical milestone that validates our path to profitability at scale. As we progress toward our goal of deploying hundreds of thousands of robotaxis by 2030, WeRide is well-positioned to capitalize on the autonomous driving opportunity. The depth of our technology stack, breadth of our global partnerships, and strength of our regulatory relationships position us to capture significant value as autonomous mobility transforms transportation worldwide.” Jennifer Li, WeRide’s Chief Financial Officer and Head of International, added, “Our Q3 financial performance represents substantial improvement in both growth trajectory and operational leverage. Revenue reached RMB171.0 million, representing 144.3% year-over-year growth, while the 761.0% increase in robotaxi revenue provides strong validation of our technology from both third parties and end users. Our diversified portfolio across products, services, and geographies continues to provide multiple avenues for sustained growth. Our gross margin expansion to 32.9% demonstrates our platform’s improving efficiency as we scale. Our Hong Kong dual primary listing, supported by reputable institutional investors globally, strengthens our balance sheet and establishes WeRide as an attractive public investment opportunity in autonomous driving.” Unaudited Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results Revenues Total revenue grew 144.3% YoY to RMB171.0 million (US$24.0 million) in 3Q2025, compared to RMB70.0 million in the same period of 2024. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue was RMB114.7 million (US$16.1 million) compared to RMB65.5 million in the same period of 2024. The increase of cost of revenue was mainly due to (i) an increase in cost of goods sold, aligned with the sales increase; and (ii) a slight increase in costs of services, affected by an increase in costs of intelligent data services, partially offset by a decrease in costs of ADAS research and development (R&D) services. Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit was RMB56.3 million (US$7.9 million) compared to RMB4.6 million in the same period of 2024, and gross margin was 32.9% compared to 6.5% in the same period of 2024. There were certain ADAS R&D service projects in 3Q2024 that incurred higher-than-expected costs, along with inventory write-downs. As no such items occurred in 3Q2025, both gross profit and gross margin recorded a significant YoY increase. Furthermore, certain ADAS R&D service projects with better margin profile further contributed to the increase of overall gross margin in 3Q2025. Operating Expenses Operating expenses were RMB435.8 million (US$61.2 million) compared to RMB895.7 million in the same period of 2024. Net Loss Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per ADS2 Balance Sheet Other Corporate Developments Exchange Rate Information This announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise noted, all translations from RMB to U.S. dollars are made at a rate of RMB7.1190 to US$1.00, the exchange rate set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as of September 30, 2025. Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures In evaluating its business, the Company considers and uses the non-IFRS financial measure of adjusted net loss as a supplemental measure to review and assess operating performance. The Company believes that adjusted net loss provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the Company’s consolidated results of operations in the same manner as it helps the Company’s management. The Company defines adjusted net loss as net loss for the period excluding share-based compensation expenses, fair value changes of financial assets at FVTPL and changes in the carrying amounts of preferred shares and other financial instruments subject to redemption and other preferential rights. The Company presents the non-IFRS financial measure because it is used by its management to evaluate its operating performance and formulate business plans. Adjusted net loss enables the Company’s management to assess the Company’s operating results without considering the impact of the aforementioned non-cash adjustment items that it does not consider to be indicative of its core operations. Accordingly, the Company believes that the use of this non-IFRS financial measure provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results in the same manner as its management and board of directors. This non-IFRS financial measure is not defined under IFRS and is not presented in accordance with IFRS. The non-IFRS financial measure has limitations as an analytical tool. One of the key limitations of using the adjusted net loss is that it does not reflect all items of expenses that affect the Company’s operations. Further, this non-IFRS measure may differ from the non-IFRS information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore its comparability may be limited. The non-IFRS financial measure should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to loss for the period or any other measure of performance information prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS or as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance. Investors are encouraged to review the Company’s historical non-IFRS financial measure in light of the most directly comparable IFRS measure, as shown below. The non-IFRS financial measure presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measure presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting the usefulness of such measures when analyzing the Company’s data comparatively. It is encouraged that you review the Company’s financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. Conference Call Information The Company’s management team will host an earnings conference call at 8:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, November 24, 2025 (or at 9:00 PM Beijing Time on Monday, November 24, 2025). Details for the conference call are as follows: Event Title: WeRide Inc.

Title: Let the dancing begin, Pope Alexios (the Infallible), his poor comrades, the Left’s vaudeville, the shop windows and the media

Time Published: 2025-11-24T08:09:43Z
Full Content:
Hello, today we have a journalistic celebration because, whichever way you look at it, we realized from our leader Alexis’ book, which has just come out piping hot, that in the end God does exist and of course so does the Virgin Mary. Apart from the fact that even Tsipras invoked Him in difficult moments (in Mati), we also understood it ourselves from the way we survived after the SYRIZA five-year period. So what the wise people say — “Holy Mary, help” and “God protect us” — somehow… exists, hidden as a wish deep in time, and perhaps it even holds true. To be honest with you, I leafed through the book Ithaca and I’m conveying to you whatever I understood subjectively. Tsipras, it is certain, did not write this book to apologize for anything, or almost anything. If one considers that the pivotal point of his term was the referendum, the negotiation, and its outcome — yet another memorandum worth 80–100 billion euros — for this Tsipras does not seem to repent at all. On the contrary, he considers it the correct political move which benefited the country. Meaning that if you asked him today whether he would do it again, or whether he would “take” the alternative solution the Europeans were offering him from the spring of 2015, he would obviously answer in the affirmative. Nor did I read him admitting mistakes in other critical issues, except for Zoe and Varoufakis, with whom, however, he untangled things early, since the summer of 2015. The one he utterly humiliates, clearly intentionally, is poor Kasselakis, although he does not accept that he “foisted” him onto SYRIZA. And really, if you sit and write that Tyler was asking Betty how they would raise his children with Stefanos when they go to the Maximos Mansion… you understand! Novartis-families Generally speaking I didn’t see him admit to having made a mistake, not even in the historical Novartis frame-up. There he says that “we shouldn’t have taken politicians to their natural judge but to a Preliminary Committee,” as if the Justice system were more controlled compared to the parliamentary majority he fully controlled. Even in his… attempt to make a supposed self-critique about the constant attacks on Mitsotakis’ family, he gives a completely ridiculous explanation regarding his wife, Mareva. Mitsotakis, he says, swept us away into mistakes with his communication mechanisms, resulting in “a state of siege and under the sway of anger, we adopted a tactic of highlighting scandals that concerned not only Mitsotakis but also the business activity of his wife…”. The truth of course is that he cultivated an entire media system to attack families, journalists, political opponents, etc., from the first to the last day of his term. These things of course sometimes go wrong in life — not to say almost always — and today his opponents will be enjoying his misfortunes with popcorn. Small first conclusion Nevertheless the book is very interesting because it is living history, and it will be read whether it enrages you or makes you happy because you are on the Left and nostalgically remember how lovely things were with Dritsas, Tasia, Filis, Zoe in her… right mind, and the rest of the crazy gang who brought us one step before the drachma. The book will get enormous publicity, it will raise limitless dust and disputes on both sides. It will… inevitably also assist the deeply wounded relationship of Samaras with ND, and ultimately it will benefit — gift, once again — Mitsotakis. And lastly: newspapers and shop windows Naturally I will return more analytically after I study the leader’s book, but I want to close today’s commentary with something I read that touches me in the job I’ve done for 40 years. Tsipras recounts his famous meeting with Psycharis in a mutual friend’s house, shortly before taking power. The late Stavros, after starting off with the theory that they had to come to an understanding because DOL always belonged to the… Democratic Camp, told him that at that time (DOL) was facing major financial problems, obviously implying that the new SYRIZA regime could help them. Then Tsipras, according to his own narrative, countered that they (DOL) were politically attacking them, etc. And Psycharis replied with the line: “Look, Alexis… newspapers are like shop-window displays. One time they have summer clothes, one time winter clothes. The shop is the same. The display changes.” What Psycharis told him — in truth, in a very digestible and vivid way — was, is, and I think will be the norm between power and the media, regardless of whether the (transaction) did not flourish at the time. With exceptions, of course, that stand out… Cabinet meeting The Cabinet meeting scheduled for Tuesday was moved to Wednesday afternoon, as the funeral of Nikos Hardalias’ father intervenes. It has several items, from Justice issues regarding inheritances and Environmental provisions concerning spatial planning, and generally K.M. will give the final guidelines to the ministers for the year’s end. A party with a pulse There may not have been many local derbies in ND’s Prefectural and Local Organizations, but Piraeus headquarters mobilized strongly yesterday and counted its members ahead of the elections. The mechanism warmed up a bit; 122,000 people entered the process to pay and register, and indeed at a time when internal party matters are not at their peak. What they retain in ND is that the mechanism showed vital signs ahead of the congress to be held after Easter and of course ahead of the elections. Not to mention that the numbers for ND’s Prefectural elections are larger than the internal elections for the Presidency in other parties. Geopolitical stress tests are coming to the banks The SSM is attempting a closer approach regarding geopolitical risks for European banks. And because measurements in this case cannot be precise, it is virtually impossible for corresponding forecasts to be made. They would cost billions anyway. But although the approach seems somewhat lighter, in the end it becomes an additional headache for the banks. As far as our country is concerned, even without being in a red-hot zone, it constitutes a geopolitical area of increased priority for supervisors. Thus supervision is insistently asking Greek banks as well to “stress” similar data in the exercises they conduct, such as ICAAP for example, which is the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process. This is an internal procedure banks apply to assess how resilient they are to adverse scenarios and how effective their risk-management processes are. To prove the point, JP Morgan’s Managing Director Kian Abouhossein raised the issue on Friday at the firm’s London road show, “interrogating” Pedro Machado, member of the ECB Supervisory Board. And he, among other things, answered that the thematic stress test for banks in 2026 will be an “inverse” exercise evaluating geopolitical-risk scenarios separately for each bank and their potential impact on each bank’s solvency. After all, this is the first priority of the SSM for the period 2026-2028: how banks will continue to strengthen their financial resilience in the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. Overall, discussions with banks, as he said, regarding the management of geopolitical risks continue and include the whole range: identifying these risks and of course taking the necessary actions to make banks more resilient to precisely these conditions. Signatures within the week for Ethniki Insurance The transaction for Ethniki Insurance is expected to be completed within the week. This means that the final signatures will be placed so that Piraeus Bank acquires 100% of the insurance company. And since the “what comes next” is always interesting, developments in the insurance scene around the country’s leading insurance company are expected. It is considered almost certain that sooner or later Ethniki Insurance will cooperate exclusively with its new shareholder. The above developments themselves set in motion the corresponding moves by National Bank to find a new insurance partner. Signing the agreement this week sets a milestone in that direction. The evolution at the level of bancassurance for all parties involved will become known in 2026. The ECB asks for more capital buffers from Revolut The SSM released the results of the stress test on Pillar 2 capital buffer requirements for all major European banks, and the Greek ones have among the lowest requirements, below 3%. National Bank at 2.50%, Eurobank at 2.75%, Piraeus and Alpha at 2.90%. The requirements relate to how banks operate, how they comply with SSM rules and controls. The logic is that those who do not comply are more vulnerable and therefore more capital requirements are imposed on them. There were also banks that saw an increase in their Pillar 2 required capital, such as Revolut, which became a systemic bank last year, but for next year its Pillar 2 capital requirement increased by 80 basis points to 4.50%, the highest among the 105 banks. Turnover party today at the Stock Exchange It is not unlikely that the value of transactions in today’s stock-market session will reach even 1 billion euros, due to the MSCI index rebalancing. We will have an explosive increase in turnover in the Metlen Energy & Metals stock, which is leaving the MSCI Greece Standard to join MSCI Europe, and in addition we have the entry of Viohalco and Cenergy Holdings into the Small Cap. The game professionals have played lately was classic: pressure on the stocks that are leaving MSCI until the rebalancing is completed, and an upward push on the stocks entering the MSCI indices so they are bought at high prices on rebalancing day. All this in a market that is yielding three times more than any other European market (General Index +40.28%, Banking Index +79.67%, FTSE 25 +46.08%) and with heavyweight stocks (e.g. Alpha Bank +123%, Piraeus +82%, National Bank +70%) that are flooding foreign investors’ portfolios with profits as they close out for 2025, right after Black Friday. AKTOR Group ready for a retail bond The AKTOR Group is preparing to issue a series of bonds worth 200 million euros, with a five-year duration, in order to borrow from savers at an interest rate close to 4%. At the beginning of the year, AKTOR had completed a 200-million-euro share capital increase, which was oversubscribed, to finance investments amounting to 2 billion euros. AKTOR is closely observing the success of retail bonds in the Greek market, especially after Greece’s upgrade to investment grade. The 4% for a five-year horizon for a group with a backlog that will reach 6 billion in 2025 sounds attractive. Over the past month, AKTOR Group’s stock has gained more than 11%, and its market capitalization is moving towards the target of 2 billion euros (today €1.89 billion). The difficult equation of the capital increase at ADMIE Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’ recent reference from Singapore to the possibility of a capital increase at ADMIE confirms the activity surrounding the capital reinforcement of the operator. The aim is to ensure funding for the large ten-year development program worth 6 billion euros without losing state control, with the state retaining its statutory minority, meaning it must remain at 34%. The government team is fully aware that the ambitious grid interconnection program of the coming years—almost 6 billion euros—cannot move forward solely with own funds and European resources. The entry of new investors is now considered the only way, provided that public control is not undermined. In the background, American pressure appears to play a decisive role in the shareholding developments. Diplomatic sources report that Washington and Athens have repeatedly discussed reducing Chinese influence over energy infrastructure. And it is no coincidence that among the contenders for ADMIE (besides Italian TERNA, which had been mentioned in the past), BlackRock has recently appeared, with market observers speaking of “multi-layered American activity.” Opposite these dynamics stands the Chinese giant State Grid, which with its 24% stake and enhanced rights acquired in 2017 remains a key factor. Sources familiar with the discussions claim that the Chinese do not desire conflict but request a “clear picture” of what the new shareholding structure will entail. The high quorum required for the capital increase essentially makes their consent necessary. According to information, the Maximos Mansion seeks to complete the process within the new year so that the investment momentum is not lost and uncertainty in the markets is not prolonged. The question is whether a formula can be achieved that keeps the State above 34%, brings in the American capital sought by the allies, and leaves China without reason to react. The backstage chatter says that a solution exists but requires delicate handling. The Sarantis era in Ioannina The new era of Hellenic Dairies at Dodoni formally begins. After the approval of the deal by the Competition Commission, the acquisition was completed, and already since last Friday the company’s board was radically reshaped. Thus, Chairman of the Ioannina dairy industry becomes Stelios Sarantis, son of Michalis; CEO is Giorgos Sarantis, son of Takis; Vice-Chairman and head of market supervision matters is Mr. Athanasoulas Georgios; and Deputy CEO is Mr. Konstantinos Chytas. Mr. Vlachos Nikolaos also participates in the board as a member. According to the Sarantis brothers, Dodoni’s integration into the Hellenic Dairies group will be accompanied by a series of investments. We shall see… “Byzantino” returns to The Ilisian A new gastronomic arrival—marking the first “opening” of the new destination to the general public—is in its final stage, namely the Japanese restaurant at “The Ilisian,” at the former Hilton Athens which closed in January 2022. The new restaurant, expected to become the city’s new gastronomic hotspot ahead of Christmas, has its entrance on Michalakopoulou Street, is housed in the new extension built onto the iconic property, and will overlook the impressive indoor pool of the new destination. At “The Ilisian,” the private members-only House of NYNN club has been operating since the summer, but now the destination is gradually opening to everyone—Athenians and visitors—as part of the major investment being carried out in the former Hilton building by the Konstantakopoulos–Olayan duo. The Japanese restaurant, with its impressive marble entrance on Michalakopoulou, is the first of the nine dining venues that “The Ilisian” will host, expected to open before the new year. From 2026 onward, the remaining venues will gradually follow: The emblematic Galaxy Bar on the top floor will be reintroduced as “The Galaxy Dispensary,” with a large collection of wines and premium spirits, and next to it “The Galaxy Supper Club,” a luxurious space that will elevate haute cuisine in Athens. Similarly, the “Byzantino” restaurant—a constant value from the past—will return in 2026 with a renewed appearance, while a Lounge Café Bar will operate from early morning until late at night in the hotel lobby. Optimism for 2026 early bookings Based on early bookings for the 2026 season, Greek tourism appears to be moving positively, although—according to many in the sector last weekend at Xenia—it is currently running on “autopilot.” Nearly 85% of hotels, which are small and medium-sized businesses, “cannot secure financing, and access to capital is the exception,” said Giannis Chatzis, president of the Hellenic Hoteliers Federation, during the 13th general assembly of the Hellenic Chamber of Hotels last Saturday. Tourism stakeholders are awaiting on Wednesday the Ministry of Tourism’s event for the sector, attended also by the Prime Minister, and whether Kyriakos Mitsotakis will make announcements. Note that according to data from the Bank of Greece announced last Friday regarding the travel balance, even though September “slowed down” compared to last year—with 3.42 billion euros in revenue this year versus 3.55 billion last year during the same month—the nine-month period exceeded 20 billion euros for the first time, specifically reaching 20.13 billion euros, up 9% compared to the 18.47 billion in the January–September 2024 period. Wall Street is tightening for shipping companies The latest developments on Wall Street for shipping companies show that the game is changing—and in a way that resembles a silent shift rather than a dramatic maneuver. At the annual Marine Money Ship Finance Forum, the message was clear: the market for listed shipping companies in the U.S. has shrunk by nearly half over a decade, the result of a dual “cut” from mergers and privatizations. And even if the framework seems strictly technocratic, the essence is simple: companies that remain public have two choices—either grow or leave the exchange. The pressure stems not only from low valuations or compliance costs, but also from the fact that institutional investors are looking elsewhere. With less appetite for smaller shipping firms, well-established family-owned groups often choose to depart and return to the safety of private equity. Yet, even as the American market “tightens,” Greek shipping continues to maintain a notable presence with 31 listed companies. This is not only a matter of numbers but of stability in a market that is becoming increasingly selective. Greek shipowners, through smaller listings or larger structures, maintain their footprint, consistently seizing opportunities in public markets. At the same time, the major players who remain listed—especially in the tanker sector—now function as the “flagships” of Wall Street: large market caps, high liquidity, and greater support from the investment community. It is an environment where scale becomes a strategic advantage and where, in the future, we may see only a few strong players per sector. Aramco, the Americans, and Greece in the background Aramco’s recent moves in the U.S. are not simply business announcements; they indicate that the energy game around LNG is entering a new phase, with implications stretching from the Gulf to the Eastern Mediterranean and Europe. Aramco, traditionally oil-focused, has begun systematically expanding its presence in natural gas, signing agreements with American producers such as MidOcean (Lake Charles LNG) and Commonwealth LNG in Louisiana. These are projects totaling more than 25 mtpa, a scale capable of influencing future power dynamics in the global LNG market. Saudi Arabia is attempting to diversify its energy identity at a time when Europe and Asia seek stable LNG suppliers following the disruption caused by the war in Ukraine. With more than 200 mtpa of new projects entering the market by 2030, whoever locks in strategic positions now will determine the future rules of the game. Moreover, strengthening U.S. production through foreign investment boosts America’s role as an energy superpower. This carries political weight in the Middle East, where Washington wants to maintain influence, and in the Eastern Mediterranean, where energy developments (Cyprus, Israel, Egypt) are at a critical point. And it opens a cycle of competition and opportunity for countries like Greece, which sees LNG taking a central role in its infrastructure—from Alexandroupoli to Revithoussa—making it a hub for flows toward the Balkans. Aristides and the… Pittas Fund While the major players in containerships worry about the orderbook-mountain coming toward 2027, Aristides Pittas seems to be following a different strategy — one Wall Street describes with a single phrase: “locking in the upside before the music stops.” In the last quarter, the head of the U.S.-listed Euroseas did something reminiscent of a hedge fund manager in “protect the portfolio from any possible storm” mode. Four newbuild vessels that haven’t even hit the water yet secured four-year charters at $35,500 per day, and a fifth one, already at sea, locked in close to $33,500. Some in New York would call it “building my yield before the correction begins.” He believes the big wave of new capacity will pressure the mega-ships, but not the feeder containerships. In other words, he is positioning himself in a segment that is shrinking — therefore becoming increasingly scarce and, consequently, more profitable for those who already have exposure there. At the brokers’ tables, people comment that Pittas “closed his 2026 books before they even opened.” With already 70% coverage of the 2026 operating days, the model looks more like a tech company locking in recurring revenue than a classic shipping company playing spot-to-spot. The best quarter for HELEX and Bouzna’s plans This afternoon, after the close of the session, HELEX will announce its Q3 results. Information converges toward the estimate that net profit for the third quarter will easily exceed €8 million — making this HELEX’s best quarter in the past 12 years. The HELEX share, at €5.96, trades at a discount of about -8% relative to its now-parent company, Euronext. For his part, Stéphane Bouzna has been giving interviews to international media in recent days, explaining Euronext’s broader plan. Of particular interest was his interview with CNBC, where — after praising the reform momentum of the Greek economy and reiterating plans to create a new technology and support hub in Athens now that the Athens Stock Exchange will migrate to Euronext’s advanced Optiq trading platform — he spoke about the broader strategy. Euronext is ready to contribute to the next level of market integration in Europe, creating a deeper liquidity pool for financing European entrepreneurship. He spoke about his contacts with the London Stock Exchange but did not hide that he also held discussions with the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, explaining that it would be interesting for Deutsche Börse if it were willing to sell — in response to Chancellor Merz’s call for the creation of a pan-European stock exchange. The Trojan horse of… socialism in… golden California In California, 200 billionaires have been counted, with combined wealth estimated at $2 trillion.California’s budget is on the edge of a cliff, especially after President Trump’s federal government decision to cut healthcare spending by at least $30 billion. Suddenly, someone threw out the idea: Let’s impose an extraordinary one-off 5% levy on the wealth of California’s 200 billionaires so we can all live better. The Medicaid cuts threaten 145,000 jobs in the healthcare sector. The truth is that today, 1% of California taxpayers pay over 40% of the state’s income taxes. If yet another — “extraordinary, but who can be sure?” — 5% tax is imposed, how will the 200 billionaires react? Some will choose relocation to “friendlier” states such as Florida, Texas, or Nevada. Others will transfer ownership rights to trusts or offshore structures. Some will suspend planned investments in California, and others will reduce philanthropic and institutional funding. Triggered by the victory of the “socialist” Mamdani in New York, the debate is hot on California’s TV networks. The proposal faces constitutional obstacles, while previous similar initiatives were abandoned. California governor Gavin Newsom strongly opposes it. The healthcare workers’ union ignores him and pushes the vote forward. Ray Dalio no longer believes in bitcoin Billionaire investor and founder of Bridgewater Associates, Ray Dalio, gave an interview to CNBC and revealed that he now holds only 1% of his portfolio in bitcoin. It is a position that resembles more a safety valve than an investment conviction. Dalio argued that bitcoin will never become a reserve currency for major countries because, after spectacular developments in quantum computing, the cryptocurrency can be detected, controlled, and — most importantly — compromised. That’s why Dalio again believes in gold. The truth is that in the past Dalio said quite the opposite about bitcoin (“it has proven its value… it hasn’t been hacked… it has stood the test of time”). But now that bitcoin’s exchange rate is collapsing, and after Google’s presentation of its quantum supercomputer, Dalio’s stance has changed dramatically… Yesterday, the bitcoin price had plunged to as low as $84,600 before recovering later above $86,700.

Title: Irish designer Rashhiiid: ‘My hats are talking points now – these things make me happy’

It all began with a hat, handmade from fake fur with a silk lining. Rachel Maguire was in her final year studying fashion at the Grafton Academy when she decided to make “one big bold hat” during Covid, and was taken aback when suddenly everyone who saw her wearing it wanted one too. “I felt it expressed me and made me feel better, and was a way of coming through Covid. People broke the two-metre rule to touch it. My hats are talking points now – these things make me happy, so I want to make other people feel empowered through my clothing,” she says when we meet in Blackrock in Dublin, a few weeks after her thrilling debut show in the Douglas Hyde Gallery. In the four years since she launched her label Rashhiiid (the name comes from a childhood nickname), Maguire, who is now 27, has shown extraordinary resilience and determination, demonstrating how a wild imagination can create desirable clothing. Her designs – expressive, zany and often daring – have attracted the attention of superstars like Doja Cat, who has endorsed not just her hats, but her coats and bags too, and commissioned a custom-made denim outfit. Rapper Megan Thee Stallion wore her faux Mongolian lamb boot covers performing in Boston. Her floor-length fake fur bubble coats in bright blue or pink are similar scene stealers. Her hats, her best sellers, continue to make statements. With titles like Grand Dollar Bill, Tower of Fantasy, Silver Bucket or Rainbow Racoon, they form dramatic furry frames around the face. Last year she moved to Paris, bought the best industrial sewing machine she could find, and along with two Irish interns in her studio, she completed orders, “working and doing photo shoots”, with a French PR company helping with promotion. In August, when Paris shut down, she took off for Guangzhou in China, a key area in textile manufacturing, checked into a three-star hotel in the city. “I spent the whole month there – no one spoke English, there was no internet, but I found a family-run factory making for luxury European brands that was good quality. I was lonely, with noodles for breakfast every day, and I was sewing from Monday to Sunday through the week to create my own custom pieces from fabrics I could source there. It was a dream come true.” The long grey/green dress she is wearing from her new collection is an example of the fabrics she found – a soft jersey suede which she has embellished with patch pockets. She came home laden down with pieces handmade from quality fabrics for her first collection, recalling the hotel room with fabric samples strewn all over the floor – “it looked like a drug den”. Her tireless use of social media to promote her work has ensured a following of 35,000 on Instagram. With her porcelain skin and long auburn hair, she is the best walking advertisement for her own designs. “I love using other models, but when I [model] it myself, it gets such a good response,” she says. Her debut streetwear show “I Survived Myself” in the Douglas Hyde Gallery in Dublin in September, billed as “blending bold fashion design, personal expression and cultural influence”, was a tour de force. The long unisex faux fur coats, printed suits with faux fur trim, lace dresses, ruffle skirts, cargo pants, camouflage and pop art prints delivered great impact. Woolly mammoth coats or sexy skintight bodysuits with Davy Crockett-style headgear created a look of feral femininity with occasional bondage accents. Fake fur duffle bags, furry boots and couples connected by fur ropes were par for the course. Sections of the show called Strength and Rebirth were references to her previous mental health struggles; statement print leggings were composed of personal messages, and another outfit was a patchwork of newspaper headlines. “I am truly passionate about what I love and what I do, and that saved my life,” she says. “Money will come in due course, but it will come in the right way. I am not going to churn out T-shirts that are going to a landfill dump. My clothing tells a story about who I am.” Maguire comes from an interesting background: her father is a solicitor turned winemaker of Les Deux Cols, co-owner of 64 Wines in Glasthule in Dublin; her mother, Lucy Gaffney, is a well-known businesswoman and equality advocate. Both are great supporters of her work. She is very clear about priorities. “I want to stay making and in my own world – I would never get out of bed if I was scrolling all day. I want to stay unique and get inspired by real things, not what’s on my phone.” Plans include arranging events where customers can view the collection first-hand – “I like that idea of interaction – I want to build a community and talk to people through my clothing.” Visit www.rashhiiid.com or follow her on Instagram @rashhiiid © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Patchy bus service ‘demoralising’ for residents in south Dublin suburb
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/dublin/2025/11/24/patchy-bus-service-demoralising-for-residents-in-south-dublin-suburb/
Time Published: 2025-11-24T06:00:01Z
Full Content:
Residents of a south Dublin suburb say the area is being “left behind” and “forgotten by those that make the decisions” due to infrequent and unreliable bus services, despite its recent population growth. Cristina Gheorghe, originally from Romania, has lived in the Kilternan area, in the foothills of the Dublin mountains about 1.5km from Carrickmines and 6km from Bray, since 2009. She described the issues as “demoralising and sad”. To access the city centre by bus, the area has the 118, which runs only once a day from Kilternan to Eden Quay at 7.45am from Monday to Friday with no return service, and the 44 bus from Enniskerry to Dublin City University, running about once every hour. She takes public transport to work in the city centre but if it doesn’t come, she says, she can’t wait an hour on the next bus and has to get a taxi or a lift to the Luas stop, which is two kilometres away. “How can we have independent kids and grandparents – when we have to jump in the car?” “It has a massive impact, you’re left with no solution. Everyone here drives but it’s not good for the environment.” Local Fine Gael councillor Pierce Dargan sees it as a “failing” that the Luas is not supported by bus routes. He also said not everyone can take the Luas, depending on where their destination is. He said the routes in the area had “always been an issue” but the situation had become “more severe” when BusConnects changed the routes earlier this year. “There are more houses being built here than almost anywhere else in the country ... the population has increased by so much and we don’t see any more routes being announced or frequency increased.” [ ‘It’s a crazy set-up’: residents who lost out in bus changes protest against new routesOpens in new window ] He said the 63 bus route, which directly linked Kilternan with the large town of Dún Laoghaire, had been split into two routes, the L26 and the L27. He said people need to travel to Dún Laoghaire for work, school or any county council services. Barry Mason, who lives in Kilternan, takes the L26, which is scheduled to run every half an hour, to work in Blackrock. “The situation is frustrating. More often than not I’m complaining about it. My daughter calls the L26 my arch-nemesis,” he said. Mason uses the service in the morning on his way to work but said “as the day progresses it gets worse”. He said there were at least 20 other people from the area who travel to Blackrock for work and more rely on it to catch connecting services such as the L27 to Dún Laoghaire or the Luas. In the evening, he waits for the 4.25pm bus to get home. Last week the bus arrived on time only once, he said. He said there was no direct bus to Bray. “If there was a bus that could go to Bray via Shankill, it would connect Kilternan and surrounding areas to the Dart,” he said. “As it currently stands it feels as we have been left very short of alternatives and heavily reliant on the L26, which ghosts people.” Brian Vaughan, who lives in nearby Carrickmines, is considering moving to Bray as there is no direct route to Bray for his twin daughters and at least 10 others from the area, where they attend their nearest Gaelscoil secondary school. “It’s very hard for them to get around. It’s 15 minutes by car but it’s almost impossible for them to get to school.” He said the family had to buy a second car as they cannot rely on public transport. “It’s difficult on my daughters and people of the same age in the area. We’re spending a lot of time in the car and on petrol when we shouldn’t have to.” A spokeswoman for the National Transport Authority said it “regularly reviews services” across the Transport for Ireland network to “ensure they meet passenger needs and values feedback from local communities”. “Concerns regarding services, direct connections from Kilternan and overall reliability will be taken into account as part of ongoing service reviews.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up for push alerts to get the best breaking news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone Listen to In The News podcast daily for a deep dive on the stories that matter © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Great restaurants around Ireland for a casual bite

Regardless of whether it’s sunny, windy or raining, or possibly even all three at once, a stop at Blackrock Cottage is a must when in Salthill. Open for daytime breakfast and lunch and weekend dinners, chef Michael McManus’s goal is to create memories. Try his elevated classics such salmon with brown bread or seafood chowder, or go for one his Asian-inspired hits. The new covered and heated outdoor area is a welcome addition for walkers and pet-owners. JC Takashi Miyazaki’s casual Japanese restaurant puts a strong focus on sustainable ingredients, but always in a fun and relaxed manner. It’s rare that a chef surrenders a Michelin star, but making that decision has allowed Ichigo Ichie to become a Cork nexus for interesting and tasty food, served with a choice range of natural wines. Star billing goes to the handmade buckwheat noodles, served hot and cold in various dishes. JC Izz is more than a cafe – it’s a vibrant meeting of Cork and Palestinian culture, bursting with hospitality and bold, aromatic dishes. Highlights from chef Eman Aburabi include the popular taster plate of hummus, babaganoush, zingy tabbouleh and warm manaeesh. Don’t skip the Musakhan – roast chicken with sumac and spices baked on bread. AD A Chinese grill house where the skewers are the big draw: cumin-dusted duck tongue, mahogany-skinned quail, and spicy lamb with a smoking fat cap. The sides are no afterthought either: crisp chilli-oil potatoes, bubbling corn-and-cheese, and oyster grilled with garlic and glass noodles. Pair it all with beer, which comes by the pint or in giant self-pour pots. Read our review here. CH Tokyo native and classically trained sushi chef Ken Komatsu is the man behind Matsui Ramen, a real-deal weekend ramen joint tucked away in a Kildare GAA club. Try prawn tuskemen, chilled thick noodles with a rich and savoury prawn broth, or warm up with tantanmen, a creamy and sesame child broth with thin noodles and minced pork. And if you fancy getting your hands on authentic Japanese knives to up your kitchen game, Ken is the man to ask. JC Scéal Cafe’s bright and modern interior with windows overlooking the marina is the perfect backdrop for its laser sharp and utterly moreish viennoiserie and speciality coffee. Shelves are stacked with sourdough loaves, which cut open to reveal glossy bubbly interiors. Owners Charlotte Leonard-Kane and Shane Palmer have generated a cult following from their time in Dublin 8, many of whom gladly make the pilgrimage to Greystones for their flaky pastry fix. This autumn has seen the publication of the Scéal cookbook, showing exactly how it’s all done. JC This slick diningroom is a clever mash-up of the Big Fan crew, Hidden Agenda promoters and Whiplash beer – so you’re set for great food, tunes and drinks. The food does tend to steal the show, though; chefs Alex Zhang and Chun Li bring traditional Chinese cooking techniques together with top Irish produce for lip-smacking, umami-rich dumplings, bao and Xiao Chi. Comfy seats are a big bonus, that is, until the music pulls you up for a dance. Read our review here. AD Tang now has four Dublin locations, including its newest on Windmill Lane. Its familiar Middle Eastern-inspired salads and wraps remain wildly popular, alongside queue-worthy brunch dishes, elevated since chef Keith Coleman (ex-Fumbally and Fia) became executive chef. It serves dinner on Thursday and Friday, moving from its Cumberland Place terrace to indoors on Abbey Street for the winter. Expect more vibrant, colourful plates of Middle Eastern favourites and a lively drinks list. Read our review here. AD Long a tourist town, Killarney has steadily established a quality food and drink scene in recent years. Nowhere embodies this more than Tango, a combination Argentinian parrilla and Neapolitan pizza restaurant from Facundo Rodulfo and Pamela Neumann. A lover of fire and grill, Rodulfo marries his heritage and experiences in beef empanadas, choripan sausage sandwiches and oozing grilled provolone cheese. Look out for Tango’s first cookbook or attend a masterclass to learn the tricks for yourself. JC Breakfast is now served in this restored 1820s coach house, where three fires burn all day. Lunch and dinner bring confit duck croquettes with butternut squash purée, croque monsieur with house-baked ham and Comté, and Kilmore Quay monkfish with charred baby gem. Next door, you’ll find Roundwood Stores bakery offers more casual options. CH Our pizza obsession owes much to brothers Ronan and Eugene Greaney, whose Dough Bros business continues to thrive. This year they opened Lil’ Bros slice shop on Eyre Square, but Middle Street remains the best place to experience their craft – quirky, creative Neapolitan pizzas showcasing top Irish artisan ingredients, cooked fresh and fast in a wood-fired oven. They also offer a stellar list of soft drinks, local beers and quaffable wines. AD © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. Battle with Roy at Peach's Castle is retiring soon, but you can get this $65 Lego Mario set for $28 in Amazon's Black Friday sale. By Steven Petite on November 23, 2025 at 5:55PM PST Lego Super Mario: Battle with Roy at Peach's Castle (738 Pieces) $28 (was $65) | Retiring soon Update: This deal is no longer available. For the second week in a row, Amazon is selling a Lego Super Mario playset for over 50% off during its Black Friday sale. Last week it was Soda Jungle Maker, and this week it's Battle with Roy at Peach's Castle. Normally $65, this 738-piece building set is discounted to only $28. Like Soda Jungle Maker, Peach's Castle is retiring soon, so this is likely your last chance to get a massive discount on the set. Amazon has already sold out of this deal once today (November 23), but the deal is back in stock as of 5:55 PM PT. Battle with Roy at Peach's Castle comes with three buildable Lego Super Mario figures: Roy, Red Toad, and a Chain Chomp that pulls Roy's sled. It doesn't include Peach, who is only available as an interactive figure in the Super Mario Adventures Starter Set, which is on sale for $40 (was $50). The castle's fold-out walls are destructible, so you can easily refortify your defenses after Chain Chomp crashes into them. Toad can sling projectiles at Roy and Chain Chomp with a built-in catapult atop the castle. If you have Interactive Princess Peach, you can tap the Action Tags on the rotating throne, in the small garden where Toad likes to hang out, and in hidden spots. Tapping an Action Tag plays music and sound effects from the Peach figure's built-in speakers. More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Title: AI Data Center Overinvestment Debate Intensifies
URL: https://newsonjapan.com/article/147701.php
Time Published: 2025-11-23T20:35:47Z
Full Content:
TOKYO, Nov 24 (News On Japan) - A growing debate over whether major technology companies are overinvesting in data centers has emerged as one of the most closely watched issues in global markets over the past two weeks, as heavy capital spending by Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet triggers fresh questions about profitability, risk management and the long-term sustainability of AI-related infrastructure investment. While discussions about excessive spending on data centers have surfaced periodically since earlier this year, concerns intensified in early November after Meta announced the issuance of large-scale corporate bonds to finance new data-center infrastructure. Amazon followed with multi-trillion-yen bond issuance of its own, accelerating investor unease that Big Tech may be committing to expansion on a scale that will be difficult to recover through future earnings. Analysts note that similar alarms were raised in the spring, when Microsoft’s rapid increase in data-center investment briefly pushed its share price downward. Although Microsoft later demonstrated stronger-than-expected cloud profitability, restoring the stock’s momentum, recent market reactions suggest that investors are once again sensitive to the possibility of overcapacity. At the center of the market’s short-term anxiety is Nvidia, whose earnings announcement was scheduled for release on the evening of November 6th U.S. time. Although Nvidia is the world’s largest listed company by market capitalization and its quarterly results draw global attention, industry specialists argue that Nvidia itself is not responsible for the potential overinvestment problem. Because the company does not build data centers—supplying only the semiconductors used within them—its exposure to investment risk remains limited. The current concerns, they say, relate primarily to the companies constructing the facilities, not the device manufacturers responding to orders. Capital-expenditure forecasts compiled by market analysts illustrate the divide: Apple and Nvidia appear at the bottom in terms of anticipated outlays, while Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Oracle show steep upward investment trajectories. Apple, in particular, has deliberately avoided the data-center arms race, choosing instead to rely on hybrid models using external AI infrastructure rather than directly competing in facility construction. Oracle, buoyed by demand from OpenAI, has recently accelerated its investment pace. Meta’s stock has come under especially heavy selling pressure, with the company falling nearly 10 percent following its bond-issuance announcement. Market participants attribute this reaction to two factors: first, CEO Zuckerberg’s remark that it remains uncertain whether the investment will translate directly into profit growth, but that “not investing now would be the greater risk.” Analysts viewed the statement as an inversion of normal capital-expenditure logic, prompting concerns about strategic discipline. Second, investors remain wary after Meta’s earlier push into the metaverse failed to gain traction despite major financial commitments and a corporate name change. Even so, some specialists argue that technologies dismissed as premature—such as AI a decade ago—can surge once the right market environment arrives. The long history of metaverse-like platforms, including the rise and collapse of virtual worlds such as Second Life in the mid-2000s, is often cited as evidence that cycles of enthusiasm and stagnation repeat until demand eventually aligns. For now, however, the data-center overinvestment question dominates market sentiment. Investors are watching whether the massive spending undertaken by major U.S. platforms can be justified by future profits—or whether companies like Apple, which has largely stayed out of the infrastructure race, will ultimately be rewarded for their restraint. The outcome, analysts say, will shape the competitive landscape over the next one to two years and could significantly influence the direction of global AI development. While discussions about excessive spending on data centers have surfaced periodically since earlier this year, concerns intensified in early November after Meta announced the issuance of large-scale corporate bonds to finance new data-center infrastructure. Amazon followed with multi-trillion-yen bond issuance of its own, accelerating investor unease that Big Tech may be committing to expansion on a scale that will be difficult to recover through future earnings. Analysts note that similar alarms were raised in the spring, when Microsoft’s rapid increase in data-center investment briefly pushed its share price downward. Although Microsoft later demonstrated stronger-than-expected cloud profitability, restoring the stock’s momentum, recent market reactions suggest that investors are once again sensitive to the possibility of overcapacity. At the center of the market’s short-term anxiety is Nvidia, whose earnings announcement was scheduled for release on the evening of November 6th U.S. time. Although Nvidia is the world’s largest listed company by market capitalization and its quarterly results draw global attention, industry specialists argue that Nvidia itself is not responsible for the potential overinvestment problem. Because the company does not build data centers—supplying only the semiconductors used within them—its exposure to investment risk remains limited. The current concerns, they say, relate primarily to the companies constructing the facilities, not the device manufacturers responding to orders. Capital-expenditure forecasts compiled by market analysts illustrate the divide: Apple and Nvidia appear at the bottom in terms of anticipated outlays, while Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Oracle show steep upward investment trajectories. Apple, in particular, has deliberately avoided the data-center arms race, choosing instead to rely on hybrid models using external AI infrastructure rather than directly competing in facility construction. Oracle, buoyed by demand from OpenAI, has recently accelerated its investment pace. Meta’s stock has come under especially heavy selling pressure, with the company falling nearly 10 percent following its bond-issuance announcement. Market participants attribute this reaction to two factors: first, CEO Zuckerberg’s remark that it remains uncertain whether the investment will translate directly into profit growth, but that “not investing now would be the greater risk.” Analysts viewed the statement as an inversion of normal capital-expenditure logic, prompting concerns about strategic discipline. Second, investors remain wary after Meta’s earlier push into the metaverse failed to gain traction despite major financial commitments and a corporate name change. Even so, some specialists argue that technologies dismissed as premature—such as AI a decade ago—can surge once the right market environment arrives. The long history of metaverse-like platforms, including the rise and collapse of virtual worlds such as Second Life in the mid-2000s, is often cited as evidence that cycles of enthusiasm and stagnation repeat until demand eventually aligns. For now, however, the data-center overinvestment question dominates market sentiment. Investors are watching whether the massive spending undertaken by major U.S. platforms can be justified by future profits—or whether companies like Apple, which has largely stayed out of the infrastructure race, will ultimately be rewarded for their restraint. The outcome, analysts say, will shape the competitive landscape over the next one to two years and could significantly influence the direction of global AI development. Source: テレ東BIZ A large-scale water outage continued across parts of Okinawa on November 25th after a damaged pipeline caused significant leakage the previous day, with local authorities reporting ongoing disruptions as of 11:35 a.m. Yellow dust is forecast to reach Fukuoka from the morning of November 25th through November 26th, prompting the city to urge residents—particularly those with respiratory or allergy-related conditions—to take precautions such as wearing masks when going outdoors. Kyoto’s famed autumn foliage reached its peak in late November as crowds gathered at Eikando, a temple with more than a thousand years of history and one of the city’s most celebrated spots for viewing fall colors, with visitors posing for photos along the bridge railings and foreign tourists standing out prominently among them. A large fire that broke out late on November 23rd at a waste plastic recycling plant in the city of Bando in Ibaraki has continued to burn for roughly 18 hours, with no clear timeline for containment. The blaze was first reported at around 10:40 p.m. on November 23rd when nearby residents alerted firefighters after seeing flames and smoke rising from the site. A deepening labor shortage is increasingly weighing on the Japanese economy, forcing businesses to shorten operating hours or scale back services and generating massive lost opportunities that are estimated to reach 16 trillion yen in fiscal 2024. Nvidia maintains an estimated 80% share of the global AI chip market, but a surge of new competitors is beginning to challenge the company’s dominance, reshaping expectations across the semiconductor industry. Japan's digital currency sector has transformed from a Wild West frontier into one of the most carefully monitored markets in the world. A growing debate over whether major technology companies are overinvesting in data centers has emerged as one of the most closely watched issues in global markets over the past two weeks, as heavy capital spending by Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet triggers fresh questions about profitability, risk management and the long-term sustainability of AI-related infrastructure investment. A dramatic shift is beginning to unfold in software development as AI transforms programming into an everyday skill that no longer requires specialist expertise, a trend highlighted in a forthcoming set of 2026 technology forecasts compiled by Nikkei BP. Generative AI continues to evolve at astonishing speed, raising both expectations and concerns about a future in which machine intelligence surpasses human capability, and according to Shota Imai, a 31-year-old visiting professor at the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology who is emerging as one of the country’s leading young AI researchers, the question now is how closely AI’s value systems can be aligned with those of humans, as breakthroughs since the arrival of ChatGPT push society into uncharted territory. ここ数年、日本企業では多くの大きな変化が起きています。その中でも特に注目されているのが AI OCR の活用です。 Apple’s position in the global race for artificial intelligence is increasingly in focus as questions continue to surface over whether the company has fallen behind Google and Microsoft, and how it compares with Nvidia, now one of the world’s most powerful semiconductor makers.

Stella Gallagher A woman who died after a knife attack which also left her husband seriously injured has been hailed as a loyal friend and someone who recognised the power of working and socialising with others. Stella Gallagher (59) was hailed as a dearly loved wife and mother whose tragic death has shocked the entire Cork community. Mrs Gallagher died at Cork University Hospital (CUH) where she had been rushed by paramedics last Monday evening after suffering critical injuries when she and her husband, Brian, were attacked by a knife-wielding man near their Shrewsbury Downs home in Ballinlough, Cork. Stella Gallagher Today's News in 90 Seconds - Sunday, November 23 Mr Gallagher was seriously injured during the incident and continues to recover at CUH. Mrs Gallagher was a retired chemical engineer. She was originally from Ballinspittle and was known under her maiden name of Griffin at her workplace Eli Lilly. Tributes have poured in for the mother who was hailed as a dedicated gardener, a keen singer and someone who was a loyal friend. Mrs Gallagher was held in high esteem at the Togher Community Garden which is a volunteer-led not for profit facility on the southside of Cork city. In a statement online her fellow gardeners said that it was with “profound sadness” that they learned of the passing of their dear friend and gifted gardener Stella. "It is with profound sadness that we share the news of the passing of our dear friend and fellow gardener, Stella,” they said. "Stella was a cherished and invaluable friend to us all in the Togher Community Garden family. Her absence will be deeply felt by everyone here. "We will especially remember her beautiful smile and the gentle person she was to everyone she met. Our garden will always hold memories of her kindness." "We send our deepest condolences to her family and loved ones during this difficult time. Rest in peace, dear Stella." Personal tributes have also been paid to Mrs Gallagher. A fellow gardener in the Togher Community Garden said that Stella “who somebody who made such an impression so quickly.” “Her personality really shone through. She brought a lot of life into our garden, it's the people who make a community and with the mark she left on us she'll always be a part of ours." Mrs Gallagher was also a much valued member of the SHEP Community Choir. A SHEP spokesperson said that Stella was a member "since the very beginning" and loved being part of that community. "She was a very gentle and caring presence in the choir and brought much joy to others through her singing and camaraderie,” they said. "She recognised the power and comfort of singing with others. She was also a very committed and generous supporter of the choir's fundraising initiatives. She was much loved and will be very much missed. May her gentle and kind soul be at peace." Another choir member said that Stella was a "kind, thoughtful, gentle lady who always had time for a chat" with another member describing her as "beautiful both inside and out." Her former coworkers at Eli Lilly in Kinsale noted her "kind, caring nature" as well as her competency as an engineer. Mrs Gallagher was also fondly remembered by parents whose children attended St Anthony’s national school in Ballinlough at the same time as her sons. A classmate of hers in secondary school remembered her as a "warm, kind, gentle and unassuming" friend. Mrs Gallagher is survived by her husband Brian and her children Ciara, Conor, David and Mark. She is also sadly missed by her brother Denis, parents-in-law Val and Geraldine, brothers-in-law Alan and Mark, sisters-in-law Erika, Ann, Michele and Mary, nephews, nieces, extended family and friends. The "much loved mother" will lie in repose at the Temple Hill Funeral Home in Boreenmanna Road in Cork from 5pm to 6pm on Monday (November 24). Her Requiem Mass will take place at 11am on Tuesday in the Church of Our Lady of Lourdes in Ballinlough. The Mass will be live streamed. Mrs Gallagher's burial will follow at St Michael’s Cemetery in Blackrock in Cork city. One mourner described the late Mrs Gallagher as a “gentle lady with a ready smile” whilst another said that she was a “wonderful person.” Neighbours in the tightknit estate also paid tribute to her. Taoiseach Micheál Martin lives in the Ballinlough area and admitted the thoughts and prayers of everyone in the community is with the family involved. The National Women’s Council of Ireland also offered its “deepest sympathies” to the loved ones of Mrs Gallagher. In a statement, the NWC said "that their thoughts are especially with her husband Brian who was also seriously injured and remains in a stable condition in hospital." Last Wednesday, Mrs Gallagher's son, David (25), was charged in connection with the fatal attack. David Gallagher, with an address at Shrewsbury Downs, Ballinlough, Cork was charged before Cork District Court with the murder of his mother and with assault causing harm to his father. Mr Gallagher was remanded in custody and will appear before Cork District Court again by video link on November 26.

🛍️ The 52 best Walmart Black Friday deals to shop right now (updating) 🛍️ By Heather Kuldell-Ware Published Nov 23, 2025 8:55 AM EST We may earn revenue from the products available on this page and participate in affiliate programs. Learn more › Sign Up For Goods 🛍️ Product news, reviews, and must-have deals. Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s been a rough stretch for many budgets, thanks to tariffs and rising grocery bills. If you stashed money this year in a Flexible Spending Account (aka a Flexible Spending Arrangement) and managed to dodge major medical expenses, now’s the time to put those hard-earned, pre-tax dollars to work for you and stock up for 2026 before your plan’s deadline. While FSAs are best known for covering copays and over-the-counter basics—like anti-inflammatories and cold & flu meds, first-aid and emergency kits, and vision and eye-care—you may also be able to put that balance toward high-tech health wearables, mobility and recovery gear, or even certain specialty mattresses and e-bike setups with a doctor’s note. And there’s no legal reason you can’t take advantage of that FSA and a discount shopping holiday like Black Friday/Cyber Monday simultaneously, so scroll those sales ASAP! You’ve already used the funds to lower this year’s tax liability; now let them enhance next year’s life. A health FSA is an employer-sponsored benefit that lets you set aside part of each paycheck—up to $3,300 for 2025—into an account for out-of-pocket medical costs. You decide whether to opt in when you start a job or during annual open enrollment or other qualifying life events, and then determine how much to contribute from each paycheck. Think of it as a single-year health nest egg you can use for deductibles, copayments, prescriptions, and a range of eligible medical expenses. Traditionally, you submit a claim to your FSA administrator with proof of what you bought and confirmation that insurance didn’t cover it. Many plans now offer a debit card you can swipe like a checking account, but it’s still smart to save your receipts in case your plan—or the IRS—asks for documentation later. An FSA can be a powerful budgeting tool for people with predictable, recurring medical costs, such as a payment plan for braces, monthly insulin refills, or a new annual supply of contact lenses. But if your FSA is more of a “just in case” cushion, it’s easy to reach the end of the year with a surprising amount of money sitting there—and a countdown to spend it. Unlike Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), FSAs require you to spend your balance by December 31 or you forfeit the funds. Some employers offer a small rollover—up to $660—or a grace period of an extra month or two to use the remaining funds. For your plan’s exact rules, check with your employer. What’s covered by FSA reimbursement is determined by the IRS and must be a “qualified medical expense.” In the IRS docs, that’s defined as “costs related to the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or expenses that affect the structure or function of the body.” First-aid supplies and over-the-counter meds may come to mind first, but it can also include things like: Your FSA provider is ultimately the referee here. If you’re hoping to get reimbursed for something that isn’t clearly listed as an eligible expense, you may need a Letter of Medical Necessity (LMN)—essentially a note from your doctor explaining why you need it for a specific condition. With an LMN, some plans will cover things like vitamins, exercise equipment or fitness trackers, specialty pillows or mattresses, and even massage guns, as long as they’re prescribed to treat a documented medical issue and your plan signs off. It’s easy to find FSA-eligible items online; many vendors clearly label FSA and HSA items, and large retailers like Amazon, Target, Walmart, and CVS have dedicated portals. Supergoop! This staff favorite is one of the few sunscreens that some of us will put on our faces. It goes on invisible—no smeary white to rub in—and is virtually weightless. How does a liquid leave a powdery feel? We’re not sure about the chemistry, but we know it happens. And if you’re outdoorsy, it’s not just important during sunny summer, so it’s a perfect Add to Cart. Banana Boat Need a bigger bottle to smear on the kids? This family size provides SPF 50 protection that resists sweat and water. But remember: You’re supposed to put a shot glass’s worth of sunscreen on each time you head out in the rays. OMRON Blood pressure probably isn’t top of mind unless you know yours is too high or too low. Having a reliable monitor at home provides a convenient way to check your blood pressure more often than random clinical visits, which can help spot sudden changes or changing trends. Versions with arm cuffs, like this Omron Platinum model, tend to be more accurate than the wrist-worn kind. This model stores up to 100 readings for two users and syncs with the OMRON connect app to easily share reports with your doctor. Dexcom Part of the promise of tech-infused health care is more personalized care. The cost of devices like at-home glucose monitors has come down enough that people can now see how different foods, workouts, and even sleep affect their blood sugar in real time. This particular device was created for people with Type 2 diabetes not using insulin, those with prediabetes, and health-conscious adults. Johnson & Johnson This compact first-aid kit is small and inexpensive enough to stash anywhere you tend to do everyday damage and suddenly need a bandage. Inside are 80 pieces of essential care—hand-cleaning wipes, extra-strength Tylenol, gauze, Neosporin, and more—all in a package that fits easily in a glove box, desk drawer, or carry-on bag. FriCARE We stash these self-adhesive rolls of tape in all sorts of places: first-aid kits, sports bags, most notably. They’re latex-free, great for sprains or just holding gauze or large bandages in place without using the kind of tape that feels like it’s going to rip your skin off when you remove it. It’s even useful for furry family members (animal or human). Biotrue Contact solutions do expire, but regular users often find they fly through these 10-ounce bottles faster than they expect. This two-pack of multipurpose cleaner also comes with a new contact case to replace your crusty one. ThinOptics We know two things about readers: either you refuse to wear them, or you own a pair that’s never where you actually need it. ThinOptics solves that with ultra-slim specs that tuck into a case and attach to the back of your phone. They’re armless, resting on your nose like an old-timey pince-nez, and come in standard 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 magnifications. iHealth Is the coughing and sneezing some dust or something bigger? Stock up on these rapid 15-minute tests to get your first indications whether you have flu or COVID, and then plan out your next steps. Clearblue Preggers? Not preggers? Whichever outcome you want, this early-detection test finds even low concentrations of the pregnancy hormone and features a wide tip for, uh, easier collection. Some of the more surprising gadgets and big-ticket buys aren’t “swipe your FSA card and walk away” purchases; they usually require you to pay in full and do a little extra after checkout. But if you’re not afraid of some paperwork, some cool splurges can help you improve your health. For many, brands partner with a program like Truemed, which has you fill out a health survey after purchase so a licensed provider can review your situation and, if you qualify, issue a Letter of Medical Necessity. Then you simply submit the letter plus your receipt (sometimes only for the amount above a “basic” version), and your FSA administrator processes repayment. Here are just a few examples of tech you might have thought was cool, but could also be FSA reimbursable (confirm with your insurance/doctor before any major purchase). Ray-Ban Glasses are one of the most fun (or at least most functional) ways to burn through FSA funds—and if you wear prescription lenses, that can even include Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers, aka AI glasses in disguise. They correct your vision and let you whisper questions to Meta AI (“What’s the currency conversion?” “Where’s the nearest coffee?”) while casually snapping photos and videos without doing the full phone-fumble. (This is a joy we’ve experienced first-hand on rocky ridges with the dog, where you need all your hands free but still want a picture of your furry friend against the horizon.) They’re also a great way to escape the tyranny of noise-canceling headphones: tiny speakers and mics aim sound at your ears so you can play music, get reminders, and still hear the real world happening around you. Plus, upcoming software updates will likely expand the capabilities, including their use as hearables (though there are already dedicated Nuance Audio hearing frames you can purchase as an FSA-eligible prescription pair if you’re more concerned with what’s audible than what’s AI). There are other Meta models that qualify. But no matter what frame shape you select, we also highly recommend getting Transitions lenses, so they pull seamless double duty as both your everyday specs with blue light filters and your stylish sunnies. One caveat: super-strong prescriptions (the kind that usually require high-index lenses) may not work in Meta Ray-Bans due to the delicate electronics, which could be damaged by the pressure required to insert the optics. Oura A discreet, screenless health tracker, the Oura Ring 4 goes far beyond sleep. It automatically tracks activity, blood oxygen, heart and respiratory rate, and skin temperature changes, then turns those metrics into clear, behavior-focused guidance in the app. You can even log personal factors—like caffeine intake or alcohol consumption—to see what’s affecting your rest. It’s ideal for people who care more about health insights than hardcore fitness training stats, and who want something smaller and subtler than a smartwatch. To unlock the full features of the ring, a membership is also required. Other wearables—Garmin smartwatches, for example—can qualify for reimbursement with a post-purchase Truemed assessment and approval. While select sleep and heart-rate monitors (and smart scales) don’t even require that. Ride1Up Exercise is a huge part of staying healthy—and yes, some e-bikes can qualify for FSA spending. We’re talking Class 1 e-bikes only: operable pedals, no throttle, and a max assist speed of 20 mph to make sure you get some sort of workout.At Ride1Up, for example, you can choose from the road-ready CF Racer1 (pictured above), the off-road TrailRush, or the commuter-friendly Prodigy v2. After checkout, Ride1Up will send you a quick Truemed health survey, and if you’re approved, you’ll get the Letter of Medical Necessity you need to submit your purchase for FSA reimbursement. If there’s another ebike brand you’ve been eyeing, it’s worth checking their site. Purple Much like e-bikes, mattresses usually require a Letter of Medical Necessity, and not every model qualifies. You need features that go beyond a basic bed—pressure relief, targeted support, cooling layers, or designs that help with pain or sleep issues—which means going beyond a basic bed’s price. For example, Purple’s RestorePlus Hybrid (pictured above) fits the bill with three inches of GelFlex Grid that contours to your body, supports your lower back, and sleeps cooler than traditional materials. Funds will come in handy when purchasing a multithousand-dollar mattress, but as owners of a Purple RejuvenatePremier (as well as a lumbar back cushion for long-haul flights), we can vouch for the namesake material’s relief return on investment. Keep in mind that often only part of the mattress is eligible for reimbursement—usually the amount that exceeds the price of a basic mattress. After purchase, Purple partners with Truemed, which sends a quick medical survey plus simple instructions for submitting that eligible portion to your HSA/FSA administrator. Other mattress manufacturers may have similar setups. Chirp Chronic pain sufferers might be interested in the Halo, a $199.99 device that combines TENS and EMS technologies to deliver electrical pulses that both block pain signals and increase blood flow to sore areas. The charging case holds two Halo pucks, a rechargeable remote, extension cables, and a set of reusable magnetic pads. Not sure where to place the pads? The companion app shows you exactly where to apply them based on your pain points. You can choose from six preset programs and still adjust the intensity and duration to your comfort level. Purchases through the Chirp website can be made with FSA/HSA cards, though the company notes you may need additional documentation for reimbursement. Theragun There are massage guns and then there are Theraguns. The $649.99 PRO Plus doesn’t just hammer whatever hurts; the app gives you smart, guided routines so you’re treating the right muscles (often the ones around the sore spot). When you connect a Garmin, Apple Watch, Strava, or Google Fit, it pulls in your activity to build personalized recovery plans based on your goals, actual workouts, and current science. Hardware-wise, it’s fully loaded: hot attachments for soothing warmth, built-in LED light therapy (a miniaturized panel like those skin tone/texture therapy Glo masks, which are also FSA eligible), plus all the classic heads—standard ball, dampener, thumb, wedge, and micro-point. If you want to go full hot-and-cold recovery geek, you can even add a separate cold attachment. It’s basically a high-end recovery studio.

Title: SECI pulls up Rajasthan discom for reneging on power sale pact; BlackRock, IFC, KKR-backed project developers in a tizzy

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. A standoff between state-run Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI) and Rajasthan Urja Vikas and IT Services Ltd (RUVITL) over a power sale agreement has raised concerns about the adverse impact on investors’ interest in India’s green energy trajectory. The dispute centres around a 630 MW SECI contract from firm and dispatchable renewable energy (FDRE) projects, which will use energy storage to supply round-the-clock electricity. SECI has objected to the distribution company RUVITL’s move to back out of the agreement, arguing that the power sale agreement (PSA) is legally binding, according to documents reviewed by Mint and two people aware of the development. “RUVITL cannot unilaterally withdraw the procurement of the 630 MW capacity after three and half months from the date of signing the PSA. The PSA is a legally binding document, and any withdrawal at this stage may have regulatory and contractual implications," according to a 9 October SECI communication to RUVITL. Analysts say the standoff may shake investor confidence, given that India will need to invest $1.3 trillion in non-fossil power generation capacity by 2035 to meet India's energy transition goal and to stay on track to meet net zero by 2070. This latest setback also comes in the backdrop of union power ministry directing the SECI, NTPC Ltd, NHPC Ltd, and SJVN Ltd to cancel the awarded contracts by the end of this month wherein it’s not feasible to sign power purchase agreements (PPAs) and PSAs, as reported by Mint earlier. Many discoms have chosen to wait for lower tariffs rather than sign PSAs straightaway, holding up the whole process. Rating agency Icra said on Thursday that only 5.8 GW of renewable capacity has been awarded in the first eight months of FY26. India awarded 47.3 GW in FY24 and 40.6 GW in FY25. Unsigned PPA capacity remains at about 40-45 GW as of date, according to Icra. The 630 MW bid was called by SECI to initially meet the seasonal and time-specific power demand of Delhi power distribution companies (discoms) – BSES Rajdhani Power Limited (BRPL) and BSES Yamuna Power Limited (BYPL) – which didn’t sign the PSA due to regulatory delay; post which SECI offered the power to other discoms, including RUVITL. The e-auction for the FDRE was held on 25 July, with the letter of awards (LoAs) issued to the successful bidders on 7 August. The lowest discovered tariff through the e-auction was ₹4.98 per unit. "This is simply not acceptable in any rules-based system and will have a bearing on investor's interest in India' green energy space," said a chief executive officer of one of the power generation companies that has the LoA for the tender. SECI is an intermediary in the renewable energy chain, and has signed power purchase agreements (PPAs) for this contract with project developers —BlackRock’ Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) owned Vena Energy Aura Private Ltd, International Finance Corp. (IFC) and KKR-backed Hero Future Energies’ (HFE) Hero Solar Energy Private Ltd, JSW Group’ JSW Neo Energy Ltd, New York-based I Squared Capital-backed Hexa Climate Solutions Private Ltd and KKR-backed Serentica India Renewables Private Ltd. It has also signed PSA with Rajasthan’ power distribution company (discom) RUVITL, in this case. India’s installed renewable energy capacity is around 197 GW, and solar and wind account for 129.92 GW and 53.60 GW, respectively. Interestingly, Rajasthan is the state with the highest installed green energy capacity at 40.40 GW. “The real concern is spillover. If one state feels it can get away with reopening a concluded contract, others will eventually test the limits. That’s how a one-off becomes a habit. And once doubt enters the system, it lingers for years, no matter how many reassurances follow," said Sanjay Aggarwal, former President of Fortum India and presently advisor for Fortum Holdings BV. "India can absorb an aberration. What it cannot absorb is a pattern — especially one built on the mistaken belief that investors will always come back, no matter what." “Capital has options. Credibility is how you stay on the shortlist," added Aggarwal, who was also the global head of Solar for the Finnish state-run energy utility. Spokespersons for Global Infrastructure Partners, I Squared Capital, JSW Group and Sanjeev Aggarwal, founder and chairman, Hexa Climate Solutions declined comment. Queries emailed to the spokespersons of SECI, RUVITL, Rajasthan government, ministries of new and renewable energy and power, Vena Energy, Hero Future Energies, Serentica India Renewables Private Ltd and global investors KKR, and International Finance Corporation on Wednesday night remained unanswered. Queries emailed to spokesperson for BRPL and BYPL on late Wednesday also remained unanswered. The stand-offRUVITL, in a 26 September communication to SECI, which was reviewed by Mint, said, some facts emerged after signing of the PSA and weren’t disclosed earlier by SECI. These include non-disclosure that the bidding was conducted as a state-specific bid tailored to meet Delhi’s power demand pattern, Delhi’s refusal to accept the allocation, and deviation by SECI from the tariff adoption process. “In light of the above, the matter was deliberated in detail during the recent Board meeting of RUVITL. After considering all relevant facts and prevailing circumstances, the Board has taken a decision not to proceed further with the procurement of power from the 630 MW ISTS FDRE Projects," the RUVITL communication said. Meanwhile, SECI in its 9 October communication said it "received a letter from RUVITL after three months of signing the PSA, citing some reasons, i.e. Delhi demand pattern, Approval process of CERC, etc, and not to proceed with the procurement." Before signing the agreement with SECI, RUVITL is expected to check the matching demand profile, seasonal demand, and all other aspects, SECI said. “So, not to proceed with the procurement mentioning the reasons are afterthought and contrary to the terms and condition of signed PSA." It said RUVITL had confirmed on 10 June 2025 that it would offtake the power after due diligence, and that all relevant documents, including the request for selection, PPAs, PSA and CERC tariff order, were shared before the PSA was signed on 30 June 2025.

SECI has maintained full transparency throughout the entire process," the SECI communication said. Given that a PSA is legally enforceable, SECI can approach the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) or a State Electricity Regulatory Commision (SERC) for its adoption. In the event of a default by RUVITL, there are also financial consequences wherein SECI can terminate the PSA and claim damages from RUVITL, which can be equivalent to 24 months of charges for the contracted capacity (calculated at 80% demand fulfilment ratio or DFR). For any legal adjudication, it can go to the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (Aptel) and also has the recourse to challenge an Aptel order in the Supreme Court. SECI does not bear the counterparty risk. Recalling earlier issuesThe controversial move by the solar resource-endowed state of Rajasthan is not a one-off event in the Indian green energy space. The sector has gone through similar trials and tribulations and faced investor criticism over the earlier attempt by then Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to renegotiate clean energy tariffs. The Punjab government led by then chief minister Amarinder Singh had also tried to renegotiate clean energy contracts, with the Punjab State Power Corp. Ltd (PSPCL) seeking a discount. Analysts remain hopeful about India’s green energy space. Icra’s outlook for the renewable sector remains stable, led by strong policy support, superior tariff competitiveness and sustainability initiatives by large commercial and industrial customers. "However, challenges remain on the execution front, including land and transmission infrastructure, delays in signing PPAs, exposure to equipment prices and distribution utility finances," Icra said in a note on 20 November.

Title: Analyst who called the dot-com bubble says Americans are turning a deaf ear to AI warnings—and a worse meltdown than 2008 looms
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/23/is-ai-bubble-albert-edwards-worse-than-2008/
Time Published: 2025-11-23T13:00:00Z
Full Content:
Albert Edwards, the outspoken global strategist at Société Générale—a figure who even refers to himself as a “perma bear”—is certain that the current U.S. equity market, driven largely by high-flying tech and AI, is experiencing a dangerous bubble. (Société Générale, to be clear, does not hold the view that U.S. stocks or AI stocks are in a bubble, noting that Edwards is employed as the in-house alternative view.) While history often repeats itself, Edwards warned recently that the circumstances surrounding this cycle’s inevitable collapse are fundamentally different, potentially leading to a deeper and more painful reckoning for the economy and the average investor. “I think there’s a bubble but there again I always think there’s a bubble,” Edwards told Bloomberg’s Merryn Somerset Webb in a recent appearance on her podcast Merryn Talks Money, noting that during each cycle there is always a “very plausible narrative, very compelling.” However, he was unwavering in his conclusion: “It will end in tears, that much I’m sure of.” Edwards told Fortune in an interview that previous theories about a bubble were “very convincing in 1999 and early 2000; they were very convincing in 2006–2007.” Each time, he said, the “surge in the market was so relentless” that he just stopped talking about bubbles, “because clients get pissed off with you repeating the same thing over and over again and being wrong,” only to change their tune after the bubble bursts. “Generally, when you’re gripped by a bubble, people just don’t want to listen because they’re making so much money.” As he himself frequently points out, Edwards is known as a very bearish market strategist who has made some high-profile and dramatic predictions, often warning about major stock market crashes and recessions. His track record includes famously calling the dotcom bubble, but it also includes warnings that haven’t panned out, such as predicting a potential 75% drop in the S&P 500 from peaks—worse than the 2008 Financial Crisis lows. When the New York Times profiled Edwards in 2010, it noted that the chuckling, Birkenstocks-wearing analyst had been predicting a Japan-style stagnation for U.S. equity markets since 1997 (a prediction he repeated in his interview with Fortune). Still, Edwards insists that the current parallels to the late 1990s Nasdaq bubble are clear: extremely rich valuations in tech, with some U.S. companies trading at over 30x forward earnings, justified by compelling growth narratives. Just as the TMT (technology, media, telecom) sector attracted vast, sometimes wasted capital investment in the 1990s, Edwards argued that today’s enthusiasm echoes that earlier era. There are two key differences that could lead to a much worse outcome this time, though. In previous cycles, Edwards explained, the catalyst for a bubble’s demise was usually the monetary authority’s tightening cycle—the Federal Reserve hiking rates and exposing market froth. This time, with the Fed lowering rates, that trigger is conspicuously absent. Bank of America Research has noted the rarity of central banks cutting rates amid rising inflation, which has occurred just 16% of the time since 1973. Ominously, BofA released a note on the “Ghosts of 2007” in August. Instead of tightening, Edwards anticipates the Fed will move away from quantitative tightening and likely shift to quantitative easing “quite soon” because of issues in the U.S. repo markets, another ghost from the Great Recession. The Fed itself issued a staff report in 2021 on repo issues, writing in 2021 that trading between 2007 and 2009 “highlighted important vulnerabilities of the U.S. repo market.” Repo issues reemerged in the pandemic, with the Richmond Fed noting that interest rates “spiked dramatically higher” starting in 2019. Edwards told Bloomberg that the absence of hawkish policy could lead to a “further melt-up,” making the eventual burst even more damaging. Poking fun at himself, Edwards said, “I just got bored being bearish, basically rattling my chains saying, ‘This is all a bubble; it’s all going to collapse.’” He said that he can see how the bubble can actually keep going for much longer than a perma bear like himself would find logical, “and actually that’s when something just comes out the woodwork and takes the legs from out from under the bubble.” “What’s more worrying about the AI bubble,” Edwards told Fortune, “is how much more dependent the economy is on this theme, not just for the business investments, which is driving growth,” but also the fact that consumption growth is being dominated far more than normal by the top quintile. In other words, the richest Americans who are heavily invested in equities are driving more of the economy than during previous bubbles, accounting for a much larger proportion of consumption. “So the economy, if you like, is more vulnerable than it was in the ’87 crash,” Edwards explained, with a 25% or greater correction in stocks meaning that consumer spending will surely suffer—let alone a 50% lurch. Edwards told Bloomberg he was concerned about the widespread participation of retail investors who have been dragged into the market, encouraged to “just buy the dips.” This belief that “the stock market never goes down” is dangerous, Edwards warned, arguing that a 30% or even a 50% decline is very possible. The inequality of American society and the heavy concentration among high earners whose wealth has been “inflated by the stock market” is a major concern for Edwards, who pointed out that if there is a major stock market correction, then U.S. consumption will be “hit very, very badly indeed,” and the entire economy will suffer. This view is increasingly shared by less über-bearish voices on Wall Street, such as Morgan Stanley Wealth Management’s Lisa Shalett. In many ways, Edwards told Fortune, we’re overdue for a correction, noting that apart from two months during the pandemic, there hasn’t been a recession since 2008. “That’s a bloody long time, and the business cycle eventually always goes into recession.” He said it’s been so long that his perma-bear instincts are confused. “The fact I’m less worried about an imminent collapse [right now] makes me worried,” Edwards added with a laugh. Edwards told Fortune that he’s been through various cycles and bubbles and he gained his perma-bear status in the mid-1990s, when he felt a distant earthquake happening in Asia. “You’ve been around the block a few times, you just do become cynical,” he said, before correcting himself: “That’s not the right word. You become extremely skeptical of the full narrative.” He proudly repeats the story about how, when he was at Dresdner Kleinwort in the ’90s, he wrote with skepticism about Malaysia’s economic boom at the time, only to be surprised when Thailand blew up first. Nevertheless, he said, “we lost all our banking licenses [in Malaysia] because of what I wrote,” adding that the story is still proudly pinned to his X.com account. “I had to sort of basically hide under my desk,” Edwards said of the inward reception to the emergence of his inner bear. “Corporate finance banking departments certainly didn’t appreciate losing all their banking licenses. But in retrospect, you know, they avoided a final year of lending to Malaysia before it blew up. They didn’t thank me afterwards.” Beyond equity valuations, Edwards has been highlighting two other major underlying risks that point to systemic vulnerability. First, Edwards emphasized the long-term risk of inflation in the West, driven by “fiscal incontinence.” Despite short-term cyclical deflationary pressure emanating from China—which has seen 12 successive quarters of year-on-year declines in its GDP deflator—Edwards said he believes the path of least resistance for highly indebted Western politicians will be “money printing.” At some point, the mathematics for fiscal sustainability “just do not add up,” forcing central banks to intervene through “yield curve control” or quantitative easing to hold down bond yields. This is where Edwards’ long-held thesis about Japan comes in, what he calls “the Ice Age.” Around 1996, he said, he started thinking that “what’s happening in Japan will come to Europe and the U.S. with a lag.” He explained that the bursting of the Japanese stock bubble led to all kinds of nasty things: real interest rates collapsing, inflation going to zero, bond yields going to zero. Ultimately, it was a period of low growth that Japan still has not been able to break out of. The difference with the U.S., he added, is that Japanification actually started happening in 2000 with the dotcom bubble bursting, but “the relationship broke” between the economy and asset prices as the Fed began “throwing money” at the problem through QE. The U.S. has essentially been in a 25-year bubble since then that is due to burst any day now, he argued—it’s been due any day for a quarter-century. “We’re going to end up with runaway inflation at some point,” Edwards told Fortune, “because, I mean, that’s the end game, right? There’s no appetite to cut back the deficits. We bring back the QE, if and when this bubble bursts, the only solution is more QE, and then we end up with inflation, maybe even worse than 2022.” Edwards also sees a smoking gun in home prices. “You look at the U.S. housing market, you think, ‘Well, actually, is the Fed just too loose relative to everywhere else?’ Because why should other housing bubbles have deflated in terms of house price earnings ratio, but the U.S. is still stuck up there at maximum valuation or close to it?” In a flourish that shows why Edwards is so respected despite his broken-record reputation, he notes that in a Bloomberg Opinion piece from 2018, legendary former Fed Chair Paul Volcker “eviscerated the Fed just before he died.” The central banker who famously slew inflation in the 1980s argued that the modern era’s loose monetary policy was “a grave error of judgment…basically just kicking the can down the road.” Edwards shared an OECD chart with Fortune to show just how much U.S. housing has decoupled from global markets because the Fed has been too loose. The analyst also said he applied his skepticism to private equity, an asset class that he sees having benefited immensely from years of falling bond yields and leverage. Private equity’s advantage has been its tax treatment and the fact that “it doesn’t have to mark itself to market, so it isn’t very volatile.” However, the sector is highly leveraged, and if the global environment shifts to a secular bear market for bonds, he said that would be a “major problem.” Recent high-profile bankruptcies have started to leak into bond markets, prompting concern of “credit cockroaches,” as JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon recently labeled the issue. Drawing on the metaphor that “you never have just one cockroach,” Edwards warned that these bankruptcies signal deeper issues in a highly leveraged sector that has spread its “tentacles…deeply into the real economy.” Fortune notes to Edwards that more mainstream, less bearish voices are sounding similar warnings, including Mohamed El-Erian at the Yahoo Finance Invest conference and Jeffrey Gundlach, the “bond king,” who takes a similarly skeptical view of private equity. Edwards agreed that something is in the air. “I would say there are more voices of skepticism. And again, this is one thing which makes me worry. This bubble can go on. If it is a bubble [it] can go on quite a long while. Well, we can kick the can down the road many times. Normally, the skeptics are swept aside.” For investors trapped between the fear of a collapse and the fear of missing a melt-up, Edwards advised investors to take him with a grain of salt but be mindful of potential warning signs. “I say that I predict a recession every year. Don’t listen to me, but these are the things you should be looking out for.” Paraphrasing an infamous quote from former Citi CEO Chuck Prince that summed up the bubble mentality with a metaphor about a dance party, Edwards recommended: “In terms of dancing while the music’s still playing, you have to decide whether to be in front of the band, pogoing, or dancing close to the fire escape, ready to get out first.”

WARM TRIBUTES HAVE been paid to retired chemical engineer, Stella Gallagher, who died after was attacked near her home in Ballinlough in Cork city last Monday. The 59 year old, who lived in Shrewsbury Downs in Ballinlough also had a very active life in the community. She was held in high esteem at the Togher Community Garden which is a volunteer led not for profit facility on the southside of Cork city. In a statement online her fellow gardeners said that it was with “profound sadness” that they learned of the passing of their dear friend and gifted gardener Stella. “It is with profound sadness that we share the news of the passing of our dear friend and fellow gardener, Stella. “Stella was a cherished and invaluable friend to us all in the Togher Community Garden family. Her absence will be deeply felt by everyone here. “We will especially remember her beautiful smile and the gentle person she was to everyone she met. Our garden will always hold memories of her kindness. “We send our deepest condolences to her family and loved ones during this difficult time. Rest in peace, dear Stella. “ Meanwhile, her condolences page on Rip.ie features dozens of tributes from people Stella met on her journey through life. A fellow gardener in the Togher Community Garden said that Stella “who somebody who made such an impression so quickly. “Her personality really shone through. She brought a lot of life into our garden, it’s the people who make a community & with the mark she left on us she’ll always be a part of ours.” Mrs Gallagher was also a much valued member of the SHEP Community Choir. A representative of the choir posted that Stella was a member “since the very beginning” and loved being part of that community. “She was a very gentle and caring presence in the choir and brought much joy to others through her singing and camaraderie. She recognised the power and comfort of singing with others. Advertisement “She was also a very committed and generous supporter of the choir’s fundraising initiatives. She was much loved and will be very much missed. May her gentle and kind soul be at peace.” A fellow choir member said that Stella was a “kind, thoughtful, gentle lady who always had time for a chat” with another member describing her as “ beautiful both inside and out.” Her former coworkers in Eli Lilly in Kinsale noted her “kind caring nature” as well as her competency as an engineer. One person who worked alongside her for many years said that it was a “pleasure and privilege to have worked with her” whilst another stated that they had learned a lot from her “both in engineering and in life.” Another person spoke of their fond memories of working with Stella in Pegasus Engineering in the late 1980′s at the start of their respective careers. Mrs Gallagher, nee Griffin, was also fondly remembered by parents whose children attended St Anthony’s NS in Ballinlough at the same time as her sons. A classmate of hers in secondary school remembered her “ warm, kind, gentle and unassuming” friend. Mrs Gallagher’s kind nature was present from the very start of her life with an old classmate from primary school who had not seen her for decades recalling her gentleness. Meanwhile, the funeral will take place on Tuesday of Mrs Gallagher whose husband Brian was also seriously injured in the stabbing incident. Her death notice reads that she is survived by her husband Brian and her children Ciara, Conor and Mark. She is also “sadly missed” by her brother Denis, parents in law Val and Geraldine, brothers in law Alan and Mark, sisters in law Erika, Ann, Michele and Mary, nephews nieces, extended family and friends.

Her absence will be deeply felt by everyone here. “We will especially remember her beautiful smile and the gentle person she was to everyone she met. Our garden will always hold memories of her kindness. “We send our deepest condolences to her family and loved ones during this difficult time. Rest in peace, dear Stella. “ Meanwhile, her condolences page on Rip.ie features dozens of tributes from people Stella met on her journey through life. A fellow gardener in the Togher Community Garden said that Stella “who somebody who made such an impression so quickly. “Her personality really shone through. She brought a lot of life into our garden, it’s the people who make a community & with the mark she left on us she’ll always be a part of ours.” Mrs Gallagher was also a much valued member of the SHEP Community Choir. A representative of the choir posted that Stella was a member “since the very beginning” and loved being part of that community. “She was a very gentle and caring presence in the choir and brought much joy to others through her singing and camaraderie. She recognised the power and comfort of singing with others. Advertisement “She was also a very committed and generous supporter of the choir’s fundraising initiatives. She was much loved and will be very much missed. May her gentle and kind soul be at peace.” A fellow choir member said that Stella was a “kind, thoughtful, gentle lady who always had time for a chat” with another member describing her as “ beautiful both inside and out.” Her former coworkers in Eli Lilly in Kinsale noted her “kind caring nature” as well as her competency as an engineer. One person who worked alongside her for many years said that it was a “pleasure and privilege to have worked with her” whilst another stated that they had learned a lot from her “both in engineering and in life.” Another person spoke of their fond memories of working with Stella in Pegasus Engineering in the late 1980′s at the start of their respective careers. Mrs Gallagher, nee Griffin, was also fondly remembered by parents whose children attended St Anthony’s NS in Ballinlough at the same time as her sons. A classmate of hers in secondary school remembered her “ warm, kind, gentle and unassuming” friend. Mrs Gallagher’s kind nature was present from the very start of her life with an old classmate from primary school who had not seen her for decades recalling her gentleness. Meanwhile, the funeral will take place on Tuesday of Mrs Gallagher whose husband Brian was also seriously injured in the stabbing incident. Her death notice reads that she is survived by her husband Brian and her children Ciara, Conor and Mark. She is also “sadly missed” by her brother Denis, parents in law Val and Geraldine, brothers in law Alan and Mark, sisters in law Erika, Ann, Michele and Mary, nephews nieces, extended family and friends. The “much loved mother,” will lie in repose at the Temple Hill Funeral Home in Boreenmanna Road in Cork from 5pm to 6pm tomorrow. Her requiem mass will take place on Tuesday at 11am in the Church of Our Lady of Lourdes in Ballinlough. The mass will be live streamed. Burial will follow at St Michael’s Cemetery in Blackrock in Cork city. Meanwhile, David Gallagher, with an address at Shrewsbury Downs in Ballinlough in Cork has been charged with the murder of his mother, and with assault causing harm to his father, close to the family home in Ballinlough last Monday night. Gallagher (25) was remanded in custody following his court appearance last Wednesday. He will appear before Cork District Court again by video link on Wednesday.

Title: 'Entitled,' 'complacent,' and 'sloppy': Inside the workplace tension at the world's largest HR organization

Full Content:
On September 11, a Marilyn Monroe impersonator sang a sultry rendition of "Happy Birthday" to an executive at the Virginia headquarters of the Society for Human Resource Management. The brief performance, which took place in a conference room with about 75 employees, came after remarks honoring the 24th anniversary of the 2001 terror attacks. Two former staffers who were present at the gathering, recordings of which were reviewed by Business Insider, said it was uncomfortable to see — and not just because it was sexually suggestive. They found it inappropriate because their former employer, also known as SHRM, is the world's largest HR trade group. SHRM has been embroiled in controversy in recent years. Some of these challenges have gripped workplaces across the country, including regular layoffs and restructurings and debates over DEI. Other elements, however, set SHRM apart. They include a new attendance policy that penalizes workers who arrive even a minute after 9 a.m.; a memo about a "conservative" dress code that referenced "enclothed cognition" and bans sequins; an employment discrimination lawsuit set to go to trial in December; and a company-wide meeting in which CEO Johnny C. Taylor Jr. said some staffers were "entitled," "complacent," and "sloppy." The issues raise questions about SHRM's role as an arbiter of human resources best practices. Thousands of HR professionals rely on SHRM's educational materials and credentialing programs to get ahead in their careers. It shapes not only HR departments across the country, but also national policy, briefing judges and lawmakers on workforce practices. Now, some professionals are deciding not to renew their memberships, and former employees are speaking out about their experiences on social media. "If your business is about teaching others what to do in the people space, then it's incredibly important that you model that yourself," said Ashley Herd, a former head of HR for North America at McKinsey, co-host of the podcast "HR Besties," and founder of Manager Method, a management-training company. "No organization is expected to be perfect, but SHRM puts out articles and charges a lot of money to teach about best practices," added Herd. "When they don't follow those practices themselves, that really does speak volumes." SHRM said that Taylor, a lawyer and executive who was named CEO in late 2017, deserved credit for turning the organization around. "Change is not a sign of instability — it's a sign of leadership," spokesperson Eddie Burke wrote in an email to Business Insider. In a statement, Taylor said he believes SHRM is fulfilling its mission of partnering "with HR professionals and the CEO community." "We're doing it better than ever," he told Business Insider. Revenue grew from $131 million in 2017 to $233 million last year, according to public tax filings. It has 413 employees today, up from 387 in December 2017. This article is based on conversations with more than two dozen current and former SHRM employees and nearly a dozen current and former members, as well as legal and tax filings and government records. Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. SHRM was founded in 1948 and today describes itself as "the foremost expert, researcher, advocate, and thought leader on issues and innovations impacting today's evolving workplaces." Former staffers characterized it as a punitive workplace. Under a policy instituted earlier this year, those who arrived even one minute past 9 a.m. were told to go to security and have someone on the executive team escort them to their desks, former employees said. Two former staffers said that they saw a pregnant colleague cry because she fell and hurt herself running to the entrance to make it in on time. A memo sent to SHRM's brand and marketing staff in January laid out a dress code that included a lengthy introduction about "enclothed cognition," a term that refers to the notion that the clothing workers wear impacts their performance. The code required staff to dress in "conservative" business attire and prohibited items such as sneakers, denim, skorts, sequins, hats, and clothing that doesn't cover the area between the shoulders and knees. Burke said "SHRM offers employees the flexibility to arrive between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m." and noted that the workplace is remote Mondays and Fridays. He said the trade group at large has a business-casual dress code, and said "enclothed cognition" was not a company policy. Nearly all former SHRM employees who spoke to Business Insider said there was confusion and fear of retaliation in the workplace. In an all-hands meeting last month, a recording of which was obtained by Business Insider, Taylor called many of the organization's employees "entitled," "complacent," and "sloppy." The comments were part of a broader announcement about forthcoming layoffs. Taylor said that he hadn't yet consulted with anyone about his plans, according to the recording. "Literally, I've not told anyone, because I've been trying to figure out where I was going to land, and I've landed on a decision," Taylor said. "I am going to reorganize the business of SHRM. There will be a total reorg … And this is not a decision that I've made again with anyone, no one." His comments came several weeks after another call with a smaller group of staffers in which he said no layoffs were planned. Snippets of both meetings were compiled by Benjamin Schmidt, a former employee, and posted publicly to TikTok. SHRM cut staff earlier this month. In an internal video message viewed by Business Insider announcing the reductions, Taylor said SHRM treated people with dignity during layoffs, describing SHRM's approach as "red carpet in, red carpet out." In his statement, Taylor said November's "organizational redesign is about shifting for the future, not reacting to the past," adding that the cuts were not due to financial strain and that the organization has an "enviable balance sheet." Former employees said layoffs occurred annually in recent years. They said Taylor frequently reorganized the business, resulting in job cuts and reassignments for those who remained. In some cases, full teams were let go. "It was made very clear to all that if you were not 100% aligned with whatever the latest messaging was from SHRM leadership, you were encouraged to find another job," said one former staffer. In his statement, Taylor said, "Over the last several years, which were characterized by ultra-low unemployment rates and a war for talent, we hired individuals who were not aligned with SHRM's mission, values, or culture." "That's on us — and we've corrected it. We are transparent internally about what doesn't work here, and when it's not a fit, people should move on." Over the past several years, layoffs have become commonplace in industries like tech and media. Companies such as Google and Microsoft have regularly trimmed their ranks, and the trend doesn't show any signs of slowing down: During its latest round of cuts, Amazon said it expected to uncover "additional places we can remove layers" and "realize efficiency gains" in 2026. Repeated layoffs can be a sign of poor leadership, said Herd, the former head of HR for North America at McKinsey. SHRM is "literally describing themselves as experts in all things work and selling best practices in talent planning. To then turn around and do layoffs themselves, it stings for the workers who you thought were a fit for all these years. It rings hollow to put the blame ostensibly on the people you chose to hire." "Whether they like it or not, they are held to a higher standard because they've put themselves out there as the preeminent expert on work." "It shows there are gaps in their talent planning," she said. Some former employees said colleagues who openly questioned leadership's decisions or cited concerns about SHRM's workplace culture were gone soon after. Burke, the SHRM spokesperson, said the suggestion that employees were terminated for having differing views "does not reflect how SHRM operates." "This is not about silencing dissent — it is about ensuring that our teams remain aligned, effective, and able to execute with excellence," he said. Daniel Burchfield, who joined SHRM's affiliated charitable foundation in 2024, said performance issues were cited in his February termination. But he said he hadn't been reprimanded or put on a performance improvement plan. "Nothing negative was indicated to me," he said. Two weeks before his termination, Burchfield said he told his manager he was worried about layoffs. He said the manager replied that SHRM likes to maintain an atmosphere of fear to drive performance. Burchfield said he told his manager that logic was "unhealthy." SHRM itself has said as much. "It's important for leaders to recognize that fear at work can cause a host of ill effects that undermine the quality of people's output as well as overall team performance," reads a 2023 article on its website titled "How to Remove Fear from Your Work Culture." "SHRM is meant to be setting the standard for how to run a workplace," Alexandria Kinsey, a former employee who was fired in April, told Business Insider. "They do the opposite of what they preach." Kinsey was let go in part because she had become "disruptive," the organization said. She said her behavior was a response to SHRM's "broken and toxic system." In 2022, Rehab Mohamed, an Egyptian woman who worked at SHRM as an instructional designer, filed a lawsuit against the organization in Colorado federal court. Mohamed, who was at SHRM from 2016 to 2020, said in her suit that she was racially discriminated against by a white supervisor and faced retaliation for complaining to management. She said she raised concerns about racial discrimination and retaliation with leadership, including Taylor and SHRM's human-resources head, throughout the summer of 2020. Last year, a judge called the case "messy" and said the evidence showed that the same HR person tasked with investigating Mohamed's complaints was also ghostwriting emails for Mohamed's boss and drafting Mohamed's termination paperwork around the same time. SHRM's guide on "How to Conduct a Workplace Investigation," dated about two weeks after that decision, said investigators "should focus on being impartial to gather and consider relevant facts and should not push the investigation in any particular direction." SHRM has consistently denied Mohamed's claims. In his statement, Taylor said that "SHRM doesn't comment on pending cases, but we will say this: we do not settle meritless cases. We know the facts, and we trust the process." Lawyers for Mohamed didn't reply to calls or emails. The case, which is scheduled to begin jury selection on December 1, is unusual, Evan Fray-Witzer, an employment lawyer in Boston, told Business Insider. Workplace-discrimination lawsuits rarely get this far, he said. Further, SHRM didn't bring an independent investigator to oversee its internal probe into the matter, the court found. This is "far from best practices," Fray-Witzer said. In response to questions from Mohamed's lawyers, SHRM revealed the existence of two other discrimination complaints from employees. One case, filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2018, was settled. The other, filed with a California regulator in 2021, is pending. Following the murder of George Floyd in 2020, SHRM made DEI a focus of its educational materials. In 2021, a Harvard Business Review Analytic Services report sponsored by SHRM concluded that company leaders should make DEI a strategic priority. It said that DEI is not only "the right thing to do," but research shows DEI leaders outperform their competitors financially. In July 2024, SHRM jettisoned the term "equity" from what it now calls "inclusion and diversity," or I&D, prompting social-media backlash from many members and others in the HR community. SHRM cited Taylor's reasoning for the move in a LinkedIn post that drew nearly 1,000 comments, writing that he has said that "by emphasizing Inclusion-first, we aim to address the current shortcomings of DE&I programs." In his statement, Taylor said the removal of "equity" from SHRM's messaging was driven by data indicating that the word is confusing and polarizing. "While we fully respect some employees and some SHRM members didn't agree with that decision, we are very clear all workplace I&D strategy should be legally compliant, workplace unifying, and business accretive," Taylor said. In recent years, many employers have pulled back or ended DEI programs, concluding the programs were misguided or facing pressure from conservative activists and the second Trump administration. Because SHRM spent years producing DEI materials for HR leaders, its shift was conspicuous, said Don A. Moore, a leadership and communication professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. For some staffers, concerns about SHRM's shift away from DEI were exacerbated by Taylor's connection to the Trump administration. Bloomberg Law reported that Taylor was among those being discussed as a potential labor secretary in Trump's second term, while he chaired an advisory board focused on HBCUs and served on the White House Workforce Policy Advisory Board in the first administration. Taylor has personally supported both Republicans and Democrats over the years. SHRM spent $1 million to $2 million annually on lobbying in recent years, US Senate filings show. Paul Lalonde, who has worked in HR for more than a decade and lives in the Chicago area, said Taylor and SHRM are "kowtowing" to the Trump administration. Lalonde said he declined to renew his SHRM membership in response. SHRM's shift away from DEI has impacted its business relationships. In 2024, the American Heart Association pulled out of a partnership with SHRM's affiliated charitable foundation, partially in connection with the group's move away from a focus on equity, according to three people with knowledge of the relationship. The groups had collaborated on a report on racial gaps in healthcare access and outcomes that led to the SHRM Foundation being paid at least six figures, according to two people. Representatives for SHRM and AHA characterized the amounts paid as "modest" or "routine." Greg Donaldson, an AHA spokesman, said its contract with SHRM's foundation expired and was not renewed because of a change in "strategic direction" and said it would be "inaccurate" to say the collaboration ended over the word "equity." Burke, the SHRM spokesperson, said the American Heart Association was "a valued member" and said SHRM looks "forward to continuing to explore ways of working with them in the future." SHRM hit a nerve with some in the HR community again with the choice of anti-DEI activist Robby Starbuck as a conference speaker last month, alongside Van Jones, a CNN host and entrepreneur, and Taylor, who moderated the conversation. Starbuck has repeatedly called DEI "poison." At the event, he said he believes "equity" is a "Marxist concept." "Diversity is one of the most pressing and polarizing issues for our workforces," Taylor said in a LinkedIn video announcing the event. "To move our organizations forward, we must leave behind the echo chambers and lean into difficult conversations." SHRM also changed the event's name to Blueprint from its previous moniker, Inclusion. Shari Dunn, a DEI consultant and author in Portland, Oregon, who is Black, said she found Starbuck's speaking invitation offensive. She canceled her membership over the organization's retreat from DEI principles. "They claim this is a free exchange of ideas and they're just trying to bring different opinions," she said. "My humanity and intelligence can't be a 'different opinion.'" Not all SHRM members opposed Starbuck's participation. Dave Greenlaw, an HR executive in Washington D.C., previously told Business Insider that he planned to attend even though he disagreed with Starbuck. He said he believed HR leaders need to understand the full corporate landscape, even when it might be uncomfortable. In a statement to Business Insider, Starbuck said he spent two hours taking photos with conference attendees after he finished speaking. "So clearly, not every HR professional felt distressed to have my voice included," he said. "It was nice to have a productive conversation with Johnny and Van about making workplaces less divisive." Some of SHRM's members have said publicly they would cancel their membership, which gives them access to templates, legal information, and other resources. Membership revenue increased in 2024, from $69 million to $75.6 million, according to its tax filings. Figures for 2025 aren't yet available. SHRM said its overall membership number has grown about 16% over the course of Taylor's tenure. At least part of last year's revenue increase may have been due to an 8% price hike for the annual membership that took place in February 2024. The cost of an annual membership rose by another 13% earlier this year, to $299. Taylor's total compensation has also grown. He received $4 million last year, more than five times what he made in 2018 and a 48% increase from what he was paid in 2022. Taylor started his career as a law-firm associate, and then went on to serve in legal and HR roles at companies including Paramount Pictures, Alamo Rent a Car, and Blockbuster, according to his LinkedIn profile. Before joining SHRM, Taylor led the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, a nonprofit that supports historically and predominantly Black schools, from 2010 to 2017. Business Insider identified two appearance-related complaints during his tenure. The organization settled a discrimination lawsuit filed by an employee, Tara Smith, who said she was fired for refusing to wear pantyhose to business meetings. The fund said Smith had been insubordinate. In his statement, Burke said that Taylor "refused to settle this lawsuit because he believed it was meritless, and even when the organization settled it after his departure, he refused to participate in the settlement." A student also launched a Change.org petition signed by more than 6,800 people in opposition to the organization's ban on dreadlocks for male participants in its Leadership Institute. The student wrote that his acceptance was rescinded because of his hairstyle and called the policy "discriminatory, sexist, and contrary to TMCF's mission of supporting" students from historically Black colleges and universities. TMCF did not respond to a request for comment. At SHRM, meanwhile, Taylor has said the organization talks "policy, not politics." Roger King, a longtime employment lawyer with the CHRO Association, an HR policy organization, said Taylor deserves credit for growing SHRM's membership and talking openly about the group's decision-making on diversity topics. "Many in the business community have gone silent, or certainly have reduced their rhetoric, on this whole issue," he told Business Insider. On TikTok, Kinsey and Schmidt, who both worked on SHRM's social media team, have posted roughly a dozen videos about their experiences at the organization. The videos have been collectively viewed more than 1 million times. Kinsey said the group's treatment of its workers shows "hypocrisy," while Schmidt compared his work at SHRM to "the marketing department for the Death Star." "I highly encourage you to never give a dollar to this organization," Schmidt said in one video. It was filmed in SHRM's offices. Have a tip? Know more? Reach Sarah E.

Title: I was laid off by Meta and became a boomerang employee 3 years later. Here's why I decided to return.

Every time Agnes publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Devang Sharma, a 27-year-old senior software engineer at Meta, based in Menlo Park, CA. The following has been edited for length and clarity. The first time I joined Meta was in 2022. I uprooted my life in London and moved to Toronto to work there. I stayed for around four and a half months before being laid off. Meta is an amazing organization, one I saw myself retiring at, but there was nothing I could do to keep my job. Three years later, a recruiter from Meta reached out to me, and I had the chance to rejoin the company in a much more senior role. I had offers from other AI companies, but returning to Meta felt like a homecoming. With the direction of the industry, there's always a chance of layoffs; however, I saw coming back as a trade-off. I was working at a startup as an engineer before I applied for the Meta software engineering position in Toronto. When I was impacted by company layoffs, it was really challenging to deal with, especially as an immigrant. It was the middle of winter, and I had just left everything I knew behind in London. But I was still grateful for the first experience I had working at such a large scale. I was not dependent on Meta for my immigration status because I got my permanent residency, so I was free to switch jobs. Within a month, I secured several offers and landed a new role. There are LinkedIn groups, WhatsApp groups, Telegram channels, and email newsletters for former Meta employees. I was always in touch with the former and current employees I worked with, as well as those I had not worked with directly. The conversations were mostly regarding what's happening across the industry and also within Meta. With the recent movements and investments in AI, a lot has changed over the past two and a half to three years. Meta has an internal system that tracks and enables them to reach out to current and former employees. A Meta recruiter emailed me about a specific role and team, and when I got more details about the position, I realized it was exactly what I was looking for. The interviews were similar to my first time interviewing with them in terms of coding standards and system design, but more complex in terms of tangible design problems. I was in the interview process with other organizations and considering their offers. This made me sort of unsure whether to proceed with Meta. Before rejoining Meta, I was working at Amazon. Although I had the opportunity to work with some great AI models, I was not directly contributing to the foundational models or writing the models myself. My role was primarily focused on implementing and fine-tuning. When I discovered that I could contribute to the domain of artificial intelligence firsthand by building and writing models, not just on the implementation side, which perfectly aligned with what I was looking for, I was thrilled. I'm in my 20s and I don't have a family. I'm pretty flexible in terms of my responsibilities. I couldn't sit back and be fearful about what would happen if there were more layoffs. There will probably be some, but I can't control it. I would've regretted not taking a chance to work on something amazing, simply because I chose a safe route. I had such a mixture of emotions going into my new hire orientation, this time at Meta headquarters in Menlo Park. It brought back all the memories of my first time joining the company back in Toronto. I knew that employees who worked at headquarters got to meet people like Chris Cox, the chief product officer of Meta, and other C-suite executives. Back in 2022, at the Toronto office, we were just watching them on video. In 2025, I was sitting in the front row while Chris Cox gave an amazing speech. Things have changed since I last worked here. Priorities differ, and the company is leaner, so things move more quickly. The company's evolution in terms of shipping features is happening at a very fast pace; it's no longer a traditional software engineering role. It's more about how integrated we are with AI. Whenever you're returning to a previous organization that you have worked with, it feels like a homecoming because there's naturally some attachment there. My piece of advice would be to try to come in with the mindset of a newbie. I'm using my previous experience to help me, but I'm also thinking of this new experience as if I were joining Meta for the first time. This approach has helped me overcome my prejudices. It's given me a chance to be a curious learner, and that's one of the most important things that you can do as a professional. Do you have a story to share about being a boomerang employee?

Title: Why did Wall Street just dump $5.4 billion in Strategy MSTR stock?
URL: https://cryptoslate.com/?p=507426
Time Published: 2025-11-23T10:00:30Z

MicroStrategy’s role as Bitcoin proxy is fading as Wall Street shifts to a more direct exposure. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. For a while, owning Bitcoin was professionally awkward. Big asset managers couldn’t touch it, compliance teams didn’t know what to do with it, and internal mandates typically banned the direct custody of anything that looked like a bearer instrument. But equities? Equities were fine. That’s how MicroStrategy, a Virginia-based enterprise software firm, became the most traded Bitcoin proxy in the US equity market. After CEO Michael Saylor pivoted the entire company into a Bitcoin holding vehicle in 2020, institutional desks began buying MSTR not for its software solutions, but for its balance sheet. The trade was about finding a liquid, listed, regulator-recognized asset that let you get Bitcoin exposure on your books without the hassle of actually holding it. That trade worked for four years. Saylor issued convertible notes, bought billions in BTC, and amplified shareholder exposure well beyond spot. MSTR became the shadow ETF that Wall Street wasn’t allowed to buy. And the demand was real: at one point, MSTR traded at a 2× premium to its net Bitcoin per share. The company leaned into it. “We’re a leveraged long Bitcoin operating company,” Saylor said in 2021. Some analysts even stopped modeling software revenue altogether when analyzing MicroStrategy’s performance. Many allocators treated MSTR as a synthetic Bitcoin play. The logic was: direct Bitcoin access remained constrained, but here was a stock whose fortunes were tightly linked to Bitcoin’s. That arrangement worked until it didn’t. Between the end of Q2 and the end of Q3 2025, institutional portfolios decreased their marked paper exposure in MSTR by approximately $5.38 billion, based on aggregated filings (from ~$36.32 billion to ~$30.94 billion). That represents a drop of ≈14.8% in institutional paper value held. This wasn’t a markdown. Bitcoin remained relatively steady throughout the quarter at around $95,000, even peaking above its new ATH of $125,000 at one point. MSTR traded mostly sideways during the period, hovering near $175. This kind of price stability effectively rules out forced selling and deleveraging as primary drivers. There was no wipeout event to blame this on. This means the exposure vanished because institutions actively took it off. Major fund managers, including Capital International, Vanguard, BlackRock, and Fidelity, each trimmed over $1 billion in exposure or close to it. The reduction spans the institutional ladder, not just fringe players. In aggregate terms, it’s a 14.8% reduction in value across the board. That may not sound catastrophic, but in dollar terms it is meaningful, and structurally it marks a pivot. A $5.3 billion reduction needs context. On the one hand, it’s large. Even for Wall Street, where hundreds of billions of dollars change hands every day, it’s enough to move the needle. On the other hand, it’s modest relative to total institutional holdings of MSTR, which topped $31 billion at the end of Q3. Imagine a fund with $100 billion in assets deciding to retreat by $15 billion from a trade; the move is visible, but the exposure remains. That’s the state of MSTR: still widely held, still relevant, but no longer unique or immune. Expressed differently: if you owned $100 of institutional MSTR exposure at the end of Q2, you would hold about $85.20 at the end of Q3. If you held $1 billion, you would be down to ~$852 million in exposure. The drop matters because it signals shifting conviction. But the trade is far from vanished. It looks more like institutions quietly exploring alternatives. Historical context reinforces the point. In 2021, when Bitcoin hit earlier peaks and volatility reigned, MSTR boasted premiums of nearly 2× its net Bitcoin holdings per share. That gap has since compressed. In that light, the Q3 reduction marks a transition from scarcity-driven premium to choose-your-route flexibility. In Q4, the table has changed. Bitcoin has retreated from recent highs. Another pause or pullback in Bitcoin may present a test for MSTR’s remaining holders. Bitcoin remaining below $90,000 for a while would expose the leverage embedded in MSTR: corporate debt, equity dilution risk, and software results overshadowed by treasury holdings. However, if Bitcoin finds support at $100,000 or higher, MSTR could retain its appeal as a Bitcoin-enhanced vehicle. If Bitcoin moves higher again, companies might decide to reverse course and increase MSTR exposure. On the flip side, touching $80,000 will likely prompt an even larger reduction in MSTR exposure. Either scenario suggests Q4 filings could show a reduction or a return to previous levels of MSTR exposure, but most likely no increase compared to Q2. This change matters for more than just the companies involved. It marks a milestone in how mature Bitcoin exposure has become. For a while, MSTR served as a workaround for Wall Street. Now, that pathway has become mainstream with both institutions and retail active in MSTR trading. Spot Bitcoin ETFs and other regulated custody solutions mean large portfolios can now hold BTC without the equity-wrapper compromise. As institutional strategies evolve, assets like MSTR stop being essential and start being optional. The implication is twofold for retail. First, the fact that institutions are rethinking the proxy trade is validation that Bitcoin access has entered a new phase. If allocators feel comfortable holding Bitcoin directly, that signals deeper structural acceptance. Second, MSTR likely shifts in role: rather than being the go-to way to hold Bitcoin, it may become a tactical hedge or leveraged play. MSTR is still enormous. More than $30 billion in institutional market exposure remained at the end of Q3. The company is far from redundant, but its monopoly on institutional Bitcoin access is over. For investors who still believe in Bitcoin long-term and are comfortable with corporate wrapper risk, MSTR remains a viable option. For those seeking pure Bitcoin exposure without the corporate overlay, the path has broadened. The proxy era has transformed. The 14.8% reduction in institutional value held in MSTR matters because it reflects a change in mindset, not a mass exodus. For Bitcoin, it’s a marker of maturation. For MSTR, it’s a pivot in role. For the market, it’s the quiet next act in the story of institutional crypto adoption.

Title: Here's All The Amiibo In Stock At Best Buy During Black Friday

By Brendan Hesse and Jon Bitner on November 23, 2025 at 12:00AM PST GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. If you're searching for elusive Amiibo this holiday season, consider taking a peek at Best Buy during its Black Friday Sale event. The retailer currently has Amiibo in stock that are sold out at most other locations--including several that have been out of print for years. Many of these are available for their original $16 MSRP, undercutting the official Nintendo Store's new $20 price point. Among the highlights are long-running staples from the Super Mario series, including the recently released Mario & Luma and Rosalina & Lumas Super Mario Galaxy Amiibo figures. You can also pick up the Mario Odyssey variants of Mario, Peach, and Bowser in their spiffy white wedding outfits. You can also grab The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom characters like Sidon, Tulin, Riju, and Yunobo for $20 each, down from their usual $30. Best Buy also has several of the latest Amiibo releases in stock right now, including the new Kirby Air Riders, Donkey Kong Bananza, and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond collections. Below you'll find a list of all of the Amiibo available at Best Buy. Keep in mind that, while these are in stock at the time of writing, many Amiibo figures are popular and likely to sell out quickly, especially since most are cheaper at Best Buy than at other retailers. So if you see anything on your wishlist that's been hard to find for years, this is your chance to add it to your collection. These Amiibo deals are just some of the many Nintendo discounts available in Best Buy's early Black Friday sale. Those who haven't pick up the Switch 2 console can grab bundle deals that include the Switch 2 and a digital copy of a game. Right now, the Switch 2 + Mario Kart World or Switch 2 + Pokemon Legends: Z-A bundles are available. The retailer also has deals on several original Nintendo Switch physical games, including Super Mario Odyssey, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Nintendo Switch Sports, and more. You can also grab digital edition Switch games at Best Buy for lower prices than they're available at the Switch eShop. These offers will be available until Best Buy's Black Friday Sale ends on November 29--unless they sell out before then. Check a selection of Best Buy's Nintendo game and Amiibo deals below--and be sure to keep tabs on GameSpot's Black Friday Deals Hub for the best holiday price cuts on video games, Blu-rays, figures, and more. Nintendo Switch Game Deals at Best Buy -- Starting At $30 Amiibo Deals at Best Buy $20 ($30) The Chief of the Gerudo joined the Amiibo lineup in June as part of the Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom lineup. Best Buy is currently offering the figure for $20, down from its usual price of $30. $20 ($30) Another summer release that's part of the Tears of the Kingdom lineup, the lovable Yunobo Amiibo is also on sale for $20 (was $30). He's quite large compared to other Amiibo, yet still carries a reasonable price. $20 ($30) Sidon launched alongside the other Tears of the Kingdom Amiibo in June. He too is on sale for $20, and his figure looks pretty slick as he's holding the iconic Lightscale Trident. $20 ($30) Surprise, surprise--another Tears of the Kingdom Amiibo on sale for $20. The adorable Tulin is depicted holding the Great Eagle Bow, and a display stand. Like the others guardians, Tulin was released in June. $30 ($40) Released in June (alongside the TOTK Amiibo), Luke from Street Fighter 6 is on sale for $30. His figure can be used to save and load your outfit, color, and button settings. $30 ($40) Jamie is throwing a handstand for his stylish Amiibo, which is also compatible with Street Fighter 6. It was originally launched in June 2025. $30 ($40) The third member of the Street Fighter 6 Amiibo lineup, Kimberly is shown here jumping across the battlefield, a cloud of pink flowing in her wake. It was originally launched in June 2025 and is compatible with the Street Fighter 6 game. $50 Just released on November 20, the Kirby Air Riders lineup is a bit more expensive than your typical Amiibo. However, this figure does come with both Kirby and his Warp Star, and it's compatible with 20 Switch and Switch 2 games, including Kirby Air Riders, Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe, and Kirby And The Forgotten Land. $50 | Releases March 5, 2026 Kirby's rival wasn't left out of the Air Riders fun, as you'll find the iconic character and their Shadow Star for $50. It too was just launched on November 20 and is compatible with just about every modern Kirby game you can think of. $50 Equipped with a spear and a Winged Star, this Bandana Waddle Dee is ready for the races. As part of the Kirby Air Riders series, it's compatible with Kirby Air Riders and launched alongside the rest of the collection on November 20. $40 This new Metroid Prime 4 Amiibo dropped on November 6. Featuring Samus and her bike, Vi-O-La, it'll be compatible with the upcoming game when it arrives on Switch and Switch 2 December. $30 Samus has been given the Amiibo treatment numerous times, but this is the most recent. It arrived on November 6 as part of the Metroid Prime 4 series, and we're expecting it to be a hot commodity once the game releases next month. $30 | Releases December 4, 2025 The final Amiibo in the Metroid Prime 4 series releases the same day as the game--December 4. Sylux will likely serve as a primary antagonist, a mysterious bounty hunter about whom little is currently known. $30 The two heroic faces from Donkey Kong Bananza were given the Amiibo treatment on July 17, 2025. You can use it with the game to unlock Pauline's Diva Dress. $40 | Releases April 2, 2026 The Super Mario Galaxy 1 + 2 Collection arrived early this year, and early next year, you'll be able to get your hands on a few Galaxy-inspired Amiibo. This includes the Rosalina and Lumas figure, which is up for preorder ahead of its April 2 release. It can be scanned with the games to unlock a 1-Up Mushroom. $40 | Releases April 2, 2025 Also arriving on April 2 of next year is the Mario and Luma Amiibo. It can be scanned with the games to unlock a Life Mushroom. $20 The iconic Donkey Kong villain originally joined the Smash Bros. Amiibo lineup in 2019. After being out of print for years, King K. Rool returned in 2025 as a Best Buy exclusive thanks to the smash hit Donkey Kong Bananza. $30 The Metroid Dread Amiibo series released in October 2021, and this double pack gets you both the Samus and EMMI Amiibo. And if you're having trouble with the challenging game, you can scan the Samus figure for an extra energy tank, while the EMMI Amiibo gets you a Missle+ tank. $16 Based on the Link's Awakening remake for Nintendo Switch, the tiny, cartoonish figure arrived in 2019 and is still available at Best Buy for just $16. $16 Released in 2016, this version of Zelda was inspired by her appearance in The Wind Waker. It can be scanned into a variety of games, including Tears of the Kingdom, where it unlocks an exclusive paraglider fabric plus additional materials and items. $20 While Link and Zelda have seen plenty of Amiibo releases, only two versions of Ganondorf exist. This version was launched in 2023 as part of the Tears of the Kingdom series, and it's available at Best Buy for $20. It's typically offered for $30 when purchased directly from Nintendo. $16 If the Kirby Air Riders series feels a bit too expensive, you can instead check out this old Amiibo from 2016. Featuring Kirby traveling on a Warp Star, it's just $16 at Best Buy right now. $16 Byleth is the star of Fire Emblem: Three Houses (which launched in 2019), but their Amiibo is actually part of the Super Smash Bros series. Released in 2021, it's compatible with Fire Emblem Engage, Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. $16 Released way back in 2015, you'll find this classic Amiibo at Best Buy for just $16. It's part of the Super Mario series, can be scanned into dozens of games, and features the mustachioed plumber striking one of his most iconic poses. $16 This version of Bowser launched alongside the Mario figure in 2015. He too can be scanned into dozens of games (including Super Mario Galaxy and Galaxy 2), and his large design makes him stand out among other, smaller Amiibo. $16 Released in 2017 and sporting his wedding attire, this quirky Amiibo is available for just $16 at Best Buy. It's part of the Super Mario Odyssey Amiibo series, which includes both Peach and Bowser. $16 Decked out in what have to be the nicest clothes in his wardrobe, Bowser looked pretty spiffy when this Amiibo arrived in 2017. Like others in this collection, it's compatible with a bunch of games--including Super Smash Bros Ultimate and Super Mario Odyssey. $16 Rounding out the wedding party is none other than Peach herself. Launched in 2017, you'll find the old, iconic Amiibo for $16 right now--though it'll likely sell out fast. $16 If the Wedding Outfit Amiibo seems a bit too flashy, you can pick up the Peach figure that's part of the Super Smash Bros series. It's even older than the Wedding Outfit figure, as it launched way back in 2014. $16 Another good option is Peach from the standard Super Mario series. This depicts Peach with her classic attire, and it's arguably the best Amiibo of the bunch. It was originally released in 2015. $16 Unlike Peach, Daisy has only been given the Amiibo treatment twice. This one is part of the Super Smash Bros series and originally launched in 2019. $16 As the iconic, eternal enemy of Mario, the lowly Goomba is both evil and adorable. The same is true of this Amiibo, which is part of the Super Mario series and first released in 2017. $16 Not one to leave their Goomba friends behind, the equally adorable Koopa Amiibo was released in 2017. It's part of the Super Mario series and is a popular collector's item. $16 Kingdom Hearts may have started as a PlayStation exclusive, but it found its way to Nintendo with the 2004 release, Chain of Memories. Sora then made the cut for Super Smash Bros Ultimate, and he became an Amiibo in 2024. $25 The Pearl and Marina Amiibo figures were released in 2018, though they remain popular to this day thanks to the launch of Splatoon 3 in 2022. $16 The lovable sidekick of Splatoon 3, Smallfry was immortalized as an Amiibo a few months after the game release in 2022. The figure looks adorable, with Smallfry just as emotive as they are in the game. $16 Another launch that followed hot on the heels of Splatoon 3. The colorful Octoling is available for $16 at Best Buy, and it unlocks exclusive gear in Splatoon 3 and is compatible with several other games. $30 Though most fans are probably holding out for a Chicken Jockey Amiibo, for now you can make do with the Steve and Alex double pack. These released as part of the Super Smash Bros collection in 2022.

Title: XRP ETFs Could See Aggressive Accumulation – Here Are The Numbers

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. XRP has entered a new phase in its growth as Spot XRP ETFs begin trading across the United States. The excitement surrounding institutional access to XRP has grown quickly in recent weeks, especially as filings and inflow reports hint at rising interest from funds preparing to scale their exposure. A market commentator known as Chad Steingraber presented a projection showing just how intense ETF accumulation could become if issuers adopt an acquisition strategy similar to what was seen in Bitcoin ETFs. The estimates outline an aggressive period of accumulation that could reduce XRP’s available supply far faster than many expect, and here are the numbers. Steingraber’s first scenario examines a modest but steady accumulation model where 12 Spot XRP ETF issuers acquire an average of 3million XRP per day. His projection is based on focusing on the average rather than trying to predict which fund accumulates the most, because the combined impact is what ultimately matters for XRP’s market price. Under this setup, daily inflows would reach up to 36 million XRP. Over a standard five-day trading week, that accumulation would climb to 160 million XRP. Over the course of a month, the amount absorbed by ETFs would increase to 720 million XRP. By the end of a full year, this single projection implies that as much as 8.64 billion XRP could be removed from public circulation and locked into ETFs. Of course, these numbers only take into account the possibility of consecutive net inflow days and no net outflow days. Although these figures are hypothetical, the pace aligns with the early patterns seen in Bitcoin ETFs, where strong averages across issuers created a sustained demand for Bitcoin. In another post, Steingraber offered a more forceful accumulation model using the activity of Bitwise’s Spot XRP ETF as a benchmark. Data shows that the Bitwise XRP ETF received inflows of about 5.82 million XRP in its first trading day. In this second scenario, the projected daily acquisition rate is doubled to about 6 million XRP per issuer. If 12 funds follow this pattern, the combined accumulation could hit 72 million XRP every day. Extending the same five-day cycle, the weekly total would rise toward 360 million XRP, while monthly totals would reach approximately 1.44 billion XRP. Over a full year, this more aggressive model ends with 17.28 billion XRP absorbed into ETF products. “The entire XRP public supply will be gone UNLESS THE PRICE GOES ASTRONOMICALLY HIGH,” Steingraber said. The projections serve as a wake-up call on how quickly XRP’s supply ecosystem might change once ETF inflows stabilize and larger issuers like Grayscale, Bitwise, Canary, CoinShares, Franklin, 21Shares and WisdomTree get in on the action. However, BlackRock, which oversees the largest Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, is yet to make any move on a Spot XRP ETF. The company had confirmed in August that it has no immediate plans to file for one.

Title: PE Firms Flood Junk Debt Market to Pay Themselves
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/pe-firms-flood-junk-debt-market-to-pay-themselves-11763843247942.html

Private equity firms, struggling to find buyers for their investments, are turning to an old playbook like never before. Financial sponsors are extracting cash from their portfolio companies by raising debt to fund payouts to themselves and their investors at an unprecedented clip. Such dividend loans have hit $28.7 billion so far this year, putting them on track to surpass 2021’s record $28.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Their efforts come as the private equity machine hits snarls at nearly every turn: Attractive takeover targets are sparse and it’s harder to cash out old investments and deliver the returns once promised to pension managers, foundations and wealthy individuals. To quell impatient investors, buyout shops are increasingly layering extra borrowing on their companies and funneling the proceeds of debt sales to their stakeholders instead. “All the stars are aligned for dividend recaps; rates are coming down, spreads are tight, the market is open — yet the IPO market and M&A are still subdued,” Bill Zox, a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management, said. “Investors want distributions, and dividend recaps can buy PE firms more time to wait for a better environment for exits.” Private equity firms have routinely used dividend recapitalizations to book profits and take skin out of the game after they acquire companies. Such deals can be seen as controversial and aggressive, often leading debt investors — fearing the strain of the additional debt — to push back. But with demand for loans likely outpacing supply of new debt this year, borrowers have an upper hand. This month, private equity firm Thoma Bravo priced a $750 million loan for cybersecurity firm Darktrace to fund a distribution to shareholders, in what Fitch Ratings called “an aggressive financial policy with high leverage.” In October, Thoma Bravo raised debt on Ping Identity Holding Corp. to help fund a roughly $1 billion payout. Earlier this year, another one of its portfolio companies, Proofpoint Inc., obtained a $1.35 billion loan to fund a payment to the buyout firm and employees. Other recent deals included a $1.35 billion leveraged loan by yogurt maker Chobani Inc. to partly finance a payout. Buyout firms and their clients are relying on alternative methods to unlock cash. They’re shuffling assets out of older vehicles into what are known as continuation funds, selling stakes on the secondary market and borrowing against holdings through complex loans with high interest rates. The industry’s fund distributions have slowed so drastically that, at the current rate, it would take about nine years for customers to collect their money from the more than 12,000 companies held by US buyout funds, according to Pitchbook. That’s making limited partners reluctant to step up fresh capital, with Bain & Co. estimating in a mid-year report that there were more than 18,000 private capital funds seeking $3.3 trillion. “The reason that sponsors are doing it, and driving most of this, is realistically because they have struggled to monetize their investments,” Matthew Mish, head of public and private credit strategy at UBS Group AG, said. “The IPO market has started to thaw but is not really providing an exit. The LPs are not getting their money back.” Scarce Supply Helping fuel the dividend deals is the market’s supply-demand dynamic. Roughly $915 billion of loans have been sold in 2025, about 16% lower than the same period last year. Of that debt, some 80% has been for loan refinancings and repricings, meaning there has been relatively little new debt to buy. Another driver is collateralized loan obligations, structured credit vehicles that are the largest buyers of leveraged loans. CLOs are financed by issuing bonds. There have been more than $151 billion of the debt backed by syndicated loans sold in 2025, up about 4.7% from the same time last year, according to the Bloomberg data. “The problem is the deals aren’t performing. And so when they don’t perform, even if I want to sell mine, I’m not going to sell it to the other PE guy that knows that he has his own deals that aren’t performing and he doesn’t want mine,” Mish said. “The easiest thing to do is to do a recapitalization and sell it to a less credit discriminate investor, which is a CLO.” Click here for a podcast with Vanguard on reservations it has on junk bonds Week In Review On the Move With assistance from Dan Wilchins. ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Financial advisors who ignore Bitcoin ditched by young wealthy Americans

The Great Wealth Transfer has a new filter test for advisors: if you don’t speak crypto, you don’t get the account. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Younger, wealthier Americans seem to be rewriting the house rules of wealth management. They like broad equity indices. They park cash in T-bills. They still buy real estate and private deals. But they also expect to see Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a handful of other digital assets on the same dashboard as everything else. For them, crypto is a normal slice of a portfolio. For many of their advisors, though, it’s still a compliance headache and a career risk. That gap between young investors and advisors is there, and it’s getting wider every day. Zerohash’s new “Crypto and the Future of Wealth” report surveyed 500 investors aged 18–40 in the US with household incomes ranging from $100,000 to over $1 million. Most of them already work with a financial advisor or private wealth manager. Yet when it comes to crypto, a big chunk runs a separate stack of apps, exchanges, and wallets because their advisory firm either can’t or won’t touch it. Tens of trillions will flow from older Americans to younger heirs and charities over the next two decades. The people set to receive that capital already treat a 5–20% crypto allocation as usual, and they’re now benchmarking advisors on whether they can underwrite that reality without blowing up fiduciary duty, tax planning, or basic cybersecurity. The decision younger wealthy clients have to make is simple: if you won’t manage the part of my portfolio I care most about, I’ll find someone who will. The numbers from Zerohash’s survey are blunt: around 61% percent of affluent 18–40-year-olds already hold crypto. That share climbs to 69% among the highest earners in the sample, and most don’t see crypto as a fun lottery. Among high-income investors, 58% put 11–20% of their portfolios into digital assets. For all of them, crypto sits in the same mental bucket as real estate and core equity funds, not as a side bet. The study notes that 43% of young investors allocate 5–10% of their portfolios to crypto, 27% allocate 11–20%, and 11% allocate more than 20%. Zerohash also adds that 84% of crypto holders plan to increase those allocations over the next year. Those are the numbers for the demand side. On the supply side, the advisory channel is basically a ghost town. The survey showed 76% of crypto holders invest independently, outside their brokerage or wealth management firm. Only 24% hold crypto through an advisor at all. These are not your BTC maximalists living in cold storage; these are people who already pay a basis-point fee for advice and still feel they have to run a separate portfolio in another browser tab. Their money is already moving, as 35% percent of all affluent investors in the sample say they have shifted assets away from advisors who do not offer crypto. Among the top-earning group on $500,000 to over $1 million, that share jumps to 51%. More than half of those who left moved between $250,000 and $1 million per head. And yet, the same dataset shows how easy it would be for wealth managers to keep these clients. About 64% of respondents say they would stay with an advisor longer or bring more assets across if that advisor provided crypto access; 63% say they would feel more comfortable investing through an advisor if digital assets sat on the same portfolio dashboard as their stocks and bonds. The main takeaway is that the bar for advisors is very, very low. The bar isn’t “become a crypto hedge fund,” but “recognize this asset class exists and can be held inside the same reporting stack.” Layer this on top of the Great Wealth Transfer, and the stakes get very large, very fast. Cerulli and RBC estimate that total wealth moving from older Americans to younger generations and charities will be in the $84–$124 trillion range through the 2040s. That wall of inheritance and business proceeds is drifting toward cohorts who already treat crypto as a regular part of their portfolio. If the demand is this clear, why do so many advisors still default to “we can’t touch that”? Part of the answer sits in product design. For a long time, the only way an advisory firm could get crypto exposure into a model portfolio was through weird closed-end funds, trust structures, or offshore vehicles nobody wanted to explain in a compliance exam. Even now, with spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs out in the wild, many RIAs and broker-dealers treat those tickers as curiosities. Then there is the paperwork. Investment Policy Statements written in the past 10 years often lump Bitcoin into “prohibited speculative instruments” alongside penny stocks and options. Changing that language takes committee meetings, E&O reviews, and legal memos. The path of least resistance for a mid-level compliance officer is usually to write “not approved at this time.” Underneath that sits custody law. Under SEC rules, registered advisers need to hold client funds and securities with a “qualified custodian,” which usually means a bank, broker-dealer, or similar institution that meets strict safeguards. For years, crypto didn’t fit neatly into those boxes, and the coveted SAB 121 (Staff Accounting Bulletin 121) made life even more complicated by forcing public banks that held digital assets to record matching liabilities on their balance sheets. That logjam has started to clear. In early 2025, the SEC rolled out new guidance and no-action relief that made it easier for state-chartered trust companies to serve as qualified crypto custodians, effectively retiring SAB 121. The regulatory stack might still look like uncharted waters for many, but it no longer treats digital assets as radioactive waste. However, on the ground, a new cast of partners is rushing into the gap. Fidelity Crypto for Wealth Managers offers custody and trade execution through Fidelity Digital Assets, wired directly into the same Wealthscape interface that an RIA already uses for stocks and bonds. Eaglebrook Advisors runs model portfolios and SMAs focused on BTC and ETH for wealth managers, with portfolio reporting and billing wired into standard RIA systems. BitGo has built a platform aimed at wealth management that ties qualified custody to a TAMP-style overlay. Anchorage Digital pitches itself as a regulated digital asset custodian with reporting, reconciliation, and governance controls explicitly designed for RIAs. On paper, a mid-sized advisory shop could now bolt on a crypto sleeve with partners it already recognizes from the institutional world. But in practice, the pipes inside many firms are still stuck in the last cycle. OMS and PMS systems do not always know what to do with staking yield. The billing logic struggles with on-chain positions. The structural gap shows up in the Zerohash numbers around behavior: 76% of crypto holders in the survey buy and manage their digital assets independently. That means they already know how to move funds through exchanges, hardware wallets, and on-chain apps. For that cohort, advisors become essentially useless for buying Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other number of coins ranging from XRP to DOGE. Their value lies in tax, estate, and risk engineering for something the client has already done. This is where the “crypto-competent advisor” idea matters. A serious under-40 client today doesn’t care if their advisor can quote the Nakamoto consensus section of the Bitcoin whitepaper. They care about whether that advisor can: None of that is science fiction anymore. It’s just regular old financial advisor work. And it’s work that younger, wealthier investors have begun using as a scorecard. Zerohash’s survey shows a slow-motion run on legacy investment platforms. Start with the top-line: 35% of affluent investors in the 18–40 bracket have already moved assets away from advisors who do not provide crypto access. Among the highest-earning slice, that share is 51%. More than half of those who left had household incomes between $250,000 and $1 million. Put that into revenue terms. A $750,000 account billed at 1% is $7,500 per year. Lose ten of those relationships because you cannot stomach a 5–10% Bitcoin sleeve, and you have burned through the equivalent of a junior advisor’s salary. Lose fifty and you are into “we used to have an office in that city” territory. The path usually looks something like this: First, the client opens a self-directed account or a mobile app to get exposure while their advisor waffles. They buy the spot BTC ETF or a mix of coins on a mainstream exchange. Then, as that bucket grows and starts to feel real, they go shopping for someone who can treat it as part of a serious balance sheet. Crypto-focused RIAs and multi-family offices have picked up that brief, from DAiM in California to new arms like Abra Capital Management. Along the way, TikTok, YouTube, and Discord serve as the new discovery layer. A creator walks through how they run a 60/30/10 portfolio with T-bills, index ETFs, and a BTC/ETH sleeve. A podcast brings on a family office CIO who talks casually about budgeting 5% for digital assets. The message lands: if your advisor cannot even discuss this, others will. Culture becomes distribution. The golden aura around mahogany offices, golf club memberships, and brand-name wirehouses sits alongside a screen showing real-time P&L for a Coinbase or Binance account. For clients under 40, trust is starting to look like proof-of-reserves, qualified custody, hardware wallets, 2FA, and the ability to see everything in one portal, not just a logo they grew up seeing on CNBC. The Zerohash survey backs this up: 82% percent of respondents say that moves by names like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Morgan Stanley into digital assets make them more at ease with crypto in advisory portfolios. This is brand halo used in a new way: not to sell the firm’s own stock-picking skill, but to validate a new asset class they already hold. The portfolio design underneath all this is boring in the best way. Most affluent young investors in the survey sit inside a barbell: treasuries and broad indices on one side, a 5–20% crypto sleeve on the other, and some private deals or real estate sprinkled in between. They are not trying to reinvent modern portfolio theory. They are just adding one more risk bucket, then asking why the person who manages everything else in their life cannot help them manage this one. On the policy side, it lists Bitcoin and Ethereum as permitted assets in the IPS, subject to a defined cap, with clear language on liquidity events, rebalancing bands, and concentration limits. On the product side, it offers a simple menu: spot ETFs for clients who care about convenience and easy tax reporting; direct coins with institutional custody for those who want on-chain access; minimal alt exposure, if any, and only in products that clear compliance checks. On the operations side, it chooses partners who plug into existing reporting and billing systems: perhaps Fidelity Crypto for custody and execution, Eaglebrook or Bitwise strategies inside model portfolios, Anchorage or BitGo for more advanced clients who need governance features and staking. And it works on cybersecurity: how to talk about hardware wallets, key backups, SIM-swap risk, and what happens if a client loses access. On the human side, it stops treating crypto questions as a nuisance and starts treating them as an early warning system. The client who quietly moves $500,000 to a self-directed platform because you refused even to discuss Bitcoin is telling you something. Not necessarily anything about their risk tolerance, but a lot about how replaceable they think you are. All of this sits atop that $80-plus trillion to $120-plus trillion wall of wealth slated to move from boomers to their heirs over the next two decades. The inheritors of that capital grew up in a world where spending and sending feel as normal as wiring a bank transfer, and they’re busy watching which advisors respect that reality. The window is open for Wall Street, but it will not stay open forever. The first wave of crypto-competent RIAs, family offices, and fintech platforms is already laying the groundwork for weaving Bitcoin and digital assets into plain-vanilla wealth management without blowing up fiduciary duty, tax planning, or cybersecurity. Everyone else can keep arguing about whether a 5–10% crypto sleeve belongs in a portfolio while their clients quietly walk their accounts out the door. The wealth transfer is happening either way.

Title: Easygoing but disciplined - descriptions of Paul Costelloe’s clothes also applied to the man

Celebrated for dressing Princess Diana and creating the uniforms of British Airways staff, Paul Costelloe rose to become one of Ireland’s most successful fashion designers. In Ireland he has been associated with Dunnes Stores for the past 20 years for his collections of homewares, menswear and womenswear, a collaboration recently celebrated at his home in Monkstown. Following in the wake of Sybil Connolly who was the first to give Irish fashion an international profile, he established his name in Dublin as a young designer in 1979 having trained at the Grafton Academy followed by a period in Paris and Milan. His tailoring and early use of Donegal tweed and Irish linen made his name – breezy early dresses in the 1980s made from handkerchief linen were a sensation. That mix of tailoring and what is called flou with a strong colour sense continued to mark his style throughout his career along with a nostalgia for the freedom of the 1960s. He was also a gifted painter. Easygoing, low-key but disciplined were words used to describe his clothes, which could also accurately describe his personality. Forthright in his opinions which often generated controversy, he had a healthy disrespect for the rhetoric and hype surrounding the industry. His candour and lack of pretension made him popular with the British press. His real break came in London in 1983/84 when he was accepted as a member of a select group of British designers called the London Designer Collection, where he showed in London for the first time. That later became London Fashion Week, where he has shown for the past 40 years, most recently in the Waldorf Astoria ballroom where his collections were always the first on the schedule marking the opening of the week. The youngest of seven children of Willie Costelloe, a raincoat manufacturer who was the son of a Limerick publican and a member of the old IRA, his mother Catherine Curran was an American from New York. Paul grew up with a stylish mother and four sisters which certainly had an influence on him. Educated in Willow Park and Blackrock College, after leaving school he spent a year at the Grafton Academy before heading to Paris and a job with Jacques Esterel, the avant-garde French fashion designer. From Paris, he went to Milan, working at the department store La Rinascente. Then he took off for New York, which he recalled as the toughest part of his career, before returning to Ireland and setting up in business. His couture collections in London, shown twice yearly, demonstrated the freedom to design without commercial constraint as the clothes were only made to order and not produced for ready-to-wear sale. His last show, for winter 2025, was staged in Dublin’s City Hall in September, but he was unable to attend due to illness. He is survived by his wife Anne (née Cooper) and their seven children, Robert, Gavin, Justin, Paul Emmet, William, Nicholas and daughter Jessica. His son William, an artist like his father, has been increasingly involved in the business, as has his daughter Jessica, who is also a trained opera singer.

Title: Crypto CEO Says Bitcoin Was Never Meant To Be ‘Digital Gold’ – So What Is It?

A terse but provocative message by crypto CEO Jacob King has challenged the prevailing narrative around Bitcoin at a time when the asset’s price has reversed much of its 2025 gains. King contends that Bitcoin was never intended to function as a store of value or inflation hedge, two big labels widely used to describe Bitcoin in the past few years. Bitcoin’s price decline in recent weeks has revived long-standing questions about what the cryptocurrency was meant to represent. Much of the price surge earlier in the year has now been erased, and sentiment across the market has shifted into a defensive posture. In light of this, Jacob King released a pointed critique challenging the main arguments that investors have attached to Bitcoin over the past decade. King grounds his argument in the language of the Bitcoin whitepaper, which describes a peer-to-peer electronic cash system designed to facilitate direct online payments without intermediaries. He stresses that the whitepaper never discussed Bitcoin as a store of value, an inflation hedge, a geopolitical refuge, or any of the traits that dominate modern discourse. In King’s view, high fees, limited throughput, and declining real-world use pushed supporters to adopt new perspectives that kept enthusiasm alive, even if those narratives had no connection to what Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s creator, outlined in 2008. Satoshi explicitly described Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer system for online payments. The idea of Bitcoin as a form of digital gold was manufactured by maximalists to attract fresh waves of retail buyers. King’s comments land at a moment when Bitcoin’s price action is playing out anything but stability. The leading cryptocurrency has dropped massively from its 2025 highs, reversing most of the year’s gains and sending shockwaves through the broader market. The decline led to liquidations, weakened sentiment across major altcoins, and raised new doubts about Bitcoin’s defensive qualities during periods of stress. King’s view on Bitcoin clashes directly with the views of some of the most influential voices in global finance. Michael Saylor has repeatedly described Bitcoin as the superior successor to gold, calling it “digital property.” Larry Fink of BlackRock took the idea mainstream when he said Bitcoin had become a hedge to overcome and address local fears, a phrase that suggested the asset was maturing into a global store of value. Tom Lee, Head of Research at Fundstrat Global, has also embraced this viewpoint, stating that Bitcoin’s valuation could climb to the $200,000 to $250,000 range if it manages to capture 25% of gold’s market share. Earlier this year, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell echoed similar sentiment, noting that Bitcoin now acts as a legitimate competitor to gold. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $84,130. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Tributes have been paid to mother-of-four Stella Gallagher who died following a fatal stabbing incident in Cork earlier this week. Details of her funeral arrangements have been announced for early next week. Ms Gallagher (59) and her husband Brian (63) were both injured in the attack near their home in Shrewsbury Downs, Ballinlough at around 9pm on Monday night. Both were rushed by ambulance to Cork University Hospital where Ms Gallagher later died. Mr Gallagher underwent emergency surgery for a number of knife wounds including a serious wound to his neckand he spent several days recuperating at CUH before he was discharged from the hospital. He is now recovering with his family. The couple regularly attended Togher Community Garden in Cork with their son David since their retirement. Togher Community Garden is a volunteer-led non-profit community garden in Cork with support from Green Spaces for Health and Cork City Council. Gardeners grow their own fruit and vegetables there. Paying tribute to Ms Gallagher in an online statement, the group said: “It is with profound sadness that we share the news of the passing of our dear friend and fellow gardener, Stella. “Stella was a cherished and invaluable friend to us all in the Togher Community Garden family. Her absence will be deeply felt by everyone here. We especially remember her beautiful smile and the gentle person she was to everyone she met. Our garden will always hold memories of her kindness.” Ms Gallagher was also a member of the Cork Social Health Project (Shep) Choir. Its director, Jim Sheehan, said she was “much loved and greatly missed” in a message of sympathy posted on rip.ie “Stella was a member of the Shep Choir since the very beginning and loved being part of that community,” he said. “She was a very gentle and caring presence in the choir and brought much joy to others through her singing and camaraderie. She recognised the power and comfort of singing with others.” A native of Ballinspittle in west Cork, Ms Gallagher qualified as a chemical engineer with a BSc from Cork Institute of Technology, now Munster Technological University, in the 1980s. She worked for US pharmaceutical giant Lilly at its plant in Dunderrow near Kinsale for over three decades. “Stella was a long-standing employee at Lilly Kinsale for over 30 years, and she retired from the company in 2023. Everyone at Lilly Kinsale sends their deepest condolences to the Gallagher family at this very sad time,” the company said in a statement. Ms Gallagher, who is survived by her husband Brian and adult children Ciara, David, Conor and Mark, will be buried in St Michael’s Cemetery, Blackrock following requiem mass at Our Lady Of Lourdes Church in Ballinlough at 11am on Tuesday. Her son David (25) was charged last week with her murder and with the assault causing harm of Brian Gallagher at Shrewsbury Downs.He was remanded in custody to appear again in court on Wednesday. When David Gallagher was charged, defence solicitor, Shane Collins Daly said his client had been examined by a doctor every eight hours during interview by gardaí.

Title: These Are the 3 Biggest Stocks in Alphabet’s Secret Portfolio

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © NicoElNino / Shutterstock.com Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is often seen as a core tech giant focused on search, advertising, and cloud computing. Yet beneath its main operations lies a quieter side: a venture arm that invests in promising companies in areas like space tech, geospatial data, and semiconductors. These bets target innovations adjacent to Alphabet’s ecosystem, such as enhanced connectivity for Android devices, Earth observation for AI-driven mapping in Google Earth, and efficient chip designs for data centers powering Google Cloud. Through GV (formerly Google Ventures) and CapitalG, Alphabet manages a portfolio of about 37 public stocks valued at $2.5 billion to $3 billion as of late 2025. The three largest positions — AST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ:ASTS), Planet Labs (NYSE:PL), and Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) — highlight its strategy of backing high-growth plays in satellite networks, imaging analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI) hardware. AST SpaceMobile tops Alphabet’s portfolio with a stake worth approximately $459 million at current prices, representing 18% of its equity holdings. The company aims to build a satellite-based cellular network that connects unmodified smartphones directly from space, eliminating dead zones in remote areas. Alphabet’s interest stems from synergies with Android, with plans to enable seamless SpaceMobile connectivity on billions of devices worldwide. This aligns with Alphabet’s push for ubiquitous access to its services, like Maps and YouTube, in underserved markets. The $155 million investment in early 2024, followed by an additional $203 million in shares during this year’s first quarter, underscores confidence in ASTS’s partnerships with carriers like AT&T (NYSE:T) and Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD), which serve over 2.5 billion subscribers. Growth prospects look explosive. AST plans nationwide U.S. intermittent service by late 2025, expanding to Canada, Japan, and the U.K. in early 2026. Analysts forecast explosive revenue growth over the next few years, fueled by these deals. With a $1.2 billion cash buffer and a recent $420 million loan, funding for satellite launches is secure. The stock is up 143% year-to-date, despite losing half its value in the past month after missing Wall Street’s Q3 estimates last week. Trading around $52 per share, AST carries risks like execution delays in orbital deployments. For risk-tolerant investors, AST SpaceMobile offers moonshot potential — 50% upside by 2026 according to some models — if it captures even a slice of the $100 billion satellite broadband market. Alphabet’s bet signals it’s worth considering for those eyeing telecom disruption. Planet Labs holds the second spot in Alphabet’s portfolio at $356 million, or about 17% of holdings. Founded by NASA scientists, the company operates a fleet of over 200 satellites capturing daily global imagery, delivering geospatial data for agriculture, finance, defense, and climate monitoring. Alphabet invests here to bolster Google Earth and AI tools: Planet’s archives power environmental analytics, like deforestation tracking, and integrate with Google’s Earth AI models for pixel-level predictions on risks such as cholera outbreaks or hurricanes. This enhances Alphabet’s cloud services for enterprise clients needing real-time Earth intelligence. The growth case is compelling despite current unprofitability. Shares have surged 176% in 2025, trading near $11, but are down 33% from the highs hit last month. Fiscal Q2 backlog exploded 245% year-over-year to $736 million — 2.6 times fiscal 2026 revenue guidance — signaling locked-in demand. Analysts project 20% topline growth through 2027, driven by AI-enhanced subscriptions and government contracts. Partnerships with Airbus and the World Health Organization add credibility. At a 13.1 price-to-sales ratio, valuation feels stretched amid $22.6 million Q2 losses, but improving margins from fleet efficiencies could flip to profits by 2027. Wall Street’s “Buy” consensus targeting $14.55 per share implies 30% upside, but aggressive investors may buy for the 18% annual revenue growth forecast, outpacing the aerospace sector. Alphabet sees untapped value in data monetization, making PL a solid pick for thematic exposure to geospatial AI. Arm Holdings rounds out Alphabet’s top trio with a stake valued at around $258 million, roughly 11.5% of the portfolio. As a designer of energy-efficient CPU architectures, Arm licenses blueprints used in 99% of smartphones and increasingly in data centers. Alphabet’s investment ties directly to Google Cloud: Arm’s designs underpin custom chips like the Axion processor, offering 60% better performance-per-watt than Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) or Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) rivals, slashing costs for AI workloads. This supports Alphabet’s hyperscale needs, where Arm expects 50% data center CPU share by the end of 2025. Fiscal Q2 2026 revenue topped $1 billion (up 34% year-over-year), with royalties jumping 21% on Armv9 adoption. Q3 guidance calls for 25% revenue growth to $1.17 billion to $1.28 billion, fueled by smartphones, autos, and cloud. Analysts forecast 21% long-term earnings growth, pushing shares from $131 to a $168 target — 28% upside. The stock is up just 6% year-to-date after getting cut 28% during the market’s recent slide, but trades at a lofty 167 P/E. Still, partnerships with Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and SoftBank, plus Compute Subsystems royalties, position Arm for dominance in edge AI. Investors chasing semiconductors could buy, as Alphabet’s stake validates its role in the $500 billion chip market, but a decision to make its own AI chips introduces much more risk.

Title: Crypto Investors Are Now Value Investors, CryptoQuant CEO Reveals Why

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju has pointed out a pivot from crypto speculation to value investing within the blockchain industry. Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, has made a post in X suggesting that the current cryptocurrency price dip masks a shift to value investing. He claimed that this new era is driven by Traditional Finance (TradFi) integration, like tokenized Real World Assets (RWAs). This comes as Bitcoin price falls to around $84,000 from its October peak of $126,000, and Ethereum (ETH) trades below $2,700. For the longest time, digital assets were synonymous with speculation, but CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju believes that the era is quietly coming to an end. On X, he claimed that the market is undergoing a necessary but under-appreciated transformation. In his words, “crypto investors are becoming value investors.” Young Ju pointed out that even as the prices are down, the fundamentals are the strongest they’ve been in the past seven years. In fact, he claims not to have seen fundamentals and price drift this far apart. crypto investors are now value investors https://t.co/oihgm3zh4i — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) November 22, 2025 Amid this outlook, there is more integration of TradFi with Decentralized Finance (DeFi). He cited the example of the former BlackRock IBIT team members who launched HelloTrade. Noteworthy, HelloTrade is a decentralized exchange that is designed for 24/7 trading of tokenized stocks and bonds. Robinhood is also inching towards tokenized private shares, as earlier announced by its CEO, Vlad Tenev. Then there is Strategy, the popular business intelligence and software firm that has made Bitcoin acquisition a hobby. CryptoQuant CEO noted that all of this development suggests that the TradFi system is building infrastructure for a new financial world. Globally, there is a strong movement of tokenization in the TradFi system, marking a revolutionary pivot. During the Hong Kong FinTech Week, held earlier in November, Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Chief Executive Eddie Yue unveiled a five-year tokenization plan. He described it as a core pillar for advancing the city’s financial sector. The roadmap includes more than 40 initiatives across four areas: data infrastructure, Artificial Intelligence (AI), resilience, and tokenization of finance. Also, SEGG Media unveiled a $300 million digital asset strategy that combines an 80/20 crypto treasury model with validator income and tokenized sports assets.

Bitcoin ETFs pull in $238 million as Ether funds end an eight-day outflow streak and Solana products extend a ten-day run of inflows. Spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a rebound at the end of the week, with all Bitcoin, Ether and Solana funds seeing inflows after a week of volatility and downturns. On Friday, spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs attracted $238.4 million in net inflows after a wave of heavy redemptions the day before. BlackRock’s IBIT drove the turnaround with $108 million, while smaller contributions from BITB, ARKB, and BTCO helped lift sentiment. Even Grayscale’s GBTC, long pressured by outflows, added $61.5 million, according to data from Farside Investors. The recovery came after a bruising $903 million outflow on Thursday, the biggest outflow day in November and one of the largest single-day outflows since the products were launched in January 2024. During the day, redemptions hit nearly every issuer, including IBIT with a loss of $355.5 million, FBTC with $190.4 million pulled, and GBTC with $199.4 million in outflows. Related: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF sheds $2.47B in November as outflows hit record $3.79B After eight consecutive sessions of redemptions, Ether (ETH) ETFs broke their losing streak with $55.7 million in inflows on Friday, powered largely by Fidelity’s FETH, which brought in $95.4 million. The reversal followed a punishing stretch from Nov. 11–20, when Ethereum funds shed a combined $1.28 billion, one of the longest and deepest red waves since their launch. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) ETFs continue to outperform the broader altcoin market. Since launch, the five Solana funds have gathered $510 million in net inflows, led overwhelmingly by Bitwise’s BSOL with $444 million. The group has now logged a 10-day inflow streak. Related: ARK Invest wraps up week with Bitcoin ETF, Bullish, Circle, BitMine buys Ether slumped sharply this week, dropping 15 percent between Wednesday and Friday and liquidating 460 million dollars in leveraged long positions. However, despite the decline and a total drawdown of 47 percent since the August all-time high, derivatives data shows top traders slowly adding long exposure. Futures funding rates have risen from four percent to six percent, indicating early signs of stabilization even though bullish demand remains weak.

That’s how you know the earth isn’t flat: if it were the cats would have pushed everything off it by now. “Putin on the 28 Points” There is no way that Putin is going to treat those 28 points as the final plan but will consider them a basis of negotiations though Trump may have other ideas. And as the negotiations continue, the Russian military are setting up new realities on the ground by taking the Ukraine fortress belt. In one “version” of that 28 point plan, the unoccupied part of the Donbass would be not only turned into a DMZ but that Russia would lease that territory from the Ukrainians. A few weeks more and it will be a moot point as the Russian military will take it all back – and more. Funny thing is that Trump is demanding that Zelensky accept that plan by Thanksgiving as if it was the final version. And to put pressure on him, he has threatened to cut of weapons and intel from the Ukraine. If I was Zelensky I would call Trump’s bluff and refuse to sign it. That way if the Ukraine starts to collapse, the Neocons, the Ukrainians and the Europeans will put all the blame on Trump for losing the Ukraine which is the last thing he wants.

A supplier for a company I once woked at developed an optical component under NDA and applied for a patent behind our backs. A year or so later our customers started getting sued for using said component in their products, even though it was agreed in writing that we would have a royalty free and assignable license to the technology developed. Rather than deal with the legal issues, our customers shifted to another technology from overseas. A 9-figure revenue loss. “The Patent Office Is About To Make Bad Patents Untouchable” Truly a gift of immense importance to corporate (and individual) Luddites in whose interests it is to prevent innovatiion by others and enables then to get great rents on the IP they own. Once again, a US institution gives the future away to China, Russia and the other BRICS countries, and enables the US economy to go down the tube even faster than Germany. God bless America. Yes, true The article points out that patent trolls will still exist regardless and that the review process has only existed since 2013. Many including Dean Baker and Cory Doctorow have pointed out that the problems with our Intellectual Property regime are way bigger than the proposed change. In movie world patents had a lot to do with the existence of Hollywood since zealous enforcement of basic patents on the movie camera caused early filmmakers to flee the NY area to California in order to use their “pirated” machines (CA weather also had something to do with it). Doctorow says that unreasonable IP enforcement does indeed lead to “piracy, the obvious choice” among the public if less among money making corporations that can be more easily sued. Working link for “G20 countries’ medium-term growth to be weakest since 2009 crisis, IMF says Reuters” article at- https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/g20-countries-medium-term-growth-be-weakest-since-2009-crisis-imf-says-2025-11-19/ I would suggest that some members of the G20 are having better economies than others. G20 countries like Argentina, France, Germany and the UK would be having a rough time of it while G20 countries like Russia and China would be coping better. The FT article on the German economy contains at least one memory hole: Another frequent scapegoat is the price of energy. There is no doubt that Germany was hard hit by Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to turn off the taps on gas supplies to Europe in 2022 (and not to fill up Germany’s reservoirs in the autumn of 2021). But everyone in Europe suffered from the resulting energy crisis. Did Germany suffer a greater blow? The only problem with that FT article is that Russia never turned off the gas but it was European countries which cut the gas off themselves. But to avoid the blame for doing so, they made up the legend that Putindidit. US export of LNG skyrocketed in summer/fall 2022!

Record-breaking November heat blankets the South…link didn’t work for me. But there’s this, from 2024: https://thebamabuzz.com/noaa-reports-alabama-experienced-warmest-november-ever-recorded/ Ahhh, Coming for Your Burrata. Is it time for the national conversation on U.S. narcissism? The article is a reminder of the DJG Axiom about Writing by Anglos about the Mediterranean World >> It is almost always inaccurate, and most Anglo writing about Italy is just plain wrong. (A notable exception — and another reason for reading Naked Capitalism — is Conor Gallagher, who always runs down details and gets them in line.) Observations, dairy-related: –Burrata is something of a fad, like “cacio e pepe,” which went from being a Roman favorite to a supposedly national dish. Except that I have almost never seen it here in the Undisclosed Region. –Puglia has always had very hot and dry summers. I am not trying to discount climate change, the effects of which are readily seen in much of Italy, mainly as excessive warming. Patience Gray in her wonderful Honey from a Weed has some vivid descriptions of Puglia in summer, rainless, preternaturally bright, and hot. –For these reasons, the farmers in the article are bravely challenging some problems with weather and climate. In most of Italy south of Roma, the main milk producers are sheep, buffalo, and goats. All of these animals tolerate heat better. –In Sicily, the main producers of milk have been the sheep and goats. According to Mary Taylor Simeti, in her definitive Pomp and Sustenance, there was no (bovine) dairy in Sicily before the early 1800s, when one was established because of royals exiled from Napoli during the Napoleonic invasions. –Buffalo is still highly regarded in Italy, as are sheep and goats. U.S. farmers might learn something, but U.S. agriculture is locked into mono-cropping, and animal husbandry consists of growing animals too fast and slaughtering them too young. –Here in the Undisclosed Region, some producers still send their cows up to higher pastures in the Alps during spring and summer. Special cheeses are made during the “alpeggio.” Then the cows come down in the fall, during celebrations, with the cows all dolled up in flower crowns and wearing big bells. The seasonality of milk is widely understood in Italy. –The article is worth reading for the typical Italian meticulousness and care. Italians are extremely serious about food production, and the article does give a glimpse of how intense the process can be. (By the way, buffalo-milk mozzarella is often considered the real mozzarella.) –There is a rather sly producer here in the Undisclosed Region who is making camembert from buffalo milk. The cheese is grand. (Don’t tell the French.) U.S. agriculture is too industrialized. The lesson of the article is that U.S. farmers and eaters should take a step back and try to rescue the U.S. countryside, now overwhelmed with unsellable soybeans, corn being made into syrup, and cattle feedlots with thousands of sick cows making sick milk. “U.S. agriculture is too industrialized. The lesson of the article is that U.S. farmers and eaters should take a step back and try to rescue the U.S. countryside, now overwhelmed with unsellable soybeans, corn being made into syrup, and cattle feedlots with thousands of sick cows making sick milk.” Some of us try to get the point across, but the “farmers” in Georgia think it is there purpose and right to produce, not farm, soybeans and feed corn on thousand-acre plots. The state legislature is all-in on the grift. There are precious few who do not go along but their lights don’t go out, so there is hope. As for Americans being serious about food…Ha! In addition to not understanding the seasonality of milk, Americans have no clue about the taste of milk from different breeds of cows and the wonderful taste of buffalo milk. Holsteins produce vast quantities of inferior tasting milk that is made even worse by the crap diet the cows are fed to stimulate max production. Crap tasting industrial milk is all that’s available to most Americans. There are some efforts. There is an alpine breed of cows in France called Tarentaise whose milk makes a very nice cheese. An artisanal cheesemaker in Vermont wanted to try to replicate it in the US and approached my family’s farm several years ago thinking their herd would be a good match. They milked Jerseys, but pastured on a terrain similar to that in France. My family agreed to supply the milk for their Tarentaise cheese , which they did for several years. But even with the cheesemaker paying them substantially over the going rate for their high quality milk, they couldn’t make a go of it as a small farm and sold the herd a few years ago. Its like some people have completely forgotten or never aware of the Green Revolution of one Norman Borlaug. For all the laurels bestowed on him, he ushered in the Corporate Ag/Food Industry Cabal. For the increase in yields there is a very long and broad list of cons off setting them. Of note is the need to buy seed from monopolies, cross pollination IP dramas [see Mexico currently], petro-chem [waves at DuPont (better living through chemicals ads lmmao) – short list. The deal is industry sets the standards based on a balance sheet and flow of funds first and foremost for the benefit of a few. On the petro-chem I remember an old doco about some banned Herbicide in the U.S. which by law was supposed to be destroyed. Wellie the Mfg found it more profitable to ship it to Mexico and be used there. Clear evidence of it being improperly stored [little wooden shacks and leaking], handling, and worst of all … poor farmer families lived right next to the fields where it was sprayed whilst the kids were playing et al – its a neurotoxin. So a experiment was undertaken to judge the cognitive effects between the farm children and say children living at a higher elevation in the same region. Basically the kids on the farm were like zombies compared to the kids at higher elevation, things like rocking up with a red balloon and their reactions, kids running up to greet them, instigating spontaneous play between themselves, all of it. Sorta like Dick Cheney’s [bless his dear deported soul] mate getting help to sell a byproduct as an artificial sweetener till real world effects were cropping up. Not that background toxicity like CO2 has gone parabolic and lest we forget man made neurotoxins/psychotropics. Add Covid into the mix and the gaslighting to dump down the public is a trifecta of human stoopid[tm]. Thank you! Indeed…The food pyramid is a production schedule… Ditto KLG … Food-serious Americans buy serious food from companies like Anson Mills. https://ansonmills.com/biographies Food-serious Americans pay to keep serious food artisanality alive here and there. And food-serious Americans with back yards at least are also learning serious-food gardening in order to grow themselves some serious quality fruits and vegetables grown without petrochemical cancer juice. Any thoughts on why MTG is resigning? being a Congressperson is no fun if you’re in the minority. even worse as a blacklisted-majority. No big conspiracy. if MTg was smart, she’d leverage her (niche) fame into being a pundit I have to admit to feeling very sad about this. Someone finally shows some grit and a spark, and it gets extinguished like a fire after someone throws a pail of piss on it. Without her the Freedom caucus is a joke. I’m sure Lindsey Graham is celebrating, and Liz Cheney too. Maybe. There are too many unknowns here. Remember when Tucker Carslon got the sack from his network, only to come roaring back with his own independent one that is now a major factor in its own right? I don’t think that MTG is just one to fade off into the distance but will come back in one form or another. Time will tell. Yes, I was quite surprised, and saddened because she was one of the most visible critics of the Trump administration from the “MAGA” ranks. She gave a number of possible reasons for resigning in her statement. Whatever one thinks of MTG’s past actions or present motives, the statement itself is quite good: https://www.yahoo.com/news/videos/marjorie-taylor-greene-savages-trump-130834004.html I can’t immediately find the written version. Hard to argue with much of that. Apparently there are few in congress with balls her size. I don’t think you should imply that MTG, who is a woman, has big balls. Besides, men have owned that phrase for a long time and women should get their own phrase. Perhaps, we could say she has a big pair of ovaries but I don’t want to catch hell for interfering. Policing other readers’ tone is not on. Please don’t do so. And I as a woman, I would take that as high praise. IMHO, the issue here is that most billionaires that IM Doc and his colleagues have treated have had genital-enhancing surgery, both the balls and the penis. So I would be more concerned about this sort of remark reinforcing equipment size fetishism. It was high praise just to be clear. Thank you! She has what many of her colleagues don’t. “genital-enhancing surgery”. What?! Is this true? Don’t the oligarchs know that “it’s not how long you make it, it’s how you make it long”? (No apologies to Winston). If the rumors are true, Elon not only had surgery but it went very wrong leaving him unfunctional. Sometimes it’s better not to take the risk and leave well enough alone. ;) (Also further proof money can’t buy you everything.) I am told additionally that many can no longer have vaginal intercourse as a result (not that they can’t get hard, but the stiffened member is not receptacle-friendly). But at their level, it’s the balance sheet and not the performance that is presumed to pleasure their sex partner. Like her or not, MTG was providing critical, vocal observations on the hypocrisies evident in Trump policies when held to the America First maxim. She will be missed. I agree. I watched her farewell video. Best line: “Congress shouldn’t be a lifelong career, or an assisted living facility.” https://www.yahoo.com/news/videos/marjorie-taylor-greene-savages-trump-130834004.html 1. She said in effect that she didn’t want to have to fight a bare-knucle battle to win in the primary (which she should win, she had big margins in her past elections) and then be in a House that would probably be controlled by Democrats and have to defend Trump v. the expected impeachment. 2. There was speculation she would run for the Senate or Governor but she said no. But plenty of time to draft her later and have her gracefully accept. 3. IIRC one of the threats against her was versus a family member….her son? That would also focus the mind. I think her turnaround is genuine and comes from personal growth, but I have been fooled before. Still, it happens, especially with someone who is not of the Swamp. She would win her primary without breaking a sweat, but defending Trump in the aftermath would be too much to take given that she has finally seen up close and personal what kind of man he is. The backlash against Trump among her constituents because of his attacks – Marjorie Traitor Greene – will be measurable. They are likely to take it personally, and this makes GOP candidate appeals to their Trump bona fides a perilous tactic outside of the Blue urban areas of Georgia. I’m going with #2. The current GOP candidates for US Senator are unimpressive in the extreme, but it may be too late for that. And I cannot see her being subservient to Lindsay Graham. Governor is a definite possibility, though. Georgia is flush right now and she would be unlikely to mess that up. She would also be less inclined to pay attention to the supplicants under the Gold Dome. A definite plus. She had no problem with the beat down of the two GOP Public Service Commissioners earlier this month. They lived in the pockets of Georgia Power Company and everyone knows that. #3 certainly would have pushed her to make this decision. If this comes out, the perps will be cast into the outer darkness in perpetuity. She is still young. Enough time to come back. Besides there are still Rubio, Vance, perhaps Tulsi (and some others). How far could she make it with those in charge? Credible death threats Imagine. Two of the issues that she is most vocal on are Epstein and Gaza, and they both are critical for the current Israeli regime. I hear the Charlie Kirk was killed for his nascent anti-Zionism theme often on the street here in the North American Deep South. I now think that the Zionist Elites have overreached. American public opinion is now firmly anti-Zionist here down South. What the Zionists either fail to understand or do not care about is that this anti-Zionism will easily change into full blown anti-semitism. Expect to see the return of pogroms, popular pogroms. One ultra-conspirational theory is that the Globalist elites will divert the public’s anger about the deteriorating conditions of the average Terran human’s standard of living from them to the Jews. My inner cynic can easily see this happening. Some may counter argue that many of the Globalist elite are Jewish. Hannah Arendt showed clearly in her analysis of the Holocaust in “Eichman in Jerusalem” that the high status Jewish elites sold out the low status Jews to insure their personal survival. Thus, it follows that the Jewish Globalists will sell out the lower status Jews to preserve their power. That’s my story and I’m sticking to it. God’s Chosen People™. Blood is thicker than water, it is the Almighty at play for sure. But thickest of all is the Almighty dollar. “[…] the high status Jewish elites sold out the low status Jews to insure their personal survival. Thus, it follows that the Jewish Globalists will sell out the lower status Jews to preserve their power.” In other words: it is all about class — the concept that should never, ever be mentioned in polite society. This is something that the Jewish “bundists” had already understood: they found irremediably suspect the idea of emigrating to Palestine in order to establish colonies there, on land bought through grants paid by, and travel expenses subsidized by the same ultra-rich Jewish capitalists who, at home, where exploiting them and their non-Jewish comrades without any moral compunction. Of course, zionists hated the bundists. One hopes the lower status Jews have enough guns and ammo to make the “popular pogromists” pay for their “popular pogroms”. The problem here is that most if not all “resistance” movements require a “vanguard” cadre to guide and “enlighten” the downtrodden masses. The degree of “kinetic capability” is almost irrelevant here. This is why the “thought leaders” of emerging movements are usually “liquidated” to ameliorate the nascent threat to the status quo. I place Charlie Kirk firmly within this category. Alas, despite the fondest wishes of so many, proper revolutions are not “crowdsourced.” Also of note is that most pogroms from the past were “officially” approved. The status quo elites view such eruptions of popular anger as not only social pressure relief valves, but also opportunities for personal profit through seizures of goods formerly belonging to the dispossessed. When you worship at the altar of Mammon, all else falls away, morals, ethics, restraint. Stay safe. …she wanted it to coincide with the assassination of JFK? I think she reached the pinnacle of politics as ugly as it stands presently in these not so united states, with only a downward spiral to look forward to as the feckless Donkey Show wins in a year by default-not by ability. p.s. M T-G has come a long way… In light of 8/10’s of an inch of rain @ Burning Man in 2023, she stated that said deluge was divine punishment… “God has a way of making sure everyone knows who God is”. Although I was there for the Rx possibilities, great art and the best vibe ever shared by 75,000 others, she pegged me… “probably being brainwashed that climate change is the cause of all of it” and that after they dispersed, they would “have these stories to tell about how terrible this is and how we have to do everything possible to stop climate change” I am going to honor her spark and backbone by assuming she has been sincere. In that case, it must be a crushing disappointment to have the hero she fought so hard for turn out to be a turncoat. She doesn’t want to be treated like a battered wife. Thanks for all of the replies. My hope is that her final act will be the reading of the names from the Epstein files on the House floor. just FYI: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rich-marjorie-taylor-greene-123013554.htmlhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/rich-marjorie-taylor-greene-123013554.html Greene’s financial journey is as unconventional as her political career. Since joining Congress in 2021, her net worth has skyrocketed, jumping from around $700,000 to as much as $25 million. As of October 2025, Marjorie Taylor Greene’s estimated net worth is approximately $25 million, which marks a significant increase from before she took office. IMO she should have stuck it out for the rest of her term. She’d have been a useful gadfly even as a lame duck. Now the GOP governor will have to call for a special election in her district, and that person will hold office until the next rep wins a general election and is sworn in a year from Jan 2026. That means another headache for Mike Johnson, as technically his majority will drop to one vote after she leaves. That makes Massie the GOP equivalent of Joe Manchin. Not a bad parting shot at the Swamp Stooge Speaker. Depending on state election law, special elections can be really difficult to handicap. Special election is how Repub Djou got elected to Congress in deep blue Hawaii. Antidic: My thoughts are THANK YOU GOD!! She voted for every Trump initiative he put forward. She is one of the main causes of the mess we are in. Now if the rest of MAGA resigns, the country might just survive. Also, IIRC, didn’t MTG threaten AOC (implying that she had a gun in her purse while yelling at her walking down the street)? I can’t find the video right now. Please correct me if I am wrong on this. When someone criticizes the Zios, I listen, and maybe stand with them, though they may leave out some crucial fundamentals. Otherwise it’s an open field. She did, and so she was a target. Make no mistake, the Zios are absolutely ruthless. I’m waiting to hear from AOC. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/22/marjorie-taylor-greene-political-reactions Some Republicans offered congresswoman plaudits, but AOC was scathing in her dismissal of her frequent sparring partner Any critique of the Zios? Still waiting. Yeah, it’s a bit odd to see many lefties reaction to this. I can only relate it to when Dick Cheney suddenly became part of McResistance. In both instances, Trump became a bridge too far but the rest of the package seems the same. Quit while you’re ahead. She can come back to electoral politics another day but right now she’s looking good and can bank that. The coming year+ will be much less fun and quite risky for her. Damn man, there is something about resilc’s snow clearing in Vermont that is both relaxing and mesmerizing. It’s like those people that put video cameras on trains and you follow their journey as if you were at the front of that train. Well done, resilc. The video is about snow clearing in the Austrian Alps… It is even spoken (not much) in German. Thanks. Couldn’t hear the words as sound is busted on my ‘puter right now. I still find it relaxing. The flags on either side of the snowplow engine hood are a give away that it’s probably a state or county snowplow. Those flags aren’t US or Vermont./ ;) They also aren’t flags or any European country I know of (and look like reverse Austrian flag with proportions off), so they may just be markers of the edges of plow used as help in navigating narrow areas. ;) good point. thanks. Von Trapp family still have their ski lodge in VT, complete with Austrian flags…. ;) Video title says it’s from the John Deere co. about snow clearing in the Alps. The Green Mountains are in Vermont. The Green Mountains are a subrange of Appalachian Mountains. Vermont snowplowing probably looks exactly like this. / ;) From Cold Pursuit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DoGlTEzy4Q Cold Pursuit is a remake of In Order of Disappearance, IMHO a better version with Stellan Skarsrgard, one of my favorite actors, in the lead role. The original version is definitely a better film. The bit at the end with the snow plow and the paraglider is laugh out loud sad funny. Skarsrgard had the father character down cold. Angry, determined and melancholy all at once. Sequoia NP has a Pisten Bully that dates from before the end of the century that’s used on the odd occasion snow surveyors need to get into Mineral King to measure up, and too boucoup of a base for snowmobiles to tread. I rode it once for about 9 miles of the hydraulic arms on either side schluffing off 5 feet feet of snow as if it twas nothing, the operator at the gimbal stick of a steering wheel, precisely pushing it to the proper place. And then we turned around and did it again by cleaning up the road’s act down to the snow-mo’s waiting for riders. I had to look up Piston Bully on utube to see what kind of machine moved so much snow. wow! Probably a little to big for my driveway. / :) Please read with more care. This site is about critical thinking :-) The video is clearly labeled as from the Alps. I said resilc had a farm in Vermont. I never said the video was from or of Vermont. Presumably he hearts having snow plowed. “Raising taxes on the ultrarich” By all means tax the rich in every way listed here, but for family blog’s sake can we just PLEASE stop arguing for it “because revenues?” This just contributes to the pernicious framing that “money grows on rich people” and that we somehow need them! Stop the self-harm! Yes, we need the tax system to be seen to be just, and yes we need to tax the rich in order to prevent them from “buying” our legislatures, but NO! We do NOT “need” either them nor their money! Gaaaah!!! 🤦‍♂️ Whatabout taxing them because climate change? We do NOT “need” either them nor their money! From each according to their ability, to each according to their needs. Sorry if someone else has already noted this (I have had trouble keeping up with all of the comments over the past few days) but NC got a nice shout out on Philip Pilkington and Andrew Collingwood’s “Multipolarity” podcast on Thursday — in this case in particular for coverage of events in Mexico. Re AI–I’m a fan of the Hudson/Wolff/Nima transcripts and toward the end of this one they say that Youtube vandals are taking their videos and manipulating the visuals with AI and earning money off the content. The manipulators haven’t yet started putting other words in their mouths but could be the script kiddies find faking intelligent conversation harder to do than playing with pixels. https://michael-hudson.com/2025/11/cowboy-capitalism-in-central-asia/ There’s loads of this kinda stuff on YT now. I first noticed it with Whitney Webb clips being repurposed for Crypto (and now just Whitney Webb “fan accounts” with AI visuals). I have heard fake audio for Alan Watts. I was fooled for about 5 minutes until “AI-lan” started talking about doom-scrolling which seemed several years ahead of it’s time ;) “Less water from glaciers during future megadroughts in the Southern Andes’ Wouldn’t be the first time something like this has happened. About 4,200 years ago a severe drought forced the population to leave the ancient city of Caral in Peru and to disperse to places where they could still feed their people. This mega drought, known as 4.2ka, may have also struck such far off regions such as Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley as well as other places- https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/nov/05/archaeologists-discover-how-oldest-american-civilisation-survived-a-climate-catastrophe Re the Border Patrol and “predictive surveillance” didn’t know this The Border Patrol has for years hidden details of its license plate reader program, trying to keep any mention of the program out of court documents and police reports, former officials say, even going so far as to propose dropping charges rather than risk revealing any details about the placement and use of their covert license plate readers. Readers are often disguised along highways in traffic safety equipment like drums and barrels. Of course they also like to be obvious and visible as in those required traffic exits on New Mexico and Texas interstates where you will be given the “papers please” treatment if you or your vehicle look at all suspicious. (I’ve been getting the wave through–so far. They do ask “are you a US citizen?”) Here in Oz at least you can get stickers that you can stick onto your rear window saying ‘Baby On Board.’ Maybe there will be a market with similar stickers saying ‘US Citizen On Board’ In yet another chapter of the mutual Bizarro World collapses of the USSR & USA… You couldn’t travel internally in the USSR without a passport or the correct papers (please give personal remembrances in this regard oh so reliable NC Russian relations of a certain age) when one was free as a bird to go where they wanted in the USA, with the only state crossing tale of oh! being the old-timey tale of a criminal who eludes capture by evading the law in merely going over the border, where for some reason the other state couldn’t touch him. Old way of detaining somebody: ‘I tracked you for about a mile doing 77 in a 65’ New way of detaining somebody: ‘the license plate reader shows that you go drive this road a lot, which is very suspicious, and also it indicates you’re into kinky amputee porn.’ Yes in the good old days it was only the Texas sheriff speed traps you had to worry about. Our most recent sheriff was into setting up drug dragnets out on the interstate and seizing large amounts of cash which by (his) definition must be drug dealer money. Then it turned out he was using the county credit card for personal use and was therefore a crook. Karma is a bitch. Oddly no jail time for him–just the boot and reputational jail time. He did confess all in court. My favorite trap ever was some road off of the Hume Highway, the main artery between Melbourne and Sydney. I was too young to rent a car circa 1982, so I bought a 1968 Renault 10 with windows that went sideways and not up and down like every other car. It faithfully got me to and fro a few times, and this one time I went that different way I was talking about, and all of the sudden the blacktop ended and you were on a dirt road doing about 40 mph per hour too close to the car in front of you, and I didn’t take it for granite, more igneous, but a stone the size of a large walnut shattered my windscreen and for the next mile had to drive with my head looking out to the right, when I got to a town of about 1,000 people, with 8 windscreen stores. I’d imagined schoolchildren were sent out on field trips to plant the just right sized rocks on the roadway, ha ha Ah, license plate readers…. It’s not like the license plate reader computer OCR (Optical Character Reader) chip could glitch, could get things wrong, could never make a mistake. Is it? Of course not. I mean, it’s a computer! They never glitch or make mistakes, right? (do a really need to add the snark tag here? ha.) And, yes, Flock feeds to ICE. From Benn Jordan. (Note: the scary deep-voiced narration in certain parts is entirely for satirical purposes, though the satire is dark.) utube: ~35 minutes. Breaking The Creepy AI in Police Cameras https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp9MwZkHiMQ Also remembering, huge numbers of new ICE hires with very little experience have been hired this year. How many of these stops are ‘training exercises’ for the new hires? What could go wrong? Brazil (1985, Terry Gilliam) – Mistake? Haha. We don’t make mistakes. Tuttle changed to Buttle, and wrong person apprehended. Having been on the wrong side of the NYPD as they fabricated a story to protect one of theirs, I think about this. I am fortunate now to live in a county where the sheriff with large city SWAT experience thinks No-Knock entries are stupid/risky and prefers actual policework to be done. Thank you! I started to watch Brazil some years ago*, but then did not, I will soon. *Brasil, it had such a broader understanding, there were disputes on several in DVD ending offerings. I had a long battle with the tollway authority over a mis-read license plate. I sold my car, and didn’t buy a new one so the plate wasn’t transferred. 6 mos later, I get a nasty letter from the tollway about unpaid tolls for the car/plate I no longer own. Long story short (many calls and letters and “fixes” that only worked temporarily), there was a car with my old license plate, except it had an F where my plate had an E. The other car also had a license plate frame that encroached into the bottom of the plate that apparently caused the reader to see an E rather than an F. Yes, this is the technology I want to involved in “pre-crime” decisions. – ‘Trump SWOONS Over Zohran in Surreal Oval Office Presser’ – Breaking News Surreal is the word! Every time I think Trumpworld could not possibly get any more bizarre, I am proven wrong. I urge those who have not actually watched the Trump-Mamdani press conference to take a look. He bullies Marjorie Taylor Greene out of office and then turns around and loves-up the Commie Jihadist from NYC. WTAF is going on? Two general observations, Mamdani evidently has serious political instincts and skills. Trump displayed one of his most potent skills, throwing everyone off balance, misdirecting focus. I’m imagining a NY Post headline, Trump tosses MTG overboard, adopts Zohran as son he always wanted, hah, who believes that? Did Trump play to a pre designed kid glove strategy? “Mamdani evidently has serious political instincts and skills.” If I thought Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani was brilliant before (and I did) he’s more than confirmed it now. All the mainstream commentators are talking about how Mamdani “charmed” the President—as if he whipped out an invitation to yet another state visit to Windsor Castle or something—but, while he undoubtedly did do that, he came with a strategy laser-focused to appeal to Trump (e.g., building more housing units in New York). The press is dopily talking about the “bromance” between the two men, which reduces everything down to a lazy Hollywood trope, but, while Trump is obviously taken with Mamdani, I’m positive that Mamdani knows exactly who and what he’s dealing with. So Mamdani, in a stunning coup, at a minimum, neutralized the threat to New York City and his administration coming from the federal government (at least for now), threw a wrench into the plans of the Republicans to run against “communist,” “jihadist” Democrats in 2026, and, as an added bonus, made those who refused to endorse him before the election look petty and short-sighted and those in the House who, just before the meeting, were “resolving” to condemn “socialism”—a few being in both groups—look hysterical. It doesn’t get much better in politics, at least in terms of optics, than that. Thanks. Those “resolving” democrats deserve a mountain of scorn, and should be roundly criticized. Classy lot are they. But they also confirm what team blue thinks about Mamdani (and socialism), not that we didn’t already know. This is classic Trump. Be super dooper nice and flattering, then make unreasonable demands, then claim hurt and betrayal when he doesn’t get what he wants. Then he’ll lash out to demonstrate how dangerous it is to oppose him. Bang goes the bromance. I agree. I believe it is Trump that is doing the “charming”. I’ll venture Mamdani is well aware. Maybe a little “enemy of my enemies is my friend” (at least for now). I always remind those who infantilize Trump that you don’t successfully build skyscrapers around the world (navigate city and state bureaucracy, labor unions, mob, environmentalists etc) by being the oaf you play on TV. I mean he’s obviously not book smart and has the vocabulary of a 7th grader, but he’s got some other skills. Yea, he got those New York mafia skills. It turns out they don’t translate well to Moscow, Beijing, or Pyongyang. “Corporation Pumping Soothing Gas Into New York Subway Station” Not really a fan of this idea as you are talking about a corporation doing this in a public place with no opt out. Did they use those CIA studies about diffusing gases in subways as an inspiration? Bath & Body Works may be pumping vanilla and fresh pine scent from diffusers but how long till other people get ideas about what can also be pumped into the air in such places. Pax, here we come- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-NVs68X_S4 (2:01 mins) The 2005 sci-fi movie Serenity is worth watching in this regard (and so many others). ‘The Pax’ is the very first thing that came to my mind as well. “In a year, ten, they’ll come back around to the idea that they can make us ‘better.’ And I do not hold to that.” To me, It’s so worth watching I bought the box set! artificial fragrances have not been proven safe, nor have they been proven unsafe. there are some studies that suggest that certain cleaning chemicals raise lung cancer odds. Precautionary principle should apply….but of course won’t, cuz peeps love the smell of artificial vanilla Aum Shinrikyo is the first thing I think of when you mentioned pumping gas into subway stations. Re: “Dead or impeached by mid 27 and removed.” I know this (or some variation thereof) is the fantasy of many, but be very careful of what you wish for. Booting DJT means that Vance will become president, and he is both a) significantly smarter than DJT, and b) has actual backing and support from the likes of Thiel and crew. The views of his wife are immaterial, just as Melania’s are. If DJT’s own party operatives manage to remove him, they will make sure to do it after he’s served 2 years and 1 day, so Vance would be eligible to be in power for a maximum of 8 more years after his ascendance in the current term. I’m convinced they’re working from a long-term strategic plan, something the Dems seem to be unable to manage. re: nukes & fiction Apparently Jeffrey Lewis of all people in 2018 published a novel about a nuclear attack by North Korea on the US (this guy really had spoons full of this irresponsible nonsense), “The 2020 Commission Report on the North Korean Nuclear Attacks Against the United States”. In 2025, DRPK has significantly improved it weapons and delivery potential, quality and quantity. I read the short book it interested me because of the duties I performed from 1972 to 1983 in SAC and Air Defense Command. Later, civilian work in US military sensor and command and control projects. The only complaint I can recall is he did not say whether the blasts were air or surface bursts. Otherwise, given the leaks of western missile defense demonstrated in Israel and Kiev I find little fault. It was mercifully brief. 400 tomahawks in the hands of Tokyo will be meaningless. “Nuclear War” by Annie Jacobsen is similar in theme. I haven’t read the Lewis material but sounds like tone too. It’s an interesting read and goes through US (and other) responses from 0.4s to 72min post-launch. – ‘Mike Huckabee Held Meeting With Jonathan Pollard, Who Spied on the US for Israel’ – Antiwar (resilc) Not surprising in an administration where “MIGA” always trumps “MAGA.” And this applies even more to Huckabee, for whom “MIGA” is a prerequisite for the Second Coming. I was puzzled by this statement though: “Pollard described the meeting as “friendly” and told Israeli media that he thanked Huckabee for aiding in the effort to secure his release from prison.” Did Huckabee actually aid in Pollard’s release? I clicked on the Times of Israel links and did not find any information on this issue. Couldn’t they have met for coffee or hummus in some little café instead of in the embassy? That sounds like Bibi’s way of putting the boot in. (…with apologies to Joseph Welch) Have you no sense of indecency, sir, at long last? “Putting Venezuela Into Perspective… A Massive Challenge Compared to Iraq, While Russian Offensive Picks Up Steam” ‘Venezuela is covered with triple-canopy jungle and mountains. These geographic features make it easy for insurgents to hide and carryout deadly ambushes. Second, and related to the first, are the porous borders with Brazil and Colombia… Insurgents can move easily across these borders and obtain resupply.’ I tell you. I am definitely getting Vietnam vibes here if Trump is idiot enough to send in an invasion force. They might have the troops to control the capital and the oil fields but the rest would be enemy territory and the resistance would be fierce. It reminds me of the Darian Scheme, the first ‘Faraway Bubble’. (Mississippi Scheme and South Sea bubbles being the others) A good chunk of Scotland’s wealth went into the Darian Scheme in the 1690’s investing in what sounds very much like a Venezuelan jungle motif. When it went bust, the scheme was a prime reason for Scotland’s union with the UK in 1707. The Darien scheme was an unsuccessful attempt, backed largely by investors of the Kingdom of Scotland, to gain wealth and influence by establishing New Caledonia or Britain-in-Panama, a colony in the Darién Gap on the territory of present-day Panama, in the late 1690s. The plan was for the colony, located on the Gulf of Darién, to establish and manage an overland route to connect the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darien_scheme It depends if the goal is to really take over the country as a functioning entity, or if it’s merely to steal some of Venezuela’s oil, put a puppet government in Caracas, and otherwise destroy the country (including any people who might be insurgents because they are, you know, leading a goat or a donkey along a country lane instead of driving a Cybertruck or a Humvee on a highway). How much did it cost Obama to destroy Libya as a country just to show the world who’s boss? Trump would use the same math I would guess. Are there any logisticians telling Hegseth: “you can’t get there and supply it, from the east coast”? Distances, Roosevelt Roads is hosting F-35’s. It is 850 km or so from Caracas! That is about two aerial refueling going and at least one coming! Gerry Ford can launch around 20 strike sorties per day until the EMAG catapults die. Maybe lots of tomahawks! Drone warfare has interest but flying around the triple C! A US army brigade, currently the large maneuver organization, with organic logistics, requires a container port with roll on roll off facilities. Useable if US had sufficient Ro-Ro ships and loading capacity on east coast! A lot of ton supply per day! Just getting stuff to a suitable port on the east coast may be a problem. Are there airfield to fly tons and tones into Venezuela? Will US wear out the C-17’s and C-5’s. I was a 22 year old 2nd LT when that monster was new! Most POL for the 3000 vehicles per Brigade would be shipped by tanker to a port (?) and distributed how? A Marine Expeditionary Unit, with about a quarter the rifles of an army brigade, needs three large “landing ships” and a cargo fleet to supply once ashore. But are there suitable beaches to deliver the 21st century John Waynes/Smedley Butlers? Vietnam war was from the beginning a multi-year business plan. The Vietnam surge to take off required building a huge port at Camh Rahn Bay to augment deliveries to port of Saigon! Iraq logistics infrastructure was kept lukewarm from Desert Storm days! Is there a port for large material in Venezuela? The logistics! Trump will order them to perform D(onald)-day landing, and then build floating (Cranberry) harbours, just like in the movie he saw. H. CON. RES. 58 CONCURRENT RESOLUTION HOUSE PASSES REP. SALAZAR’S RESOLUTION DENOUNCING THE HORRORS OF SOCIALISM That Congress denounces socialism in all its forms, and opposes the implementation of socialist policies in the United States. (I think it outlines in the now USA that, we have socialism under monopolistic capitalism..so why not denounce that…but that besides the point) and then after this I’ll stick up for you’: key moments from the cordial Trump-Mamdani meeting Guardian (Kevin W) Trump SWOONS Over Zohran in Surreal Oval Office Presser Breaking News So Trump pulls another…I tell you something that appears to go one direction while, knowing he has backing to drive the knife into Zohran from the house. “The United States is both a democracy and a republic, as both terms refer to forms of government in which supreme power resides in the citizens. The word __republic_ refers specifically to a government in which those citizens elect representatives who govern according to the law. The word democracy can refer to this same kind of representational government, also called a representative democracy, or it can refer instead to what is also called a direct democracy, in which the citizens themselves participate in the act of governing directly by voting for all laws, policies, decisions, etc.” – Merriam Webster “The real danger of socialism,” Lange wrote, in italics, “is that of a bureaucratization of economic life.” But he took away the force of the remark by adding, without italics, “Unfortunately, we do not see how the same or even greater danger can be averted under monopolistic capitalism” (Lange and Taylor 1938, pp. 109–110). “Whereas President Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence, wrote, “To take from one, because it is thought that his own industry and that of his fathers has acquired too much, in order to spare to others, who, or whose fathers have not exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate arbitrarily the first principle of association, the guarantee to every one of a free exercise of his industry, and the fruits acquired by it”; Sponsor: Rep. Salazar, Maria Elvira [R-FL-27] (Introduced 10/24/2025) Committees: House – Financial Services Here T Jefferson was talking IMHO- about industrial capitalism not financial capitalism “banking institutions are more dangerous than standing armies” is a quote attributed to Thomas Jefferson, who believed that private banks could threaten the liberties of the people by controlling the currency, leading to financial manipulation and the potential loss of property. I mean really another twisted presentation of Thomas Jefferson who warned against the “aristocracy of moneyed corporations” and then in the same H. CON. RES. 58 CONCURRENT RESOLUTION “Whereas President James Madison, the “Father of the Constitution”, wrote that it “is not a just government, nor is property secure under it, where the property which a man has in his personal safety and personal liberty, is violated by arbitrary seizures of one class of citizens for the service of the rest” IMHO, we have legislated (enacted) seizures (the corrupting influence of big money) by a class of citizens (united)/ “”aristocracy of moneyed corporations” who, through financial manipulation have disposesed millions of their personnal life safety and personal liberty. That House – Financial Services – that being the one place most concentrated in folks representing FIRE sector interests and tax policy to benefit the FIRE sector – just figures they would come up with this neoliberal distortion of Madison and Jefferson Just keeps the drips brewing for an complete privitization of all things at the public expense – the socialist aristocracy of moneyed corporations during the first bernie run, when i got unwittingly pulled into beinga teabilly whisperer and evangelist for a new new deal in the dern feed store parking lot…when they’d say, “but hes a soshulist!”(ref my bernie sticker), and i’d first ask them to define that word, and counter everything they falsely attributed to it with an example from our corporate and federal masters(including property taxes, as far as never actually ownig anything…which sent them into confused silence) then i talked about actually existing socialist structures they used every day:highways and streets and county roads that belong to all of us…the ISD that not only babysits and teaches their kids, but employs more people than any other entity in this county, the city(2nd largest employer), the county(3rd,lol)… and if they were old enough, medicare, social security…VA benefits and healthcare…and so on. the dern volunteer fire department? lol. but then bernie got shivved, and trump came a blusterin in, and all was forgotten for a while. i dont go among the mundanes near enough any more for a repeat of all of that. but i do overhear that the local lumpenrighties are not very happy with trump, et alia. Wowsers! Hot on the trail of Larry Summers And the internets are burning I sit around Trying to smile But the rumor mill is so heavy and dry Strange voices are saying (What did they say?)

Moon of Alabama’s latest regarding the 28-point plan: Kellogg Fired Over Leaking 28-Point Plan – Proposal Designed To Trap Putin To summarize, B suggests that the (pardon the phrase) leaking party, referred to as “K” by Witkoff, was not Kirill Dmitriev but special envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg. Kellogg has now stated he is leaving the post in January although he appears to already have been effectively replaced by army secretary Dan Driscoll. Interestingly, the recipient of the leaked propoesal was one Barak Ravid of Axios — the same “journalist” who recently reported the purported foiling of an Iranian plot to assassinate the Israeli ambassador to Mexico. Can’t wait to see the plan that the Driscoll gang comes up with. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGrziG-2fWw The same sort of weather event happening 20 miles up presently, caused the brutal freeze of 2018, pay heed. For two straight weeks bridging 2017 and 2018, December 26th to January 8th, the mercury never crept above 32º. Those 14 sub-freezing days tied with 1979 and 1940 for the second-longest cold spell in the city’s recorded history, according to a thing I found on the internet. Only 1961’s 16-day streak beats it. Throw in a new phrase “bomb cyclone” to liven up a brutal winter storm in the middle of that cold spell, and you’ve either got more than enough reason to cuddle up next to the fire with a glass of cabernet, or you layer up to take advantage of an ever rarer phenomenon: deeply frozen rivers. https://hiddencityphila.org/2018/01/deep-freeze-2018/ $4.01(k) update: Crestfallen is perhaps not strong enough sentiment to express anti-sediments settling down to $84k per Bitcoin, gasp. Was the sinking of the Titanic like this? you wonder as you collect your valuables from the online pursers office… I believe that the recent speculation about Trump having Dementia is correct, he has become increasingly erratic over the course of the year. It may be Covid induced, something that will be increasingly affecting public officials due to their greater exposure, however it’s going to affect all of us more and more as time passes. The claim he has ended 8 wars, his direct threats to reporters and networks and his congenial meet and greet with Mamdani in a short time are not the actions of a stable genius. It is a heckuva show, here’s hoping it is survivable! He has a piece of paper that lists all the wars “he has ended” (probably because all the Aberbaijan vs Cambodia stuff), so the claim does not count as dementia (though the need for that paper might). South of the border: US issues warning to airlines flying over Venezuela amid ‘heightened military activity’ How long till Trump has a passenger airliner shot down over Venezuela because the plane was full of narcoterrorists who might have drugs aboard to fly to the US.

Title: JPMorgan Has 15 Ideas for 'Bargain Hunting' Tech Stock Investors

Is it time to start buying tech stocks again? JPMorgan says so, with analysts telling clients in a note Thursday—a day after Nvidia's (NVDA) blockbuster earnings hit markets—that it could be time to go "bargain hunting" among the shares of hardware and networking companies that have taken big hits in recent weeks amid worries about an AI bubble. The analysts listed 15 stocks particularly exposed to AI that they believe represent the biggest bargains, with the most "overblown" risk already priced in, and strong fundamentals that could leave them poised for big gains. Most of the stocks JPMorgan recommends have declined between around 10% to 30% from their highs of the last four weeks, with one down nearly 40%, and one off just about 5%. Here are the analysts' ideas. Tech stocks have pulled back in recent weeks amid worries about an AI bubble after a big run-up earlier this year. JPMorgan is suggesting some of those worries may be overdone, leaving the shares of many businesses with strong underlying financials and healthy businesses undervalued. PC maker Dell (DELL), which has seen its stock lose one-quarter of its value from its late October highs, was one of JPMorgan's picks. "This is despite risks into margins," JPMorgan wrote, holding that investors under-appreciate Dell's track record of effectively managing rising component prices. Analysts at Morgan Stanley double-downgraded the stock to “underweight" from “overweight” on Sunday, citing concerns about rising prices for components like memory chips. JPMorgan highlighted server maker Arista Networks (ANET); laser systems leader Coherent (COHR)' electronics manufacturing services providers Flex (FLEX) and Jabil (JBL); and connector maker Amphenol (APH) among its other choices. These companies, along with Dell, derive most of their AI exposure from the largest Big Tech firms that are expected to keep investing in building out their infrastructure in the near term, and are likely to have more stable financing than less established players, JPMorgan said. Server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI), which counts leading AI chipmaker Nvidia among its partners, was also on JPMorgan's list, along with Apple (AAPL) partner and smartphone glassmaker Corning (GLW), and optical components manufacturers Fabrinet (FN) and Lumentum (LITE). Data storage provider Pure Storage (PSTG), high-speed networking firm Ciena (CIEN), data center supply chain solutions company Celestica (CLS), test equipment maker Teradyne (TER), and connector and sensor maker TE Connectivity (TEL) rounded out the list.

Title: 'We did it' - homecoming for man who swam round Ireland

Pat McGrath Western Correspondent A homecoming event has been held in Galway to celebrate the achievements of a man who has has completed a swim around the country's coastline. Daragh Morgan embarked on the fundraising effort over five months ago and completed his endeavour this week. It involved him covering around 15 kilometres each day, in order to circumnavigate a total distance of 1,468 kilometres. Organisers marked the completion of the swim with a homecoming event at Galway Harbour this afternoon. Homecoming for Daragh Morgan after his swim around Ireland Over the course of his journey, the 27-year-old was accompanied by a support fleet comprising three boats, with crews providing safety and navigational assistance when necessary. The primary support vessel was the Naomh Crónán, a 43ft Galway Hooker, provided by the Galway based Badóirí an Chladaigh group of seafarers. The expedition was captained by Dara Bailey, from Leitir Mór, and has raised over €27,000 for the RNLI and the Simon Community. "Only a select few people would be able to skipper that vessel and Dara was the glue that held everything together" said Mr Morgan. "He had so much to co-ordinate and organise all the way through this. Looking at tides, planning how we would get to GPS co-ordinates, taking to local fishermen and plotting the route". Since the start of the expedition at the end of May, Mr Morgan embarked on 99 separate swims, over 93 days. He first came up with the idea in 2019. "I was always into sport but I wanted to explore Ireland and dreamt up the idea from that notion. "But I hadn't done necessary training or anything, so I decided I needed to test my mind, body and soul to see if I could do this. "I did several swims, ran the length of Ireland and then the width of Ireland non-stop. All those things fed into the swimming idea and got me ready." He set off from Blackrock diving tower in Salthill last May, swimming first to Inis Mór. He then headed northwards, eventually travelling past 17 coastal counties, before returning to Galway this week. Over the course of his swims, he said he endured multiple jellyfish stings and other injuries, as well as contending with challenging weather conditions and unfavourable seas. "The hardest part was getting in the water to start off," said Mr Morgan. "The enormity of the logistics hit me then and I knew the scale of what I was about to undertake. "Then the usual challenges came up…chafing was a massive problem, I got badly injured and had to go to hospital at one stage, but we overcame everything to make a dream a reality." "I was very ambitious with it. I set myself a target of three months initially, to have a deadline to work towards. That put a bit of urgency to it and we ended up doing it in five months and seventeen days." "We logged our GPS co-ordinates everywhere we stopped and then started off again from there at the next stage of the journey." Organisers are emphasising the importance of a community-based effort to complete the task, in the absence of major corporate sponsorship. At the end of it all Mr Morgan said it was "pretty surreal and very emotional" to arrive back in Galway with his support crew. "We went through so much together and developed a very strong bond for each other and for the country as well. It gave me an immense sense of pride to be back in Galway, holding the Irish flag and to be able to say we did it". He is the second person to complete the feat, following the late Henry O'Donnell from Donegal, who undertook a similar challenge in 2022. Western Correspondent © RTÉ 2025.

Title: The internet is loving 'Big Short' investor Michael Burry's crusade against Nvidia and the AI giants

Michael Burry right now $NVDA $SPY $BTC pic.twitter.com/GWmgFMTTb6 The investor of "The Big Short" fame is lighting up social media after he bet against Nvidia and called out the chipmaker and other AI companies on X, which may have contributed to the stock market's slump on Thursday. Cassandra winsBrutal day... pic.twitter.com/DwGiTtbG59 Burry is best known for predicting and profiting from the collapse of the mid-2000s US housing bubble. His massive, contrarian wager was immortalized in the book "The Big Short" and a movie adaptation starring Christian Bale as Burry. Known for his dire warnings of crashes and recessions, Burry goes by "Cassandra" on X — a reference to the priestess from Greek mythology who was cursed to speak true prophecies but never to be believed. He burst back onto X in late October after more than two years of silence, and wasted no time firing off several warnings about a dangerous bubble in AI stocks. His hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, revealed days later that at the end of September it held bearish put options on Nvidia and Palantir with a combined notional value of $1.1 billion. Palantir CEO Alex Karp called the bets "batshit crazy" in a televised interview, spurring Burry to fire back that the AI company's boss couldn't "crack a simple 13F." In later posts, Burry said that he wasn't short and had exited the Palantir puts in October. He also terminated Scion's SEC registration, closing it to outside cash. Most recently, he took aim at Nvidia after its third-quarter earnings beat on Wednesday. He questioned the longevity of its chips, its "give-and-take deals" with other AI companies, and its stock dilution. Some market watchers rushed to ridicule his bearish stance on the AI boom after Nvidia shares popped more than 5% following its earnings beat. Live look at Michael Burry pic.twitter.com/nYJb5dHPSE Other commenters poked fun at Burry's defiance, and his willingness to go up against technology titans and the dominant market narrative. Michael Burry trying to keep the $NVDA short narrative alive after that earnings print pic.twitter.com/k1W9zfAW7o Still others have defended Burry, saying he's many things but foolish isn't one of them. 100% of people who think they’re smarter than Michael Burry are 100% not smarter than Michael Burry. pic.twitter.com/wxde2212P1 Shares of Nvidia opened higher on Thursday but swung to a 3% decline by the market's close, and fell another 1% on Friday. Nvidia is the world's most valuable public company with a market capitalization above $4 trillion, so its sudden downswing dragged the entire stock market lower on Thursday. The S&P 500 gave up a 1.9% gain to close 1.6% lower, while the Nasdaq Composite went from a 2.6% rise to a 2.2% fall, marking the indexes' largest intraday swing since April. Both closed less than 1% higher on Friday. The reversal led some market watchers to rally behind Burry, celebrating his surprise comeback and suggesting he may have been right to be skeptical. Michael Burry in the past 12 hours https://t.co/LfUscwdnrj pic.twitter.com/kN4FEtxVDu They also gave him kudos for cashing in on the chaos, even though Burry hasn't said whether he holds Nvidia puts or profited from Thursday's selloff. Michael Burry right now pic.twitter.com/87nXleZLX2 Burry also received praise for his Palantir bet, as the AI stock has tanked 25% since November 3, when it reported earnings and Burry disclosed his puts. Update: It's been 17 days since Michael Burry publicly went bearish on Palantir $PLTRIt's down -25% since pic.twitter.com/EtxvlYakpB By no means was Burry solely responsible for the market slump. Investors also soured on Nvidia after analysts flagged increases in inventories and deferred revenues, raising concerns the company's growth may have been frontloaded and could slow in future quarters. Moreover, delayed economic data showed US unemployment rose to an almost four-year high of 4.4% in September. Burry is yet to post about the online furor surrounding his crusade against the AI giants. But his followers may hear more from him very soon, as his X bio reads: "'Unchained' coming maybe sooner than Nov 25th." Jump to

Title: For the birds: alternative showstopper dishes for the Thanksgiving or Christmas table

As turkey farmers around the country grapple with the stress and potential monetary hit surrounding the spread of bird flu, supply uncertainty is also creeping into festive menus – is it really Christmas if we can’t rely on a gorgeous, golden bird resting at the centre of our tables? These five chefs would argue it most certainly can be, and who are we to disagree? Here, they offer up suggestions from their most beloved dishes to help get us through the coming celebrations, and there isn’t a hint of turkey in sight. I grew up in China, where we didn’t celebrate Christmas, so I haven’t got the same Christmas traditions that most people in this country would have. However, we always use it as an excuse to get together and celebrate with friends, and for many years now we have hosted this celebration in our house. We have about 15 people – friends and family – for a big meal on Christmas Day, for which I do all the cooking. I put lots of dishes filled with food on the table and let everyone help themselves. A lot of what I cook on Christmas Day is dictated by my family and the food that they love to eat. I cook a côte de boeuf every year as it’s always a huge hit, in particular with my 10-year-old daughter who would eat it all herself if allowed. I cook plenty of sides with it, both vegetables and potatoes. I definitely take a more relaxed approach at home than in the restaurant. My wife demands that I do her favourite – a butternut squash risotto; I don’t have a choice in the matter. My son is a big fan of fish and seafood, so there will have to be some prawns and a fillet of fish or two for him. We don’t really have desserts – I just put a selection of cheeses on the table and everyone helps themselves. Barry Sun’s non-turkey recommendations are: roasted butternut squash risotto with sage and taleggio, and côte de boeuf. Every year, I cook for 14 of my family who are all delighted to see something different on the menu, especially my teenage son, who loves venison. I started off serving melon and thinly sliced venison – our version of Parma ham and melon – which was a great crowd-pleaser in the Commons household. We then moved on to a lightly smoked venison as a starter, which I cured in gin and juniper berries and topped with a cranberry and hazelnut crumble. Now, for the main course, everyone is delighted to see the venison replace turkey. The big thing is that venison is wild, which gives it such a unique and herby flavour. Often you can taste the heather, unlike traditional turkey which can ultimately be very bland – hence all the sides that accompany it to maximise the flavour. Cooking venison is also a different concept. Work-wise, venison is easier to cook. Unlike turkey, where you have to cook it at a high temperature, then lower it and start the basting process, venison can be cooked on the pan exactly the way you like it, avoiding overcooking. Not only that, venison is the healthier option with a lower fat content. Sika deer is excellent; flavour-wise it really stands out, so if you can get your hands on that you’re in luck. Your butcher might be able to arrange some for you. Place venison, cracked juniper berries and rosemary in a bag and leave overnight. Remove from the bag and season. Seal off the venison in a hot pan until golden brown, add the gin and flambé. Place in preheated oven for eight minutes (medium). Remove from the oven and cover with tin foil. Allow to rest for three minutes Place the pears and the vanilla seeds and pod in a pot and cover with a lid. Cook slowly on a low heat until soft. Remove the vanilla pod. Place in a blender and blitz until smooth. Set aside and keep warm In a warm pot, melt the butter until lightly foaming. Add the shallot and thyme. Sweat until soft and translucent. Add the cabbage and cook until tender. Season with salt and add the truffle oil. Form into a ball shape and wrap in the outer leaves, then wrap the ball in cling film. Set aside. When reheating, place in boiling water for three minutes. Remove the cling film and place on the plate. (The cabbage ball can be cooked in advance and kept in the fridge.) We have never been a great house for the traditional Christmas Day turkey dinner. I always cook a very small turkey for visitors who call, but for our family dinner I will always try an alternative. Over the years, we have had goose, duck, beef Wellington and other dishes. This year, though, I decided to try stay away from the prime cuts and try some slow cooking. We have had a dish on in the restaurant – slow-cooked ribs – for the past few weeks and its moreish nature has inspired me to replicate it at home. Being a slow-cooking dish, it is easily prepared, can cook while I am at work, and when ready can be served with nearly all of the usual Christmas fare. It is fantastic with roasted parsnips, creamy champ and jus made from the cooking liquor. Garnish it with a sneaky slice of honey-glazed local ham. Beef Wellington makes a spectacular main course for Christmas Day dinner – it’s elegant, indulgent and guaranteed to impress. The golden, flaky pastry encasing tender beef fillet and rich mushrooms creates a show-stopping centrepiece that’s as beautiful to look at as it is delicious to eat. It’s perfect for serving a big crowd, slicing neatly to reveal its layers. Slicing it at the table offers a nice bit of theatre to guests too – it’s always a wow moment when we serve it in The Shelbourne too. Paired with classic sides such as crispy roast potatoes and seasonal vegetables, beef Wellington brings both comfort and luxury to the festive table. It’s a true crowd-pleaser that everyone in the family loves, making it a timeless favourite for a special Christmas feast. Christmas can be overwhelming with the amount of food and meat, so for me something like monkfish, which is light but has a meaty texture, is a really great alternative. Seasonal greens and those delicious buttery potatoes will complement it perfectly and leave you feeling very satisfied. Buy the freshest monkfish you can find, or any other white fish such as John Dory, halibut, hake, or cod – are all great options. Serve with cooked seasonal greens such as kale, chard or spinach, which all complement the dish beautifully. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Equity investors are growing increasingly concerned about the amount of leverage that Big Tech is taking on to build out its artificial intelligence infrastructure as the industry faces rising fears of a bubble. The enormous sums major technology companies are spending on AI are nothing new, but the record pile of debt they’re raising to do it is. What’s worrying stock traders is the trend represents a break from recent history, when companies tapped their huge cash piles to pay for their capital expenditures. The use of leverage and the circular nature of many of the financing deals introduces a level of risk that wasn’t there before.

Title: Amazon Layoffs: Four In 10 Employees Were Engineers In Latest 14,000 Job Cuts, WARN Data Shows

Amazon Inc has done the largest workforce reduction in its history, which hit the engineering roles the most. Four in 10 employees were engineers in the latest 14,000 job cuts, WARN data showed. The company announced the layoffs on October, 2025. The move impacted all segments of its business, from cloud services, to retail, advertising, and groceries. Amazon Inc submitted the records of job reduction for New York, California, New Jersey, Washington, and show how sharply engineering was affected. Around 40% were in engineering positions of the 4,700 layoffs recorded in the state, according to data Amazon provided through Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification filings. WARN data showed that the cuts affected engineers at various levels but disproportionately hit software development engineering staff or the mid-level software developers. The layoffs affected more than 500 product managers and programme managers across states that field notice. They account for 10% of the total job cuts. Another section which bore the hardest hit was the gamining segment. California's WARM data showed that significant reduction in its San Diego and Irvine Studios as well as central publishing. There is no data for other states, which indicates that the figure is only a part of wider cuts. The workforce reduction happened as Amazon CEO Andy Jassy continued to overhaul for the company's internal culture. Amazon said that the artificial intelligence was not the main reason behind the layoffs. The company has reduced the workforce to reduce layers, speeding up decisions. Another wave of job cut is due on January, 2026.

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/21/2025 7:44:36 PM PST by TBP In his second term, President Donald Trump certainly hasn’t been afraid to go bold — and now it could be the stock market’s turn. The slate of reforms under consideration could be the biggest positive development for our financial markets since the early days of the Reagan administration, if not since the creation of the federal securities laws themselves. It could also finally put the brakes on the rise of “woke capital.” For years, political activists have been using America’s biggest corporations as vehicles for their social agenda. They call it “ESG” — environmental, social and governance investing — but it really boils down to pressuring companies to take political stands that most ordinary investors never asked for, from Black Lives Matter to “climate justice.” The most famous example came in 2021, when a tiny “green” hedge fund named Engine No. 1 managed to get two climate-activist directors on the board of oil giant Exxon Mobil. How did political actors disguised as investors convince other shareholders to elect oil-hostile directors to the board of a petroleum company? Simple: They captured the votes of the massive passive index fund giants — BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. Instead of letting three giant index fund families dominate shareholder votes, the Securities and Exchange Commission could require them to vote the same way they invest — passively. Passive funds should mirror how the rest of the shareholders vote. (Excerpt) Read more at nypost.com ...

They call it “ESG” — environmental, social and governance investing — but it really boils down to pressuring companies to take political stands that most ordinary investors never asked for, from Black Lives Matter to “climate justice.” The most famous example came in 2021, when a tiny “green” hedge fund named Engine No. 1 managed to get two climate-activist directors on the board of oil giant Exxon Mobil. How did political actors disguised as investors convince other shareholders to elect oil-hostile directors to the board of a petroleum company? Simple: They captured the votes of the massive passive index fund giants — BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. Instead of letting three giant index fund families dominate shareholder votes, the Securities and Exchange Commission could require them to vote the same way they invest — passively. Passive funds should mirror how the rest of the shareholders vote. (Excerpt) Read more at nypost.com ...

Title: Crypto Trader Who Correctly Predicted The Bitcoin price Top At $125,000 Reveals Where It’s Headed Next
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-top-at-125000/
Time Published: 2025-11-22T02:00:48Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin price action has shifted into a high-volatility zone, and a well-known crypto trader is reinforcing a bearish outlook that is unfolding almost exactly as he projected. Doctor Profit—who previously pinpointed the $68,000 peak in 2021 and this cycle’s $125,000 top—is now mapping out further downside, framing the current correction as only the first stage of a much deeper decline. Bitcoin price has entered a pronounced downward cycle, registering losses of 8.4% in the past 24 hours and more than 17% over the last two weeks. Doctor Profit noted on X (formerly Twitter) that Bitcoin’s drop from $125,000 marks the first stage of a larger bear-market trend. He frames the current environment as a transitional zone marked by brief consolidation rather than true stabilization. Under his model, the next major move points toward a deeper retracement, with the Bitcoin price ultimately gravitating toward the $60,000 region as the cycle’s next critical target. This call aligns with his historical cycle predictions. In earlier cycles, he anticipated the 2021 top near $68,000, projected a collapse toward $18,000, and then switched bullish at that bottom to forecast the rally toward $120,000. With the latest reversal forming directly at the levels he flagged months in advance, his bearish thesis has gained renewed credibility. He also pointed back to a September warning that the crypto market was set for a 30% contraction. With about 25% already wiped out, he views the downturn as a broad repricing rather than a simple correction. In a separate post, Doctor Profit highlights unusually large outflows from top asset managers, framing the activity as aggressive bearish positioning rather than panic. On-chain data supports this, as transfer logs show deep, continuous outflows from Grayscale-linked wallets into Coinbase Prime. These transactions include batches ranging from roughly 14 BTC to nearly 500 BTC per transfer, with multiple consecutive sends above $47 million each. The sequencing indicates coordinated offloading rather than isolated reallocations. Similarly, BlackRock’s IBIT vehicles executed a string of 300 BTC transfers repeatedly into the same exchange infrastructure, alongside other batches such as the 135.351 BTC movement captured in the logs. Each 300-BTC tranche reflects roughly $27–28 million in flow at recent prices. Analysts observing these flows reported that more than $3 billion in Bitcoin hit exchanges within just 45 minutes on November 20, one of the most aggressive sell-offs of the cycle. As institutional selling grows and his cycle model tracks prices closely, the market is adjusting expectations. Bitcoin could stay well above the next predicted levels, keeping attention on the path from $125,000 down to his $60,000 target. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: ETH price drops to 4-month low, but Ether futures data hints at $3.2K bounce

Time Published: 2025-11-21T22:00:00Z

ETH price fell to levels not seen since July, but compelling futures data could shed light on a silver lining. Is Ether headed toward $3,200? Key takeaways: ETH derivatives positioning shows large traders increasing long exposure as sentiment stabilizes despite ongoing weakness in broader risk markets. Public companies holding sizable ETH reserves continue to trade at discounts, signaling investors still lack conviction in a near-term recovery. Ether (ETH) faced a sharp 15% drop Wednesday to Friday, falling to $2,625, its lowest level since July. The move wiped out $460 million of leveraged ETH bullish positions in two days and extended the decline to 47% from the Aug. 24 all-time high. Demand from ETH bulls is still mostly absent in derivatives markets, although sentiment is slowly leaning toward a potential relief bounce to $3,200. The annualized funding rate on ETH perpetual futures settled near 6% on Friday, rising from 4% the previous week. Under balanced conditions, the indicator typically fluctuates 6% to 12% to cover the cost of capital. While still far from a bullish setup, ETH futures showed some resilience even as macroeconomic uncertainty increased. A University of Michigan survey shows that 69% of consumers now expect unemployment to rise in the year ahead, more than twice the level from a year ago. Joanne Hsu, the director of the consumer survey, reportedly said: “Cost-of-living concerns and income worries dominate consumer views of the economy across the country.” During an earnings call on Tuesday, Home Depot CEO Ted Decker said the company continues “to see softer engagement in larger discretionary projects,” mainly due to ongoing weakness in the housing market. Decker said that housing turnover as a share of total available supply has approached a 40-year low, while home prices have begun to adjust, according to Yahoo Finance. Part of Ether traders’ fading confidence stems from nine straight sessions of net outflows in spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Roughly $1.33 billion has exited those products during that stretch, driven in part by institutional investors reducing exposure to risk assets. The US dollar strengthened against major foreign currencies as concerns around the artificial intelligence sector grew. The US Dollar Index (DXY) climbed to its highest level in six months as investors sought the safety of cash holdings. It might seem counterintuitive, given the US economy’s heavy ties to the tech sector, but traders are simply holding reserves until there is clearer visibility on employment data and whether consumer demand will recover after the extended US government shutdown. Top traders at OKX increased their long positions even as Ether fell to $2,700 from $3,200 on Sunday. Confidence is gradually improving following strong quarterly earnings and year-end guidance from Nvidia (NVDA US), and after Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said he sees room for interest rate cuts in the near term as the labor market weakens. Related: BitMine announces 2026 ETH staking plans as market melts down The cryptocurrency bear market has been especially difficult for companies that built large ETH reserves through debt and equity issuance, such as BitMine Immersion (BMNR US) and ShapeLink Gaming (SBET US). Those stocks currently trade at discounts of 16% or more relative to their ETH holdings, highlighting investors’ lack of comfort. From a derivatives standpoint, whales and market makers are increasingly convinced that $2,650 marked the bottom. Still, bullish conviction likely hinges on renewed spot Ether ETF inflows and clearer signals of a less restrictive monetary policy, meaning Ether’s potential return to $3,200 may take a few weeks.

Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Ross Stores Climbs on Strong Earnings; Nvidia, Oracle, Broadcom Fall as AI Slump Persists

Shares of an off-price apparel retailer climbed after the company touted its success in the back-to-school season and issued a rosy outlook for the critical holiday quarter. Meanwhile, a database software firm remained under pressure as questions linger about its valuation and capacity to meet lofty targets. Major U.S. equities indexes bounced back Friday, clawing back losses posted in the prior session. The S&P 500 ended the final trading session of the week 0.9% higher. The Dow added 1.1%, while the Nasdaq rose 0.8%. See here for Investopedia's full wrap-up of Friday's major market moves. Shares of Ross Stores (ROST) surged 8.4% after the off-price apparel, footwear, and accessories retailer surpassed third-quarter sales and profit estimates. The company is the latest discount retailer to demonstrate it's benefiting from consumers' bargain-seeking. Ross highlighted strength in the back-to-school shopping season and raised its outlook, pointing to optimism about the crucial holiday period. Comments from John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, helped boost expectations that policymakers might cut interest rates in December. Rate-cut optimism boosted the stocks of companies exposed to the housing market, which stand to benefit from lower mortgage rates. Shares of residential construction materials supplier Builders FirstSource (BLDR) jumped 7.1%, while homebuilders D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN) also notched solid gains. Insulet (PODD) shares climbed 5.8% a day after the medical device maker held an investor day event. The manufacturer of continuous glucose monitoring devices provided a three-year sales and profit forecast that exceeded consensus expectations. Several research firms raised their price targets on Insulet stock following the event. Oracle (ORCL) shares tumbled 5.7%, extending their recent downtrend and suffering the heaviest decline of any S&P 500 stock Friday. The database software and cloud computing giant has been rattled recently by concerns about its elevated valuation and heavy borrowing tied to its data center investments. Following Friday's drop, the stock is down around 28% over the past month. Nvidia (NVDA) shares slid 1% as concerns about an AI bubble continued to weigh on high-flying tech stocks. Friday's decline extended the stock's 3% loss yesterday despite the AI chip giant blowing past estimates with its third-quarter earnings report. Nvidia's largest rivals, Broadcom (AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), shed 1.9% and 1.1%, respectively, on Friday. Nuclear power providers Vistra (VST) and Constellation Energy Corp. (CEG), whose stocks soared over the past year as they struck multi-billion dollar deals to power AI data centers, were also dogged by bubble fears. Their stocks fell a respective 3% and 2.2%.

Title: What's Going on With Oracle? Its Stock Price Has Dropped More Than 40% in Two Months.

Betting big on artificial intelligence is proving to be a double-edged sword. Shares of Oracle (ORCL), the almost-50 year-old software company turned AI play, rallied furiously during the summer as investor enthusiasm for what could be the next transformative technology surged. Lately the company's stock has given up much of those gains, down more than 40% from its all-time high in September, more than other related plays including Meta Platforms (META), Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), whose stocks declined at least 20% from their respective peaks. Now investors are looking at Oracle as the poster child for AI-related excess. Though concerns about AI valuations have been lingering for years, investors have recently started to pan stocks tied to the theme, weighing the amount companies are spending to develop the tech against the potential for future revenue. Oracle has come under increased scrutiny since it raised $18 billion in new debt last month to fund its infrastructure buildout, pushing its overall debt to over $100 billion. In January, Oracle announced that it was joining forces with ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Japanese tech giant Softbank on a $500 billion project, called Stargate, to develop AI infrastructure in the U.S. It's become increasingly difficult to view AI-related businesses in a vacuum, because of the relationships they've created between each other with multi-billion dollar deals. In that way Oracle's hurt could turn into pain for others. Oracle's quarterly earnings report in early September blew past Wall Street expectations, sending the stock soaring 36% in one day and briefly making co-founder and Executive Chairman Larry Ellison the world's richest person. A few weeks later, however, the company announced that longtime CEO Safra Catz would be replaced as CEO, and the stock has been declining ever since. Meanwhile, traders have started to pile into Oracle's credit-default swaps as a way to both hedge and bet against the AI trade, according to a recently published story by Bloomberg. Credit default swaps are derivative contracts that serve as a kind of insurance against the possibility that a borrower will default on its debt obligations. Consensus capital expenditures for AI hyperscalers, including Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL), Meta, Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle have risen to $533 billion now from $467 billion at the start of the third-quarter earnings season, according to Goldman Sachs. Oracle is also a major part of the web of deals between AI software makers, chip companies and cloud operators, whose circular deals—possibly indicating more self-dealing than representative of organic demand—have raised eyebrows. The Wall Street Journal reported that a large chunk of the outsize revenue backlog unveiled in its September earnings report was from an OpenAI deal. "The feedback loops created by the revenue and equity relationships between some of the largest U.S. public companies and smaller AI firms increase the risk that stress in one part of the AI ecosystem affects investors across the AI complex," Goldman analysts led by Ryan Hammond said in a report published earlier this week.

Betting big on artificial intelligence is proving to be a double-edged sword. Shares of Oracle (ORCL), the almost-50 year-old software company turned AI play, rallied furiously during the summer as investor enthusiasm for what could be the next transformative technology surged. Lately the company's stock has given up much of those gains, down more than 40% from its all-time high in September, more than other related plays including Meta Platforms (META), Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), whose stocks declined at least 20% from their respective peaks. Now investors are looking at Oracle as the poster child for AI-related excess. Though concerns about AI valuations have been lingering for years, investors have recently started to pan stocks tied to the theme, weighing the amount companies are spending to develop the tech against the potential for future revenue. Oracle has come under increased scrutiny since it raised $18 billion in new debt last month to fund its infrastructure buildout, pushing its overall debt to over $100 billion. In January, Oracle announced that it was joining forces with ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Japanese tech giant Softbank on a $500 billion project, called Stargate, to develop AI infrastructure in the U.S. It's become increasingly difficult to view AI-related businesses in a vacuum, because of the relationships they've created between each other with multi-billion dollar deals. In that way Oracle's hurt could turn into pain for others. Oracle's quarterly earnings report in early September blew past Wall Street expectations, sending the stock soaring 36% in one day and briefly making co-founder and Executive Chairman Larry Ellison the world's richest person. A few weeks later, however, the company announced that longtime CEO Safra Catz would be replaced as CEO, and the stock has been declining ever since. Meanwhile, traders have started to pile into Oracle's credit-default swaps as a way to both hedge and bet against the AI trade, according to a recently published story by Bloomberg. Credit default swaps are derivative contracts that serve as a kind of insurance against the possibility that a borrower will default on its debt obligations. Consensus capital expenditures for AI hyperscalers, including Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL), Meta, Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle have risen to $533 billion now from $467 billion at the start of the third-quarter earnings season, according to Goldman Sachs. Oracle is also a major part of the web of deals between AI software makers, chip companies and cloud operators, whose circular deals—possibly indicating more self-dealing than representative of organic demand—have raised eyebrows. The Wall Street Journal reported that a large chunk of the outsize revenue backlog unveiled in its September earnings report was from an OpenAI deal. "The feedback loops created by the revenue and equity relationships between some of the largest U.S. public companies and smaller AI firms increase the risk that stress in one part of the AI ecosystem affects investors across the AI complex," Goldman analysts led by Ryan Hammond said in a report published earlier this week.

Title: Why Nvidia’s Enduring Momentum Isn’t Easing A.I. Bubble Concerns

What a difference a day can make. Nvidia shares surged on Wednesday after the chip giant reported better-than-expected earnings and guidance, defying growing talk of an A.I. bubble and high-profile exits from investors like Peter Thiel. But just 24 hours later, Wall Street’s A.I. darling nosedived more than 3 percent yesterday (Nov. 20) as hopes for another interest rate cut this year faded following a hotter-than-expected September jobs report.

You can opt out anytime. Those renewed rate concerns, combined with lingering fears that A.I. stocks are dangerously overpriced, triggered a sharp market reversal. The Dow erased a 700-point gain to finish down 386 points yesterday, while the Nasdaq fell 486 points and the S&P 500 dropped 103. Nvidia reported total revenue of $57 billion for the August-October quarter, beating analysts’ expectations of $55 billion, with EPS of $1.30 versus the predicted $1.26. The company predicted that sales for the current quarter ending January should reach about $65 billion, above Wall Street’s consensus of $61.7 billion. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives praised the results, arguing they show the A.I. boom remains solid. He pointed to Nvidia’s $2 billion data-center revenue beat and strong demand for its upcoming Blackwell and Rubin chips. He reiterated his view that the A.I. build-out is still in its early stages, with tech giants—or “hyperscalers” such as Google, Meta and Microsoft—expected to spend between $550 billion and $600 billion next year to accelerate A.I. adoption. “The pure Nvidia numbers/guidance and strategic vision show the A.I. Revolution is NOT a Bubble…instead it’s Year 3 of a 10-year build out of this 4th Industrial Revolution in our view,” Ives said in a client note this week. Still, after Thiel sold his $100 million stake in Nvidia—joining other major sellers like SoftBank, which recently unwound $5.8 billion—some investors began to wonder whether Nvidia and the broader A.I. trade may be approaching a plateau. Concerns over lofty valuations have grown louder, particularly from famed short-seller Michael Burry, who has a $187 million short position against Nvidia. Burry has accused Oracle, Meta, Amazon and Google of understating depreciation for their A.I. infrastructure to inflate earnings through 2028. Joseph Schuster, CEO and founder of ETF operator IPOX Schuster, said recent selling looks more like profit-taking than a sign that an A.I. bubble is ready to burst. “The market is rotating, consolidating and digesting huge gains,” he told Observer, noting that investors are in a “risk-off market” for the rest of the year. “It doesn’t mean that something will burst or fall apart. It’s a normal part of the cycle.” Schuster doesn’t expect a dot-com-style correction and remains optimistic about the A.I.’s long-term fundamentals, but he said Nvidia and other big tech names could see more downside in the weeks ahead. Nvidia, specifically, could slip to the $165–$170 range, he said. Jane Edmondson, head of thematic strategy at ETF research firm VettaFI, agreed. “I have been in bubbles before, and it does seem different this time,” she told Observer. “I do feel like we are still very early days and only just now starting to see [A.I.] use cases that could be groundbreaking.” “If you look at Nvidia’s order books, they are very strong and Huang expects lots of business to come, and I agree with him,” she added. She rejected views that Nvidia’s price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 30x is unsustainable, saying, “I have never seen companies achieve this level of growth. It’s exponential.” As the market matures, Edmondson said, the winners and losers will become clearer. She expects firms with their own growth capital—such as Google, Meta and Alphabet—to emerge stronger than those that rely heavily on leverage.

Title: BTC ETF outflows are 'tactical rebalancing,' not institutional flight: Analysts

The outflows reflect short-term price movements, not lower institutional demand or structural issues in the Bitcoin market, analysts said. The record outflows from Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) represent short-term, “tactical” rebalancing rather than institutional flight from BTC, according to analysts at crypto exchange Bitfinex. Long-term Bitcoin (BTC) holders taking profit by selling their coins and highly leveraged positions flushing out of the markets are the root causes of the billions of dollars in ETF outflows and the broader market crash, Bitfinex analysts said. The uncertainty of a December interest rate cut has also shifted investors to a risk-off outlook, Bitfinex said. Bitfinex said the structural thesis for Bitcoin remains “firm,” and that Bitcoin is positioned for continued institutional adoption as a store-of-value asset with strong long-term fundamentals. The ongoing drawdown is a short-term price movement, they added. Related: BlackRock leads near $3B Bitcoin November ETF exodus with record $523M outflows Bitcoin ETF outflows have topped $3.7 billion in November, as losses from October’s crypto market crash extended, sparking investor fears of the beginning of a bear market. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF led the outflows, with over $2.47 billion in redemptions so far in November. The Bitcoin ETFs posted some of the worst daily outflows on record in November. Single-day outflows crossed $900 million on Thursday, according to Farside Investors. The average ETF investor is now underwater following BTC’s crash below $90,000. However, this does not mean that ETF investors will panic sell, Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at quantitative trading company Kronos Research, told Cointelegraph. Bitcoin ETF investors tend to be long-term holders and ignore short-term market noise and price movements, Liu said. Long-term Bitcoin whales and OGs who hold the asset directly rather than through an investment vehicle are responsible for most of the selling, according to senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.

Title: Amazon Ring Workers Ordered to Relocate Amid ‘AI-Powered’ Push

(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.’s Ring division has ordered hundreds of customer service workers to relocate to central hubs in the US and UK amid a companywide push to streamline and automate operations. The affected personnel, who have been working remotely, will have to report to offices in Hawthorne, California; North Reading, Massachusetts; Tempe, Arizona; or London, according to a memo sent earlier this month and reviewed by Bloomberg. Hundreds of workers will have to relocate to keep their jobs, according to two people familiar with the matter. In the memo, Amazon’s video doorbell unit said it was looking to transform the customer service department into a “proactive, AI-powered support ecosystem.” A subset of workers who deal directly with customers, along with their supervisors, can still work remotely, the memo said. The department also supports Amazon’s Blink camera and home security brand. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the relocation requirement and declined to comment further. In June, Amazon Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy warned that AI tools capable of performing human tasks would likely shrink the company’s workforce. Four months later, Amazon announced it was eliminating 14,000 corporate positions. The latest job cuts roiled a workforce already grappling with several previous rounds of layoffs and an order to return to the office five days a week. Some employees see the relocation and return-to-office policies as efforts to force people to quit without Amazon having to pay severance. The company denies that and estimated in October that severance costs had reached $2 billion this year as of Sept. 30. Ring’s relocation mandate will likely prompt a large number of customer-service staff to leave, according to one affected employee, who requested anonymity to avoid possible retaliation. Ring founder Jamie Siminoff returned to the company as CEO earlier this year and has made clear that AI will play an important role in its future. --With assistance from Matt Day.

CURRENCY OBSOLETE: Billionaire Elon Musk on Wednesday speculated money may become irrelevant in the future if current artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics innovations continue. SCANDAL SPIRAL: Former Treasury Secretary and Harvard President Larry Summers resigned from the board of OpenAI amid the fallout over his correspondence with disgraced late financier Jeffery Epstein.

PRIME USERS: The artificial intelligence-related layoffs sweeping corporate America could impact prime loan borrowers, Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski said. ROBOT NATION: Amazon is doubling down on artificial intelligence and robotics to remake work inside its warehouses and fulfillment centers, even as it cuts thousands of corporate roles and faces growing fears about machines replacing human workers. UNITED WE STAND: The artificial intelligence boom promises to be more eventful than the dawn of the internet. It will lead to a higher quality of life for everyone in the first country to achieve AI dominance. AI is already being harnessed for cancer detection and for developing self-driving vehicles that will lower traffic fatalities.

MILITARY SUPERIORITY: The Department of War is narrowing its research and development strategy to six "Critical Technology Areas" officials say will speed up innovation and strengthen America’s military edge. MISSING THE BOAT: Democrats in Washington are losing the AI conversation. Not because they are wrong about AI's risks, but because they have failed to offer Americans a vision for the economic transformation ahead. While they focus on managing problems, others are defining what comes next. One side is talking about building the future, the other about constraining it.

Title: Here’s why $110B stimulus in Japan is affecting Bitcoin and the crypto market
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/heres-why-110b-stimulus-in-japan-is-affecting-bitcoin-and-the-crypto-market/

Higher rates ahead? Could the U.S follow Japan’s path? Macro headwinds from rising debt, sticky inflation, and a strong labor market are fueling risk-off sentiment in the crypto market. Japan’s $110 billion stimulus and record 40-year bond yields are setting a precedent for the Fed. Macro-wise, the U.S economy feels all over the place right now. Take Nvidia’s [NVDA] earnings, for example – $200 billion in annualized returns should have been a major bullish catalyst. And yet, the market still sold off. However, it’s not just the crypto market. U.S equities also saw heavy losses. The S&P500, for instance, wiped out $2 trillion and Nvidia went from +6% to -3%, even after reporting $55 billion in a risk-off environment. In short, this market weakness has been driven by macro FUD. In fact, the bigger pressure seems to be coming out of East Asia, which in turn is shaping a blueprint for what could hit the crypto market next. Countries around the world are sitting on massive debt loads right now. However, Japan tops the chart. Its government debt-to-GDP ratio is around 230%, the highest globally. Put simply, Japan owes more than $2 for every $1 it produces, making it the most “indebted” country in the world. On top of that, Japan’s finance minister recently rolled out a $110 billion stimulus to combat inflation, which hit 3% in October. The plan is aimed at boosting buyer spending. The result? Japan’s 40-year bond yield surged to a record 3.77%. Source: TradingEconomics Notably, the impact of this move has investors turning bearish. Rising debt, paired with spiking government bond yields, is sucking capital out of risk assets. That leaves the Bank of Japan stuck. Cut rates and you risk fueling inflation, hold steady and markets stay under pressure. Right now, 53% of participants are betting on a rate hike at December’s BOJ meeting. And, the market is already pricing in potential moves. At the same time, Japan’s moves are setting a benchmark for the Federal Reserve, putting extra pressure on the crypto market. President Trump’s recent stimulus plan is drawing increasing scrutiny as well. A few days ago, he proposed a $2,000 payout for every household below the “high-income” bracket. At the same time, U.S. deficit spending added $619 billion during the 43-day government shutdown. Put simply, the U.S is heading deeper into a debt spiral. Analysts now expect total debt to hit $40 trillion by 2026, with the debt-to-GDP ratio already back to 124%, putting the Fed under serious pressure. Source: ZeroHedge And, it doesn’t stop there. The U.S. economy is wrestling with a data blackout, an AI-driven “bubble burst” and inflation stuck above the Fed’s 2% target. And when you stack it all up, the crypto market’s Q4 crash looks more macro-driven than ever. In this context, Japan’s latest blowout is sending a strong signal for U.S markets. Rising debt could push for a rate cut, but with inflation still hot and the labor market strong, that’s looking less likely. This will only add pressure on the crypto market heading into 2026.

Title: Bitcoin rout continues as crypto treasuries face reckoning: Finance Redefined

Growing unrealized losses and falling NAV levels are threatening corporate crypto treasuries, making it difficult to raise capital for future digital asset investments. Cryptocurrency markets continued their decline for a fourth consecutive week this week, raising concerns over the status of the bull market cycle. Investor concerns grew on Thursday after a 10X Research report revealed that BitMine Immersion Technologies, the world’s largest corporate Ether (ETH) holder, is sitting on a cumulative unrealized loss of $3.7 billion on its total holdings. Most digital asset treasuries (DATs) have suffered declines in their net asset value (NAV), making it difficult to raise funds for new investments or to attract new retail investors, leaving existing shareholders “trapped” with growing paper losses, according to 10x Research founder Markus Thiele DATs are also facing significant pressure from the MSCI stock market index, which is considering excluding corporate crypto treasuries with a balance sheet comprising more than 50% of crypto assets. The consultation is open until Dec. 31, with the results set to be made public on Jan. 15, 2026. The resulting changes will take effect in February. Elsewhere, Bitcoin (BTC) sank to a six-month low of $82,000 on Friday, a level last seen in April when the markets were recovering from US President Donald Trump’s Liberation Day tariff announcement, TradingView data shows. Concerns are mounting over the sustainability of corporate crypto-treasury firms as BlackRock moves forward with a staked Ether fund that analysts say could compete directly with existing digital-asset treasuries. BitMine Immersion Technologies, the world’s largest corporate Ether holder, is currently down $1,000 per purchased ETH, implying a cumulative unrealized loss of $3.7 billion on its total holdings, according to a Thursday research report from crypto insights company 10x Research. The decline in net asset value (NAV) across these firms is making it difficult to attract new retail investors while leaving many existing shareholders effectively “trapped” unless they sell at a steep loss, 10x Research founder Markus Thielen wrote in a LinkedIn post. “When the premium inevitably shrinks to zero, as it is doing now, investors find themselves trapped in the structure, unable to get out without significant damage, a true Hotel California scenario,” he said. He added that, unlike exchange-traded funds (ETFs), digital-asset treasury companies, or DATs, “layer on complex, opaque, and often hedge-fund-like fee structures that can quietly erode returns.” The mNAV ratio compares a company’s enterprise value to the value of its crypto holdings. An mNAV above 1 allows a company to raise funds by issuing new shares to accumulate digital assets. Values below 1 make it much harder to expand capital and holdings. BitMine’s basic mNAV stood at 0.77 while its diluted mNAV stood at 0.92, according to data from Bitminetracker. Continue reading The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s Crypto Task Force has scheduled a roundtable discussion centered on privacy and financial surveillance for December, as a renewed focus on privacy grips the cryptocurrency industry. The privacy roundtable is slated for Dec. 15. Like other SEC roundtables, crypto industry executives and SEC officials will discuss common pain points and solutions, but no hard policy proposals will be submitted. Privacy has become a hot-button topic following several developments, including the partial guilty verdict in Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm’s trial in June, the Samourai Wallet developer sentencing in November and the privacy token price rally over the last two months. “Authoritarians thrive when people have no privacy. When those in charge start being hostile to privacy protections, it is a major red flag,” said Naomi Brockwell, founder of the Ludlow Institute, an organization advocating for liberty through technology. The renewed interest in privacy hearkens back to crypto’s cypherpunk roots, and one of the core reasons the cryptographic technology that underpins crypto was invented — to ensure secure communication channels between parties in hostile environments. Continue reading Coinbase has launched Ether-backed loans for US users, allowing customers to borrow USDC against their ETH holdings without selling, in a new offering powered by Morpho and running on Base. The exchange said the product is available across most US states, except New York, with variable rates and liquidation risk tied to market conditions. Users can borrow up to $1 million in USDC (USDC) stablecoin. Coinbase plans to expand the program to other assets, including loans backed by its staked Ether token, cbETH. The new product is being launched in collaboration with Morpho, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol. In September, Coinbase integrated Morpho into the Coinbase app, offering users a yield of up to 10.8% on their USDC holdings. According to Dune data, Coinbase’s onchain lending markets have processed more than $1.25 billion in loan originations, backed by about $1.37 billion in deposited collateral. Roughly $810 million in loans is outstanding, with more than 13,500 wallets holding active borrow positions. Continue reading The DeFi Education Fund, an advocacy organization focused on decentralized finance, has proposed utilizing the technology to reduce costs, aiming to address poverty in the United States and globally. In a Wednesday blog post, the group said DeFi infrastructure could potentially save unbanked and underbanked people around the world about $30 billion annually by reducing remittance costs. The organization cited examples of workers sending funds home and paying fees to do so, which could be reduced “by up to 80%” with DeFi. “The poverty premium [the expenses incurred by low-income households that wealthier individuals are often able to access at a lower cost] persists because the current, layered, antiquated financial infrastructure makes it expensive to serve low-income customers profitably,” said the DeFi Education Fund, adding: “Nothing is free, and DeFi doesn’t eliminate costs entirely, but by removing intermediaries and leveraging software rather than outdated financial systems, we can dramatically reduce the cost of financial services for everyday people and give them greater control of their finances.” Many advocates have proposed utilizing various applications of blockchain technology to address factors that contribute to poverty, such as reducing transaction times, eliminating or reducing fees, and increasing access to financial services. The DeFi Education Fund cited the increasing costs in the US associated with cashing paychecks without a bank account, using money orders and owning a home. Continue reading Mastercard is expanding its Crypto Credential program to self-custody wallets, allowing users to send and receive cryptocurrencies using verified, username-style aliases instead of long wallet addresses. Polygon will be the first blockchain to support the rollout, while payments firm Mercuryo will handle identity verification and issue the aliases to users, according to a Tuesday press release shared with Cointelegraph. “By streamlining wallet addresses and adding meaningful verification, Mastercard Crypto Credential is building trust in digital token transfers,” said Raj Dhamodharan, executive vice president of blockchain and digital assets at Mastercard. Once verified by Mercuryo, users can link a human-readable alias to their self-custody wallet or request a soulbound token on Polygon that proves the wallet belongs to a verified individual.

Title: Why crypto's having a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad month

Crypto's having a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad month, and it could get worse before it gets better, experts said. Cryptocurrencies have cratered this month, losing more than $1 trillion in value in recent weeks. Bitcoin's dropped to the lowest level since April and is on track for its worst month since 2022. It's down more than 33% from its all-time high above $126,000 in early October, which officially pushes the digital unit into bear market territory defined as at least 20% lower than the record high. Bitcoin's now down about 10% this year, and likely will see more selling which could mean its first annual loss since 2022, experts said. At 1:29 p.m. ET, Bitcoin was down 3.18% at $83,776.81. "It seems early in the selloff process," said Hyunsu Jung, chief executive of publicly traded crypto-treasury company Hyperion DeFi. A whirlwind of factors have contributed to crypto's downfall, analysts said. Cryptocurrency tends to trade in line with the riskier growth stocks like in artficial intelligence and technology, which also have been battered lately amid high valuation worries and an uncertain economy. "It would be difficult to attribute selling to a single factor," Jung said. "The current state of the market is risk assets across equities and crypto both seeing pullbacks - due to multiple factors such as: potential exhaustion of the AI trade." Global interest rate uncertainty and moves to cash by corporate digital asset treasuries and other large crypto holders like investment firm Blackrock are also weighing on crypto, Jung said. That initial sell-off pushed cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin through several technical support levels on price charts that triggered a cascade of sales among trend followers, exacerbating the decline. Specifically, key signals that prompted more selling according to Tom Essaye, founder and president of Sevens Report Research, include: The sharp decline could force even more sales, some analysts warned. It's "reawakened concerns about a further wave of forced selling, amid worries that retail investors might need to liquidate other assets to meet margin calls," Deutsche Bank economist Jim Reid said. A margin call is when a brokerage demands an investor deposit more money or securities to cover a shortfall that happens amid a sharp price decline. Once the dust settles - and no one can say yet when that might be - investors with iron stomachs may want to tip toe in, some experts said. After sifting through corporate 13Fs, or a required Securities and Exchange Commission form for institutional investment managers who oversee at least $100 million in assets under management, LPL Financial's portfolio strategist George Smith found "a large increase in cryptocurrency-related products and blockchain mining firms (underscoring) the growing institutional appetite for digital assets." That could bode well for cryptocurrency because institutional investors are often considered "smart money." Again,"no one should ever invest beyond their risk tolerance," said David Namdar, chief executive of CEA Industries, the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency Binance Coin. "But historically, moments like this, when sentiment is low and volatility is high, have often been where long-term value is created. Anyone considering an investment should think in years, not days, and should understand the asset’s inherent volatility." Medora Lee is a money, markets and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

Title: Layoffs are piling up, raising worker anxiety. Here are some companies that have cut jobs recently

Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Legal Notices, EEO Report, Ad Choices, Public Inspection File Contact, KWTV Public Inspection File, KSBI Public Inspection File, Closed Captioning Assistance, FCC Applications, VPAT (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template) It’s a tough time to be looking for a job. Amid wider economic uncertainty, some analysts have said that businesses are at a “no-hire, no fire” standstill. That’s caused many to limit new work to only a few specific roles, if not pause openings entirely. At the same time, sizable layoffs have continued to pile up — raising worker anxieties across sectors. Some companies have pointed to rising operational costs spanning from President Donald Trump’s barrage of new tariffs and shifts in consumer spending. Others cite corporate restructuring more broadly — or, as seen with big names like Amazon, are redirecting money to artificial intelligence. Federal employees have encountered additional doses of uncertainty, impacting worker sentiment around the job market overall. Shortly after Trump returned to office at the start of the year, federal jobs were cut by the thousands. And the record 43-day government shutdown also left many to work without paychecks. The impasse put key economic data on hold, too. In a delayed report released Thursday, the Labor Department said U.S. employers added a surprising 119,000 jobs in September. But unemployment rose to 4.4% — and other troubling details emerged, including revisions showing the economy actually lost 4,000 jobs in August. There’s also growing gender and racial disparities. The National Women’s Law Center notes women only accounted for 21,000 of September’s added jobs — and that Black women over the age of 20, in particular, saw unemployment climb to 7.5% for the month. The shutdown has left holes in more recent hiring numbers. The government says it won’t release a full jobs report for October. Here are some of the largest job cuts announced recently: In November, Verizon began laying off more than 13,000 employees. In a staff memo announcing the cuts, CEO Dan Schulman said that the telecommunications giant needed to simplify operations and “reorient” the entire company. General Motors moved to lay off about 1,700 workers across manufacturing sites in Michigan and Ohio in late October, as the auto giant adjusts to slowing demand for electric vehicles. Hundreds of additional employees are reportedly slated for “temporary layoffs” at the start of next year. In long-awaited cuts just months after completing its $8 billion merger with Skydance, Paramount plans to lay off about 2,000 employees — about 10% of its workforce. Paramount initiated roughly 1,000 of those layoffs in late October, according to a source familiar with the matter. In November, Paramount also announced plans to eliminate 1,600 positions as part of divestitures of Televisión Federal in Argentina and Chilevision in Chile. And the company said another 600 employees had chosen voluntary severance packages as part of a coming push to return to the office full-time. Amazon said last month that it will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs, close to 4% of its workforce, as the online retail giant ramps up spending on AI while trimming costs elsewhere. A letter to employees said most workers would be given 90 days to look for a new position internally. United Parcel Service has disclosed about 48,000 job cuts this year as part of turnaround efforts, which arrive amid wider shifts in the company’s shipping outputs. UPS also closed daily operations at 93 leased and owned buildings during the first nine months of this year. Target in October moved to eliminate about 1,800 corporate positions, or about 8% of its corporate workforce globally. The retailer said the cuts were part of wider streamlining efforts. In mid-October, Nestlé said it would be cutting 16,000 jobs globally — as part of wider cost cutting aimed at reviving its financial performance amid headwinds like rising commodity costs and U.S. imposed tariffs. The Swiss food giant said the layoffs would take place over the next two years. In September, Lufthansa Group said it would shed 4,000 jobs by 2030 — pointing to the adoption of artificial intelligence, digitalization and consolidating work among member airlines. Also in September, Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk said it would cut 9,000 jobs, about 11% of its workforce. The company — which makes drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy — said the layoffs were part of wider restructuring, as it works to sell more obesity and diabetes medications amid rising competition. Oil giant ConocoPhillips announced plans in September to lay off up to a quarter of its workforce, as part of broader efforts from the company to cut costs. Between 2,600 and 3,250 workers were expected to be impacted, with most layoffs set to take place before the end of 2025. Intel has moved to shed thousands of jobs — with the struggling chipmaker working to revive its business. In July, CEO Lip-Bu Tan said Intel expected to end the year with 75,000 “core” workers, excluding subsidiaries, through layoffs and attrition. That’s down from 99,500 core employees reported the end of last year. The company previously announced a 15% workforce reduction. In May, Microsoft began laying off about 6,000 workers across its workforce. And just months later, the tech giant said it would be cutting 9,000 positions — marking its biggest round of layoffs seen in more than two years. The company has cited “organizational changes,” but the labor reductions also arrive as the company spends heavily on AI. In June, Procter & Gamble said it would cut up to 7,000 jobs over the next two years, 6% of the company’s global workforce. The maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers said the cuts were part of a wider restructuring — also arriving amid tariff pressures. © 2025 Griffin Media.

Despite Nvidia Corp. reporting blockbuster fiscal third-quarter earnings that easily surpassed consensus estimates, the market's reaction demonstrated that valuation concerns and uncertainty about the sustainability of the AI boom continue to hold investor sentiment firmly in bearish territory. The chipmaker, whose graphics processing units are the essential bedrock of the current AI revolution, reported revenue of $57 billion late Wednesday, exceeding expectations and issuing similarly robust guidance for the current period, projecting fourth-quarter sales of $65 billion. The results, fueled by seemingly insatiable demand from hyperscalers like Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft, should have ignited a sector-wide rally. Instead, the surge proved short-lived. Nvidia’s stock, which initially jumped in after-hours trading and opened sharply higher on Thursday, rapidly reversed course, closing the session down approximately 3.15%. The dramatic reversal in the market’s AI bellwether dragged the entire technology sector down with it, contributing to a 2.2% plunge for the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index that day. The week’s action was a stark manifestation of a broader debate raging among institutional investors: whether the multi-year AI rally has inflated into a speculative bubble. This skepticism is evidenced by a noticeable market rotation into defensive sectors. Throughout November, professional fund managers have been moving capital out of high-growth technology and AI-adjacent stocks and into sectors like healthcare, which have substantially outperformed the broader market. Tech, meanwhile, has been the S&P 500’s worst-performing sector this month. Other key AI infrastructure plays followed Nvidia’s slide. Rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) slumped nearly 8%, and other chipmakers contributed to the sell-off, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index declining nearly 5% on Thursday. The bearish sentiment was particularly painful for pure-play AI software vendors, many of which lack the established cash flows and diverse revenue streams of the Big Tech titans. C3.ai Inc. (AI), a prominent enterprise AI application provider, saw its stock price decline over the five-day period, underscoring the vulnerability of companies whose entire valuation rests on the promise of rapidly scaling AI revenue. The stock began the week trading around $13.44 per share but retreated steadily and was down 5% over the past five days, according to Yahoo Finance. This decline means C3.ai's shares are down more than 26% in the past month, a sign that investors are reassessing the risk associated with its current business model ahead of its December earnings report. The company faces stiff competition from major cloud providers now aggressively pushing their own AI platforms, and concerns remain regarding the long path to profitability for enterprise AI solutions. The divergence between Nvidia’s underlying business strength and the stock market’s lukewarm reception illustrates that while the AI revolution is undoubtedly real, investors are no longer willing to underwrite the sector’s current valuations without clearer signs of sustained, broad-based commercialization—outside of the largest cloud and chip companies.

Title: Want $4,000 per Year in Monthly Passive Income? Invest Just $2,500 in These Yield-Heavy Dividend Stocks

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Panchenko Vladimir / Shutterstock.com It would be an impressive feat to generate $4,000 in yearly passive income with just $12,500 in your account. Yet, it’s actually possible if you invest $2,500 into five carefully chosen stocks or exchange traded funds (ETFs). Not only that, but you could get paid cash distributions every month and possibly even every week. The plan is to own high-yield stocks that represent profitable businesses which pay monthly dividends. Also, you can own some ETFs offering big yields and frequent cash payouts. Allocating $2,500 toward the five assets on today’s list means you’d be investing $12,500 in total. It’s possible to earn $4,000 per year in dividends/distributions is you achieve an average yield of at least $4,000 / $12,500 or 32%. Sure, that’s ambitious and these five stocks/ETFs carry some risk; for example, any of the annual yields might get cut. On the other hand, you could become a passive income overachiever simply by holding five assets, so let’s start off with two high-paying stock picks. We’ll begin with Oxford Square Capital Corp. (NASDAQ:OXSQ), a business development company mainly specializing in bank loans and collateralized loan obligations (CLOs). Since Oxford Square Capital Corp. sends out its cash dividends on a monthly basis, you can take advantage of frequent reinvestment and compounding opportunities. It’s smart to focus on income-positive businesses in order to mitigate your overall risk level. As it turns out, Oxford Square Capital Corp. is income-positive as it reported roughly $5.56 million of third-quarter 2025 net investment income. At the moment, Oxford Square Capital Corp. offers a 22.46% forward annual dividend yield. This doesn’t measure up to our objective of achieving an average yield of at least 32%. Nevertheless, buying $2,500 worth of OXSQ stock is a good start as we’ll raise the average yield later with some mega-yield ETFs. Another stock you could invest $2,500 into is Orchid Island Capital (NYSE:ORC). This company is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that concentrates on U.S.-based residential mortgage-backed securities. Like Oxford Square Capital Corp., Orchid Island Capital pays dividends every month. Furthermore, Orchid Island Capital is a profitable business enterprise, having recorded $72.08 million in Q3 2025 net income. Being income-positive implies, more or less, that these companies should be able to continue paying monthly cash dividends. Currently, Orchid Island Capital stock investors can expect a 20.14% forward annual dividend yield. We’re still below our 32% average yield target, but there’s no need to fret as I’ve got a three-pack of ETFs that could bring massive payouts. To raise the bar in terms of overall annual yield, you could invest $2,500 into three funds from Roundhill. These ETFs all pay distributions on a weekly basis, so you can continue to receive cash payments every month or even more often than that. To provide a simplified explanation, the following Roundhill ETFs trade shares of a well-known stock as well as a type of derivatives known as swaps. This typically raises the risk level but also enables substantial income-generation opportunities. First, we have the Roundhill AMZN WeeklyPay ETF (CBOE:AMZW), which trades shares and swaps to indirectly extract income from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock. Unlike a direct investment in Amazon stock, you’ll receive weekly cash distributions if you hold AMZW shares. Clarifying the fund’s objective, Roundhill explains that the AMZW ETF targets “enhanced returns corresponding to 120% of” the weekly performance of AMZN stock. The expected annual distribution rate of the Roundhill AMZN WeeklyPay ETF is quite hefty at 37.57%. Next up is the Roundhill TSLA WeeklyPay ETF (CBOE:TSLW), which uses similar trading strategies to indirectly derive income from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock. In particular, the TSLW ETF aims for “enhanced returns corresponding to 120% of” the weekly performance of TSLA stock. There’s risk involved as the share price of the Roundhill TSLA WeeklyPay ETF may be volatile. However, it’s hard to resist the fund’s massive 53.28% annual distribution rate, no doubt. Then there’s the Roundhill AVGO WeeklyPay ETF (CBOE:AVGW), which attempts to achieve similar results with Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock. Again, the share-price volatility risk shouldn’t be overlooked, but the AVGW ETF’s gigantic 54.68% distribution rate makes it a worthwhile addition to this list. So, have we reached or objective of a 32% or higher average annual yield? To fond out, we just need to add up the expected yields of OXSQ, ORC, AMZW, TSLW, and AVGW and then divide the total by five. The result is a 37.63% average annual yield between these five stocks/ETFs. Thus, we’ve put together a plan to earn at least $4,000 per year in dividends/distributions (assuming there are no yield cuts) with monthly or even weekly cash payments to your account.

Title: Tech Stocks That Are Down Today: AMD, Palo Alto Networks, DataDog and Micron Technology

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © alexgo.photography / Shutterstock.com After yesterday’s debacle in which approximately $1 trillion in market capitalization was erased from the stock market, some technology stocks are still hunting a bottom. With the Nasdaq Composite now down 3% for the month of November so far, the AI rally has lost its steam for the time being as the markets wrestle with bullish fundamentals overshadowed by negative headlines. While the selling hasn’t been pretty for the bulls, it does not appear to be over, at least not yet. The following technology stocks – Micron Technology (Nasdaq: MU), Data Dog (Nasdaq: DDOG), Advanced Micro Devices (Nasdaq: AMD) and Palo Alto Networks (Nasdaq: PANW) – are heading lower today in a most volatile time to be invested in the U.S. stock market. After sinking as much as 11% in Thursday’s market sell-off, and even dipping below the psychologically sensitive $200 threshold, the bottom has seemingly fallen out in the stock. Today MU stock is down another 3.6%. Investors have been spooked by Micron’s aggressive AI capex plans in which management conceded that its $18 billion plan would face headwinds. Investors are having to get used to these massive balance sheets committed massive amounts of capital to stay in the AI race. Also, profit taking is normal with a stock that has run up over 100% year-to-date. Rosenblatt has a whopping $300 price target on the stock, owing to its massive total addressable market and leaving room for plenty of upside potential. Morgan Stanley analysts are targeting a very bullish $325 stock price with an “overweight” rating. Therefore investors might look to any pullback in the stock as a potentially strategic buying opportunity but not for the faint of heart. After spiraling by 9.5% on Thursday, Datadog is widening its losses today, falling 3.4% as of mid-morning trading. After nearing the $200 level in November, Datadog has taken a step backwards, threatening to fall below the $150-per-share level in recent days. Year-to-date, the stock is up 8.2%, and Wall Street analysts are bullish with an average price target of $218 attached. With OpenAI integration a bullish sign, today’s declines may be technical in nature, as there is no apparent negative catalyst, but the declines are still hitting investor portfolios hard. After losing 7.8% in Thursday’s market downturn, Advanced Micro Devices stock can’t get out of its own way. AMD stock has now dipped below the $200 level, falling a steep 4% in today’s session. AMD clinched its latest all-time high last month when it rose as high as $264 per share, and investors may be taking profits off the table. AMD also has a spot in the coveted OpenAI club, having clinched a recent partnership with the maker of ChatGPT. The consensus is that the stock is worth close to $300 per share, but the ride up is likely going to be bumpy. After falling 7.4% yesterday, Palo Alto Networks is down a further 1.2% today. The cybersecurity company reported earnings and suffered a downgrade by HSBC, which lowered its view on the stock from “hold” to “reduce” with a price target of $157. PANW announced a merger in which it is buying a cloud-management company in a $3.3 billion transaction, which as the buyer could also be weighing on the stock.

Title: Amazon layoffs: Tech giant’s mega job-cut drive eliminated this one specific role the most, data shows

Amazon had in October announced that it will lay off 14,000 corporate employees. The Amazon layoffs, its largest in three years, have affected every part of the company's businesses — rom cloud computing and devices to advertising, retail and grocery stores. However, one job category saw the most impact — engineers. According to a report by CNBC citing documents filed in New York, California, New Jersey and Washington, about 40% of the nearly 4,700 job cuts in these places were engineering roles. Amazon, which joined several other big tech companies in announcing major layoffs, reported the data in Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification, or WARN, filings to state agencies. The filings, which represent a segment of the data, show that the Amazon layoffs in October impacted a mix of software engineer levels. However, SDE II roles, or mid-level employees, were affected disproportionately. This comes despite human resources chief Beth Galetti said in her memo announcing the Amazon layoffs mentioned that the company now specifically needs engineers as it moves on to manage work with fewer people. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before,” Galetti wrote. “We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business,” she added. According to the report by CNBC quoting WARN data, over 500 product managers and program managers were laid off after the October announcement, representing more than 10% of the total job cuts. Senior manager and principal level roles were also eliminated as part of the layoffs at Amazon. Amazon had in October announced that it will cut 14,000 job roles across divisions. The corporate workforce of Amazon comprises about 350,000 personnel, meaning the 14,000 cuts announced in October represent about 4% of that headcount. “The reductions we're sharing today are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we're investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers' current and future needs,” Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, had said in a blog post. CEO Andy Jassy had repeatedly said he was determined to cut management layers and ease bureaucracy that began afflicting Amazon after a pandemic-era hiring binge.

Title: Here’s why Wall Street is starting to place bets on BofA’s famously risk-averse CEO

After Bank America’s first investor day in 14 years, CEO Brian Moynihan is privately declaring victory. For a change, he may have a point. Yes, we’ve been tough on Moynihan on these pages, pointing out how he has shied away from taking calculated risk – a prerequisite for banking and finance – and leaving BofA shares to languish as an also-ran on Wall Street during his long tenure as CEO. But based on some numbers I’ve been crunching following his big shindig two weeks ago, Moynihan is right to do some chest pounding – so far only in private – after he pitched the bank’s evolving business model to investors and analysts. Wall Street sources tell me investors liked what they heard that day from a CEO who until maybe now, has never made the sale about why they should hold stock in the nation’s second-largest bank as opposed to shares of Jamie Dimon’s JPMorgan, the nation’s biggest bank. True Dimon is considered the world’s best banker for many reasons including JPM stock price and his own voluble personality. Moynihan, 66, has always been an odd fit in a business dominated by dealmakers and risk takers, like Dimon. His lawyerly temperament is one of caution. He cut his managerial teeth as general counsel of Fleet Boston, which was among the multitude of acquisitions that led to the creation of the modern BofA. He took over as CEO in 2010 after the financial crisis nearly caused BofA to collapse. He did a good job pulling BofA off the mat (its shares traded as low as $3), attracting investor cash from the likes of Warren Buffett and scaling back risk. His problem, critics say, is that he never evolved the bank’s business model. It’s the reason why BofA shares have lagged JPMorgan and all of the Big 6 banks. Investor day was supposed to mark a shift, with Moynihan and a slew of top executives explaining how the bank is now dedicated to producing “responsible growth,” meaning it’s risk-on at BofA – albeit within Moynihanian limits. As of press time, it seems to have worked. Shares are down since the Nov. 5 presentation, but not as much as the markets (correcting due to tech fears) and, more importantly, Moynihan’s key competitors JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo. Since then, 20 analysts have raised their price targets on BofA shares. I am told that Morgan Stanley lists its stock as its top big bank pick with a price target of $70; it’s currently trading around $50 a share. We weren’t alone tweaking Moynihan as his stock fell around 2% during the festivities. But after the market closed, something interesting happened: While the CEO was on stage answering questions with the executives slated to take his job when he retires in a few years – CFO Alastair Borthwick, Jim DeMare, head of global markets and Dean Athanasia, head of regional banking – shares began to rise in after-hours trading, largely recovering their losses for the day. “We appreciate the positive reaction from investors,” a Bofa spokesman tells On The Money. The day gave our leadership team a chance to comprehensively tell the story of our franchise, how we are growing each of our businesses, and the opportunities for growth in the future.” Sign up to receive On The Money by Charlie Gasparino in your inbox every Thursday.

Of course you can’t erase more than a decade of malaise with just one investor day. If Moynihan’s plan doesn’t lead to better earnings growth, if it fails to meet its all important “return on tangible equity ratio” goal (bank analysts use this number for assessing performance) of 18%, and if it doesn’t improve its stock price, Moynihan’s planned retirement in five years might be expedited. If the progress of the past two weeks is sustained, who knows? He might stay longer. Advertisement

Title: The impact of migrant work experience on rural households’ participation in digital finance: Evidence from China

Currently, the development of digital finance in China’s rural areas remains in its early stages. The proportion of rural households participating in digital finance and the types of participation are relatively low. This hinders the realization of digital finance’s inclusive effects. This paper examines the influence of migrant work experience on participation in digital financial of rural households using data from the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS). The findings suggest that migrant work experience significantly increases the probability of rural households’ digital financial participation and increases the breadth of participation. Heterogeneity analysis finds that migrant work experience promotes digital financial participation more for rural households with migrant formal work experience, migrant entrepreneurial experience, completion of compulsory education, and long-tail groups. Mechanism analysis finds that migrant work experience can influence rural households’ digital financial participation by improving their financial literacy and broadening their social networks.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Along with the rapid development of information and communication technologies such as the Internet and big data, finance has combined with them to form a new financial business model. Compared to traditional finance, digital finance significantly lowers the barriers to financial services and transaction costs while expanding the reach of financial products [1]. Digital finance provides financial services to underserved populations globally to promote their consumption [2], entrepreneurship [3,4], household welfare [5], and regional economic development [6]. Especially for rural areas beyond the reach of traditional finance, digital finance breaks the geographical limitation of financial services, alleviates financial exclusion and poverty in remote rural areas, and becomes an important way to promote the development of inclusive finance [7,8]. Family digital finance participation refers to the use of digital financial tools such as digital payments, digital wealth management, and digital lending by households. Despite the many benefits of digital finance, the participation rate of Chinese rural households in digital finance is generally low [9]. 2017 China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) data show that the proportion of rural households participating in digital finance was only 20.96% [10]. 2019 Rural survey data from four Chinese provinces show that less than 20% of rural households use more than two digital financial products [11]. 2021 Data from the China Rural Economy and Rural Finance Survey (CRERFS) similarly show that the average number of rural households using three types of digital finance is only 1.025 [12]. In fact, the use of digital finance puts forward higher requirements for farmers’ digital skills and financial knowledge, which makes rural residents with backward economy and low average education level more likely to be excluded [13]. The ability of rural households to participate in digital finance is key to enabling rural households to enjoy the dividends of digital experience development, and improving the well-being of rural residents. Therefore, research on the factors influencing rural households’ digital financial participation has recently attracted increasing attention from scholars and policymakers in developing countries. Existing literature has primarily examined rural households’ participation in digital finance from perspectives including personal financial literacy [14], ICT usage [9], e-commerce adoption [15], regional digital financial development [16], regional network infrastructure [17], and regional pandemic situations [18]. Economists have accumulated a large body of evidence that an individual’s early experiences can have a significant impact on later behavioral decisions. Studies by sociologists and psychologists have found that an individual’s early experiences can have an impact on later decision-making and behavioral competencies [19,20]. First, early experiences have a profound effect on an individual’s later decisions. For example, a manager’s experience can have an impact on his or her later managerial decisions in the firm. CEOs’ international work experience leads to higher compensation [21]. Firms whose CEOs experienced the Chinese famine early in their careers experienced lower stock price declines than firms that did not [22]. Second, early experiences can influence an individual’s ability to behave later in life. For example, work experience can promote pro-social behavior in adolescents [23]. Early grassroots work experience for tax officials enhances their ability to serve as Chinese officials later in life [24]. As one of the significant life experiences for farmers, migration work experience inevitably exerts a considerable influence on their decision-making. However, no literature has yet explored this phenomenon. This paper makes the following key contributions. First, it explores the impact of migrant work experience on rural households’ participation in digital finance, thereby enriching the research perspective. Second, it reveals the underlying mechanisms through which migrant work experience influences rural households’ digital finance participation, deepening our understanding of the intrinsic link between migrant work experience and digital finance engagement. Finally, it examines the heterogeneous effects of migrant workers’ work experience on rural households’ digital finance behaviors, providing insights for developing differentiated policies to enhance rural digital finance participation. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 provides a theoretical analysis of the impact of migrants’ work experience on the financial vulnerability of rural households and formulates the research hypotheses. Section 3 presents the data, models, and variables used in the empirical study. Section 4 reports the baseline results, robustness tests, and heterogeneity analysis results of the empirical study. Section 5 presents the results of mechanism analysis. Section 6 presents the conclusions and corresponding policy recommendations. Under the influence of urban human capital externalities, migrant workers subconsciously mimic and learn from high-skilled individuals, achieving complementary advantages in skills and resources. This enhances their income, cognitive and non-cognitive abilities, and accumulates human capital, ultimately making their labor experience a key event in their lives. This migrant work experience forms a special kind of memory imprint that retains previous psycho-cognitive patterns and behavioral habits even after the labor force returns home, and has a profound impact on the family’s economic behavioral decisions. It has been shown that migrant work experience positively contributes to farmers’ economic capital, human capital, social capital, and visionary attitudes [25,26], thereby contributing to rural households’ participation in digital finance. Therefore, this article proposes the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 1: Migrant work experience can facilitate rural households’ participation in digital finance. Migrant work experience can facilitate rural households’ participation in digital finance by increasing their level of financial literacy. Financial literacy, as a vital form of human capital, effectively promotes household participation in digital finance by enhancing families’ understanding of financial products and decision-making capabilities [27,28]. After migrating to economically developed cities for work, farmers gain significantly increased access to financial institutions and products such as banks, securities, credit cards, and funds. This exposure continuously broadens their financial horizons and market awareness, ultimately fostering the accumulation of financial knowledge [29]. Moreover, migrant work contributes to increased household income. As earnings rise, farmers develop greater needs for wealth management and asset appreciation, thereby motivating them to proactively acquire financial knowledge [30]. This, in turn, enhances their ability to manage household finances and preserve or grow their assets. The experience of migrant work can facilitate rural households’ participation in digital finance by broadening their social networks. Social networks, as an important informal system, can establish a demonstration effect of rural households’ participation in digital finance [31]. Within social networks, when acquaintances utilize digital financial products and derive benefits from them, they share various information during daily interactions. This not only helps other households broaden their access to information, enabling them to better understand digital finance, but also builds trust in digital financial platforms by disseminating experiences. This reduces feelings of unfamiliarity and apprehension, thereby stimulating willingness to participate in digital finance. Furthermore, social networks foster mutual assistance among members. When encountering difficulties or risks during digital financial activities, individuals can seek advice and support from friends, relatives, and others within their relational networks [32]. This reduces their perceived risks associated with digital finance participation and strengthens their confidence to engage. Migrant work not only allows rural families to maintain their original kinship and geographic networks, but also expands new social networks such as karma and friendships in the new work [33]. Therefore, this article proposes the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 2: Migrant work experience can facilitate rural households’ participation in the digital finance by increasing their financial literacy and expanding their social networks. The data used in this study come from the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS), which is conducted by the China Household Finance Survey and Research Center of Southwestern University of Finance and Economics on a sample basis every two years, and comprehensively tracks households’ dynamic financial behaviors, providing the researcher with detailed information on household credit, financial assets, and insurance. The data used in this study are from the 2019 China Household Finance Survey (CHFS). The CHFS data sample covers 29 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities), 345 counties, and 1,359 communities (villages) nationwide, with a stratified sample of 34,643 households, ensuring strong representativeness. In addition to the demographic characteristics, economic features, and financial literacy information, the 2019 CHFS data also includes household migration and migrant work experiences, as well as participation in digital finance. According to the purpose of the study, the sample of heads of households under 18 years old and those who go out to school are excluded, and the sample data of 9096 rural households are retained after removing the missing values. The per capita GDP data at the regional level comes from the China Statistical Yearbook. This article examines the impact of migrant work experience on both the probability and breadth of digital financial participation among rural households. Since the explanatory variable whether rural households participate in digital finance is a binary discrete variable, a probit model is constructed. The model is set up as follows: Where is the probability of rural households’ digital financial participation, denotes whether householder has migrant work experience. is a vector of control variables, and is the error term. Since the explanatory variable breadth of household digital finance is a discrete variable with counting characteristics, this paper constructs a Poisson model to analyze the impact of migrant workers’ work experience on the breadth of farmers’ participation in digital finance. The hypothesis probability is determined by the Poisson distribution of parameters, and the model is set up as follows: Where is the number of households using digital financial instruments, is Poisson’s arrival rate, and represents the breadth of farmers’ participation in digital finance. Furthermore, based on the preceding analysis, farmers’ financial literacy and social networks mediate the impact of migrant work experience on their participation in digital finance. Therefore, this article constructs a mediation model to test this. The traditional mediation model does not consider the endogeneity of the mediating variables, and when the mediating variables have endogeneity problems, resulting in the estimation results may be biased. The mediating variables in this article are financial literacy and social networks of farm households, both of which have endogeneity problems such as omitted variables or reverse causality that may exist between them and digital financial participation of rural households. When the intervening variable and the mediating variable are endogenous at the same time, the instrumental variables of the intervening variable and the instrumental variables of the mediating variable need to be utilized to identify the mediating effects. This article builds on the following model [34] by adding instrumental variables for the mediating variables to complete the causal identification of mediating effects: In model (3) are channel variables, including financial literacy and social network. denotes the effect of migrant working experience on each channel variable, is the error term; is the only endogenous variable in the model. In model (4), denotes the direct effect of migrant working experience on rural households’ digital financial participation; denotes the effect of channel variables on rural households’ digital financial participation after controlling for the migrant work variable, is the error term; The model includes two endogenous variables, and channel variables. This paper has two explanatory variables: probability of participation in digital finance (Probability of participation in digital finance) and breadth of participation in digital finance (Breadth of Participation in Digital Finance). Based on the definition of digital finance by existing scholars, it mainly refers to traditional financial institutions providing payment, financing, investment and other new types of financial services with the help of digital technology [1]. Therefore, this paper focuses on measuring rural households’ digital finance participation by examining the use of the most frequently used financial instruments such as digital payment, digital lending, and digital finance. The questions on digital payment, digital lending, and digital finance management in the questionnaire used are (1) Digital payment: have households used payment methods such as online banking, mobile banking, Alipay, and WeChat? (2) Digital lending: have households used internet borrowing, credit loans or crowdfunding? (3) Digital finance: Have they purchased financial products? The variable of whether to participate in digital finance and the variable of the breadth of participation in digital finance are measured as follows: if a rural household has used any one of the financial instruments such as digital payment, digital lending, digital finance, etc., it is considered to have participated in digital finance, which takes the value of 1, and vice versa 0. The breadth of participation in digital finance is measured by the number of types of digital financial instruments mentioned above that have been used by the rural household. The core explanatory variable in this article is the migratory work experience of the farm household, which takes the value of 1 if the head of the household has lived or worked for more than half a year outside of the province/city where he/she resides, and 0 otherwise. In addition, since this article focuses on work experience, the sample of those who have migrated due to their schooling has been excluded. The mediating variables for this article are financial literacy and social networks. In the measure of financial literacy, considering the differences in the level of financial literacy represented by farmers answering “I don’t know” and answering incorrectly when confronted with a financial literacy question [35], the number of direct answers to financial questions and the number of correct answers to financial questions were used respectively to measure farmers’ financial literacy level. The three main financial literacy questions in the questionnaire include interest question, inflation question, and compound interest question. The questionnaire used contained questions related to financial literacy in three areas: interest, inflation, and compound interest. Interest problem: Assuming that the bank’s interest rate is 4% per year, if you deposit 100 yuan for 1 year, the principal and interest you will receive after 1 year will be?; Inflation problem: Assuming that the bank’s interest rate is 5% per year and the inflation rate is 8% per year, what will you be able to buy after one year of saving 100 yuan in the bank?; Compound Interest Problem: If you take out a loan or deposit 10,000 yuan and compound interest at 10% per year, what is the total amount of principal and interest you will need to repay after two years?. For each of the above questions, two dummy variables can be generated for whether or not to answer “don’t know” and whether or not to answer incorrectly, and a total of six dummy variables can be obtained for the three questions, and the factor analysis method is used to get the score of financial literacy of the farmers. In the measure of social network, Rural China is a highly humanized and relational society, and social relationships among people often follow the agreed-upon principle of “exchange of gifts”. Family gift income and expenditure is an important means of maintaining family social network relationships, and can reflect the strength of family social network relationships. Therefore, this article uses the logarithm of the total amount of household gift income and expenditure to measure the level of social networks. In this study, three variables may exhibit endogeneity: migrant work experience, financial literacy, and social networks. This stems from potential omitted variables related to migrant work experience. Simultaneously, household digital financial participation may also exert a reverse effect on financial literacy and social networks. Households with broader participation are more likely to access financial information online and form new social connections, thereby achieving higher levels of financial literacy and social networks. Therefore, to effectively mitigate estimation biases arising from reverse causality and omitted variables, this study requires establishing corresponding instrumental variables for each endogenous variable, while simultaneously satisfying the requirements of instrument relevance and exclusivity. First, drawing upon existing literature [36,37], this study selects the migration work atmosphere within the village (community) (IV_mw) as an instrumental variable for rural households’ migration work experience. This is measured by the proportion of households within the village (community) that have migration work experience, excluding the interviewed household. In terms of relevance, given the informational network characteristics of rural household migration work [38], households within the same village (community) share work information and experiences, assisting others in migration efforts. When a village has more migrants, the likelihood of the surveyed household engaging in migration work increases. Regarding exclusivity, the migration work environment within villages does not directly influence household participation in digital finance. This is because the migration work environment itself can only provide information or social pressure. Only when households actually engage in migration work will key factors such as income growth, improved financial literacy, and changes in financial needs be directly triggered, thereby driving the use of digital finance. Without actual migration experience, other channels like idea dissemination or peer modeling often yield limited results due to the absence of economic incentives and foundational capabilities. Second, this study selects the interaction term between regional traditional financial development levels and household attention to financial information (IV_fl) as an instrumental variable for financial literacy. It measures traditional financial development levels using the logarithm of regional financial institutions’ loan balances in 2014. The choice of 2014 stems from the fact that China’s digital inclusive finance began rapid development only after the State Council issued the “Guiding Opinions on Promoting the Healthy Development of Internet Finance” in 2015. In terms of correlation, regions with more developed traditional financial sectors provide residents with greater opportunities for both passive exposure and active learning of financial knowledge. Rural households with high attention to financial information are more likely to proactively seek out financial news, market trends, wealth management knowledge, and information from their surroundings, thereby achieving higher levels of financial literacy. Regarding exclusivity, prior to the rise of digital inclusive finance in China, the level of traditional financial development could only influence households’ digital financial participation decisions by affecting their financial literacy. Finally, this study selected the interaction term between the proportion of the region’s most common surname and household financial support provided to non-household members (IV_sn) as an instrumental variable for social networks. In terms of relevance, surnames serve as a key indicator for distinguishing whether rural households belong to the same clan [39]. A higher number of prevalent surnames in a region indicates broader social networks among rural households. Simultaneously, household financial support to non-household members reflects rural households’ capacity for external social interaction, closely linked to expenditures on household social networks. Regarding exclusivity, the proportion of surnames in a village carries distinct clan and cultural characteristics, unaffected by individual household traits. It is unlikely to be influenced by variables other than household social networks, thereby satisfying the exogeneity requirement for the instrumental variable. This paper selects a series of control variables at the level of personal characteristics of farm households, household characteristics and regional characteristics, respectively. Individual characteristics include sex (Gender), age (Age), years of education (Education), marital status (Marriage), and health (Health) of the household head. Household characteristics variables include owner-occupied housing (House), household size (Size), household Elderly dependency ratio (Elder), household Child dependency ratio (Child), total household income (Income), total household assets (Assets), and business engaged in by the household (Commerce). Regional characteristics variables include the logarithm of GDP per capita (Pergdp) and regional dummy variables. Table 1 shows the definitions of the variables. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t001 Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics and mean differences of the main variables. The result of the mean value of rural households’ digital finance participation shows that the proportion of rural households participating in digital finance is 32% and the average breadth of participation in digital finance is 0.368. This indicates that the probability and breadth of digital financial participation are not high. The mean test also revealed that households with migrant work experience exhibit a higher probability and greater breadth of participation in digital finance. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t002 Table 3 reports the results of the baseline regressions on the impact of migrant work experience on rural households’ digital financial participation. The results in columns (1) and (3) find that the coefficients on the impact of migrant work experience on the probability and breadth of rural households’ digital financial participation are positively significant at the 1% statistical level without the inclusion of control variables. The results in columns (2) and (4) find that the effect of migrant work experience on both the probability of participation and breadth of participation in digital finance for rural households is also positively significant when all control variables are added. The above results indicate that migrant work experience contributes significantly to both the probability and breadth of digital financial participation of rural households. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t003 Among the control variables, the age, education level, and health status of the household head significantly influence rural households’ participation in digital finance. At the household level, household size, business investment, and total assets positively affect households’ digital finance behavior. At the regional level, per capita GDP positively influences households’ digital finance behavior. The household head’s gender, marital status, owner-occupied housing, and total income do not significantly affect households’ digital finance behavior. Although there is no reverse causality between past migrant labor experiences of rural households and current digital financial participation of rural households, the results may still be biased by omitted variables. Table 4 reports the results of the estimation using instrumental variables. Column (1) presents the estimation results using the IV-Probit model. The results show that the coefficient of the effect of out-of-home labor experience on the probability of digital financial participation of rural households is positively significant at the 1% statistical level. Column (2) presents the estimation results using IV-Poisson model. The results show that the coefficient of the effect of migrant labor experience on the breadth of digital financial participation of rural households is positively significant at the 1% statistical level. The F-value of 325.37 in the first stage indicates that the selected instrumental variable is not a weak instrumental variable. The results of the endogeneity test show that after considering endogeneity, the migrant work experience still has a positive impact on the probability of rural households’ digital financial participation and the breadth of participation. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t004 Since the migrant work decision-making is not random, but affected by many factors such as individual farmers and households, it may lead to endogenous problems caused by sample self-selection, resulting in biased results. To solve this problem, this paper use the propensity score matching method (PSM) to mitigate this bias. The propensity score method (PSM) could create a near-randomized experiment by identifying the sample that is closest to the treatment and control groups in terms of covariates, in order to reduce estimation bias. In this study, according to whether the farmers have migrant work experience, the sample was divided into families with migrant work experience (treatment group) and families with no migrant work experience (control group).By using the logit model to calculate the propensity score with Participate in digital finance and Breadth of participation as the dependent variables, four common matching methods, namely nearest neighbor matching (K = 3), radius matching, kernel matching and local linear regression matching, were selected to re-estimate the impact of migrant work experience on rural households’ digital financial participation. The results of the balance test (S1 Table) show that none of the P-values were significant after matching, indicating that there was no significant difference between the treatment and control groups. Table 5 reports the results of the average treatment effect (ATT) of migrant work experience on the probability of digital financial participation and the breadth of participation of rural households estimated using the PSM. The estimation results of the four matching methods are less different, but all are positively significant at the 1% level. The average treatment effect of outwork experience on the probability of rural households’ digital financial participation ranges between 0.085 and 0.102, and the average treatment effect of outwork experience on the breadth of rural households’ digital financial participation ranges between 0.101 and 0.122. The PSM estimation results are relatively close to the baseline regression results, which further validates the robustness of the main findings. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t005 While the instrumental variable method was used in the previous section to mitigate potential omitted variable problems, it was considered that the use of cross-sectional data also introduces omitted variable bias that may lead to endogeneity problems. To further overcome potential endogeneity problems, this paper will construct balanced panel data for estimation using Chinese household finance data (CHFS) for 2017 and 2019, and the descriptive statistics of the data are shown in S2 Table, and the regression results are shown in Table 6. This paper controls for the same control variables as the baseline regression, except for fixing time and region. The results report that the effect of migrant work experience on both the probability and breadth of digital financial participation of rural households is positive and significant, indicating that migrant work experience has a significant contribution to digital financial participation of rural households. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t006 The exclusivity condition for the instrumental variable of village migration work atmosphere may not be satisfied. While migration work atmosphere can influence digital financial participation through the migration decisions of surveyed households, this may not be the sole pathway. For instance, under peer group effects, the migration work atmosphere within the village exerts the same influence on migration decisions of households other than the surveyed one, with migration experience directly impacting their digital financial participation. In other words, the instrumental variable may indirectly influence the respondent household’s digital financial participation by affecting other households’ engagement. Concurrently, an infrastructure effect may exist: villages with stronger migration work atmospheres may attract more financial institutions and digital infrastructure, thereby enhancing household digital financial participation. Given these considerations, this study incorporates village digital financial participation, rural financial institutions, and rural digital infrastructure as control variables in the model to block these pathways and enhance the exclusivity of the village migration work atmosphere as an instrumental variable. Table 7 shows that after adding these controls, the impact of migration work experience on rural households’ digital financial participation remains robust. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t007 To examine the heterogeneity of the impact of migrant working experience on rural households’ digital financial participation across groups, this paper regresses the sample into groups with respect to the types of work performed during migrant work, long-tail groups, and regional differences, respectively. The type of work during migrant work has an important impact on the ability of migrant workers to effectively accumulate experience, knowledge, and contacts. It is generally recognized that people with formal work or entrepreneurial experience typically not only have higher income levels, but are also more likely to have access to a wealth of information and asset management skills [40], factors that contribute to their better participation in digital financial markets. Table 8 reports the impact of migrants’ formal work experience and migrants’ entrepreneurial experience on rural households’ digital financial participation. The results in columns (1) and (3) show that the coefficients of the impact of migrant formal work experience on the probability of digital financial participation and the breadth of participation of rural households are both significantly positive, suggesting that migrant formal work experience has a greater facilitating effect. The reason is that engaging in formal work usually has a more stable wage income and a clearer compensation system, which makes migrant farm households more confident in investing and borrowing on digital finance platforms and enhances their motivation to participate in digital finance. The results in columns (2) and (4) show that the effect of migrant entrepreneurship experience on the probability of rural households’ digital finance participation is insignificant and the effect on the breadth of digital finance participation is positively significant. The possible explanation is that entrepreneurship itself is characterized by high risk and uncertainty, and many rural households may be wary of digital financial participation because they fear that the use of digital financial products during migrant entrepreneurship may increase financial risk. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t008 The impact of migrant work experience on rural households’ digital financial participation is also likely to vary across farm households’ education levels. This paper examines the sample by dividing it into two groups, those who have not completed compulsory education and those who have completed compulsory education, based on the required number of years of compulsory education in China (9 years).The results in Table 9 show that the marginal contribution of migrant work experience to the probability and breadth of household digital finance participation is greater for farmers who have completed years of compulsory education compared to those who have not completed years of compulsory education. This is because farmers who have completed compulsory education are usually more adaptable and able to acquire digital skills and learn financial literacy more quickly, enabling them to be more willing to engage in digital financial activities and continue to expand the breadth of their participation. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t009 In addition, the paper also seeks to understand whether migrant work experiences can facilitate the participation of disadvantaged rural households in digital finance. According to the Long Tail Theory, traditional financial models tend to focus resources on “head” customers at the expense of “tail” customers, and disadvantaged farmers who are excluded from traditional finance are also more likely to be excluded from digital finance. Drawing on existing literature [11], rural households with per capita household incomes below the 2018 Chinese National Poverty Standard Line of 3,200 yuan are defined as the long-tail group. The results in Table 10 show that the coefficients of the impact of migrant work experience on the probability of household digital financial participation and the breadth of participation are larger for the long-tail group than for the non-long-tail group. This suggests that migrant work experience brings more significant marginal improvement effects of cognitive ability enhancement and social network expansion for the long-tail group, which in turn strongly promotes their participation in digital financial activities. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t010 How does the migrant work experience contribute to rural households’ participation in digital finance? This section will delve further into the channels and mechanisms through which such experiences may have an impact. Table 11 reports the results of testing the financial literacy mechanism. Column (1) presents the regression results for the impact of migrant work experience on financial literacy. The coefficient for the financial literacy variable is significantly positive at the 1% significance level, indicating that migrant work experience positively enhances farmers’ financial literacy. The F-value in the first stage is 317.80, far exceeding the empirical value of 10, confirming that the instrumental variables are not weak. Columns (2) and (3) present regression results for the joint effects of migrant work experience and financial literacy on rural households’ probability and breadth of digital financial participation. Both migrant work experience and financial literacy exhibit positive and significant coefficients. The Cragg-Donald Wald F statistic of 87.228 exceeds the Stock-Yogo critical value of 7.03 at the 10% level, confirming no weak instrumentation issues. Furthermore, considering potential violations of the sequential neglectability assumption, this study adopts the research approach from Ima [41,42] to conduct sensitivity tests on the financial literacy mechanism (S3 Fig). The results confirm that the causal inference of the financial literacy mediation effect is valid and robust. These findings collectively demonstrate that migration work experience promotes rural households’ participation in digital finance by enhancing their financial literacy levels. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t011 Table 12 reports the results of testing the social network mechanism. Column (1) presents the regression results for the impact of migrant work experience on social networks. The coefficient for the migrant work experience variable is significantly positive at the 1% statistical level, indicating that migrant work experience significantly expands rural households’ social networks. Columns (2) and (3) present regression results examining the joint effects of migrant work experience and social networks on the probability and breadth of household digital financial participation. Both variables exhibit statistically significant positive coefficients at the 1% level. The Cragg-Donald Wald F-statistic of 267.015 exceeds the Stock-Yogo critical value of 7.03 at the 10% level, confirming the absence of weak instrumental variable issues. Sensitivity analysis (S3 Fig) on the social network mechanism confirms the validity and robustness of the causal inference regarding the mediating effect of social networks. These findings demonstrate that migrant work experience promotes rural household participation in digital finance by expanding their social networks. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t012 Insufficient digital financial participation of rural households largely hinders the development of rural inclusive finance and farmers’ access to the dividends of digital economic development. Starting from the new perspective of migrant work experience, this study examines the impact of migrant work experience on rural households’ digital financial participation based on the 2019 China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) data. The study found that migrant work experience is an important influence on rural households’ digital financial participation, significantly contributing to the probability of digital financial participation and increasing the breadth of participation. Heterogeneity analysis finds that migrant work experience promotes digital financial participation of rural households with migrant formal work experience, migrant entrepreneurial experience, completion of compulsory education, and long-tail groups more. Mechanism analysis finds that migrant work experience can influence rural households’ digital financial participation by improving their financial literacy and broadening their social networks. Based on the above research findings, this article puts forward the following policy recommendations. First, while encouraging farmers to seek employment outside their hometowns, the government should focus on optimizing the employment environment and providing robust support to farming households. For instance, this could involve expanding formal employment channels through vocational skills training, or supporting independent entrepreneurship through business guarantees and subsidies. In addition, For migrant working farmers with a low level of education, training in the basics of digital finance is provided on a case-by-case basis, and personalized digital finance guidance services are provided to enhance their willingness to participate in digital finance. Financial institutions should develop low-threshold, flexible and diverse digital financial products to meet the financial needs of low-income migrant working farmers in different scenarios, based on their actual needs. At the same time, the leading role of farmers with high levels of education should be utilized, and these farmers should be encouraged to serve as volunteers or tutors for digital financial education, so as to teach digital financial skills to other farmers and enhance the willingness of farmers with low levels of education to participate in digital finance. Secondly, the Government should further strengthen education and training in rural financial knowledge and expand the social network of migrant working farmers. The government can collaborate with financial institutions to establish dedicated online communication platforms for migrant workers or regularly organize offline forums, providing spaces for them to exchange work and life experiences as well as financial knowledge. This approach enables them not only to share insights on using digital finance face-to-face but also to foster mutual trust and connections, expand their social networks, and ultimately boost the entire group’s enthusiasm for adopting digital financial services. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.s001 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.s002 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.s003 (DOCX)

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks A day after Thursday’s anxiety-inducing fake out, Friday turned into Redemption Day on Wall Street. The Dow ended the day 493 points higher, or 1.08%, after gaining as much as 800 points earlier in the day. The broader S&P 500 finished out the day 0.98% higher and the Nasdaq was up by 0.88%. The earlier bounce back came after New York Federal Reserve President John Williams said he supported lowering near-term interest rates, giving traders hope that they could get a December rate cut, after all. Friday’s gains cap a topsy-turvy and highly confusing week for markets. Going into Thursday, the sagging stock market had two big questions it wanted answered: Is the artificial intelligence bubble about to burst, and will the Fed cut interest rates in December? At first, it seemed like traders finally got the clear response they had been eagerly awaiting: Phew. Right? Wrong. Traders at first cheered Thursday morning, sending all three major stock indexes sharply higher. At one point, the Dow was up more than 700 points. But by late morning, the rally started to wear off, and sentiment – and markets – turned sharply negative by midday. Traders came to realize that the answers they thought they received actually just raised new, more difficult questions. “People are trying to figure out A.) What’s better than off the charts in terms of what Nvidia can say from here and realizing that there’s no reward at these levels and B.) how the Fed can cut if jobs numbers are really better,” said Michael Block, market strategist at Third Seven Capital. By the end of the day Thursday, it was like nothing had changed: Markets resumed their slide that has sent the S&P 500 down more than 5% from the all-time high it reached just before Halloween. Markets rebounded Friday, but Nvidia was essentially flat. Bitcoin dropped by around 2% to levels not seen since April and is on pace for its worst month since 2022. Nvidia’s quarterly earnings were so blow-out that investors began to fear that the world’s most valuable company and maker of the most precious commodity in tech – high-end AI chips – couldn’t possibly keep up this pace of growth for much longer. Eventually, demand will ebb. And even if it doesn’t anytime soon, the AI market isn’t just Nvidia – other, less powerful companies could still be overinflated. Perhaps, traders feared, Nvidia’s earnings didn’t actually answer any of their questions at all. Investors also looked more closely at a particularly confusing jobs report and realized it might not say exactly what they initially thought: The headline number showed much stronger-than-expected hiring in September, suggesting that the worst of the early-summer hiring slowdown may be behind us. The unemployment rate may have risen because more workers were entering the labor force, resuming their job searches after the summer lull. Williams’ glass appears to be half empty. But if the Fed takes a glass-half-full approach – particularly after minutes from its last meeting released Wednesday showed significant resistance to another rate cut in December – perhaps that rate cut won’t be coming next month, after all. So here we are on Friday, right back where we started. CNN’s Fear and Greed Index is in “extreme fear” mode and at its lowest level since – you guessed it – April. The VIX volatility index briefly spiked to 27, its highest level since… do we even need to say it? Until investors get satisfactory answers to their questions, expect more market volatility going forward. But with shutdown-delayed government data, an end to earnings season and traders about to go on vacation for the holidays, it’s not clear those answers are coming anytime soon.

Increasing systemic risk from interconnected investments with circular revenue relationships is waving red flags. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The honeymoon period for the explosive growth of the AI industry may be drawing to a close, as some of the world's top financial institutions are growing increasingly worried about the sheer quantity of debt being taken on by top tech and AI firms to build out the infrastructure they all claim is so necessary, as Bloomberg reports. Although the top firms continue to perform well, recent wobbles in stock pricing suggest confidence is waning and the risk of a larger collapse grows ever greater. The multiple hundred-billion-dollar deals struck between AI and technology firms in 2025 have raised eyebrows every time the news breaks, but so far, there's only been an upside for the companies involved. OpenAI, Nvidia, Microsoft, Anthropic, and others have all seen their share prices skyrocket in the wake of their interlocking deals, making many of these companies feel like they're buoying each other while they all hunt for the elusive AI profit that has yet to materialize. But those vibes are now turning into genuine concerns in the financing world. "We’ve seen an expansion of the ecosystem to include companies with weaker balance sheets like Oracle and CoreWeave, more debt, and we’ve also seen more interlocking and circular revenue relationships,” said Morgan Stanley's chief investment officer for wealth management. “That interconnectivity between the players brings systemic risk.” Although Nvidia has made real money with everyone buying up its graphics cards to power the new AI data centers, most other companies in the space have yet to realize anything in the way of profit. Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Google can at least rely on strong profits in their existing businesses, but many companion companies, like the aforementioned Coreweave, do not. Oracle is another example. Though it had a strong business in place already, it's certainly not hundreds of billions strong. But that's now what it's being tasked to deliver, and despite the interlocked deals with these other "hyperscaler" businesses, that may not be enough to maintain investor confidence forever. To manage these investments, it's been forced to take on more debt, with Bloomberg reporting Oracle selling $18 billion in government bonds in September, and banks lending it $38 billion for further capital expenditure. Since its record share price highs in September, it's now fallen by over a third. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Indeed, even the venerable Nvidia isn't invulnerable to the shake in confidence. Nvidia's recent earnings reports were strong, but its stock price has slid several percent in recent days and has lost over 10 percent since the start of the month. Bloomberg highlights that this reaction from investors comes as they start to hunt for profit in the AI equation. Although capital investment was expected earlier in the AI hype phase, investors are now looking for a return on those investments. That may be where some of the borrowing is coming in: companies look to accelerate their developments to increase revenue over a shorter time scale. “When companies that don’t need to borrow are borrowing to make investments, that sets a bar for the returns on those investments,” explained Bob Savage, head of markets macro strategy at BNY. “We’re in a ‘show me the money’ phase.” Still, he doesn't see the AI bubble bursting any time soon. Most expenditure is still being funded by cash flow, so investors shouldn't be too concerned for now. As we head into the new year, though, if some of these major investments don't lead to big returns, it's clear investors will put increasing pressure on these AI-first companies to find the profit somewhere.

Title: How AI Is Ushering In A New Nuclear Age
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2025/11/21/how-ai-is-ushering-in-a-new-nuclear-age/

ByChristopher Helman, Forbes Staff andPhoebe Liu, Forbes Staff. At Aalo Atomics’ 40,000-square-foot factory on the south side of Austin, Texas, workers move five-eighths-inch-thick steel plates onto machines that slowly bend and roll them into 12-foot-wide cylinders, which they then weld into 25-foot-tall vessels. These could be made cheaper by outside contractors. But Aalo cofounder and CEO Matt Loszak wants to do this work in-house, since each vessel will eventually contain the guts of a ten-megawatt (MW) nuclear fission reactor. Five of these Aalo-1 reactor units, working in tandem, will power a single 50 MW electric turbine—enough juice to run a large data-processing center or 45,000 homes. “It’s not a paper reactor; it’s getting built,” declares Loszak, a 35-year-old Canadian engineer now on his third startup. In August, Aalo broke ground on a two-acre site at the Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory, where it aims to achieve “criticality” by July 4, 2026—America’s 250th birthday and the deadline President Donald Trump has set for at least three U.S. startups to prove that their advanced nuclear reactor designs work. To achieve criticality, Aalo will load a vessel with off-the-shelf nuclear fuel rod assemblies and then initiate a self-sustaining nuclear fission chain reaction. Producing electricity? That comes later. Even after achieving criticality Aalo will still need to build out manufacturing and a supply chain of vendors, sign data center customers and get final approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. “We’ll get the factory set up, come down the cost curve and have this Holy Grail product,’’ vows Loszak, who is shopping for up to 1 million square feet for a gigafactory and recently hired Bryson Gentile, who headed Falcon 9 manufacturing at Elon Musk’s SpaceX, to set up Aalo’s mass production operation. “What Elon did [with electric cars and rockets] was kind of like running the four-minute mile. When that happens, everyone’s like, ‘Wait, this is possible,’ ” Loszak says. He hopes to produce electricity in 2027. Demand for electricity is soaring, largely because of the power-sucking data centers undergirding the artificial intelligence boom, and Loszak isn’t the only nuclear entrepreneur aiming to ride the wave of AI dollars. A dozen ventures with names like Valar Atomics, Oklo, Kairos Power and X-energy are racing to perfect, permit and deploy a new generation of small, prefabricated reactors that could power individual data centers or even feed the larger electrical grid. So far in 2025, venture capitalists, stock market investors, billionaires, the DOE and others have poured more than $4 billion into these and other new U.S. nuclear ventures, versus closer to $500 million in 2020, per PitchBook. Tens of billions more will be needed if nuclear power is to make a comeback. Two-year-old Aalo has raised $136 million ($100 million of that in August), with billionaire Antonio Gracias’ Valor Equity Partners as its lead backer. Valor was one of Tesla’s first institutional investors, and Gracias, who sits on SpaceX’s board, told Forbes that Aalo will be a winner because of its commitment to manufacturing and vertical integration “similar to Tesla’s first-principles approach to batteries, electric vehicles and robotics.” These startups won’t all succeed. But the stars seem aligned for nuclear energy’s comeback. Demand is there—OpenAI’s Sam Altman has said he’ll need an outlandish 250 gigawatts of power in eight years. (That’s as much as Brazil uses.) More sober analysts predict that by 2030, data centers will need double the roughly 40 GW they now consume. At the current average industrial electricity price of nine cents per kilowatt hour, 40 GW would cost $32 billion a year—but prices will rise if demand grows faster than generating capacity. Analysts see natural gas turbines filling maybe 60% of the need, but those are on four-year back order. Coal remains unpopular (no matter how often Trump refers to the dirtiest fossil fuel as “beautiful and clean”). Wind and solar, besides being on Trump’s hit list, don’t provide the sort of 24/7 reliability data centers require. That’s a big gap for nuclear startups to fill. “There is plenty of room for everyone to do well, because the world needs that much energy and more,’’ says Iran-born billionaire Kamal (Kam) Ghaffarian, the aerospace entrepreneur who is the founder of Rockville, Maryland–based X-energy, which is developing a gas-cooled nuclear reactor. Sure, lots of folks still oppose nuclear reactors, particularly in their own backyard. But support is now both broad-based and top-down. Since reoccupying the Oval Office in January, Trump has canceled giant offshore wind projects, scotched a solar megafarm and signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, killing tax credits for wind and solar power projects that begin construction after next July 4. But that same law preserved and expanded benefits for nuclear power—tax credits for new designs now equal up to 40% of investment. The Trump administration is also overhauling the famously slow and cautious Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), which should speed up approval of new designs. And it aims to make permitting easier, in part by encouraging startups to locate reactors on military bases or at sites—like the Idaho National Lab—that have hosted nuclear activities since World War II’s Manhattan Project. While Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates has been singing nuclear energy’s praises as an answer to global warming for two decades, other voices now join the chorus. People say “ ‘If we invented nuclear fission today, we would view it as the silver bullet that solves climate change,’ ” says Drew Wandzilak, a principal at VC firm Alumni Ventures, which invested in X-energy, Aalo and Valar. “That’s how powerful it is.” Back at Aalo, Loszak and his cofounder, chief technology officer Yasir Arafat, 39, have added personal reasons for pursuing a nuclear revival. Loszak’s childhood asthma abated after his home province, Ontario, replaced nearby coal-burning plants with nuclear ones. Arafat did his calculus homework by candlelight in Bangladesh before coming to the U.S. as a college student and earning a master’s in nuclear engineering from North Carolina State. His career has spanned the scale: He worked on Westinghouse’s big AP1000, an 1,100 MW reactor, before heading to Idaho National Lab in 2019 to lead microreactor design. The cofounders hope eventually to sell their small mass-produced reactors not only to AI firms but also to poor, power-starved countries. Aalo means “the light” in Bengali. Not so long ago, the future of nuclear energy looked grim. After a tsunami led to disaster at Japan’s Fukushima nuclear plant in 2011, both Japan and Germany began mothballing sites. The U.S. industry, for its part, had been struggling since the partial meltdown at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island in 1979. The accident domina­ted headlines for months, but the small amount of radiation released turned out to pose no threat, the NRC says. Nevertheless, the regulatory fallout from Three Mile Island led to plant cancellations and stricter NRC rules, contributing to delays and runaway costs for big nuclear plants. In 2024, after 15 years, Georgia Power finally completed its Augusta, Georgia, plant with two Westinghouse AP1000 reactors, capable of powering 1.7 million houses. The cost surpassed $30 billion, more than double the original budget, reportedly due to unproven engineering, nonexistent supply chains and a skilled-worker shortage. Building a plant of equivalent size with natural gas turbines (assuming they could be found) would cost just $7 billion. It seemed the U.S. no longer had the ability to construct big nuclear plants efficiently. It now has 94 operating grid–scale reactors (many over 40 years old), down from 112 in 1990. DOE, Gates and other true believers were already pouring money into new reactor designs when Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine and AI’s voracious power demands jump-started the nuclear bandwagon. The European Union, desperate to wean itself off Russian oil and gas, decided that zero-carbon nuclear power can be considered “green” in some cases. Meta, Amazon and Alphabet’s Google have all inked long-term deals to buy nuke juice. Even Three Mile Island is back in the game. Its surviving reactor, closed in 2019, is now being prepped for restart after Microsoft agreed to buy all its output for the next 20 years. It’s been renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center. At 40, Mike Laufer, CEO and cofoun­der of Kairos Power, is a new-nuke veteran, having already built, operated and decommissioned a demonstration plant in Albuquerque, New Mexico. “In nine years, we’ve learned a huge amount,” he says. Kairos is now building Hermes 1, its first power-generating (demonstration) reactor, as well as Hermes 2, its first commercial reactor, which aims to deliver 50 MW to the Tennessee Valley Authority’s electric grid by 2030. Google has agreed to buy, by 2035, some 500 MW of power from Hermes reactors. Kairos’ headquarters is in a converted aircraft hangar at the former Naval Air Station in Alameda, California, just south of UC Berkeley, where Laufer and his two cofounders got their doctorates. The startup expects $303 million in funding from DOE by the time it completes Hermes 1 in 2028. (Laufer refuses to say whether his billionaire father, Henry Laufer, a mathematician who built hedge fund pioneer Renaissance Technologies with the late Jim Simons, is a backer.) The prefabricated modular Kairos system capitalizes on decades of advances with a molten fluoride salt-cooled reactor design. It uses a novel “pebble” fuel known as TRISO (for tri-structural-isotropic). This fuel is a feature of several new reactor designs, and a big reason why backers claim the new systems are both meltdown- and terrorist-proof. Tiny uranium dioxide kernels (the size of poppy seeds) are coated in millimeter-thick layers that insulate the uranium and contain dangerous fission products. Kairos then encases the TRISO in graphite to form pebbles the size of golf balls. When a lot of these pebbles are close together they can initiate fission reactions, yet the multilayered coatings aim to prevent the fuel from ever getting hot enough to initiate a runaway chain reaction (or meltdown). Backers claim that even if bad guys stole the thousands of TRISO pebbles in a mini-reactor, they’d be hard-pressed to do anything dangerous with them, and if they blew up a reactor, a cleanup crew would be able to go in after and safely pick up the pebbles. Kairos has devised its own TRISO production line, which is now being moved to DOE’s Los Alamos National Lab site, so it can finally “pelletize” actual enriched uranium. “In-house manufacturing is a key part of our strategy,” Laufer says. Isaiah Taylor, the 26-year-old founder and CEO of two-year-old Valar Atomics, also plans to use TRISO fuel but isn’t producing it himself yet—he’s too busy developing what Steve Marcus of Los Angeles–based Riot Ventures, which seeded Valar, describes as “the Toyota Corolla of reactors, not a Lamborghini.” In September, the El Segundo, California–based startup broke ground in Utah on its first demonstration reactor. In November, Valar announced a $130 million funding round and said it had achieved zero-power criticality (fission but no electricity) in a test of its reactor core at Los Alamos. It’s not clear if zero-power criticality meets Trump’s goal. Regardless, Taylor expects to achieve full reactor criticality (generating electricity, that is) by the president’s July 4 deadline with his “Ward 250” high-temperature, gas-cooled reactor design (named after his grandfather Ward Schaap, a scientist on the Manhattan Project). Valar has already built a thermal prototype that gets subjected to the same operational temperatures and pressures, but without the uranium fuel inside. “We dump 16 city blocks of L.A. power—half a megawatt—into the core,” says Taylor, whose team has discovered leaks and learned valuable skills by repeatedly taking their prototype apart and putting it back together. Taylor is a man in a hurry. The Idaho native dropped out of high school at 16 and spent what would have been his college years teaching himself nuclear engineering. His gung-ho attitude appeals to both funders and MAGA influencers. “He has the unique ability to be persuasive and get people to join the mission,” Marcus says. Fittingly, another Valar investor is Palmer Luckey, the billionaire who was featured on Forbes’ 30 Under 30 list in 2014, sold his virtual reality firm Oculus to Meta when he was just 21 and cofounded high-tech weapons maker Anduril at 24. This year Valar joined a lawsuit filed against the NRC claiming it was taking too long to permit new nukes and might not have the authority to regulate mini-reactors anyway. (Other plaintiffs in the case are startups Last Energy and Deep Fission plus Texas, Utah, Louisiana, Florida and the Arizona legislature.) The case has been stayed for settlement talks. “We need nuclear now,” not after a three-year review process, says Deep Fission CEO Liz Muller, 47, who founded the startup with her father, a retired UC Berkeley physics professor. The two-year-old startup raised $30 million in a September public offering. Its unusual approach involves boring a 30-inch-diameter hole a mile down into the earth, lowering a uranium fuel containment canister into it and filling the hole with water, which will be heated by the reactor to generate power, while keeping the reactor safely ensconced in solid rock. “Over the next two years we’re going to see who can actually start to build and who can’t,’’ Muller says. One startup that has cashed in on the hype without even building a pilot plant is Oklo, founded in 2013 by husband and wife Jacob and Caroline DeWitte. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was its chairman from 2015 until April. The company went public via a SPAC in 2024, and its market cap of $15 billion (down from a $26 billion peak in October) makes both DeWittes billionaires. While Oklo has begun prep work on a site adjacent to Idaho National Lab, it’s unlikely to reach criticality by next July 4. Still, it has friends in high places; energy secretary Chris Wright was formerly on Oklo’s board. It’s the highest-profile of a half-dozen publicly traded mini-nuke companies. “[Oklo’s] stock is very symbolic of what public opinion is; everybody’s pro-nuclear and wants to be invested in it,” Riot’s Marcus says. It’s worth noting that even the wealthiest, most intelligent and most powerful people on the planet can’t just will a new reactor into being. Bill Gates cofounded TerraPower in 2008. After 17 years and close to $4 billion in investment from Gates, DOE, Nvidia, HD Hyundai and others, it still doesn’t have the NRC’s approval for its 350 MW molten salt reactor design. There’s also a chance, particularly given Trump’s constant flip-flopping, that old-fashioned big nuclear plants, not factory-built units, could be the future. Having gone through bankruptcy and multiple ownership changes in the past decade, Westinghouse received a fresh lifeline in October when the Trump administration pledged to help expedite permitting and financing for $80 billion in new reactors (enough to build anywhere from five to ten Westinghouse AP1000s) in exchange for Uncle Sam taking a 20% “participation interest” in any Westinghouse profits above $17.5 billion generated by 2029. That’s terrific news for Amarillo, Texas–based Fermi America, which has minted the richest new nuclear billionaire: cofounder and CEO Toby Neugebauer, 53. A private equity investor and son of a former Republican Congressman, Neugebauer (and his family) saw their net worth hit $6 billion after Fermi went public in October. Fermi’s plan is to build colossal data centers powered by at least four AP1000 reactors on 5,000 acres adjacent to Pantex, a DOE outpost in the Texas panhandle that for decades has manufactured the plutonium heart of nuclear warheads. “If you can’t build nuclear power on this site, you can’t do it anywhere,” says Neugebauer, whose cofounders are Rick Perry (the former governor of Texas and Trump’s first energy secretary) and Perry’s son, Griffin. Like many AI companies, Fermi is close with the administration. Neugebauer chose Cantor Fitzgerald, controlled by the family of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, to arrange its IPO. Another Lutnick-controlled company, real estate broker Newmark, reportedly earned millions in fees securing land for Fermi. "The reason we do nuclear is we are patriots," says Fermi CEO Toby Neugebauer. "China is building power out the wazoo. That’s why we need nuclear AI." Plus, Neugebauer is a project developer, not an innovator. He has hired as his chief nuclear construction officer Mesut Uzman, a Turkey-born U.S. citizen who helped manage the building of the first four AP1000 reactors in China, then another in Bulgaria and four more in the UAE. “We have someone who is not a virgin. He’s got 13 kisses under his belt,” brags Neugebauer, who says that once the small nuclear reactor guys are ready, he’ll happily build multiple gigawatts of them on the site, too. Neugebauer is also hedging his nuclear bet: He already has 2.5 GW of natural gas turbines on order and intends to build 11 GW of gas power before his first reactor is complete. But his long-term vision is for Amarillo to serve as the federal government’s hub for atomic-powered artificial intelligence. “The reason we do nuclear is we are patriots,’’ he says. “China is building 33 [large] reactors, not for air conditioning. They are building power out the wazoo. That’s why we need nuclear AI.”

Title: Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) Smart Glasses Get 20% Price Drop Ahead of Black Friday

Time Published: 2025-11-21T11:10:07Z

Meta is tossing out a limited time 20% discount off all Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) smart glasses, which you can nab from now until December 1st. Released in 2023 starting at $300, Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) are capable smart glasses in their own right, including video/photo capture, onboard AI assistant, and the ability to play music and take calls. The second gen version released earlier this year, starting at $380, bringing with it better battery life, higher-quality video capture, and improved audio/mics. You can check the spec sheet below for a 1:1 comparison. Still, at $240, Meta’s latest deal makes Gen 1 the cheapest it’s ever been, with the 20% discount available across all Gen 1 lens and style combos. You can get the deal from now until December 1st direct through Meta, which includes expedited shipping, as well as partner retailers, including Amazon, Best Buy, Ray-Ban Stores, and Target in the US. Many supported regions are getting the deal too, which you’ll find in local pricing across Europe, Australia, Canada, India, Mexico, the United Arab Emirates, and the UK. Meta is also tossing out 20% off prescription lenses when you purchase Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1 and 2) and/or Oakley Meta HSTN glasses, which will only be available through Meta from now until December 1st. While Meta is clearly using the big Black Friday sales rush to flush old stock, I honestly hoped for a much larger barn burner, although it’s pretty clear why we’re not seeing the any super deep discounts. As occult corporate calculus goes, Meta and EssilorLuxottica probably don’t want to make Gen 1 too attractive to people who might otherwise just spring for the more expensive Gen 2. This makes me think that 20% off is about as low as Meta will go this year around, although I’ll be keeping my eye on post-Black Friday sales to confirm. Still, there are some caveats potential buyers should be aware of: neither are better at capturing video than your smartphone, and they don’t play music better than even mediocre wireless ear buds. You also have to use Meta AI, which is… okay, making it more of a fun toy (or Christmas gift) than a must-have addition to your smartphone. This article may contain affiliate links. If you click an affiliate link and buy a product we may receive a small commission which helps support the publication. See here for more information. TL;DR: What if the only reason they sell is because they are pretty? I REALLY want to see real world usage statistics. There is no doubt some actual utility you can get from AI assistants, and taking pictures has been the main use of glasses like HMDs since Google Glass. But as far as I can tell people could still mostly buy them as fashion accessories because they are Ray Bans. Everybody incl. Apple and Samsung are now struggling to catch up with Meta's surprising sales hit, but this is all on the promise that people will somehow use them as their first steps into a sort of AI assistant real world metaverse. And that may be a big miscalculation if they are bought primarily as (photo) glasses. The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses seriously upgrade the number of use cases, but currently lack an SDK that would allow custom apps, with Meta only offering one to developers for connecting smartphone apps to the glasses. And the display glasses come with significantly increased size and weight, no longer as unsuspicious as their regular smartglasses, and at a much higher price that very likely still makes Meta lose money on every single sale. The potential is no doubt there, but we are still very far from smartglasses doing even a small fraction of what smartphones can do today. So while we are seeing regular reports on how well they sell and what Meta does to push them further into the mainstream, what we'd really need is more info on how impactful the smart part of smartglasses is in reality. Or if everybody is just chasing large user numbers, blindly hoping they will somehow magically translate into the next smartphone-like platform in the future. Yes, they're pretty and they take pictures. That's the Trojan horse through which we hope to arrive to the other stuff once they are on the head of people For Meta it doesn't really matter if this works or not, as long as Facebook and Instagram keep laying golden eggs that pay for everything that Zuckerberg wants and gets due to his class B shares in Meta Platforms. These come with 10x the voting power of the publicly traded class A shares, giving him 60% of the total vote. So when he decided in 2021 that the Metaverse was going to happen now, that was what they went for with no way to stop or fire him. And now they are going for smartglasses, with no way to stop or fire him. If it doesn't work, he'll just try something else. The question is really how much the industry should follow Zuckerberg's ideas based on how successful they turned out to be in the past. I'm pretty sure that Apple is still serious about making Vision a viable consumer product, and they are massively investing into media like immersive live event streaming that only make sense on a high end HMD. Like the just announced Real Madrid documentary shot on 30 Blackmagic URSA Cine Immersive cameras for USD 30K each. So even if Apple now rushes to release some "me too" smartglasses, we will very likely see a Vision Air in a few years. I'm not as sure about the future of HMDs running AndroidXR, which Google describes as "Android XR is an AI-powered operating system coming soon to headsets and glasses". Google being seduced by the current AI and smartglasses hype may lead to them abandoning another VR capable class of headsets to solely focus AndroidXR on much less capable AI assistants in a much smaller form factor. Which is why it would be so important to learn if smartglasses are actually used beyond the "they're pretty and they take pictures" as actual smartglasses. "Smart glasses accounted for more than a third of EssilorLuxottica's growth in Q3 2025" — UPloadVR. So people are not just buying Ray-Ban, they are buying Ray-Ban Meta. But that doesn't answer what they are using them for. The official price on the Ray-Ban website for the Meta Ray-Ban Wayfarer Gen 1 is USD 329, USD 459 for Gen 2, and the price for the Original Wayfarer Classic sunglasses these are based on is USD 244. And if you go directly through their AI glasses page, the Gen 1 list price is only USD 299, a mere USD 55 more than the regular glasses, though real world prices after rebates etc. may be very different. So there is quite a chance that people buy the Meta version just to give it a try, as they only add 20% to the price, and then after some initial tries never even bother to charge them. They surely are a novelty and a reason for more people to buy Ray-Ban glasses. But we know from VR HMDs that most of them end up on a shelf, with the Quest 2 and later having a much better retention rate than Rift & Co, though still only about 40%. For a device that so far has very limited use, but still works as regular sunglasses, the equivalent to "sitting on a shelf" would be "sitting on a nose uncharged/unused". I do not doubt that Quest 2 was the best selling HMD ever, I do not doubt that Meta Ray-Bans are what drives EssilorLuxottica's growth in what I'd suspect is a pretty saturated sunglasses market. What I doubt is that sales numbers represent active users numbers, basically that the features that make the Meta Ray-Ban smarter than their dumb Original Wayfarer Classic cousins see a lot of use. And that's quite crucial for the whole device category, hence my demand for usage statistics instead of only sales statistics. When a camera and a microphone and headphones are sitting on your nose — and good quality ones — you will use them. I use them all the time, to the point that I regret not getting the transition version because I want to use them indoors as well. I use the AI and live translation only occasionally, but they are very useful when you need them. When you have paid hundreds of dollar for a VR HMD with many good games available, you will use it. Or not, as the 60% that stopped using their Quest 2 a few months after the purchase. Again, I am not looking for sales numbers or anecdotes, I'm looking for usage statistics. I know they sell well, I know they can be useful, I know that some people love them and use them all the time. What I want to know is how many people that bought them still use the smart features after a few weeks, or at all for anything but taking pictures or blocking the sun. As with everything XR, numbers are hard to come by, and it took a lot of cross referencing from different sources to find out the retention rate on Quest 2, which by now has probably dropped significantly. Getting the retention rate was important to estimate how well VR is received by the average users, which provides some insight into the readiness and longterm market chances of a device. And it turned out to be not that well, with the majority not seeing the increased immersion worth the hassle/discomfort after a while, instead switching back to flat games on PCs/consoles/phones. Smartglasses users will typically also carry a smartphone that can do pretty much everything the glasses can do and more, with better cameras and a screen to see what picture you will take, but requiring to pull out and hold the device. So I'd say there are a number of good reasons why current smartglasses might be abandoned or reduced to mere sunglasses. Asking for any use other than taking pictures would probably drop the actual usage numbers even further. And what I am looking for is evidence aka statistics, not personal opinions or claims of inevitableness by individual smartglasses lovers or haters.

Title: Nvidia’s AI-driven earnings surge sparks market rally, easing bubble fears

Nvidia reported $57B in Q3 revenueÂ (62% YoY growth), exceeding Wall Street forecasts. Profits surged toÂ $31.9B, signaling unstoppable AI demand. CEO Jensen Huang declared AI adoption is accelerating globally, with Blackwell GPUs "off the charts" and cloud GPUs "sold out." Nvidia jumped 5% in after-hours trading, nearingÂ $196. Big Tech (Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta) saw gains. Crypto-linked stocks reboundedÂ (Coinbase, MicroStrategy) as Bitcoin recovered toÂ 91,500 after dipping below 89K. InvestorÂ Michael BurryÂ warned of inflated earnings due to understated data center depreciation. Major players likeÂ Peter Thiel and SoftBank cashed outÂ (SoftBank sold itsÂ $5.8B stake). AI is replacingÂ 80% to 90% of customer service jobsÂ and expanding into creative fields (writing, design). Analysts warn ofÂ job displacement, privacy risks, bias and existential threatsÂ from unchecked AI growth. Nvidia's dominance confirms AI's explosive growth, but sustainability is uncertain. GPU demand remains high, but history showsÂ bubbles eventually burstâinvestors should weigh AI's transformative potential against its disruptive consequences.

Nvidia's dominance confirms AI's explosive growth, but sustainability is uncertain. GPU demand remains high, but history showsÂ bubbles eventually burstâinvestors should weigh AI's transformative potential against its disruptive consequences. Nvidia's record-breaking third-quarter earnings report has sent shockwaves through global markets, fueling a surge in AI and crypto-related stocks while temporarily alleviating fears of an artificial intelligence bubble. The semiconductor giant's staggering performanceâbolstered by unprecedented demand for its AI computing platformsâhas reignited investor optimism, lifting Bitcoin, Big Tech and mining stocks in after-hours trading. Nvidia reportedÂ 57 billion in revenue for Q3, a 62% increase compared to the same period last year and surpasses Wall Street's projections ofÂ 54.7 billion. Profits soared toÂ 31.9 billion, up 65 billion (Â±2%)Â further signaled that AI adoption shows no signs of slowing. CEOÂ Jensen HuangÂ declared, "Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out." He emphasized that AI adoption is accelerating globally, stating, "We've entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fastâwith more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once." CFOÂ Colette KressÂ added that Nvidia's Blackwell Ultra architecture is now its leading platform, while older Blackwell models continue to see strong demand. Notably, she downplayed revenue from the China-specificÂ H20 chip, calling it "insignificant"âa nod to U.S. export restrictions. Nvidia's earnings acted as a catalyst for broader market optimism: Nvidia (NVDA)Â surged 5% in after-hours trading, reachingÂ 196 after closing at 186.52. Big TechÂ stocksâApple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META)âall posted gains. Crypto-linked equitiesÂ rebounded, with Coinbase (COIN), MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Circle Internet Group (CRCL) edging higher. Bitcoin mining stocksÂ saw dramatic jumps, led byÂ Cipher Mining (+13%),Â IREN (+10%) andÂ Marathon Digital (+4%), as miners pivot toward AI data center operations. Bitcoin itself clawed back from aÂ 24-hour low of $88,540âits first dip below $89,000 since late AprilâtoÂ 91,500 following Nvidia's report. Ether (ETH) also recovered above 3,000Â after briefly sinking belowÂ $2,900. AI bubble concerns persist Despite the rally, skepticism remains. InvestorÂ Michael Burryâfamous for predicting the 2008 housing crashârecently accused AI-driven firms of understating data center depreciation to inflate earnings. Nvidia's Kress countered, highlighting theÂ long operational lifespanÂ of its GPUs due toÂ CUDA software updates, noting that evenÂ six-year-old A100 chipsÂ remain in active use. Meanwhile, major investors are cashing out: Peter Thiel's hedge fundÂ dumped itsÂ $100 million Nvidia stake. SoftBankÂ sold its entireÂ $5.8 billion positionÂ to fund its own AI ambitions. AI workforce disruption looms While Nvidia's success underscores AI's explosive growth, analysts warn of its societal impact. AI is rapidly displacing human rolesâfrom customer service (handlingÂ 80% to 90% of inquiries) to creative fields like writing and design. As Huang noted, AI is "doing everything, all at once"âraising questions about long-term employment stability. According to BrightU.AI's Enoch, analysts are warning about AI's societal impact due to several pressing concerns that stem from the rapid advancement and increasing integration of artificial intelligence into our daily lives. These warnings can be categorized into several key areas: job displacement and economic inequality, privacy and surveillance, bias and discrimination, autonomous weapons and warfare, existential risk and misinformation and manipulation. To mitigate these risks, it is crucial to promote ethical AI development, advocate for strong regulations and oversight, and foster public dialogue about the societal impacts of AI. Nvidia's earnings reaffirm its dominance in the AI revolution, but whether this rally is sustainable remains uncertain. With GPU demand still red-hot and miners diversifying into AI, the marketâs optimism may persistâfor now. Yet, as history shows, bubbles inevitably burst. Investors riding the AI wave should tread carefully, recognizing both its transformative potential and disruptive consequences.

Crypto-linked equitiesÂ rebounded, with Coinbase (COIN), MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Circle Internet Group (CRCL) edging higher. Bitcoin mining stocksÂ saw dramatic jumps, led byÂ Cipher Mining (+13%),Â IREN (+10%) andÂ Marathon Digital (+4%), as miners pivot toward AI data center operations. Bitcoin itself clawed back from aÂ 24-hour low of $88,540âits first dip below $89,000 since late AprilâtoÂ 91,500 following Nvidia's report. Ether (ETH) also recovered above 3,000Â after briefly sinking belowÂ $2,900. AI bubble concerns persist Despite the rally, skepticism remains. InvestorÂ Michael Burryâfamous for predicting the 2008 housing crashârecently accused AI-driven firms of understating data center depreciation to inflate earnings. Nvidia's Kress countered, highlighting theÂ long operational lifespanÂ of its GPUs due toÂ CUDA software updates, noting that evenÂ six-year-old A100 chipsÂ remain in active use. Meanwhile, major investors are cashing out: Peter Thiel's hedge fundÂ dumped itsÂ $100 million Nvidia stake. SoftBankÂ sold its entireÂ $5.8 billion positionÂ to fund its own AI ambitions. AI workforce disruption looms While Nvidia's success underscores AI's explosive growth, analysts warn of its societal impact. AI is rapidly displacing human rolesâfrom customer service (handlingÂ 80% to 90% of inquiries) to creative fields like writing and design. As Huang noted, AI is "doing everything, all at once"âraising questions about long-term employment stability. According to BrightU.AI's Enoch, analysts are warning about AI's societal impact due to several pressing concerns that stem from the rapid advancement and increasing integration of artificial intelligence into our daily lives. These warnings can be categorized into several key areas: job displacement and economic inequality, privacy and surveillance, bias and discrimination, autonomous weapons and warfare, existential risk and misinformation and manipulation. To mitigate these risks, it is crucial to promote ethical AI development, advocate for strong regulations and oversight, and foster public dialogue about the societal impacts of AI. Nvidia's earnings reaffirm its dominance in the AI revolution, but whether this rally is sustainable remains uncertain. With GPU demand still red-hot and miners diversifying into AI, the marketâs optimism may persistâfor now. Yet, as history shows, bubbles inevitably burst. Investors riding the AI wave should tread carefully, recognizing both its transformative potential and disruptive consequences.

He emphasized that AI adoption is accelerating globally, stating, "We've entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fastâwith more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once." CFOÂ Colette KressÂ added that Nvidia's Blackwell Ultra architecture is now its leading platform, while older Blackwell models continue to see strong demand.

Title: Tesla's robotaxi clears a key hurdle in Nevada
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-robotaxi-dmv-approval-nevada-autonomous-cars-self-certification-2025-11
Time Published: 2025-11-21T05:11:39Z

Tesla just got one step closer to deploying its robotaxis commercially in Nevada. Tesla completed the self-certification process for the robotaxi in Nevada, a DMV representative told Business Insider. This step means the company can deploy an autonomous car on Nevada roads, but it still needs approval from the Nevada Transportation Authority to operate commercially. A spokesperson for the NTA told Business Insider that Tesla has yet to submit an application for the permit. Clearing self-certification in Nevada comes as CEO Elon Musk aims to expand ride-hailing in up to 10 metropolitan areas by the end of the year, with a fleet of more than 1,000 vehicles. "We expect to be operating in Nevada and Florida and Arizona by the end of the year," Musk said on an October earnings call. Tesla's robotaxis are operating commercially in San Francisco and Austin. The company is hiring in cities such as Las Vegas, Dallas, Houston, Tampa, and Orlando, as it ramps up the robotaxi deployment process. On Monday, Tesla received approval from the Arizona Department of Transportation to operate ride-hailing services in the state. It also submitted a "self-certification" to test its robotaxis in the state with safety drivers, a spokesperson for the department told Business Insider. Meanwhile, in California, a robotaxi war is breaking out. Uber, Tesla, and Waymo are fighting to shape robotaxi regulations in the state. Waymo, which operates self-driving taxis in San Francisco and Los Angeles, said in November that companies offering autonomous ride-hailing services should submit quarterly reports about the rides. Tesla opposed this suggestion. This week, Amazon launched its Zoox robotaxi service in San Francisco, offering select members of the public free rides. Tesla's stock price dropped about 2% on Thursday. It's up more than 15% in the past year. Update: November 21, 2025 — This story has been updated to include a statement from the NTA. Jump to

Title: Jeff Bezos-backed Physical Intelligence raises $600M to improve its AI robot brains
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/11/20/jeff-bezos-backed-physical-intelligence-raises-600m-improve-ai-robot-brains/
Time Published: 2025-11-21T02:00:56Z

UPDATED 21:00 EST / NOVEMBER 20 2025 by Mike Wheatley Robotics software startup Physical Intelligence has reportedly closed on a fresh, $600 million round of funding that brings its valuation to a lofty $5.6 billion. The company has not officially disclosed the latest round, but reports by The Information and Bloomberg cited undisclosed sources who are familiar with the matter on the details. Those sources said CapitalG, an independent growth fund operated by Alphabet Inc., led the round, with existing investors Lux Capital, Thrive Capital and Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos all returning to throw more capital at the startup. New investors Index Ventures and T. Rowe Price also participated in the round, the sources said. The startup was founded in 2024 by former Google DeepMind researchers and academics from Stanford University and the University of California at Berkeley. It’s developing artificial intelligence algorithms that can act as the “brains” of robots. The company, which is led by Chief Executive Karol Hausman, says it’s building a “general intelligence” system that will eventually be able to power any kind of robot for any kind of application. Robotics AI is a completely different kettle of fish from AI for chatbots such as ChatGPT. Because robots operate in the real world, they need to be able to learn not only from text, but also from other modalities, especially visual data, so they can perceive the physical environment they operate in and make decisions and take actions based on those inputs. Physical Intelligence has not yet announced any product or service, but Bloomberg said the company has been testing its AI software on robotic arms, performing tasks such as folding clothes, assembling boxes and making coffee. Earlier this week, the company released a new vision AI model based on reinforcement learning – a technique that enables models to improve over time as they learn from their experiences. The startup has shared a video of its robotic arms in action on X, saying that the reinforcement learning technique has helped it to double its overall throughput, or the number of tasks it can complete per hour. Our model can now learn from its own experience with RL! Our new π*0.6 model can more than double throughput over a base model trained without RL, and can perform real-world tasks: making espresso drinks, folding diverse laundry, and assembling boxes. More in the thread below. pic.twitter.com/XN1VFYQey1 — Physical Intelligence (@physical_int) November 18, 2025 In testing, Physical Intelligence said the machines were put to work for three hours, and were able to complete each task in an average of three minutes. To develop its models, the startup has spent a lot of money on gathering real-world data that’s used for training purposes. A year ago, when it raised $400 million in funding, the company said one of the biggest challenges it faces is getting enough large-scale multitask and multirobot data to train its models, and its experiments allow it to generate valuable data itself. The startup says existing robots tend to be inflexible, because they’re designed to perform only one particular task in a specific environment. They can work around small changes in their environments but can’t adapt easily to extremely messy or complex spaces such as homes or other real-world places. Physical Intelligence’s goal is to change that, using general intelligence to enable robots to learn and become acclimatized to any environment and task. The startup is not alone in thinking that AI can be used to create much more capable robots. Google LLC is also focused on robotic intelligence through its subsidiary Intrinsic, which just yesterday announced its partnering with Foxconn on a smart factory initiative. Meta Platforms Inc. is also developing AI for robots, and this week announced its latest Segment Anything computer vision models. Amazon has similar ambitions, and regularly introduces more sophisticated, AI-enabled robots in its logistics and warehouse facilities. Similarly, there are dozens of startups that compete with Physical Intelligence, with the likes of Gecko Robotics Inc., Genesis AI, Cobionix Corp. and FieldAI Inc. some of the latest to attract investment capital in recent months.

iRunFar reviews the best GPS watches for running from Garmin, Coros, Suunto, Amazfit, Apple, and Polar. A GPS watch can track various metrics before, during, and after your run and help you maximize your workouts. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi If you’re looking into options for the best GPS running watch and feeling overwhelmed by the options and their price tags, you’re not alone. As runners, many of us are deeply committed to the sport, and some of us have a thirst for our personal data rivaling the overlords at Meta. Then, others of us want a simple watch to keep track of time and maybe measure our heart rate. And then some runners choose to go with no technology at all. Regardless of where you fall on the spectrum, our testing of various GPS watches on the market will help you choose the best one for your needs and budget. When testing watches, our team looked at battery life, screen size, features, and durability. This guide builds on years of testing, comparing the latest watches to their predecessors and identifying what stands out. Our team of runners of all types analyzed which watches worked best for different situations, runner needs, and budgets. We continually update this guide as new models of watches hit the market. The Garmin Forerunner 570 is our favorite for its features, appearance, and price. If you’re looking for lower-priced options, we recommend the Suunto Run or the Amazfit T-Rex 3 Pro, as they provide a lot of features at a very reasonable price.. To learn more about the lingo associated with GPS watches, how we came up with our list of favorites, and things to consider when choosing yours, look at the how-to-choose section, frequently asked questions, and research and testing methodology below our picks. A GPS watch can let you track your data and splits throughout a run. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi Pros: Cons: While Garmin has an array of watches ranging from those with every feature imaginable to reasonably basic, the Garmin Forerunner 570 is the most complete mid-premium device designed for runners that the brand has released. Five years ago, when I began testing GPS running watches in earnest, I was what you might call a “bigger is better” person — always reaching for the largest, most spec-heavy device available for trail running. I leaned heavily on Garmin’s fēnix and Enduro lines, including the Garmin fēnix 7 Solar Edition and the Garmin fēnix 8 AMOLED. I still respect how capable those adventure watches are, but over time, my priorities shifted. I’ve come to appreciate smaller, more running-focused designs with cleaner interfaces, less gimmickry — think solar-powered glass — and far more reasonable price tags. A thousand-dollar adventure watch just isn’t what most runners actually need. But one thing hasn’t changed, though: I still think Garmin makes the best all-around GPS running watch. Competing offerings from Coros, Suunto, and Amazfit are improving every year, but Garmin continues to dominate when it comes to accuracy, training depth, and ecosystem strength. The Forerunner 570 feels like the true sweet spot — bringing the precision and intelligence of Garmin’s fēnix and Epix lines to a lighter, more comfortable watch focused squarely on all runners. The 570 is lightweight and easy to wear all day, and it has an upgraded AMOLED display that’s bright without being overdone. It’s readable in intense sun, under dense tree cover, and at night without glare or blown-out contrast. Garmin’s classic five-button interface is still a huge advantage, especially while wearing gloves or trying to operate the watch while running on uneven surfaces. Weighing 50 grams, it’s a watch you forget you’re wearing. The 570 separates itself in GPS accuracy and trail performance. Garmin’s multi-band and multi-GNSS chipset now appears in this mid-tier model, offering the kind of precision you once had to buy a fēnix to get. Road pacing stays remarkably stable, even during surges or structured intervals. On the trail, the watch handles canyons, tree cover, switchbacks, and altitude shifts with impressive consistency. Satellite lock is near-instant, and track quality remains clean and believable even in environments that confuse cheaper sensors. Battery life continues the “just right” approach. You get 18 hours in all-systems GNSS and multi-band GPS mode, and about 11 days of use in smartwatch mode — enough for marathons, 50k races, and long training weeks without constant charging. Garmin’s training ecosystem remains unmatched, and the auto-climb feature stands out for trail runners, breaking climbs into segments so you can pace strategically. Navigation is another major strength, with offline maps, turn-by-turn routing, and seamless compatibility with Garmin Connect and Strava. The 570 isn’t flawless. Before a September race, I loaded my PacePro plan only for the watch to freeze at the starting line and becoming useless until it auto-restarted twenty minutes later, costing me several recorded miles. And offline Spotify integration, one of my must-have Garmin features, still suffers occasional playback interruptions. These frustrations stand out because the rest of the watch works so seamlessly. The Forerunner 570 balances elite accuracy, powerful training tools, excellent navigation, and comfort better than any other watch I’ve tested this year. It’s the most complete GPS running watch of 2025 — and the clear top pick. Pros: Cons: At its core, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 remains a productivity smartwatch designed for endurance athletes who want rugged hardware, deep health tracking, and outstanding GPS performance. The new Ultra 3 isn’t a radical departure from the Apple Watch Ultra 2, but a few key upgrades improve its functionality. Compared to the Ultra 2, this model offers longer battery life, a faster S10 processor, more storage, a larger and more efficient display, and, most excitedly for ultrarunners and backcountry athletes, emergency satellite connectivity. When off-grid, this watch can reach satellites to send messages, share your location, and communicate with emergency services — and it can do this all without your phone. While we haven’t had a chance to test this feature on this specific watch, we’ve been impressed with the reliability of the satellite communications of iPhones with similar technology. For trail runners, hikers, and anyone who ventures into remote terrain, this is a meaningful safety upgrade. The watch keeps the safety features of the previous version, like crash detection, fall detection, and an 86-decibel siren. Battery life is a tangible improvement this year. Apple claims up to 42 hours of regular use, 72 hours in low-power mode, and up to 14 hours of continuous GPS tracking with heart rate monitoring. If you need a longer tracking time, you can put the watch in low power mode where it makes fewer GPS and heart rate readings, and the battery will last up to 35 hours. The watch’s charging is faster now too, and runners can expect an 80% charge in about 45 minutes. For the display, a new OLED panel with a thinner bezel makes room for a slightly larger screen. The always-on mode now updates every second, which makes watch faces and data fields easier to read during a run. As before, brightness is excellent, and the touchscreen is quick and responsive — though still not ideal with wet hands or gloves. Some familiar drawbacks remain with the Apple Watch Ultra 3. You still need an Apple device to activate it, mapping and routing still lag behind dedicated sports watches, you can’t natively upload a route to follow during a workout, and the compass workaround requires manual juggling between apps. But as an all-in-one device, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 is outstanding. Running with only this watch and earbuds — with music, calls, messages, and safety features fully onboard — remains one of its biggest strengths. If you’re upgrading from a non-Ultra Apple Watch, the leap is a big one. For Ultra 2 owners, the decision to upgrade comes down to how much you value the better battery, larger display, and satellite safety features. Overall, this is the most capable Ultra watch yet — a rugged and connected device that can handle daily training and save your bacon in the backcountry without carrying an auxiliary device like a Garmin InReach. Pros: Cons: The Coros Apex 4 combines running-specific performance features with the ruggedness needed for mountain-sport athletes. In Coros’s athlete matrix, it’s not the Eliud Kipchoge or the Tommy Caldwell — it’s the Kilian Jornet: a blended runner, climber, and skier who goes long or short in a variety of environments. It showcases Coros’s most up-to-date technology — voice alerts, calls, voice pins, improved sensors, and more — wrapped in one distinctly low-tech choice by 2025 standards: a MIP display. In fact, it’s only one of two watches in this entire guide without an AMOLED display, and while that’s a matter of visual preference, the low-tech display’s impact on battery life is undeniably an advantage. The watch sits in the mid-tier price bracket and is competitive with its peers in some ways, and behind in others. That said, it’s also the strongest updates we’ve seen this year, bringing Coros’s newest features into a watch that’s far more usable for runners than the company’s newest outdoor flagship device, the Nomad. Having fully crossed over into the AMOLED era, I was legitimately shocked by the MIP display. Nearly every watch I’ve tested in the past two years has arrived with a bright, phone-like AMOLED panel. I was so surprised by the Apex 4’s dimness that I texted iRunFar founder and Gear Editor Bryon Powell to confirm whether it was just me. Bryon, not an AMOLED acolyte, finds the display perfectly suitable. It’s worth noting that the Apex 4 has no brightness adjustment, though runners can toggle a white background for slight improvement. The Apex 4 uses super-strong sapphire glass for exceptional durability and scratch-resistance, and is the same glass used on Coros’s highest-end mountain watches. Coros also adds the Action Button on the lower left side of the case that gives quick access to frequently used features — including your maps, saved pins, and any shortcuts you configure. For runners and mountain athletes who prefer tactile control over touchscreen swipes, the new button is a meaningful usability upgrade that makes mid-run navigation or note-taking dramatically more efficient. If maximizing battery is a priority, the Apex 4 is a better bet than Coros’s AMOLED models and offers 41 hours of GPS use. Satellite lock is near-instant, cornering is accurate, and elevation data is stable. In road, foothill, and track testing, it performed on par with the Coros Pace Pro and significantly better than older Apex models. It’s not quite to the level of Suunto Vertical 2 in extreme terrain, but everywhere else, it’s excellent. The Apex 4 debuts Coros’s most ambitious voice-tech package to date, and it’s genuinely useful. Voice alerts read out splits, laps, and heart rate zone changes clearly enough that you rarely need to look at the screen. You can answer calls via Bluetooth and dictate short voice pins mid-run, which sync to the app automatically. For trail runners who want to capture route notes, conditions, or nutrition reminders, voice pins are one of Coros’s best new features. The Apex 4 also brings Coros’s best mapping experience yet. Scrolling is fluid, labels are clearer than on any previous Apex, and map detail has been meaningfully upgraded. While AMOLED watches will always look sharper, the MIP maps remain surprisingly readable and deliver far superior battery endurance during navigation-heavy outings. The Apex 4 is Coros’s most complete iteration in this series. If you prioritize battery life, reliable GPS, excellent mapping, rugged durability, handy hardware controls, and surprisingly effective voice tech over a pretty screen, it’s one of the best performing watches of 2025. Pros: Cons: The Coros Vertix 2S is an upgrade on the previous watch in this category, the Coros Vertix 2. With improved GPS accuracy and the newest optical heart rate monitor, this watch’s updates are relatively minor. That said, we loved the last version, and this watch keeps everything we appreciated about its predecessor. We acknowledge that this probably isn’t a pure runner’s watch, but people who go on long adventures will use and appreciate the many features. The new upgrades actually decrease the battery life of this watch. Still, it has 118 hours of battery in standard GPS mode — nine hours less than the previous model. Much of the decrease comes from the new optical heart rate monitor sensor. The watch uses an algorithm to account for your running cadence to edit out the extraneous noise that often affects wrist heart rate measurements. We’ve always found this line of Coros watches to be the most accurate when navigating terrain without a clear view of the sky, like slot canyons in Utah. Compared to watches from other brands, its pings seemed to jump around far less. The body of this watch features sapphire glass and a titanium bezel, making it extremely rugged. It makes it less-than-ideal for casual wear for most people, but you can trust it to stand up to the rigors of the mountains. The 1.4-inch screen is larger than most others on the market and will dwarf smaller wrists, and some of our testers had a hard time fitting it through the wrist holes of shirts they were wearing. The large face does provide plenty of space to see up to eight data fields at once, and it makes navigation a little easier on the eyes. If you don’t like to charge your watch often or want one to accompany you on long adventure runs, fastpacks, or other multi-day expeditions, the battery life and features of the Coros Vertix 2S can’t be beaten. You can read more about the details of this watch in our in-depth Coros Vertix 2S review. Pros: Cons: One of the bigger surprises in the GPS watch market this year has been the Amazfit T-Rex 3 Pro. The watch offers the capabilities of a Garmin fēnix at a far more accessible price. With competitive battery life, one of the most stunning displays on any watch I’ve tested, and deep biometric analytics, the brand makes a compelling case as the best value in performance wearables right now. What immediately stands out is the 1.5-inch AMOLED display. It’s the brightest and most vivid screen we’ve tested, with contrast and sharpness that make traditional MIPS displays feel muted by comparison. If you’re coming from a Garmin fēnix, Coros Apex or Vertix, or any non-AMOLED device, one glance at the T-Rex 3 Pro is like a jolt of espresso — colors pop, maps are actually enjoyable to navigate, and data fields are legible at every angle. Amazfit has spent the past few years quietly reinventing itself from a budget-friendly alternative into a legitimate challenger to the legacy GPS brands. The design is bold and armored, albeit a tad chintzy — kind of like a generic PC next to a cutting-edge looking Apple — but it’s much more refined than previous generations. Amazfit uses sapphire glass on this rugged trail model, and durability appears excellent so far. I haven’t crash-tested it with a full trail wipeout, but after several scrapes against granite and sandstone, the lens remains completely scratch-free. Under open skies, accuracy is strong, pacing is stable, and satellite lock is quick. On dense, winding trails, the watch still performs well overall, though it doesn’t quite match Garmin’s top chipsets. Occasional micro-wobbles happen in tough conditions, but they’re rare. What stands out most is the responsiveness — pace changes register quickly without smoothing or lag, a feature that has historically held back value-tier watches. Battery life remains one of Amazfit’s defining advantages, with up to 38 hours of dual-band GPS use. With dual-band GPS and always-on display active, the T-Rex 3 Pro still lasts multiple training days before needing a charge. With settings optimized, stretching it beyond a week is easy. Amazfit’s health and training ecosystem — built on parent company Zepp’s operating system — continues to mature. Stress scores, sleep tracking, recovery metrics, and training load estimates are all here. Garmin still leads in coaching and long-term analytics, but the Zepp app presents data in a clean and intuitive manner, and the overall experience is smooth. Navigation features include turn-by-turn guidance, offline maps, and reliable syncing with popular route platforms. Smartwatch features like notifications, weather, music control, and a growing Zepp OS app library round out the package and make the watch feel far more premium than its price. The T-Rex 3 Pro represents the most polished version of Amazfit’s identity: bold, durable, extraordinarily bright, and packed with functionality. It doesn’t quite match Garmin’s ecosystem depth, but no other brand delivers this level of performance, ruggedness, and battery life for the price. Pros: Cons: Suunto has long been known for its rugged, mountain-ready — and sometimes comically bulky looking on normal or small wrists — multisport watches, and the Suunto Run takes a refreshing U-turn toward almost extreme minimalism. If you have used a Suunto in the past, taking the Run out of the box will have you double-checking your assumptions, and actually wearing the Run — with its super-comfortable, soft nylon strap — will reveal its key advantage. At only 36 grams with the textile ban, it is easily the lightest watch in this buyer’s guide, though the new Coros Pace 4 takes the lightest title this year at 32 grams. As for performance, it also ramps up processing power and has a decreased lag time while in an activity and scrolling through data pages. The AMOLED display is brilliantly bright and very easy to read, with large digits and uncluttered data fields that make quick glances simple. The interface is intuitive, and menus are structured logically enough to learn the watch in minutes. It truly prioritizes activity — not bells and whistles — so much so that you can navigate to start a run in just one click. Build quality is far better than expected at this price, with a sturdy polymer case, stainless steel bezel, Gorilla glass, and strong water and impact resistance. GPS accuracy is one of the watch’s strongest attributes. Suunto’s heritage in navigation shows even in this entry-level model. The watch has a dual-band multi-GNSS chipset — awesome for a watch at this price point — allowing it to lock onto the best available satellites for optimal accuracy. Post-run syncing and processing speed are historically two of Suunto’s biggest pain points. Both are improved but still the slowest among the watches in this guide. Compared to other watches in this guide, the Suunto Run’s battery life is just average. You can expect about 20 hours of GPS runtime in the highest-accuracy dual-band satellite mode with bio-monitoring and brightness features on high, and you’ll get upward of 40 hours with the power-saving GPS mode enabled. Training features focus on essentials rather than advanced analytics. A reliable optical heart-rate sensor, basic recovery indicators, structured interval support, and suggested workouts give new runners everything they need to build fitness safely. Pace, distance, cadence, and effort metrics sync seamlessly to platforms like the Suunto app, Strava, and TrainingPeaks. The Suunto Run nails exactly what beginners need: accuracy, durability, simplicity, and value. It feels intentionally designed to remove friction, reduce distractions, and give new runners a trustworthy, confidence-building tool. For anyone buying their first GPS device or returning to running with a desire for clarity and ease, this is the most compelling entry-level option. Pros: Cons: At around $600 (stainless steel) and $700 (titanium), the Suunto Vertical 2 brings the brand’s strongest hardware to date, with their latest chipsets, sensors, and processing power. GPS accuracy is exceptional, and the new heart-rate sensor finally produces readings that rival your old chest strap. There’s plenty of onboard storage for free worldwide maps — though downloading a state-sized region like Colorado still takes close to an hour over Wi-Fi. Battery life is outstanding, providing nearly 60 hours of continuous, full-accuracy GPS on a single charge, and over 200 hours in the deepest power-saving modes. Design is where the Vertical 2 truly separates itself. Suunto continues to favor clean geometry, symmetry, and subtle material transitions. Suunto has unveiled a raft of new watches over the last few years, expanding their options to meet runners and outdoor athletes with new price points and features that better match a wide variety of needs. With all its new watches, Suunto has retained its Scandinavian design aesthetic, which, to me, still presents the most premium, cleanest, and aesthetically pleasing GPS watches on the market. A major part of Suunto’s design aesthetic now centers around the AMOLED display. Suunto has rolled out the display across its entire running and outdoor line and has even said it likely won’t produce another MIP device again. That’s great news for fans of crystal-clear brightness and HD-quality mapping, though a concern if you prefer the softer, less power-hungry feel of MIP screens. Still, on a 1.5-inch display — the largest in this guide — AMOLED looks outstanding. And since the Vertical 2 no longer uses the solar energy-collecting glass found on the first Vertical, Suunto reclaimed even more space for visibility and mapping detail on the front panel. Despite its substantial size, the Vertical 2 sits flatter and more naturally on the wrist than earlier Suunto giants thanks to tapered walls and angles. The thick silicone strap remains one of the best in the industry: soft, slightly stretchy, and secure. It’s comfortable enough to be positioned on the wrist where the heart rate sensor sits best. The three widely spaced metal buttons maintain Suunto’s minimalist ethos and provide a firm, glove-friendly click. Suunto has added a feature that seems small but becomes indispensable once you use it: a very bright front-of-unit flashlight — as opposed to the backlight-based flashlight on the Suunto Race series. With multiple brightness settings, it’s remarkable for navigating camp or just making it to the bathroom in the middle of the night without your phone. As you might expect, this is a watch that harkens back to Suunto’s past: a huge display, a thick, ultra-comfortable strap, and a bomb-proof bezel. But it pairs that classic ruggedness with modern components, one of the best displays in the category, and a level of industrial design that remains unique to Suunto. Shop the Suunto Vertical 2 - stainless steelShop the Vertical 2 - titanium Pros: Cons: Coming from a brand that used to dominate fitness devices 15 years ago, the Polar Grit X2 is a return to the competitive end of the market for the company. Polar has existed as a fitness device brand for over 50 years, but seemed to lose its footing around the 2010s when you couldn’t line up to a running, cycling, or other endurance activity or race without seeing a Polar heart rate chest strap, cadence monitor, bike computer, or wrist watch attached to nearly every athlete in the field. Since then, Polar has been flat-out eclipsed by a core set of running watch brands that have been faster to react, market, and innovate for modern customers. Despite getting overtaken by Coros, Garmin, Suunto, and even Apple, Polar has quietly produced some excellent devices over the past couple of years with competitive features and a software ecosystem that could be described as quirky — in a good way! The Grit X2 took a long time to make it to the United States market after becoming available in Europe early in the year. The scuttlebutt suggests that some tenuous trade agreements could be behind the delay, as well as the cost. At $800 the Grit X2 is very expensive, though it is the “affordable” option behind its even more expensive sibling, the Grit X2 Pro, which comes in at $1,000. The X2 is a tad lighter, smaller, and slower compared to the Grit X2 Pro, but it has the same gorgeous AMOLED display and a highly adequate battery life of around 30 hours in its best performance mode. The Grit X2 — like the Suunto Vertical 2 and Coros Apex 4 — is a capable running watch that also plays well in other mountain sports settings. The watch’s Scandinavian design is similar in some ways to Suunto’s balance of rugged but not bulky. It has a 1.28-inch display protected by sapphire glass, and it has proven to be extremely easy to read in bright sunlight and has withstood a couple big diggers. Despite all this toughness, it remains wearable for everyday use, and the tactile buttons are optimized for gloved hands, making it truly a watch that can handle city streets, mountain summits, and everything in between. In short, the Polar Grit X2 is a well-rounded, highly capable watch that deserves more attention from outdoor athletes and runners alike. It proves that Polar can still compete with the biggest names in the industry. While it may not have dominated headlines like Garmin or Apple over the past decade, the Grit X2 quietly delivers on all fronts: accurate dual-band GPS chipset, advanced biosensing, robust navigation, and rugged durability. The Coros Vertix 2S offers a wide range of features and great battery life but is too big for casual wear for many.

Photo: iRunFar/Christin Randall Accuracy What we fundamentally want from the best GPS watch for running is to correctly measure a run’s distance, pace, and elevation change. Thanks to incredible innovation in satellite technology and specific algorithms designed for sports by watch manufacturers, we now have incredibly complex technology in a package small enough for your wrist. Even relatively inexpensive watches like the Suunto Run have exceptional GPS accuracy. When it comes to accuracy, we’re often perplexed when, after trail running with a friend, we compare distance and vertical gain and see different results. This is sometimes a function of different brands’ technology, but it is often a function of battery power-saving modes, the number of GPS readings per minute you’ve selected, or the default settings on your watch. Utilizing the maximum location measurement frequency will sap a watch battery, but while spacing out the readings is easier on the battery, it creates a less precise track. Obstructions in the sky, like trees or even clouds, can affect GPS accuracy, and the industry suggests GPS accuracy is within 1% to 3%. Manufacturers recommend importing your data to a run-specific app, like Garmin Connect or the Suunto App, to corroborate your data with more sophisticated elevation models. We found that the most accurate GPS watch we tested was the Coros Vertix 2S, especially in areas where we didn’t have a clear view of the sky. Battery Life Battery life is arguably the most prized feature for ultrarunners looking for the best GPS watch. Fortunately, we are in something of a battery life golden age. Every major GPS watch company seeks to one-up their competitor to own the title of longest-lasting battery. This competition benefits the customer, as we’re not only getting batteries that can last up to 118 hours of normal GPS use, as with the Coros Vertix 2S, but they also charge incredibly fast. When just a few years ago, companies would boast about 15 to 20 hours of battery life, and their watches might take three to five hours to charge from dead, we’re getting massive increases in battery life and equally as big drops in charging time. The Suunto Vertical 2 can go from dead to fully charged in under an hour and will then measure over 60 hours of activity. Companies’ claims about battery life represent use with standard GPS tracking alone, without the additional battery demands of using navigation, receiving notifications, or playing music. Rather than manually tuning your watch to the best or worst battery performance, many manufacturers have preset battery modes that allow you to select the performance level you require based on your activity or the remaining battery power on the watch. Suunto watches are known for their sleek, Scandinavian designs. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi Comfort Years ago, GPS watches looked like tiny computers on your wrist, and some, like the Suunto Vertical 2, are continuing to lean into the rugged and large aesthetic. As time passes, GPS watch sizes are getting more compact, and breakthroughs in technical performance are shrinking the package while adding new features. Many brands offer different strap styles in addition to the normal silicone one, including nylon and other soft-style straps with elastic and hook-and-loop closures. These styles can add comfort and a more precise fit. The best example of this is the band included with the Suunto Run — it’s so light and comfortable you might forget you’re wearing it. All the watches in this guide are comfortable enough to wear all day, but the appropriateness of wearing a GPS watch to work or other life commitments varies depending on the user. Watches like the Suunto Run or the Polar Grit X2 are small and stylish enough to wear in everyday life, while many people would shy away from wearing the Suunto Vertical 2 or similar rugged-looking watches in casual settings. Ease of Use The incredible technology in the best GPS running watches means there can be a learning curve to taking advantage of their full functionality. Not a single watch here is simple enough to pull out of the box and use all of the features immediately. You might be able to record a run — but what next? Do you use the watch’s corresponding app to synchronize it? Do you make adjustments in the watch itself or with the app? Is it a combination of both? These are questions you’ll need to sort out as you begin accessing features on your watch and learning its capabilities. The Suunto Run is one of the simplest watches to learn to use. With so many options and the amount of data provided, it even takes time to remember which buttons control selections and navigate forward or back. Some watches have a bold start/stop button distinct from the others. The watches in this guide use buttons, scrolling dials, touchscreens, or a combination of all three to operate. Buttons are simple to use on the fly, but dials, like on the Coros Apex 4, can be tricky to use quickly. Buttons are generally big and responsive, with some performing much better than others. The watches in this guide with touchscreens generally work well even in wet or cold conditions. Extra Features and App Compatibility Each watch in this guide has a corresponding mobile app that can do everything from downloading your runs and sharing with a third-party app like Strava to designing and synchronizing routes. The apps can also control the colors and display of the watch face and synchronize firmware. Many watches have a coaching component that allows you to customize your workout or download workouts directly from professional athletes. The Polar Grit X2 has a suite of features, including hydration tracking and menstrual cycle tracking. Several watches in this guide can sync offline playlists from streaming services like Spotify, or have built-in storage for music playback. Some watches, including the Apple Watch Ultra 3 and the Garmin Forerunner 570, have Mobile Pay. iRunFar’s Meghan Hicks tests the Coros Vertix 2 in the slot canyons of Utah. We found it to provide more accurate GPS tracking than other watches in areas like slot canyons. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi We at iRunFar are GPS running watch aficionados with a long history of testing watches. Many of our team members love pouring over running data, and we use our watches to collect accurate metrics of our runs and health. For the initial version of this guide, we combined our more than 100 years of GPS running watch field testing with polls of the iRunFar community to see what everyone thought was the best GPS running watch on the market. We selected nearly a dozen highly vetted watches for rigorous summer, fall, winter, and spring testing. We tested these watches in climates from the densely forested northwestern United States to the cold, dry, and variable seasons of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. We took different GPS watches out in difficult terrain, like slot canyons in Utah and mountains in Bhutan, to see if there was a difference in accuracy in places where they didn’t get a clear view of the sky. We evaluated the watches based on their features, price, comfort, processing speed, accuracy, navigation capabilities, battery life, and compatibility with third-party apps. We continue to test new watches and update this guide when needed. What is a GPS watch, and why is it helpful in trail running and ultrarunning? Besides shorts and shoes, many runners consider a GPS watch a fundamental piece of running gear. It lets you easily and accurately record your runs and see important data. like pace and elevation gain, while you’re out there. The data synchronizes with popular apps, allowing you to compare or log your information securely. It’s a training log that doesn’t take up physical space. Moreover, the watches in this guide work for more than just running. They track tons of other sports, such as paddleboarding, yoga, and cycling, and collect the unique metrics associated with each activity. Every watch in this guide can significantly improve your understanding of your body and training. The Garmin Forerunner 570 combines a lot of useful features for a reasonably competitive price. This is not to suggest that trail or ultrarunning requires a GPS watch. For many, the invasion of more and more data in our lives is becoming burdensome and tiring. A pen-and-paper training journal combined with a simple stopwatch or using your smartphone with any number of free run-recording apps is much more inexpensive and simple. The Suunto Race has a variety of activity options besides running. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi Which running watch has the best GPS? Each watch tested in this guide does a fine job of tracking your run. Positioning in these watches is usually acquired through one or a combination of the five major satellite systems (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS, and Beidou). Different satellite systems have variable accuracy in different areas of the world. Incremental differences appear between all of the watches, even on the same activity, yet none of the watches tested here has an outlying poor output. The Coros Vertix 2S has a feature that seeks to combat satellite interference, whether it’s from a dense forest or a deep canyon, by utilizing all five satellite systems at once. Choosing the best GPS watch could almost be more a matter of what else it has beyond good GPS accuracy, since there isn’t a poor performer among the bunch in this guide. Apple watches can provide the same tracking and health metrics of top GPS watches. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi I want to race my first ultramarathon. Which GPS running watch should I use? Many people will simply use their phone and the app like Strava for their first ultra. This is a low-cost and simple way to use a piece of hardware you already own and are probably going to carry regardless. The drawback is that your phone has a battery that probably won’t last beyond 50k. If you’re new to ultrarunning and simply looking for the best GPS running watch for reliability and affordability, the Suunto Run and Garmin Forerunner 570 are excellent and affordable options. You won’t get all the fancy features of the highest-end watches, but you’ll get enough battery to last nearly any ultra. The Amazfit T-Rex 3 Pro also packs in a lot of features at a reasonable price point. For ultrarunners who want to get the most technology, data, and performance out of their races and training, this guide has some truly exceptional options, namely the Suunto Vertical 2 and Coros Vertix 2S. What’s the difference between a fitness tracker and a running watch? This is a question mainly regarding features. Fitness trackers have come a long way and are more affordable than any watches tested in this guide. But their downside is that they rely heavily on pairing with a phone to draw out similar features that are built directly into GPS watches. The health and sleep monitoring features of the Amazfit T-Rex 3 Pro and the Polar Grit X2 can give you much of the information that dedicated fitness trackers provide. From intervals to health metrics, GPS watches can measure and track all of your data. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi Which is the most accurate GPS watch? When comparing all of the watches tested here on the same 25-kilometer run, not a single one had exact fidelity when comparing the GPX track to the trail marked on Mapbox, the commercial map provider for everything from Strava to the navigation system in your car. In some cases, the track showed a tester crossing an alpine lake, which they didn’t, or taking a very long detour around part of a forest. You might expect the same brand of watches to provide the same output, but that wasn’t the case. There were deviations between watches across the board. We found that the advanced GPS system of the Coros Vertix 2S outperformed other watches when it came to difficult conditions, such as in slot canyons or under heavy tree cover. Two of our testers who run together frequently find that a Coros watch consistently measures more distance when compared to a Garmin, but the Garmin reports more elevation gain. The consistency of the variability points toward differences in the algorithms used by the watches to calculate these numbers. The industry says that most GPS watches are accurate within 1% to 3%, which explains the deviation in watches, even when tested simultaneously. A few watches have special features to improve their accuracy. Suunto employs its “Snap to Route,” where you could take a GPX file, load it into the watch, and then navigate that course while you run. This is a clever way to ensure that your run is as faithful to the intended route as possible, and it minimizes error due to satellite reception and other variables, like clouds, buildings, or other obstructions. We asked the Garmin product manager to explain the differences between measurements of different watches on the same course. They said, “There are numerous challenges in forming an elevation profile over a long trail run or ultramarathon, like effects of weather over longer periods and how the watch is worn (for example, if the barometer port is up against clothing).” They continued, “Because of these sources of error, we expect differences in the total ascent between runners, and these can add up over long-distance runs. On the distance side, GPS accuracy is the biggest thing. User settings, type of device, which arm the user is wearing the watch, running form, and environment (tree cover can affect the line of sight to satellites) can all affect accuracy.” The Garmin Forerunner 165 Music is a great entry-level GPS watch that is simple to navigate and use. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi These watches are so expensive! What is the best budget running watch? You’ll have to spend some money to get a reasonable GPS watch, though there are major variations in the price points among the different options. Chiefly, the ever-mind-blowing strength of their batteries that dictate the cost, plus a suite of other features that help you understand your physiology, including heart rate and blood oxygen saturation. A GPS watch can replace your phone as a podcast or music device, and they are incredibly durable with their titanium, steel, and sapphire materials. The Amazfit T-Rex 3 Pro offers many of the features of a high-end watch at a much lower price. What’s the best running watch for small wrists? Many GPS watches, like the Coros Vertix 2S, have big displays that look massive on even average-sized wrists. The large size makes it easier to see a lot of data and to navigate with offline maps. The Suunto Run, with a much sleeker design, won’t swallow smaller wrists. These two are at opposite ends of the price spectrum, separated by about $400. In the end, the best GPS running watch for you will be one that you’re comfortable wearing, so it’s worth considering fit when choosing one. Both road and trail runners can benefit from the data collected by a GPS watch. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi What GPS running watch best integrates with smart technology so that I can stay connected while running? All the watches in this guide — including the least expensive Suunto Run — display notifications from incoming calls, text messages, and emails on their screens. You must connect the watch to your smartphone via Bluetooth for this to work. The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is essentially a phone on your wrist. I am bad with technology. What running watch is the easiest to use? If ultrarunning is your primary sport, many of these GPS watches are overbuilt for what you actually need in terms of features. The Garmin Forerunner 570 is one of the more pared-down of these options, but it still has all of the features a runner needs. The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is also an excellent option for those who struggle with technology. Like most Apple products, it provides a great user experience, and the dedicated action button makes it easy to put it on your wrist and go. It will still interpret your daily data, including sleep, and can guide you in improving your fitness and health. Related articles: Craig Randall is a Gear Editor and Buyer’s Guide Writer at iRunFar.

Title: Bubble fears ease but investors still waiting for AI to live up to its promise
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/11/20/nvidia-ai-bellwether/
Time Published: 2025-11-20T22:10:35Z

By MICHAEL LIEDTKE Fears about the artificial intelligence boom turning into an overblown bubble have diminished for now, thanks to a stellar earnings report from Nvidia that illustrated why its indispensable chips transformed it into the world’s most valuable company. But that doesn’t mean the specter of an AI bubble won’t return in the months and years ahead as Big Tech gears up to spend trillions of dollars more on a technology the industry’s leaders believe will determine the winners and losers during the next wave of innovation. For now, at least, Nvidia has eased worries that the AI craze propelling the stock market and much of the economy for the past year is on the verge of a massive collapse. If anything, Nvidia’s quarterly report indicated that AI spending is picking up even more momentum. The highlights, released late Wednesday, included quarterly revenue of $57 billion, a 62% increase from the same time last year. That sales growth was an acceleration from the 56% increase in year-over-year revenue from the May-July quarter. What’s more, Nvidia forecast revenue of $65 billion for the current quarter covering November-January, which would be a 65% year-over-year increase. Given Nvidia’s forecasts, “it is very hard to see how this stock does not keep moving higher from here,” according to analysts at UBS led by Timothy Arcuri. The UBS analyst also said the “AI infrastructure tide is still rising so fast that all boats will be lifted.” Nvidia’s numbers are viewed through a window that extends far beyond the Santa Clara, California, company’s headquarters because its products are needed by a wide range of companies — including Big Tech peers like Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta Platforms — to build data centers that are becoming known as AI factories. “AI spending isn’t just holding up, it’s accelerating. That’s exactly what the market needed to see,” said Jake Behan, head of capital markets for investment firm Direxion. The numbers initially lifted Nvidia’s stock price by as much as 5% in Thursday’s trading, while other tech stocks tied to the AI spending frenzy also got a boost. But Nvidia’s shares and other tech stocks reversed course later in the session as investors found other issues besides AI, such as the government’s latest jobs report and the future direction of interest rates. Even with a 3% drop in its stock price amid the broader market decline, Nvidia remains valued at $4.4 trillion, more than 10 times its valuation three years ago when OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot, triggering the biggest technological shift since Apple released the iPhone in 2007. Nvidia’s rapid rise has turned its CEO Jensen Huang into the chief evangelist for the AI revolution and he sought to use his bully pulpit during a late Wednesday conference call with industry analysts to make a case that the spending to make technology with humanlike intelligence is just beginning. “There’s been a lot of talk about an AI bubble. From our vantage point, we see something very different,” Huang insisted while celebrating “depth and breadth” of Nvidia’s growth. Huang is hardly a lone voice in the wilderness. A recent report from Gartner Inc. estimates that worldwide spending on AI will rise to more than $2 trillion next year, a 37% increase from the nearly $1.5 trillion that the research firm expects to be spent this year. But it remains to be seen if all that money pouring into AI will actually produce all the profits and productivity that proponents have been promising. That leaves the question unanswered if all the real spending that’s happening will be worth it. The most recent survey of global fund managers by Bank of America showed a record percentage of investors saying companies are “overinvesting.” Big Tech is already so profitable that many of the most successful finance their spending sprees with their ongoing stream of revenue and cash hoards in their bank accounts. But some companies, such as Meta Platforms and Oracle, are relying more heavily on debt to fund their AI ambitions — a strategy that has raised enough alarms among investors that their stock prices have plunged more dramatically than their peers in recent weeks. Both Meta and Oracle have suffered more than 20% declines in their stock prices since late October. But other Big Tech powerhouses leading the way in AI remain just behind Nvidia and iPhone maker Apple in the rankings of the most valuable companies. Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon boast market values currently ranging from $2.3 trillion to $3.6 trillion. “It is true that valuations are high and that there is some froth in the market, however, the spending on AI is real,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for money manager Northlight Asset Management. “Whether or not the spending turns out to be overdone won’t be known for many years.” AP Business Writer Stan Choe in New York contributed to this story.

Shares of the world's most valuable company lost hold of their early gains after a blowout earnings report, while a big-box retailer soared after its latest quarterly results surpassed expectations. Major U.S. equities indexes finished Thursday's session in the red after overdue September jobs data sent mixed signals. The tech sector led the declines, as shares of Nvidia (NVDA) pulled back from their early advance in the wake of the AI chipmaker's better-than-expected quarterly results to close 3.2% lower. Nvidia was one of the day's worst-performing stocks in the Dow, which slid 0.8%. The S&P 500 fell 1.6%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 2.2%. See here for more from Investopedia on Thursday's market action. Shares of other AI chipmakers lost ground along with Nvidia. Rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) slumped nearly 8% and Broadcom (AVGO) slipped 2%, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index registering a nearly 5% decline. Nvidia memory chip partner Micron Technology (MU) tumbled 10.9%. Jacobs Solutions (J) shares lost the most of any stock in the S&P 500, dropping close to 11% after the engineering and consulting company reported a year-over-year decline in quarterly profits. The company said the results reflected a change in value of its investment in Amentum (AMTM), which was spun off from the company last year and combined its former intelligence arm with its cyber and critical mission solutions business. The price of Bitcoin (BTCUSD) extended its downtrend to hover around $87,000. Shares of Robinhood Markets (HOOD), which offers crypto trading on its platform, dropped about 10%, while shares of crypto exchange operator Coinbase Global (COIN) fell 7.4%. Walmart (WMT) shares jumped nearly 7% to notch Thursday's top performance in the S&P 500, after the retail giant's earnings topped analysts' estimates. Year-over-year growth in e-commerce sales and advertising revenue helped drive the strong performance, in what could be a positive signal for U.S. consumer spending heading into the height of the holiday season. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for use of its Eylea HD eye treatment for patients with macular edema following retinal vein occlusion. Regulators also greenlighted a monthly dosing option for Eylea HD for patients a variety of eye conditions. Regeneron shares advanced 5%. Shares of Solventum (SOLV), the health care company that was spun off from 3M (MMM) last year, gained close to 3%. The push higher followed Solventum's announcement that it had agreed to acquire Acera Surgical, a bioscience firm focusing on regenerative wound care. Solventum is set to pay $725 million in cash for Acera, with up to $125 million in potential additional payments tied to reaching certain milestones.

Title: Verizon Begins Laying Off Thousands of Workers

Reading time 2 minutes Telecom giant Verizon has begun laying off some 13,000 employees as part of a new reorganization initiative. Approximately a week ago, the Wall Street Journal reported that Verizon was considering job cuts. Now, the layoffs have begun, according to an email viewed by Gizmodo. “Our current cost structure limits our ability to invest significantly in our customer value proposition,” wrote Verizon’s new-ish CEO, Dan Schulma, in an email sent Thursday and shared with Gizmodo (the Journal originally reported on the email). “We must reorient our entire company around delivering for and delighting our customers,” the top executive added. Yes, to “delight” customers, the company must apparently very much not delight its workforce. Schulman, who took over the top spot in October, said in the email that the layoffs would reduce Verizon’s “outsourced and outside labor expenses.” To help the workers who are losing their jobs, Verizon has established a $20 million Reskilling and Career Transition Fund, Schulman said. This fund will “focus on skill development, digital training and job placement to help our people take their next steps,” he shared. The CEO added that technological change was sweeping through the economy. “Changes in technology and in the economy are impacting the workforce across all industries,” he wrote. “Change is necessary, but it can be difficult—especially when it affects valued teammates. It’s important that we direct our energy and resources to set Verizon on a path to success. The actions we’re taking are designed to make us faster and more focused, positioning our company to deliver for our customers while continuing to capture new growth opportunities.” When it comes to job security, this has been a tough year for tech workers. Amazon recently announced 14,000 layoffs, Accenture and Synopsis have announced thousands of layoffs, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Oracle have made similarly dour announcements, and Intel has promised to reduce its workforce by a whopping 25,000. There are many other tech companies that have made similar moves over the last twelve months. Yes, lots and lots of people are getting fired right now, and, according to reports, it’s increasingly difficult for entry-level workers to find positions. Some people blame AI (which is promising to help America’s C-suite gut certain segments of their corporate workforce) while others merely blame our shitty economy, which seems to be suffering under the yoke of the Trump administration’s dopy fiscal policies. There’s no reason why both can’t be to blame. Whatever the cause, one thing is clear: Silicon Valley is in its downsizing era, and it’s not so much fun.

Title: Google offers voluntary buyouts to UK employees

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Google is offering voluntary buyouts for employees in its UK offices, Business Insider has learned. An email went out to UK staff this week offering them a voluntary exit package, according to two people familiar with the matter and confirmed by a Google spokesperson. It's unclear which UK organizations the offers went to, or how many buyouts were offered. Google did not respond when asked for comment about this. "Earlier this year, some of our US teams introduced a voluntary exit programme with severance for U.S.-based Googlers, and we are now also offering the programme in the UK to support our important work ahead," the Google spokesperson said. "We are committed to investment in the UK and continue to hire for critical roles and important projects aligned with our company priorities to ensure we can deliver on the opportunity that AI offers the UK economy," they added. The voluntary buyouts are the latest example of Big Tech firms finding ways to reduce head count this year to become more efficient, flatten management structures, and lean into AI. Companies such as Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft have announced layoffs, while Microsoft has also offered some employees money to leave. The exact package being offered by Google in the UK would depend on how long the employee had worked at the company, staff were told. Google employs more than 7,000 people in the UK, according to its own figures. Google has offered voluntary buyouts across various parts of its US business this year, including its Android and Core engineering orgs. Much of the framing of these has been about how Google is reorienting its company around AI, and that it wants employees who aren't excited about that goal to feel like they can leave. In October, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan offered employees a voluntary exit package as part of a reorganization around AI priorities, according to a memo seen by Business Insider. "It's an incredibly exciting time at YouTube and many opportunities and challenges lie ahead. But we also understand some of you may be ready for a new challenge, so we've decided now is the right time to offer a Voluntary Exit Program," Mohan wrote. Have something to share?

Title: Even Realities Even G2 Review: Anti-Meta Smart Glasses With Real Potential
URL: https://gizmodo.com/even-realities-even-g2-review-2000687632
Time Published: 2025-11-20T20:23:45Z

Reading time 11 minutes What exactly doÂ smart glasses need to be smart? If you’re Meta, the answer to that question revolves around two things: cameras and audio. Sure, the Meta Ray-Ban Display have a screen in them, but there are only a couple of major things that allÂ of Meta’s smart glasses have in common, and that’s the ability to take pictures/videos and play audio. Those features can be useful, but they also come with their own drawbacks. Not only are smart glasses with cameras and speakers less private by virtue of the fact that you’re walking around with a gadget that records discreetly from your face, but they also weigh a lot more and look less like regular glasses. Adding hardware adds heft. It’s simple math. Even Realities Even G2 The Even G2 smart glasses have a great display and nice hardware, but they're plagued by bugs. Pros Cons But just because that’s what Meta thinks a pair of smart glasses needs doesn’t mean that’s where everyone’s head is at. There are some smart glasses purveyors asking what happens when you subtract from that equation, and the results, as I’ve found with Even Realities Even G2, can be interesting, encouraging, and sometimes a little frustrating. Even Realities is perhaps the main company making what I call “anti-Meta smart glasses” right now, and it recently released the Even G2, its second pair of smart glasses without cameras or speakers. Like the Even G1 predecessor, these smart glasses center around a screen, which in this case is a dual-lens display that outputs only in monochrome green. Unlike the Even G1, the Even G2’s display gets an assist from new hardwareâthe Even R1, an optional smart ring sold separately for navigating the UI that also doubles as a health tracker. The combination of screen and smart glasses can be a promising one. While I was worried about inputs on the Even R1 feeling laggy, I actually found sliding my thumb around the ceramic smart ring to work most of the time. To activate the Even G2 displays, all you need to do is double-tap with your thumb. To scroll between menu options, you slide your thumb up or down. To select, you give the Even R1 a single tap. You can also hold your thumb down on the smart ring to bring up a quick dashboard to check notifications or activate features like the teleprompter or translate. While inputs work fairly well, they’re far from perfect. Sometimes I find myself having to double-tap multiple times to get the results I want, and other times I scroll past my intended destination in a menu. It’s not enough to make me want to toss the Even R1 out completely and give up like other smart rings I hesitate to even mention, but there’s some refinement to be done here if Even Realities wants the smart ring to be theÂ best way of navigating a pair of smart glasses. The Even R1 controls may not be as nuanced as the gestures in the Meta Ray-Ban Display, aÂ “Neural Band” wristband that reads the electrical signals in your arm, but it’s a heck of a lot less invasive, and it certainly doesn’t leave a giant red mark on your wrist afterwards. It’s also, unfortunately, $250 in addition to the $600 price tag of the Even G2 smart glasses, so there’s that. Thankfully, the smart ring is, again, optional and not required to use the Even G2. As an input system, it’s safe to call the Even R1 solid, but there’s room for future improvement. A smart ring is only part of the equation; it’s also about what you can actually doÂ with said ring that matters. In the Even G2’s case, there are quite a few features that can be nice to have when they actually work. While you obviously won’t be taking pictures or videos, listening to music, or taking calls, the Even G2 isÂ set up for things like notifications. The Even G2, through the companion app, can show you text messages from your phone, emails, messages from apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, Snapchat, and Telegram, and native calendar notifications. Most of these worked for me after enabling them in the app and then force-resetting the Even G2 (not exactly a smooth process), but I wasn’t able to get text messages to show up in iOS 26 on my iPhone 17. I should also mention that Instagram messages, which I got to work on the Even G2, decided to randomly stop working, and would only return after resetting the smart glasses completely. These are the types of quirks I found in lots of corners of the Even G2. That being said, if you do manage to get notifications working, depending on what your style is, you can choose to have the smart glasses show them automatically or have them delivered discreetly so you can go in manually and check the notifications section in the Even G2 UI. You cannot, however, respond to messages; these smart glasses are for notifications only, which is a major disadvantage compared to the Meta Ray-Ban Display that do let you reply with dictation. Another cool thing the Even G2 (when coupled with the Even R1) can do is give you information about your health. I wouldn’t call the metrics real-time by any means, though they are updated… intermittently. Maybe a little too intermittently for my taste, especially if you’re trying to do something important like tracking your heart rate or your calories burned while running. The lack of up-to-date or even real-time health stats makes this feature a little less useful or interesting than it could be. It’s hard to say what the cadence of updating is, or what triggers an update to the health app in the Even G2, but it could take a while. Sometimes the health metrics also like to disappear from the health widget entirely, which is not great. When that happens, I have to unpair and repair the glasses to get them back. Sometimes I have to reset the smart glasses entirely. Sometimes none of those things work, and I’m just screwed, and I have to wait around for things to start working again. Needless to say, none of that is ideal. Like the Oura ring, the Even R1 tracks steps, calories burned, sleep, skin temperature, heart rate, heart beat intervals, and blood oxygen. While I probably won’t find most of that useful (that’s just me, maybe you will), I did like the sleep tracking, which logs time awake, REM, core sleep, and deep sleep as separate categories. It also provides a sleep score, which one night, for me, was a 77 out of 100. The score, according to Even Realities, is calculated based on things like duration, efficiency, and the balance of the sleep stages throughout the night. Needless to say, it wasn’t the greatest night’s sleep I’ve had. If you’re just looking for a health wearable, you shouldn’t buy the Even R1 (Oura or a Samsung Galaxy Ring still does more, especially with scores and guidance), but it’s nice to have those features (when they work) on top of having a controller for your smart glasses. Other features include navigation, which can be used by selecting the “navigate” option in the Even G2’s UI or by using the onboard voice assistant. I tried navigating to the Brooklyn Museum from my apartment, and it seemed to work just fine. By saying, “Hey Even, navigate to the Brooklyn Museum,” a small map surfaces in the bottom right with turn-by-turn navigation in the bottom left. At the top-right, you’ll get the distance and the time it takes to get to your destination. If you want a larger view, you can tap once on the Even R1 or on either of the two touchpads located on each of the temple tips, and then tap to go back. I like the Even G2’s navigation both because it could be useful for biking or if you just don’t feel like pulling your phone out, but also because it looks like a lo-fi analog map from The Matrix or from the movie Alien.Â I know this probably wasn’t the intention here, but I appreciate the aesthetic either way. Like many other smart glasses, there’s also a translation feature, which has both upsides and downsides. I had my partner speak Spanish to me, which was translated into English, and I liked that the translated text seemed to do a better job of conveying the Spanish phrases in a way an English speaker would understand than other smart glasses I’ve used. It also translated fairly quickly, which is important if you’re using this feature in the real world. One thing I didn’t like, however, is that they struggled to pick certain phrases up. I can’t tell if the microphones are maybe not as powerful as on other smart glasses or if the software is just a little slow, but the Even G2 are a little harder of hearing than on Meta’s Ray-Ban Display in my experience. There’s also a feature called “Conversate,” which listens in on conversations and transcribes them in front of your eyes. Unlike other smart glasses transcription features, the Even G2 attempts to add context. When taking a work meeting, I had the Even G2’s Conversate feature activated, and the results were a little silly at times. While it did an okay job of hearing mostÂ of what was said, it also misheard things and added irrelevant context. For instance, it misheard my name and called me James Pierre, and also misunderstood when someone said the name of a website, instead providing a definition for the literal word, instead of background on the site itself. It was nice, however, to be able to go back into the Even app to review what we spoke about; here you’ll get an AI summary andÂ a transcript. In an ideal world where AI is a lot smarter than it is right now, Conversate could potentially be useful, but as it stands, features like Conversate are hit-or-miss, no matter how well-intentioned they are. Lastly, there are separate widgets in the Even G2 for news and for stocks, if that’s your jam. Scrolling through them isn’t ideal from a UI perspective since you have to actually tap through one article to get to the next, but it is sharp enough to be legible. To scroll, you can use the Even R1 or the glasses’ touch controls on the tips of the Even G2. Stocks seemed to work okay, though I don’t have any money, so I don’t think that’ll be a feature that I use much. If you doÂ have money, you can add your preferred stocks via the Even app, and they’ll show up in a separate widget inside the Even G2 UI. Altogether, the features inside the Even G2 are actually thoughtful, though due to some bugginess with the app and the hardware, they’re not quite as useful as they could be at this point. I want to hope that they can get better with time, but for now, this is the level of polish I’m able to comment on. And speaking of polish, I should also note here that I had quite a few issues trying to get the Even G2 set up, where neither it nor the R1 would stay connected to my iPhone via Bluetooth. As I understand from some digging on Reddit, finicky Bluetooth connections are a common complaint among owners of the Even G1, and there’s a chance that those issues may have carried over into the second generation. While I was eventually able to get the smart glasses stable enough for testing by resetting them and updating the firmware in both devices, you should be aware of those pitfalls before you buy, and brace yourself for them not improving over time. One thing I really like about the Even G2 and the Even R1 is the hardware. Even Realities’ whole shtick is that its smart glasses are glasses first, and on that front, the Even G2 succeed. Because of the lack of cameras and speakers, they’re lightweight at just 36.5g as opposed to the Meta Ray-Ban Display, which are 69g. The use of titanium for the frames also helps keep the Even G2 light. They feel great on my face, and they fit my head well, too, which is a major plus. I wore the Even G2 and the Even R1 for almost the entirety of a workday, which in my case is like 10 hours, and I wasn’t ready to rip them off my face, nor did they leave huge marks on my head and nose. If I were to wear one pair of smart glasses all the time, this might be it. The look might not be for everyone, but I like the slightly rounded frames and the metal arms. On the tips of each arm, there are also touch controls for navigating the smart glasses and waking them up. One tap is select, two taps wake them up or goes back in the UI, and swiping to the front or to the back wheels the Even G2’s menus up or down, respectively. I also appreciate the screen, which Even Realities is calling the 3D floating display, a dual-lens system that uses micro LED. Even Realities says that the Even G2 is 50% sharper than the first generation of glasses, thanks to its redesigned optical system, and I believe that figure. Overall, I find the Even G2 to have a much sharper display than the Meta Ray-Ban Display, which makes reading notifications or even full-on articles easy on the eyes. The display isn’t the brightest in the worldâit’s 1,200 nits as opposed to the Meta Ray-Ban Display, which can go up to 5,000 nitsâbut it’s not slouching either. It’s also adjustable in the Even app so you can choose whether you want the display to appear mid, near, or far, and even position where the screen shows up in a vertical alignment (top or bottom). Having used AR glasses that don’t have adjustable screens in the past, this could be the difference between being able to see the display or not for some people. Sure, you’re not getting any color through the Even G2 waveguides, but for what the smart glasses are going for, I think the display is done well. While the screen is generally non-invasive, it’ll depend on what exactly you’re doing with the Even G2. For instance, things like notifications will appear in smaller boxes that disappear in 10 seconds by default, while the main menu can take up about 25% of the lenses depending on what your settings are in the display section of the app (again, there are settings for near, mid, and far as well as height options). To get a sense, when a new article is fully open, you’ll get a headline, a subhead, and most or all of the first paragraph. All of the menus inside the Even G2 are quite simple, usually consisting of text inside a box (the news widget, for example) or maybe graphs and numbers (the stock widget and health widget). They’re meant for at-a-glance information and nothing more. As long as you’re okay with glanceable chunks of data, like the time, temperature, date, orÂ number-based health metrics and email subjects/snippets, the Even G2 will most likely satisfy you with its display legibility and simplified UI. Battery life on the Even G2 glasses and the Even R1 ring is fairly solid. Even Realities advertises about two days of use, and after using the glasses and ring intermittently throughout the day for a period of about 10 hours, both were around 80%. To charge the Even G2, there’s an included charging case, while the Even R1 ring uses an included magnetic charger, which is a small pedestal connected to a USB-C cable. You can check the Even G2 and Even R1 battery life in the app to see if you need more juice. If you wear prescription lenses, you’re in luck here; the Even G2 supports people who need to actually wear glasses. The display is easily my favorite part of the Even G2, and while it doesn’t support full color, I can’t say I’m super bummed about that, given what the glasses are designed to do at this juncture in time. For notifications and navigation, all you need is a sharp, bright, Matrix-esque screen. Despite how frustrating the Even G2 and the Even R1 were to set up and how annoying they are when they stop working correctly, I weirdly see the potential of a pair of smart glasses that could be something functional. Could be, that is. Right now, the Even G2 and the Even R1 feel like a work in progress, like a lot of other smart glasses, and while the ideas are interesting, they’re just not as practical as they ought to be for the price they’re being sold. Maybe Even Realities can get the Even G2 and the Even R1 up to snuff with software updates and fixes to the Bluetooth bugs I experienced, but who knows what the future holds. Some Even G1 users were legitimately upset about the launch of the Even G2 since theyÂ had faith that Even Realities would refine its first-gen smart glasses before plowing ahead to a new pair. Obviously, that didn’t happen, and because of that, there’s no reason to think Even Realities won’t do the same thing with the Even G2. With that context and my firsthand experience, it’s hard to consider the Even G2 and the Even R1 as anything more than fairly nice hardware with some potential. If you’re willing to spend (checks notes) $600 on the smart glasses or $850 to also get the smart ring, then who am I to stop you? But if that potential doesn’t ultimately amount to much, you can’t say you haven’t been warned.

Title: Stocks stay on rollercoaster despite strong Nvidia earnings

By Lewis Krauskopf and Dhara Ranasinghe NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -Nvidia Corp's strong earnings report offered only a brief reprieve from worries that have plagued stocks about the return on relentless artificial intelligence investment and lofty valuations on Wall Street. AI darling Nvidia on Wednesday surprised Wall Street with accelerating growth after several quarters of slowing sales and a fourth-quarter forecast that exceeded expectations. Initial relief across world stocks, however, turned sour on Thursday as investors refocused on the negatives that pulled the benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite off record highs hit late last month. Investors also grappled with the delayed release of September payrolls data that solidified the belief that the Federal Reserve would not lower interest rates for a third straight meeting in December. "This is a coordinated risk off trade — tech stocks, crypto, etc on worries about valuations and leverage," said Nationwide Chief Market Strategist Mark Hackett. "The fact that it is an intraday decline rather than a drop at the open suggests exhaustion." Nvidia's upbeat results did not dispel concern around a fall back to earth for highly-valued tech stocks, amid lingering concerns about whether AI spending will pay off. Nvidia's results "are encouraging and support the AI story," said Angelo Kourkafas, senior global investment strategist at Edward Jones. "But ... I think there's broad skepticism over the next one-to-three years whether AI is going to be able to deliver on the return side." Global stocks have now dropped over 3% this month in part driven by concerns that a rally in tech shares has gone too far, too fast. "The concerns around tech will persist and each quarter we are likely to come across the same concerns as markets question the concentration," said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Global Investors in London. "That story won’t go away." Shah said that while she was overweight U.S. stocks, she was also wary of concentration risks and this was one reason why she was looking at European shares. AI COMPANY RESULTS AS IMPORTANT AS DATA PRINTS Investors and analysts say that as AI emerges as a so-called mega-trend, market sentiment hangs on earnings results from chipmaker Nvidia, a bellwether for the AI build-out, and other technology companies. They are as key to shaping views on the economic outlook as monthly economic releases. Nvidia's shares were down over 2% after rallying sharply in early trade. The S&P 500 was off 1.2% and the Nasdaq was down 1.7% after both had climbed sharply earlier. MSCI's index of global shares was off 0.7%. Morgan Stanley on Thursday said it scrapped its forecast that the Fed would cut interest rates by a quarter-point at its December meeting after the Labor Department released data showing a greater-than-expected 119,000 non-farm payrolls increase in September. The report was more than a month late due to the government shutdown. "It's a sense that the Fed is still driving in the fog and we're not going to get any support from monetary policy in the short term," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth. "I think that's been a larger influence (in the market today) than the questioning about AI valuations." "The positive here is the most speculative fringes of the market are getting a much-needed sell-off." Fed Governor Lisa Cook didn't help sentiment, saying that historically elevated prices in equities, corporate bonds, housing and leveraged-loan markets may portend a large pullback in valuations. AI, TECH STOCK CONCERNS REMAIN Thursday's action showed that investors need to brace for a bumpy ride. "Investors do need to worry about bubble risks," Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, told reporters on a call about the 2026 outlook on Thursday. The so-called "Magnificent Seven" - including Nvidia and Meta - have seen their share prices soar over the past several years, fuelling fears about the scale of market exposure to just a few names. Technology firms are among the stock market's big fallers in recent days, although they are still well up on the year. The S&P 500 tech sector's forward price/earnings ratio - a measure of how much a company is worth compared to future earnings - was recently about 30 times, well above its 10-year average of 22.2. The AI stocks frenzy has drawn comparisons with the 1990s dotcom boom and bust, while concerns were rising about debt taken on by tech firms. Nvidia produced $60 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months, David Trainer, CEO of investment research firm New Constructs, said in a note. To justify its current stock price, it would need to produce $2.1 trillion in annual cash flows within 10 years, he said. On Wednesday, speaking before the Nvidia results, Amundi, Europe's biggest asset manager, said it was underweight megacap stocks. While it had not sold down the stocks in most portfolios, it has been hedging with derivatives that give it the option to sell them instead, Amundi's CIO, Vincent Mortier, said.

A wave of relief swept through European markets after Nvidia’s upbeat forecast eased concerns that artificial intelligence (AI) reliant stocks may have over elevated valuations amid analysts’ concerns. Dublin The Iseq All-Share index ended the session down 0.25 per cent to 12,024.30, lagging behind its European counterparts. Deutsche Bank upgraded insulation specialists Kingspan stock to ‘buy’ and it gained 1.98 per cent to reach €66.95. In a mixed day for the banks, Bank of Ireland gained 0.57 per cent to reach €15.055, AIB fell 0.36 per cent to hit €8.24, and PTSB was flat. Ryanair fell 1.02 per cent, a major component, it weighed down the index alongside fellow heavy-hitter, Kerry Group which shed 0.71 per cent. London The blue-chip FTSE 100 climbed 0.16, halting a five-day decline. The domestically focused FTSE 250 fell slightly to elongate its losing run. The aerospace and defence sector rebounded after a setback in the previous session. Industry heavyweights Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems both gained. Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca advanced about 0.40 per cent after its drug to control growth of non-cancerous tumours was approved in the United States. Miniature war-games maker Games Workshop soared 13.49 per cent and hit a record high on strong half-year forecast. Johnson Matthey shares fell 3.35 per cent after the chemicals company said finance chief Richard Pike would take on a new role as chief operating officer. Sportswear retailer JD Sports fell 3.88 per cent after forecasting annual profit at the lower end of market expectations. Additionally, Friday’s UK retail sales figures will also be on investors’ radar to gauge the nation’s economic health, after this week’s data showed inflation easing for the first time in five months. Europe The pan-European Stoxx 600 index gained 0.49 per cent on Thursday with investors buoyed by positive Nvidia results. In company news, Novartis AG boosted its sales targets for two key cancer drugs, underscoring confidence in its oncology pipeline, but its stocks still fell 1.76 per cent. BNP Paribas SA announced a new buyback and plans to reach a target for capital strength early as chief executive Jean-Laurent Bonnafe seeks to reverse a recent slide in the stock price. The bank’s stocks gained 4.40 per cent. A series of European defence companies gained ground in trading. German defence giant Rheinmetall AG added 2.57 per cent while BAE Systems gained 1.77 per cent. Siemens Energy announced its biggest share buyback since the turbine maker went public five years ago amid optimism around surging data-centre investments, and added 1.14 per cent. Stellantis traded more blows with BYD saying its Chinese partner Leapmotor is selling more electric vehicles in Europe’s biggest EV market. It fell 3.04 per cent. New York Wall Street’s main indexes advanced on Thursday, with technology stocks getting a boost after Nvidia’s stellar results quelled some concerns around an AI bubble, while a firm September jobs report showed signs of a resilient economy. Nvidia gained after the world’s most valuable company forecast sales above analysts’ estimates for the final three months of the year and surpassed expectations for third-quarter revenue. Chief executive Jensen Huang shrugged off concerns about AI on a call with analysts, saying: “We see something very different.” A year-long rally in high-flying technology stocks had begun to lose some steam as investors became increasingly cautious of a potential AI bubble. Concerns about monetisation prospects over the technology, circular spending within the sector and debt issuance have weighed on markets with the Nasdaq sharply off its October high and Nvidia down sharply from its peak. Most megacap and growth stocks advanced, with Alphabet up and Meta gaining. The S&P 500 tech index was among the gainers, with Advanced Micro Devices, Broadcom and other chip-related stocks jumping. Walmart jumped after the retailer raised its annual forecast for the second time this year and also set a December date to change its stock listing to the Nasdaq from the NYSE. – Additional reporting: Reuters, PA Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: U.S. stocks rise on a wave of fresh optimism led by Nvidia and Walmart

news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time What began as a banner day for stocks turned into a major rout, as investors signaled ongoing skepticism about the longevity of the artificial intelligence boom and trimmed hopes of support from the Federal Reserve. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 2%, and the broad S&P 500 index dropped by more than 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 top-tier stocks, declined by nearly 390 points. It had been up 700 points earlier in the day. Cryptocurrencies also shed billions in value: Bitcoin had fallen below $87,000 as of late Thursday afternoon, weeks after having set highs above $120,000. The stunning turnaround added further unease to an already shaky economy that has forced households to trim budgets amid stubborn inflation and signs of a wavering job market. With an ever-increasing part of the economy's principal driver — consumer spending — now reliant on affluent households, an extended market pullback could inflict wider damage. "You don’t have to have the biggest bubble in history for an expensive stock market" and end up seeing declines, said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak asset management group. Traders’ hopes were boosted early Thursday by a better-than-expected jobs report that appeared to show the economy remained resilient. Even before the day began, stocks looked poised to rise after Nvidia, the chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom, reported strong quarterly earnings and revenue. Yet by midday, markets had turned red. The solid September jobs report diminished the odds that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next month to lower the cost of borrowing money to spur economic activity. When investors don't have to pay as much in interest, they often put those savings into stocks. “The broad rebound in payrolls suggests diminished risks of a higher unemployment rate,” analysts with Morgan Stanley said in a note published shortly before noon. “We no longer expect a Fed cut in December.” Losses were further compounded by ongoing concerns about AI — specifically, how much more profitable the companies buying chips like Nvidia's will be. The fears were articulated Wednesday evening on X by Michael Burry, made famous by the movie "The Big Short." "Just because something is used does not mean it is profitable," he wrote. Finally, the ongoing sell-off of bitcoin indicated to some traders that a key source of support for stocks — retail or day traders — were beginning to waver on their trademark "buy the dip" mentality. "I wouldn’t say we’ve flipped from bull to bear," said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers financial group. "I would say we’ve flipped from bull to balanced market in the short term. A lot depends on whether sentiment continues to weaken." Stocks had already been showing signs of flagging in recent weeks. With Thursday's losses, the S&P 500 fell to its lowest point since September. The long-delayed September jobs report, which showed that the United States added a sturdy 119,000 jobs, appeared to show some glimmers of hope for the economy. Although the unemployment rate ticked up from 4.3% in August to 4.4%, about 450,000 workers entered the labor force. Economists view that as evidence that job opportunities are still plentiful, despite a wave of corporate layoffs. Just before the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the jobs report, Verizon told employees it planned to lay off 13,000 employees, or about 13% of its workforce. The company joined a suite of other blue-chip employers that say they plan to eliminate tens of thousands of jobs, including Amazon, General Motors, IBM, Microsoft, Paramount, Target and UPS. The details of the jobs report, which captured conditions before the government shutdown, as well more recent jobs data, suggested a more mixed picture for the U.S. economy. Manufacturing shed 6,000 jobs, continuing a trend in a sector the Trump administration has touted as a key target of its economic policies. Transportation and warehousing also lost 25,300 jobs. Wage growth slowed, and job totals for July and August were revised downward. The employment gains in September were concentrated in the health care, hospitality and social assistance sectors. Another snapshot of the economy came courtesy of Walmart, which on Thursday reported strong sales and raised its outlook for the year. That strength points to cracks in the economy, though. Executives said the chain is luring more high-income shoppers who are looking for bargains, and noted that lower-income families are feeling more pressure. "As pocketbooks have been stretched, you're seeing more consumer dollars go to necessities versus discretionary items," Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said on an earnings call Thursday morning. Walmart's stock closed 6.5% higher. Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Verizon Confirms Mass Layoffs, Will Eliminate 13,000+ Jobs

Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. UPDATE: Verizon is set to lay off over 13,000 workers in the coming weeks as part of a cost-cutting and restructuring initiative. "Today, we will begin reducing our workforce by more than 13,000 employees across the organization, and significantly reduce our outsourced and other outside labor expenses," newly appointed CEO Dan Schulman writes in a memo to employees that it also published online. "Every part of the company will experience some level of change." Verizon had just over 100,000 employees as of Sept. 30, meaning the layoff will reduce the headcount by 13%. Schulman says that the company's current costs and structure limit its ability to invest in its "customer value proposition." He also argues that complexity and friction within the organization were slowing it down and frustrating customers. In the last quarter alone, the company lost 7,000 postpaid customers, while rivals T-Mobile and AT&T made significant gains. Verizon says it set up a $20 million fund focused on "skill development, digital training, and job placement" for the people it's laying off. It touted the fact that it's "the first company to set up a fund to specifically focus on the opportunities and necessary skill sets as we enter the age of AI," which is...an interesting way to spin things. Those impacted in the US will be notified today, while those in other regions will be notified in the coming weeks, The Wall Street Journal reports. Original Story (11/14): Verizon could soon be the latest tech company to announce a mass layoff. The carrier will cut around 15,000 jobs next week, The Wall Street Journal reports. The news arrives amid stiff competition for Verizon; it lost 7,000 postpaid customers in the last quarter, while T-Mobile added 1 million and AT&T gained 405,000. The report also arrives just over a month after Dan Schulman was appointed as the new CEO. The former PayPal CEO had served on Verizon's board for seven years before taking over as the chief executive in early October. "Verizon is at a critical juncture," Schulman said at the time. "We are going to maximize our value propositions, reduce our cost to serve, and optimize our capital allocation to delight our customers, and deliver sustainable long-term growth for our shareholders." Verizon had about 100,000 employees in February, and cutting 15,000 would mark the largest job reduction in the company's history, according to WSJ. While most of the job cuts will come through layoffs, others will result from franchising stores. Around 180–200 stores will be franchised, meaning people working there will no longer be on Verizon's payroll. With the move, Verizon joins the long list of tech companies trimming their workforces significantly this year. Intel announced a reduction of 15% of its workforce in July, and Amazon just cut 14,000 jobs last month. While expense management and restructuring have been cited as reasons by Verizon and Intel, Amazon has pinned the blame on employee culture. Jibin is a tech news writer based out of Ahmedabad, India.

Title: US filings for jobless benefits remained in historically healthy range during government shutdown

Time Published: 2025-11-20T14:56:33Z
Full Content:
By MATT OTT, Associated Press Business Writer New U.S. jobless claim applications fell last week, remaining within the healthy range of recent years, according to the government’s first weekly layoffs data since before the government shut down on Oct. 1. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits for the week ending Nov. 15 fell by 8,000 from the previous week to 220,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. Data for the weeks covering the government shutdown also remained in the same range of recent years, falling between 200,000 and 250,000. Also Thursday, the Labor Department said in a separate report that U.S. employers added a surprisingly solid 119,000 jobs in September. The unemployment rate rose to 4.4%, the highest since October 2021, however that’s partly because 470,000 people entered the labor market. The increase in September payrolls was more than double the 50,000 economists had forecast. But Labor Department revisions shaved 33,000 jobs off July and August payrolls. The monthly jobs report — considered the most important market-moving data on the U.S. employment situation — had been delayed for seven weeks by the federal government shutdown. During the 43-day shutdown, investors, businesses, policymakers and the Federal Reserve were without much of the figures they use to diagnose the health of the American job market because federal workers had been furloughed and couldn’t collect the data. Thursday’s labor market reports come at a time of considerable uncertainty about the economy. The job market has been strained by the lingering effects of high interest rates and uncertainty around Trump’s erratic tariff policies, though economic growth at midyear was resilient. Fed policymakers are divided over whether to cut interest rates for the third time this year when they meet in December for the final time this year. Some major companies have announced job cuts this year, including Procter & Gamble, Dow, CNN, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines, Microsoft, Google and Facebook parent company Meta. Intel and The Walt Disney Co. also recently announced staff reductions, as have Verizon, General Motors,American Airlines and Amazon. Thursday’s report on weekly layoffs showed that the four-week average of claims, which softens some of the week-to-week volatility, fell by 3,000 to 224,250. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the week ending Nov. 8 jumped to 1.97 million, an increase of 28,000 from the previous week.

November 20, 2025 09:35 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA LONG BEACH, Calif., Nov. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today completed its second launch in two days from its launch sites in two hemispheres, setting a new annual launch record for the Company: 18 Electron launches in 2025 with 100% mission success. The “Follow My Speed” mission lifted off from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand on November 20, 2025 at 12:43 UTC (November 21, 2025 at 1:43 am NZDT) to successfully deploy its payload for a confidential commercial customer. The mission launched just two days after the Company’s latest launch from Launch Complex 2 on Wallops Island, Virginia, Rocket Lab’s third HASTE launch this year and sixth mission overall involving its suborbital variant of Electron for hypersonic technology test flights. These record-setting events further solidify Electron’s industry leadership as the world’s most frequently launched small orbital rocket. Rocket Lab has increased the annual launch cadence of Electron by 1,700% in less than a decade, driven by international demand for its responsive space capabilities and proven execution with pinpoint payload deployment accuracy. Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: “Electron once again proves why it is the champion of small launch globally. These two launches serve as great examples of the team’s skill at delivering mission success for our customers anywhere, anytime, and no matter the mission profile – from a suborbital hypersonic technology demonstration to a commercial orbital mission, all within 48 hours and from opposite sides of the world. This new annual record is a proud moment for a remarkable team that continues to set new benchmarks for the launch industry.” Rocket Lab remains on track to further extend Electron’s annual launch record and end the year with more launches scheduled.

By WYATTE GRANTHAM-PHILIPS, AP Business Writer NEW YORK (AP) — Verizon is laying off more than 13,000 employees in mass job reductions that arrive as the telecommunications giant says it must “reorient” its entire company. The job cuts began on Thursday, per to a staff memo from Verizon CEO Dan Schulman. In the letter, which was seen by The Associated Press, Schulman said Verizon’s current cost structure “limits” the company’s ability to invest — pointing particularly to customer experiences. “We must reorient our entire company around delivering for and delighting our customers,” Schulman wrote. He added that the company needed to simplify its operations “to address the complexity and friction that slow us down and frustrate our customers.” Verizon had nearly 100,000 full-time employees as of the end of last year, according to securities filings. A spokesperson confirmed that the layoffs announced Thursday account for about 20% of the company’s management workforce, which isn’t unionized. Verizon has faced rising competition in both the wireless phone and home internet space — particularly from AT&T, T-Mobile and other big market players. New leadership at the company has stressed the need to right the company’s direction. Schulman became CEO just last month. In the company’s most recent earnings, he stated that Verizon’s trajectory was at a “critical inflection point” — and said, rather than incremental changes, Verizon would “aggressively transform” its operations. For its third quarter of 2025, Verizon posted earnings of $4.95 billion and $33.82 billion in revenue. The carrier reported continued subscriber growth for its prepaid wireless services, but it lost a net 7,000 postpaid connections. News of coming layoffs at Verizon was reported last week by The Wall Street Journal. The outlet says that the 13,000 job cuts mark the largest-ever round of layoffs at the company. Beyond the cuts across Verizon’s workforce, Schulman said that the New York company would also “significantly reduce” its outsourced and other outside labor expenses. It’s a tough time for the job market overall — and Verizon isn’t the only company to announce sizeable workforce reductions recently. More and more layoffs have piled up at companies like Amazon, UPS, Nestlé and more. Some companies have pointed to rising operational costs spanning from U.S. President Donald Trump’s barrage of new tariffs and shifts in consumer spending. Others cite corporate restructuring more broadly — or are redirecting money to artificial intelligence. Regardless, such cuts have raised worker anxieties across sectors. Schulman on Thursday recognized that “changes in technology and in the economy are impacting the workforce across all industries.” He said that Verizon had established a $20 million “Reskilling and Career Transition Fund” for workers departing the company. Shares of Verizon fell just over 1% by Thursday’s close.

Title: Creator Economy Ad Spend Projected To Hit $37B This Year, IAB Report Says

By Jesse Whittock International TV Co-Editor The creator economy ad market will hit $37B this year, growing at four times the rate of the overall media industry, according to a new report on the sector. The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB)’s 2025 Creator Economy Ad Spend & Strategy Report forecast the massive growth in the sector in the U.S. this year, up 26% year-over-year. The figures point to marketers and advertisers increasingly treat contenting creators as distinct channels, rather than elements of social media campaigns, the IAB report claimed. Related Stories News Digital Talent Rep Fixated Hires Content Chief To Fill "Massive Hole" In Creator Economy News YouTube Diehard Trevor Noah Envisions A "Creator-Run World" Where Talent, Brands And Audiences Connect In "Beautiful Verticals" Spend included in IAB’s report includes direct partnerships and their paid amplification, along with ‘content adjacencies,’ defined as brands investing “intentionally run ads adjacent to creators with whom they do not have a direct partnership.” For context on the 2025 figure, media as a sector overall grew 5.7%, per a separate IAB study from September. Further to that, you can see the rate of growth in that IAB noted the overall creator economy ad spend for 2021 was $13.9B, rising to $29.5B last year. IAB projects the 2026 figure will be $43.9B, up another 18%. Watch on Deadline “Leveraging the creator economy to connect with audiences is no longer experimental for marketers – it’s essential,” said David Cohen, CEO at the IAB. “The significant growth we’re seeing reflects a deepening commitment from brands to invest in creator-driven strategies. However, with that maturity comes a need for clear standards, better measurement, and tools to navigate an incredibly fragmented ecosystem.” The IAB itself has had to pivot due to the tilt toward creators. The organization puts on the annual NewFronts in New York, a series of showcases to ad buyers dominated by streaming. As traditional NewFronts companies like YouTube, Amazon, NBCUniversal and Hulu have fallen out or shifted toward the traditional broadcast and streaming upfronts in mid-May, the IAB has branched out to gaming and creator events. Breaking the 2025 stats down, the most ad spend came from retail ($12.3B), followed by consumer packaged goods, finance, apparel, tech, auto, telecoms, travel, home, health and wellness, and media and entertainment the only vertical below $1B at $400M. IAB’s report showed marketers were most keen to pact with content creators who were managed by social media platforms such as YouTube BrandConnect and TikTok Creator Marketplace, followed by creators managed by media companies such as web publishers and TV networks and then direct outreach. Creator-specific representation agencies, which have been springing up at a significant rate, was the sixth-most popular route. Working with talent agencies such as UTA and WME and sports rep agencies, including the sports units of the Big Three, were least favored. It’s also expected AI will take a central role in creator-led campaigns with 46% of respondents currently using it for content creation and work processes and another 29% planing to do so in the next year. The stats come as TV and film companies continue to wrestle with their relationship with the creator economy. With thousands out of work following huge layoffs at media and tech giants over recent years, there has been a growing acceptance of content creators and more professionals exploring how they can apply their expertise to the creator world. IAB’s U.S. Creator Economy reaches its stats through an ad spend projection that measures the ad dollars brands invest in creators through direct partnerships. Earlier this week, credit card provider Visa released a report projecting the creator economy would hit $500B by 2027. Dade Hayes contributed to this report.

Title: Flipkart fintech super.money preps buy-now-pay-later play

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Flipkart-backed UPI app super.money is preparing a fresh push into buy now, pay later (BNPL) by partnering regulated banks and lenders, as it hunts for its next leg of growth beyond credit on UPI, according to two people aware of the plans. The company is looking to compete with existing checkout-finance players such as Axio and Snapmint in the tightly contested intersection of e-commerce and lending, said the first person, asking not to be named as the product is still under development. “Once it is fully built, the launch will have two parts," this person added. “One is to offer super.money as a checkout option on e-commerce sites, and the other is to bring an e-commerce layer inside the app itself with BNPL-style financing at checkout." The second person said the broader idea is to position super.money as a one-stop destination for e-commerce journeys supported by credit, so that users can move from discovery to payment in a single, smooth flow on its interface. Mint could not independently ascertain a firm timeline for the launch. However, the two people cited above said the BNPL product is currently in development and testing, and is expected to go live only after the company completes tighter KYC and other regulatory checks that apply to this category. This emerging category, where BNPL is offered as a checkout option across commerce sites, is not new. Companies such as Snapmint, which raised about $125 million this year, and Axio, acquired by Amazon for around $200 million, are already significant players in this space. According to Brijesh Damodaran, managing partner at Auxano Capital, a BNPL offering allows a UPI app to move beyond being just another payments button at checkout granting it greater control over the merchant interface with features such as EMI options, offers, and seamless pay-later flows. “UPI has won on volume but not on margins. But it carries zero MDR (merchant discount rate) and is heavily commoditised. BNPL or checkout credit lets a UPI app move from pure payments to credit-led revenue through interest, fees, or merchant commission," he said. MDR is the fee merchants pay to payment processors for accepting digital payments; UPI transactions have had a zero MDR regime since 2020, meaning payment apps earn no direct revenue from flows. Within the broader consumer credit landscape, BNPL is expected to grow at a robust clip of 20–35% annually over the next several years, though the big question is whether large banks, traditional card issuers, or UPI-first players like super.money will end up controlling most of the market at checkout, Damodaran added. Business basicsA spokesperson for super.money declined to comment on the new BNPL plans. However, founder Prakash Sikaria told Mint that the app had processed “around ₹740 crore of loans" last month alone through its various credit products. Apart from loans, super.money also works with a clutch of banks, including Axis Bank (for a co-branded credit card and secured cards), Utkarsh Small Finance Bank (secured credit cards and fixed deposits) and Kotak811 (secured cards and an integrated savings–spending–borrowing account). “Next year, our projection is 2 million cards. We are already among the top three issuers of RuPay cards and we want to be the largest," Sikaria said. Flipkart launched super.money beta version in June 2024 and rolled it out publicly in August that year. Since then, the app has doubled down on young, often first-time borrowers as its core market. To acquire these users, super.money leaned on a rewards-led model that offers up to 5% cashback on every UPI transaction. The strategy appears to have paid off: by September 2025, the app had climbed into the top bracket of UPI players by transaction volume, overtaking established names such as CRED, Amazon Pay, WhatsApp Pay and BHIM. Also Read | Can PhysicsWallah’s blockbuster debut revive India’s edtech dream? In September, super.money processed 256.34 million UPI transactions worth ₹9,852.44 crore, even as PhonePe and Google Pay continued to command 80–83% of the overall market, down from about 85% a year earlier. On whether such heavy cashback-led acquisition is sustainable, Sikaria said the average annual cashback per user is roughly $2–3. “Our thesis is we just need to monetize $2–3 more per user than our competition," he said. “India has a wide diversity of users; typically, monetisable users subsidise non-monetisable ones. If you can largely avoid non-monetizable users and focus on a high-Arpu (average revenue per user) segment, your average Arpu is much higher." Elaborating on secured credit products, Sikaria said that super.money sees average monthly spends of about ₹5,000–6,000 per secured card user, largely led by merchant payments. The app now has roughly 10.0–10.5 million monthly transacting users. On the revenue side, Sikaria said super.money is making about $3 million a month, which works out to an annualized revenue run rate of around $36 million at present. Flipkart’s renewed fintech bet with super.money marks its second coming in payments and lending after its PhonePe chapter. The e-commerce major bought PhonePe in 2016, but the two separated ownership in December 2022, paving the way for both to raise capital and scale on their own, with Walmart continuing as the common majority shareholder. Since then, PhonePe, led by Sameer Nigam, has filed draft papers with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for an initial public offering of around ₹11,000 crore and seen large secondary share sales, including General Atlantic’s $600-million deal that helped employees cover tax outgo on exercised stock options. Regulatory lensThe BNPL segment has drawn scrutiny from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in recent years, especially around low-ticket unsecured lending, deferred payment products routed via prepaid instruments, and opaque pricing for borrowers. The RBI has tightened norms on digital lending and pushed lenders to hold more capital against unsecured retail portfolios. In 2023, the RBI also tightened rules around first-loss default guarantees (FLDGs), a popular comfort structure used by fintechs with their NBFC partners, where the fintech promises to cover part of the lender’s credit losses. The central bank capped such guarantees at 5% of the outstanding loan pool, after earlier market practice in some unsecured digital lending segments had reportedly gone much higher. That pushed several lending service providers to pause or redesign short-duration, small-ticket credit products as their NBFC partners reworked risk, capital and economics under the new cap. The BNPL landscapeThe UPI and BNPL market has filled up with rivals such as Navi (founded by Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal), MobiKwik, Paytm, Amazon Pay and Google Pay. In BNPL specifically, super.money’s planned products would sit alongside Snapmint and Axio, as well as captive “pay later" offerings such as Amazon Pay Later and Flipkart Pay Later, plus horizontal BNPL specialists like Simpl and LazyPay (owned by PayU). Also Read | Why Manipal and upGrad want Byju’s—and what’s really at stake now The BNPL industry in India has witnessed turbulence over the last few years, especially after high-profile setbacks like the shuttering of ZestMoney. Once a poster child for digital lending, ZestMoney ceased operations in December 2023 amid mounting non-performing assets and regulatory pressure, before parts of its loan book and technology platform were sold to DMI Finance, an NBFC lender. Layoffs and restructuring followed, and similar pressures have also hit rivals. Simpl, another leading checkout credit provider, has reportedly trimmed its workforce in October this year and faced regulatory heat, including enforcement action from the Enforcement Directorate this year.

The BNPL segment has drawn scrutiny from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in recent years, especially around low-ticket unsecured lending, deferred payment products routed via prepaid instruments, and opaque pricing for borrowers. The RBI has tightened norms on digital lending and pushed lenders to hold more capital against unsecured retail portfolios. In 2023, the RBI also tightened rules around first-loss default guarantees (FLDGs), a popular comfort structure used by fintechs with their NBFC partners, where the fintech promises to cover part of the lender’s credit losses. The central bank capped such guarantees at 5% of the outstanding loan pool, after earlier market practice in some unsecured digital lending segments had reportedly gone much higher.

Title: Nvidia’s $54B Earnings Test and Fed Minutes Put Best Wallet Token in Play

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. What to Know: Markets are walking a tightrope this week. Nvidia is set to report $54B+ in Q3 revenue, a figure big enough to make or break the AI trade that has driven much of 2025’s risk rally. Futures across stocks and crypto have been drifting as traders wait to see whether the world’s top AI chipmaker can justify its massive valuation and keep the AI narrative alive. Economists expect roughly 50K new jobs, a clear comedown from earlier in the year. A softer payrolls print combined with divided Fed views on further cuts would reinforce the idea that policy is slowly tilting back toward easier conditions, even if inflation is still above target. Bitcoin has already been slapped down to near seven-month lows, roughly 25–30% below its recent peak, in a pullback analysts describe as sentiment-driven rather than structural. If Nvidia smashes expectations and the macro data lean dovish, that combination could flip the switch back to ‘risk-on’ and give both Bitcoin and altcoins room for a sharp relief rally. When that kind of macro reset hits, fresh liquidity doesn’t just chase the majors. It needs rails, wallets, and launchpads that make it easy for new users to move from fiat into crypto, hop across chains, and discover the next wave of tokens. That’s where infrastructure plays come in, and it’s exactly the lane Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is trying to own with a multi-chain wallet, in-app presale access, and a presale that has already raised more than $17.2M at $0.025975 per token with around 76% staking rewards. The current non-custodial wallet landscape is messy. Newcomers juggle multiple apps, seed phrases, and gas settings across chains, while veterans still pay too much in swap fees and miss early-stage deals because everything is fragmented. Best Wallet is designed to stitch that chaos together, and Best Wallet Token is there to help. The app is a true multi-chain wallet, with support for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, Polygon, Base and more, letting users buy, store, deposit, send, and swap thousands of tokens from one interface. Fiat on-ramps are integrated through partners like Onramper to surface aggressive rates and lower card processing costs, which matters when altcoin rotations kick off and every percentage point of friction eats into upside. Security is handled with MPC tech from Fireblocks and cloud backups instead of exposed seed phrases, plus features like 2FA, biometric login, and advanced anti-fraud tooling. That’s aimed squarely at the next wave of users who want self-custody without feeling like they’re one mistyped word away from losing a portfolio. On top sits the $BEST token. Holding $BEST reduces transaction fees when buying or swapping crypto in-app, cuts swap costs across the 330-DEX, 30-bridge routing stack, and boosts rewards on the upcoming Best Card, which plans up to 8% cashback for heavy users. Best Wallet’s launchpad feature also gives $BEST holders early access to the best crypto presales at a ‘Phase 0’ price before wider listings, letting them rotate into new narratives faster and cheaper than users stuck on legacy wallets. This lines up neatly with where the market is heading. Tokenized funds, regulated stablecoins, and payments giants experimenting with on-chain rails all point toward a future where compliant wallets with deep DeFi hooks become the main interface for value transfer. Best Wallet is built to sit in that intersection, connecting regulated stablecoin flows with native DeFi and presale access. As capital trickles back into risk assets, a wallet-plus-token combo that makes multi-chain navigation easy could attract both first-timers and battle-hardened degen traders. Watch $BEST as onboarding demand grows. The presale is currently priced at $0.025975 per token, with more than $17.2M already raised and a sizeable social footprint across X, Telegram, and Discord. Staking is live during the presale, offering 76% APY powered by an 800M-token (8%) allocation dedicated to staking rewards. That lets early buyers immediately put idle tokens to work while the sale is still ongoing, compounding exposure if the token lists into an improving macro backdrop. Learn how to join and stake in our guide to buying $BEST tokens. If Nvidia’s earnings confirm that the AI boom still has legs and the Fed’s tone softens on the back of a weak 50K jobs print, that cocktail could refill the risk-asset punch bowl. In those conditions, a presale-stage wallet token plugged directly into multi-chain liquidity, presales, and stablecoin rails becomes a clear way to get leveraged exposure to the next adoption wave without betting on a single niche sector like meme coins or gaming. Join $BEST before the presale closes. This article is informational only, not investment advice; crypto prices and presale outcomes are highly speculative and capital is at risk.

Title: Nvidia’s $57B Quarter, Bitcoin’s Rebound, And 3 Tokens Aligned With The Next Risk Cycle
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/best-crypto-to-buy-nvidia-report-rebounds-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2025-11-20T12:31:56Z

Nvidia’s fiscal Q3 numbers didn’t just beat expectations, they detonated them. Revenue came in at $57.01 billion, almost $2B above what Wall Street was pricing in, with a jaw-dropping $51.2 billion from data-center alone. AI spending isn’t easing off the accelerator; it’s compounding like a tech-market feedback loop on steroids. And yes, that matters for crypto. Bitcoin had slipped under $89,000 after a 27% drawdown from its $126K+ peak six weeks ago. But the moment Nvidia’s earnings hit, BTC snapped back above $91,000, and risk appetite started seeping back into the broader market. Traders suddenly remembered that the so-called “AI bubble” looks a lot more like a structural capital cycle than a blow-off top. The pattern is getting hard to ignore: Through 2024 and 2025, the correlation between high-growth tech and Bitcoin has only tightened as both assets increasingly express the same macro trade, long compute, long scarce digital assets, short fiat dilution. So the question isn’t just where Bitcoin goes next, it’s which parts of the crypto stack actually benefit from this returning liquidity. Capital is rotating into assets with real throughput, real user demand, and tangible cash-flow potential, not just shiny narratives. That’s where programmable Bitcoin layers, multi-chain wallet ecosystems, and even high-octane meme assets start to separate. Below, we look at three projects across that spectrum. One aims to fix Bitcoin’s structural limitations. One is positioning itself as the next major wallet-distribution and order-flow engine. And one is pure speculative beta packaged in meme culture, the kind that historically thrives when risk cycles flip from cautious to greedy. Together, they outline how this next phase of the market could unfold across infrastructure, utility, and culture. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) positions itself as the first Bitcoin Layer 2 to integrate the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), effectively grafting Solana-grade parallel execution onto Bitcoin’s settlement layer. The pitch is simple but powerful: let Bitcoin handle security and finality, while an SVM-powered L2 processes everything that requires speed, throughput, and programmability. That architecture directly targets Bitcoin’s three long-running frictions: slow block times, high fees during congestion, and limited support for complex applications. Because the SVM stack has already proven itself at high throughput and ultra-low latency, Bitcoin Hyper aims to deliver sub-second performance to wrapped BTC payments, DeFi protocols, NFT platforms, and even gaming environments, without dragging interactions through 10-minute blocks. A decentralized Canonical Bridge manages BTC flow between layers, while SPL-style token support and Rust tooling make it easier for Solana-native developers to deploy dApps that tap into Bitcoin’s liquidity without learning an entirely new stack. Momentum on the fundraising side has been strong. The presale has now raised more than $28.1M, placing it among the larger early-stage Bitcoin L2 launches, with tokens currently priced at $0.013305. Recent on-chain activity shows four whale wallets accumulating roughly $532K, including a $53K single purchase, a sign of early conviction from size-on-chain buyers. Those looking to position early can explore how to buy $HYPER, while long-term analysts may want to revisit the latest Bitcoin Hyper price prediction to understand where the project could sit if demand for scalable BTC layers continues to build. Join the $HYPER presale now. If Bitcoin Hyper is a bet on Bitcoin becoming a high-performance settlement engine, Best Wallet is a bet on controlling the front door that users walk through to access that ecosystem. Its pitch is bold: capture a massive share of the wallet market by the end of 2026 by merging security, presale access, liquidity routing, and a smoother user experience into a single interface. The stack behind it is surprisingly serious. Best Wallet integrates Fireblocks’ MPC-CMP architecture at the wallet layer, the same institutional-grade key management used by major exchanges, then layers on portfolio analytics, presale discovery, and Rubic-powered DEX aggregation. In a market where users hop between Bitcoin L2s, Ethereum rollups, Solana, and Base within the same session, routing matters. If a wallet controls where swaps, bridges, and presale entries originate, its native token can effectively tax that flow via fee rebates, yield boosts, or future governance over routing paths. Traction has also been strong. The Best Wallet presale has raised $17.22M+ so far, with tokens currently priced around $0.025975. Staking utilizes a dynamic APY model (currently 76%), adjusting rewards based on demand, lock durations, and liquidity conditions. This mechanism is designed to prevent runaway emissions and keep incentives responsive as volumes shift. If the next cycle brings another wave of retail onboarding as Bitcoin pushes toward or past its highs, the wallets that sit closest to user intent become some of the most leveraged positions in the ecosystem, and Best Wallet is aiming directly at that layer. For traders mapping out the potential upside, our Best Wallet token price prediction offers useful context on how its market share ambitions could translate into value. Explore Best Wallet’s roadmap and presale details. SPX6900 ($SPX) lives on the far end of the spectrum: a meme-driven ERC-20 that blends parody, market cynicism, and pure speculative energy into a single ticker. It primarily runs on Ethereum but extends across Solana and Base via Wormhole, providing multichain liquidity and cross-community reach. Circulating supply sits near 930M SPX, supported by deflationary burn mechanics that lean into the “engineered scarcity” meme. The token’s breakout moment came in early 2024 when it briefly crossed the $1.5B market-cap milestone before cooling toward the mid-hundreds of millions, still enough to hover near the top-100 bracket and sit shoulder-to-shoulder with established meme heavyweights.] Its culture centers on satire, speed, and collective in-jokes rather than utility, but that’s precisely why traders watch it. In risk-on windows, especially when AI stocks rip or Bitcoin reclaims momentum, SPX tends to act as a volatility amplifier. Liquidity often rotates from majors into meme assets with cross-chain presence, and SPX’s ties to Project AEON NFTs give it extra surface area for speculative flows. Track SPX6900 across major exchanges and analytics dashboards. Explore Bitcoin Hyper now.

Title: In the Wake of the U.S. November Elections and the Reopening of Government? Food Insecurity, Worsening Economic and Social Crisis
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/elections-reopening-government-social-crisis-worsen/5906324
Time Published: 2025-11-20T12:29:54Z
Full Content:
On November 4, the electorate in several United States municipalities and gubernatorial races delivered a resounding rebuke to the current trajectory of the MAGA Republicans who control both Houses of Congress and the White House. The elections came just over two weeks after the second “No Kings Day” around the U.S. which mobilized an estimated 7 million people. Therefore, on electoral and mass levels people are expressing their disagreement and anger with policy imperatives of the current administration. During the months of October and early November, the U.S. Senate could not agree on a national budget to keep the federal government functioning. The major issue stalling an agreement was the threat on the part of the administration and its allies in Congress to not provide adequate funding for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) which was passed during the tenure of former President Barack Obama. Although the ACA has never been a viable substitute for a genuine national insurance program which would guarantee healthcare to all persons living in the country, the dissolution of what is labelled pejoratively as “Obamacare” absent of an alternative would of course prove disastrous. These cuts in healthcare funding, which delayed the reopening of the federal government for 43 days, resulted in the refusal of the administration to provide billions of dollars in Supplemental Nutrition Agriculture Program (SNAP) benefits to tens of millions of people. It would take a federal court decision demanding that the Trump administration pay out benefits to families which rely on these programs for a bare minimum of food to compel partial payments. Some states in the U.S. recognizing the potential for severe malnourishment, did release emergency funds to stave off a major food deficit crisis. . . Yet the crises are by no means resolved. Although the Republicans in the Senate pledged to reopen a debate on the extension of existing ACA subsidies, there is no methodology for holding them accountable. If the costs of healthcare premiums for ACA recipients increase substantially, it could very well portend the demise of the program since those within low-and-moderate income households would not be able to afford enrollments in this program. In addition to threats to the existence of the ACA, there is currently a bill under consideration in Congress which would place two-year limits, with some exceptions, on Section 8 housing subsidies. If these plans are carried out it would result in homelessness for millions more in the U.S. Consequently, the suspension of SNAP benefits, the overpricing for healthcare coverage and the severe curtailment of housing subsidies would inevitably result in the premature deaths of millions in the U.S. One commentator over the conservative Fox News network said on air that people who have no homes to live in should be given lethal injections by the government. These developments had a profound impact on mass mobilizations against Trump as well as the outcomes of the November 4 elections. The emerging crises requires an independent strategy to build a sustainable resistance movement to not only stop the ongoing attacks from the White House and Congress, the struggle must move to enhance the social safety net and improve the overall economic conditions for the workers, farmers and youth inside the U.S. One of the most watched elections during early November was the mayoral race in New York City, the largest municipality in the country. Zohran Mamdani won the election as a stated democratic socialist committed to lowering the cost of housing, public transportation and childcare. Mamdani emphasized that the municipality was a “city of immigrants” and therefore should not cooperate with efforts by the Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) agents to hunt down and deport residents of New York. During the days leading up to the elections, ICE personnel attacked vendors on Canal Street in Manhattan who are there daily merely to make a living amid rising inflation. People in the neighborhood battled the federal agents demonstrating their opposition to the immigration policies of the White House. In other elections where Democratic candidates won gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, undoubtedly were the voters’ response to the presence of ICE and the worsening economic situation facing working people. In California, a referendum to create five new Congressional districts was a direct response to the actions of the Texas state legislature to enhance the membership of the MAGA Republican representation in the House of Representatives. Los Angeles, the second largest municipality in the U.S., has been targeted by the Trump administration by deploying large units of ICE agents along with federalized National Guard troops and Marines. These efforts by Trump have not endeared people in California and other states to his domestic policies. In Memphis, Tennessee and Washington, D.C., the deployment of the National Guard was carried out absent any support for these actions by the people. The State of Illinois and the City of Chicago have taken legal and political actions to prevent the sending of National Guard troops into the third-largest city in the country. On a daily basis people in Chicago and its suburbs have been challenging ICE in their raids on communities, workplaces and commercial businesses. Portland, Oregon, which is not a majority African American or Latin American municipality, has also been targeted in all likelihood for its progressive population which fought the deployment of federal agents during the George Floyd uprising of 2020. On a legal basis and through mass demonstrations, the people of Portland strongly objected to the sending of National Guard troops into the city. Although Trump declared that ICE, the Custom and Border Patrol (CBP) agents and the National Guard are being deployed to find, detain and deport migrants, in actuality his security personnel have stated that they are after “gangs” and drug traffickers. These agents are setting up checkpoints to monitor the populations as a whole. Despite the claim of economic prosperity over the last ten months, untold numbers of workers, farmers, agricultural employees, small and medium-sized businesses are suffering immensely due to the repressive apparatus of the state. Many people are afraid to go to work while others cannot patronize businesses due to cutbacks in services. Large transnational corporations are being impacted as well with layoffs in the auto industry, delivery services and hospitality sectors. Sonder corporation after ending its partnership with Marriot International, has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Amazon, UPS, Verizon and others have announced the layoffs of tens of thousands of employees. These layoffs will compound the problem of joblessness brought about by the massive downsizing within the federal government since the Trump administration came to power. During the campaign for president in 2024, Trump claimed that he would end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours. After 10 months, the war rages on with Russian Federation troops now surrounding Ukrainian forces in Pokrovsk and Kupiansk. Sanctions against the Russian Federation and continuing weapons supplies from the U.S., UK and the European Union (EU) have failed to turn the tide of the war. Many other false statements related to ending the war in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have further exposed the ineffectiveness of U.S. foreign policy. The forced migration to at least five African states continues to prompt protests and legal actions in the U.S. and in at least one country on the continent. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is threatened with wider military assaults. Dozens have been executed extrajudicially by the Pentagon under the guise of fighting illegal drug smuggling into the U.S. In response, the government of President Nicholas Maduro has mobilized over 5 million people to resist any attempted land invasion. In Palestine people are still being killed, displaced, denied food and medical services weeks after a ceasefire was declared. Trump’s meeting with the Saudi monarchy will not benefit the workers and oppressed peoples in the U.S. and West Asia. These domestic and foreign initiatives by the U.S. administration are not reflective of growing strength among the imperialist states. It is a clear signal of a political quagmire and economic decline of Washington, Wall Street and its allies around the world. Therefore, the resistance movement to the Trump administration must seek allies broadly inside the U.S. as well as internationally. This global alliance of progressive and revolutionary forces provides the only method for the reversal of the present period of reaction. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Shoppers are still flocking to Walmart. The company raised its full-year earnings and sales outlook Thursday, heading into the crucial holiday shopping season. Walmart also offered fresh signs that it is shedding its original identity as a strictly down-market brick-and-mortar operation by growing its e-commerce business and increasing its market share of higher-income shoppers. Walmart's shares closed more than 6% higher Thursday, even as the broader market suffered a dramatic sell-off. The stock is up more than 18% this year. The biggest retailer and grocer in the United States acknowledged the added financial pressures on lower-income households but said middle-income families are holding up. Walmart saw more sales growth in its grocery and health and wellness product categories than in general merchandise. "As pocketbooks have been stretched, you're seeing more consumer dollars go to necessities versus discretionary items," Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said on a call with analysts Thursday morning. The company reported that same-store sales for Walmart U.S. rose 4.5% in the quarter that ended Oct. 31, exceeding analysts’ expectations. “The team delivered another strong quarter across the business. eCommerce was a bright spot again this quarter. We’re gaining market share, improving delivery speed, and managing inventory well,” outgoing CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement. Walmart reported 27% growth in e-commerce sales globally. Walmart also announced that it will move from trading on the New York Stock Exchange to the tech-heavy Nasdaq next month. It’s the latest sign of America's largest private employer working to position itself as tech-forward in order to compete with Amazon. The discounter's third-quarter earnings come amid growing questions about whether Americans contending with tariffs, corporate layoffs and accelerating inflation are still confidently spending on retail. As a bellwether for the U.S. economy and consumer confidence, Walmart’s strong earnings and guidance indicate that consumers are still shopping — at least at the lower end of the retail price point. The company announced last week that McMillon will step down in January. McMillon, 59, started at Walmart as an associate in the 1980s and has helmed the company since 2014. Under his leadership, Walmart improved pay and benefits for many employees, renovated hundreds of stores and boosted its e-commerce and delivery programs, especially during the Covid pandemic. John Furner, CEO of Walmart U.S., will take over the top job Feb. 1. Since 2019, Furner has led Walmart's American operations — by far the largest slice of the company, with around 1.6 million of Walmart's approximately 2.1 million total associates worldwide. Walmart is leading the retail race against longtime rival Target, which Wednesday reported a drop in third-quarter sales and cut its full-year profit guidance. Target’s sales have faltered over the last few years, with some consumers expressing frustration over what they said were disorganized stores and rollbacks of the company's diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. In October, Target said it would cut about 1,800 corporate jobs. Target is hoping for a fresh start in the new year. Incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke will take over Feb. 1, the same day Furner becomes CEO of Walmart. The struggling retailer said Wednesday that it plans to increase its investment in stores and technology next year by 25%. Since January, U.S. businesses have had to contend with ever-changing tariffs under the Trump administration. Walmart has navigated the uncertainty by raising prices on some items, while swallowing some tariff costs on others. In the three months that ended Oct. 31, prices at Walmart U.S. rose around 1% overall, with higher prices on electronics, toys and seasonal items in particular due to tariff pressures. In the grocery section, Walmart expects egg prices to drop but anticipates the record-breaking beef prices will stay high, in part from cattle herds shrinking over the last few decades. Prices for other grocery staples are also up, though the Trump administration's rollback of tariffs on many food items last week could offer some relief. Despite the rising prices, Walmart is offering its annual Thanksgiving menu deal for 10 at less than $4 per person. It's less expensive than last year's package, but it also contains fewer items. The company is also expanding its use of artificial intelligence, teaming up with OpenAI to allow customers to buy from Walmart within ChatGPT. Walmart has not detailed the terms of the partnership or shared when the new option could be available. This week, Target announced its own collaboration with OpenAI. Walmart has lagged behind rival Amazon in AI-driven e-commerce — Amazon debuted its Rufus shopping assistant in February 2024, more than a year before Walmart launched its counterpart, Sparky.

It’s getting frothy out there. Pick any stock market metric, whether it’s the Nasdaq’s closing price or a more technical measure like the Shiller P/E ratio, and the number will look unusually large. Throw in crazy AI valuations, for privately held startups and publicly traded stocks alike, and what we’re seeing looks a lot like a bubble. Perhaps this time is different. But note that phrase served as the ironic title of an acclaimed 2011 book by economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff—a work whose subtitle is “Eight Centuries of Financial Folly.” In any case, if you’re one of many looking at your swollen portfolio with a mix of glee and dread, it may be time to consider a rebalancing act. This section of this year’s Investor’s Guide offers some ideas on how to go about that. We offer tips on how to play defense in the current stock market (spoiler: Candymakers are a sweet bet for sour times). We also devote some space to stocks that might be best held at arm’s length; whatever these companies’ ultimate fates might be, these aren’t the times or the prices at which to be a buyer. And for optimists, we have a preview of some buzzy rumored IPOs coming next year. Choppy markets can make for attractively priced debuts: Perhaps you will find the next UPS, which went public right before the dotcom bust, or Visa, which listed on the eve of the 2008 financial crisis. We’ll also weigh in on gold and Bitcoin. In the wake of Warren Buffett penning his final letter to investors, it feels fitting to say his most famous adage applies like never before: Be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy. Jim Masturzo, chief investment officer of multi-asset strategies at investment manager Research Affiliates, says a good first step is to diversify beyond stocks to TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) or commodities like gold. When it comes to equities, Roger Aliaga-Diaz, Vanguard chief economist in the Americas, advises embracing value stocks—stocks whose prices are low relative to their earnings. Not all value stocks are created equal, of course. Here are some categories and names to consider that are likely to fare well in an economic downturn (prices are as of market close Nov. 13): Consumer plays:Amy Arnott, a portfolio strategist at financial services firm Morningstar, says companies that produce staples like food and cleaning products are less correlated with broader economic trends. Stocks in this “consumer defensive” category include Colgate-Palmolive (CL, $79), which makes toothpaste and other household items. In addition to selling goods that consumers will buy in any economy, “Colgate is unique in the fact that they are very globally diversified,” says Erin Lash, Morningstar’s director of consumer equity research. Lash is also a fan of Mondelez International (MDLZ, $57), a candy, food, and beverage company, in part because it derives more than 70% of its revenue outside North America. “Confectionery in particular remains an affordable indulgence for consumers,” she says. You’ve still got your health: Stocks in the health care sector, another recession-resistant industry, are another way to buffer your portfolio from market shocks. David Trainer, CEO of investment research firm New Constructs, likes HCA Healthcare (HCA,$473), which operates around 190 hospitals and 150 other health care facilities in the U.S. and U.K. “Demand for health care is going up like crazy,” says Trainer, adding that this trend, combined with HCA’s more-than-decade-long history of notching consistent profits, makes it a strong, undervalued play. Energy hogs: Once-boring energy stocks became buzzy owing to the AI sector’s insatiable need for power, which has produced record-high electricity demand. But even if the AI boom goes south, energy businesses aren’t as risky as they seem, says Masturzo of Research Affiliates, because overall demand for power remains strong. MPLX (MPLX, $52) is an Ohio company that owns oil pipelines and fuel transportation facilities. “As long as people need energy, they’re going to transport it,” says Trainer. Its price/earnings ratio in mid-November was 11, much lower than the average of 31 among the S&P 500. “Anti-AI”: Arnott, the strategist at Morningstar, says that if investors are worried about the overvaluation of AI stocks, they could look to Buffett. The business legend’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B, $513) is a conglomerate that Arnott describes as “an anti-AI play.” The firm derives much of its income from sectors like energy, railroads, and insurance—services that will be very much in demand even if the AI bull market turns bearish. In a frothy market all stocks are risky— and that’s doubly true for companies that may have soared too high in the recent boom, or that face harsh economic headwinds. Here are candidates to avoid, at least until business conditions revive or their prices come down to earth. Circle (CRCL, $82) went public this summer in one of the most successful IPOs in history. That was then; now, the crypto firm is struggling to hold its value as interest rates, which directly impact Circle’s stablecoin revenue, are poised to decline. Circle’s share price is facing further pressure from the end of a lockup period for employee stock sales, and its ongoing struggle to control expenses. Tesla (TSLA, $402) is on pace to record its worst year of profits since 2021. It’s also headed for a second straight year of shrinking sales in its car business. Still, the stock is trading at all-time highs. Why? Investors are likely betting that CEO Elon Musk will deliver on moonshot promises of self-driving cars and humanoid robots. Maybe Musk is worth his recently won $1 trillion pay package, but the likelihood of Tesla turbocharging its car sales in 2026 to match its current valuation seems out of this world. Bears are sounding the alarm over inflated valuations for AI companies, and there’s perhaps no purer publicly traded AI play than CoreWeave (CRWV, $78). The company operates data centers across the U.S. and sells computing capacity to Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. CoreWeave “is the poster child of the AI infrastructure bubble,” Kerrisdale Capital, an investment management firm shorting the company’s stock, wrote in September. The core of CoreWeave’s risk lies with its liabilities: To finance the construction of its data centers, it has incurred billions in debt and taken on hefty lease obligations. Can it juice its revenue to outpace that tsunami of liabilities? Two words: prediction markets. That describes the business of upstarts Kalshi and Polymarket, which made their names offering odds on U.S. politics, but are fast expanding to other categories—including sports betting. This has left DraftKings (DKNG, $30) one of the most popular online sportsbooks, on its back foot. “Analysts are downplaying the tectonic shift that we believe is occurring in the sports betting market and DKNG,” wrote short-seller Spruce Point Capital Management in an October report. After President Trump unveiled a sweeping set of tariffs on what he termed “Liberation Day,” swaths of companies saw their share prices tumble. Many have since recovered, but Deere (DE, $473), the venerable maker of John Deere agricultural and construction machinery, has continued to struggle. For the first three quarters of 2025, the company reported year-over-year decreases in net sales, and it’s been wrestling with the impact as trade wars play havoc with American farm exports—not a good sign for tractor sales. If 2024 amounted to an IPO drought, the 2025 IPO market has been more like a persistent drizzle. That, more or less, bodes well for an even steadier stream of public debuts in 2026. “The IPO market is not closed,” says Merritt Hummer, partner at Bain Capital Ventures. “It’s just curated, and I think that’ll continue to be the case. That cautious but decidedly positive sentiment is a bigger deal than it may appear on the surface. After IPOs soared in 2021 amid near-zero interest rates and stay-athome investor mania, the past few years have been muted. According to Dealogic, there were 1,010 IPOs in the U.S. in 2021, including marquee brands like Rivian, Bumble, and Robinhood. Over the next three years, however, the market collectively mustered only 546 more public offerings, with just a handful of big names in the mix. Then came 2025, which through Q3 has seen more than 300 U.S. IPOs, including blockbuster debuts from CoreWeave, Circle, and Figma. It was a decent but not great year in the view of market watchers, but they’re bullish on 2026. “Everything is set up for a much more positive year, because multiples are still pretty strong for tech in the public markets,” says Kyle Stanford, PitchBook director of research for U.S. venture capital. Geopolitical instability has fueled post-2021 stagnation in the IPO market, as have higher interest rates. But that stagnation means the bench for potential venture-backed IPOs runs deep with companies that have been biding their time. There are obvious giants waiting in the 2026 wings, the most notable of which is Databricks, a cloud platform for AI and data analytics valued north of $100 billion. Long discussed as an inevitable public company, Databricks has a key advantage that will be essential for any company looking to go public at a premium: an AI angle. “Anything with an AI story is getting a premium,” says Mary D’Onofrio, Crosslink Capital partner. “Databricks, for example, had $4 billion of run rate revenue, and AI products were providing $1 billion of it…Anything that can touch on AI, which tugs on the purse strings and the willingness to buy of customers, suggests ongoing growth.” This is equally true for other names attracting IPO buzz, including Canva, which in 2024 acquired Leonardo.ai, leveraging the startup to launch new AI-flavored products. (The successful IPO of fellow design unicorn Figma is being cited as evidence of Canva’s readiness.) There’s also Deel, an HR platform valued at around $17 billion, which makes its AI case by investing in automation. (Notably, none of these companies are making the kinds of massive infrastructure investments that have some industry watchers worried about an AI bubble.) All this AI talk evokes the question: What about OpenAI? It’s not impossible, but most watchers think OpenAI won’t take the leap into public markets until 2027. Meanwhile, the most underrated IPO story of 2026 could very well be fintech. This year saw the likes of Chime, Klarna, and Circle go public, and unicorns like Plaid and Rapyd are rumored to be waiting in the wings. “Chime and Circle showed that fintechs with clear profitability paths can perform well, and that gave the market confidence again,” says Aditi Maliwal, Upfront Ventures general partner and early Chime investor. “‘Profitability’ wasn’t a word anyone was using in the 2012 to 2019 runup. And now it’s the most important term we talk about and are thinking about for next year.” Others tech firms to watch out for: cybersecurity company 1Password, fleet management software provider Motive, and fitness tracking app Strava. But a word of caution: A host of factors could rain on this parade. PitchBook’s Stanford doesn’t expect a recession, but says that if one materialized it would stymie the IPO pipeline. And then there are the unpredictable dynamics of the AI boom. David Chen, Morgan Stanley’s head of global technology investment banking, thinks much of the current hype will create serious long-term value. But not every AI-fueled rise will live up to that hype. “It kind of reminds me of when I started in this industry in 1999,” Chen says. “If expectations aren’t met…you’ll have a lessening of interest temporarily, which always happens in tech. There are always winners and losers.” Gold has always been the ultimate safe haven in times of economic trouble. But these days, a growing number of market watchers say investors should opt instead for digital gold—a popular nickname for Bitcoin. Owing to the rules governing its creation, there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins in circulation, which is a big reason fans say it should be treated as a permanent store of value, just like the famous yellow metal. “It’s the only place you can go that’s independent from government inflation,” says David Pakman, a managing partner at the venture capital firm CoinFund. “It’s the kind of asset you’ll hand down to your kids—you must own it.” It’s clear many people agree with Pakman, based on Bitcoin hitting a record-high price of around $125,000 in October, and seeing its market cap swell to over $2 trillion. The World Gold Council and prominent goldbugs, who used to ignore Bitcoin, now regularly denounce it, recognizing competition. Does this mean gold’s days as the safest of assets are numbered? Hardly. As of November, Bitcoin’s market cap was only around 7% of the total value of all above-ground gold. What’s more, gold has been on an unprecedented tear this year, hitting $3,000 an ounce for the first time in March, and $4,000 less than six months later. The eye-popping runs have left goldbugs and Bitcoin believers ecstatic. But Mike McGlone, a senior commodities strategist with Bloomberg Intelligence, says he is experiencing a different emotion. He describes himself as “frightened” by the soaring prices of numerous commodities, including gold, and believes a major correction is coming that could see the price of the yellow metal drop 25% or more. McGlone says he is especially skeptical of Bitcoin’s trajectory after attending an investing summit in Naples where he witnessed people stand and clap whenever someone mentioned the cryptocurrency. “This is classic peak market stuff,” he warned, predicting that Bitcoin could fall to around $50,000 in the coming year. Indeed, there are signs that the crypto rally, fueled by the launch of Bitcoin ETFs and the Trump administration’s favorable regulatory policies, is running out of gas. In early November, the currency dipped below the $100,000 mark and has since floated closer to that level than to its all-time high. Pakman, though, is taking the long view. “It’s just the greatest asset ever created,” he said. “Bitcoin has performed better than any asset over 11 of the last 14 years. —Jeff John Roberts This article appears in the December 2025/January 2026 issue of Fortune with the headline “What to buy, and not buy, in 2026.” This article is part of Fortune’s 2026 Investor’s Guide.

Title: Long-delayed jobs report to show hiring amid wobbly economy

The fresh data arrives about six weeks after its initially scheduled release. Employers hired far more workers than expected in September, defying a sharp slowdown over the summer that appeared to cool off the labor market. The U.S. added 119,000 jobs in September, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That figure marked an acceleration from the previous month, and it exceeded an average of nearly 100,000 jobs added per month over the first half of 2025. The report included a downward revision for the month of August, however, slashing performance from 22,000 jobs gained that month to 4,000 jobs lost. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4%, which marks the highest level since October 2021. Still, the unemployment rate remains low by historical standards. A stock market selloff over recent days underscored the uncertainty looming over the economy as some investors warned of an AI bubble. Blockbuster earnings unveiled by chip giant Nvidia late Wednesday, however, appeared to rebuke such concerns. Mass layoffs at corporate giants like Amazon, UPS and Verizon in recent weeks have drawn attention to a sluggish labor market -- and stoked fears that job losses may spread. It is likely too early to panic, however, some economists previously told ABC News. While the layoffs reflect a weakened labor market and AI adoption in some corners of the tech industry, they added, the prospect of wider job losses remains highly uncertain. Inflation has picked up in recent months while hiring has slowed, posing a risk of an economic double-whammy known as "stagflation." Those economic conditions have put the Federal Reserve in a bind, since the central bank must balance a dual mandate to keep inflation under control and maximize employment. “We have the situation where the risks are to the upside for inflation and to the downside for employment. We have one tool,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference in Washington, D.C., last month. “You can’t address both of those at once.” Still, Powell said, concern has tilted toward strain in the labor market, prompting the central bank to reduce interest rates a quarter of a percentage point at each of its last two meetings. "A further reduction of the policy rate in December is not a foregone conclusion -- in fact, far from it," Powell told reporters. Traders peg the chances interest rates will be left unchanged next month at about 66%, while the odds of a quarter-point rate cut stand at 33%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, a measure of market sentiment. On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said it would not release a full jobs report for the month of October due to lost capacity during the shutdown. Rather, partial jobs data for October will be released as part of the November report, the BLS said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: September jobs report arrives today, almost seven weeks behind schedule

Scott Horsley Hiring picked up in the early fall after a lackluster summer. A report from the Labor Department on Thursday shows employers added 119,000 jobs in September. Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Images hide caption Hiring picked up in the early fall after a lackluster summer. An overdue report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed U.S. employers added 119,000 jobs in September, while the unemployment rate inched up to 4.4%. The report was released almost seven weeks behind schedule due to the government shutdown. And because the shutdown also delayed data-gathering, there won't be another jobs report until mid-December. While the newly released information is a bit stale, it may offer some clues about the pace of hiring and firing this fall. The report paints a mixed picture of the job market. Hiring was strongest in health care and hospitality in September, while factories and warehouses cut jobs. Downsizing in the federal government also continued during the month, though state and local governments continued to add jobs. Revised data shows job growth in July and August was even weaker than initially reported, with 33,000 fewer jobs added during those months. Loading... For months now, employers have neither added many new workers nor handed out a lot of pink slips. But Federal Reserve Governor Chris Waller worries that's about to change. Waller says his conversations with business leaders show the job market is close to stalling. "Four to six weeks ago, we were still in this kind of no-hire/no-fire mode," Waller told a group of economists in London this week. Business leaders, he said, are "starting to talk about layoffs. They're starting to plan for them in the future." Amazon recently announced 14,000 job cuts, and Verizon is cutting 15,000 workers. Waller wants the Fed to cut interest rates again when policymakers meet next month, to boost demand and prop up the labor market. But minutes from the last Fed meeting, released on Wednesday, show considerable disagreement among central bank policymakers. Many members of the Fed's rate-setting committee suggested it would be appropriate to hold interest rates steady for the rest of the year, noting that inflation has remained stubbornly above the Fed's 2% target. That's partly due to President Trump's tariffs. And some Fed policymakers think the import taxes will continue to put upward pressure on goods prices well into next year. Ordinarily, the Fed would have jobs numbers for October and November in hand before its next meeting. But because of the government shutdown, those reports won't be released until after the meeting, and some of the October data won't come out at all. It's also uncertain when or if the October inflation report will be published. That said, Waller insists he and his colleagues are not flying blind. They've been listening to businesses like Target and McDonald's that say many of their customers are cautious with their spending right now. That could put more of a squeeze on the job market. "You just go talk with firms that work with low- and middle-income households, they'll tell you point-blank, they're just not coming in the door," Waller said. "And then these firms are not going to be hiring." While government data on consumer spending has also been held up by the shutdown, anecdotal reports suggest only the wealthiest families are spending freely these days, buoyed in part by the gains in their stock portfolios. The unemployment rate is driven by two forces: the number of jobs employers want to fill and the number of workers available to fill those jobs. The Trump administration's crackdown on immigration has limited the number of foreign-born workers, at the same time many native-born baby boomers are retiring. Some analysts argue that the limited supply of workers is largely responsible for the slowdown in hiring. Waller worries that the slowdown is driven more by a declining need for workers, which could result in higher unemployment in the months to come. "There's definitely a reduction of supply," he said. "But to me that is masking the reduction in demand, and that's what I'm concerned about." Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Title: The September jobs report is finally here

news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time The United States added 119,000 jobs in September, a stronger-than-expected figure and a sign that the economy was adding jobs at a healthy clip before government shutdown. But the details of the report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics paint a more mixed picture, that of a labor market that has recently begun to look wobblier amid high-profile layoff announcements from a host of blue-chip companies. September's employment gains were concentrated in health care, food and drinking establishments, and social assistance. Manufacturing shed 6,000 jobs, continuing a trend in a sector the Trump administration has touted as a key target of its economic policies. Transportation and warehousing also lost 25,300 jobs. The unemployment rate climbed from 4.3% to 4.4% in September, though the pickup was due in part to an increase in the labor force, which the BLS said gained 450,000 new potential workers. The pace of wage growth slowed. Thursday’s report was originally supposed to be released Oct. 3, but it was shelved because of the government shutdown. Jobs data collected for October will be released Dec. 16 as part of the full report covering November, the BLS said Wednesday. The absence of official economic reports over the past six weeks has made it difficult to accurately assess the current state of the jobs market. But data from private and alternative sources has painted a worrisome portrait amid signs of softening consumption among many households and stubborn price increases. Over the past few weeks, Amazon, General Motors, IBM, Microsoft, Paramount, Target and UPS have announced plans to eliminate tens of thousands of jobs. Their ranks were joined Thursday by Verizon, which announced the start of layoffs affecting 13,000, according to an internal memo. About 39,000 workers received layoff notices in October, according to data tracked by the Cleveland Federal Reserve — a number last seen in May and before that only during times of crisis. A separate report released this month by the research firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas counted 153,000 job cuts announced in October, though some analysts give less weight to its data over methodology questions. Whatever the exact total, those who do find themselves without work are now experiencing an average unemployment spell of 24.5 weeks — nearly six months. That’s the worst reading since November 2017. Tiffany Price, South Florida general manager for Job News USA, a job listings service, said many companies face budget cuts and have effectively frozen hiring. And what companies are still hiring are offering lower compensation rates that more experienced workers may have trouble accepting. The number of employers who attended a recent Job News jobs fair at Amerant Bank Arena in Broward County, Florida, was nearly half the figure of a year ago, while attendance among workers held steady at about 2,000 potential applicants, Price said. Still, many organizations report difficulties finding qualified workers, she said. On both the employer and the employee sides, a “post and pray” job application strategy has taken hold that leads to worse outcomes for both, she said. More successful outcomes on both fronts have come from local relationships and face-to-face outreach. A bright spot has been local government, Price said — something that is reflected in the national data, which shows employment in local government roles has continuously expanded since the Covid-19 pandemic recovery set in. “It’s a weird market,” she said. Questions about the health of the labor market now dominate discussions about whether the Federal Reserve should continue to cut interest rates. On Monday, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said a December cut was needed to stem further job-market deterioration. “My focus is on the labor market, and after months of weakening, it is unlikely that the September jobs report later this week or any other data in the next few weeks would change my view that another cut is in order,” he said. In his speech last month announcing a 0.25% rate cut, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was more circumspect, saying it appeared that the jobs market was weakening only gradually and signaling he was not ready to guarantee a December rate cut was inevitable. The Fed’s divisions were laid bare in meeting notes released Wednesday from the October rate-setting meeting that showed a sharp split among policymakers about the risk that lower rates would spur already-elevated inflation by making it easier for consumers and businesses to borrow money. “Most participants noted that, against a backdrop of elevated inflation readings and a very gradual cooling of labor market conditions, further” interest-rate cuts “could add to the risk of higher inflation becoming entrenched,” the notes said. So far, many economic analysts have been reluctant to call it a full-blown jobs crisis, pointing to data from state-level claims for unemployment that remain subdued and recent reports from the payrolls processor ADP showing a slight rebound in new hires. “Fears of a renewed labour market downturn, amid reports of mass layoffs at several large firms, are not reflected in still-muted jobless claims or the pick-up in hiring in the ADP private payrolls report,” Thomas Ryan, North America economist for Capital Economics research group, wrote in a note published last week.

November 20, 2025 04:51 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Nov. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Janitorial Services Market With Impact Analysis of US Tariffs (2025 Edition)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.One of the most significant drivers of the janitorial services market is the heightened awareness of health and hygiene, particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic shifted the way businesses, institutions, and even households perceive cleanliness. As organizations adopt stricter cleaning protocols to mitigate the spread of infections, the demand for professional janitorial services has surged. Regular deep cleaning, sanitation, and disinfection have become standard practices in many industries, particularly healthcare, hospitality, and retail.Moreover, due to expansion of commercial spaces such as offices, malls, and entertainment centres has also contributed to the growth of the janitorial services market. As new buildings and facilities are constructed, there is a corresponding demand for ongoing cleaning and maintenance services. This demand is particularly prominent in rapidly urbanizing regions, where commercial real estate and industrial activities are increasing. In developing economies, urbanization and industrialization have led to the rise of new buildings, fuelling the need for more comprehensive cleaning services.Another factor driving the janitorial market is the growing preference for eco-friendly and sustainable cleaning solutions. As environmental concerns become more prevalent, companies are increasingly opting for green cleaning practices that minimize the use of harmful chemicals and reduce environmental impact. Janitorial service providers that offer green cleaning options are seeing greater demand, especially from environmentally conscious organizations and sectors like education and healthcare. Furthermore, innovations in cleaning technologies are also playing a significant role in the expansion of the janitorial services market. The adoption of advanced cleaning equipment, such as automated floor scrubbers, high-efficiency vacuums, and even robotic cleaners, has improved the efficiency and effectiveness of janitorial services. These technological tools enable faster and more thorough cleaning, which is particularly important for large-scale facilities such as airports, shopping centres, and hospitals.The janitorial services market in North America is mature, with steady demand driven by the healthcare, corporate, and retail sectors. The United States is the largest contributor to the region's market, where businesses continue to outsource cleaning services to improve efficiency. Additionally, the growing adoption of green cleaning solutions and the demand for specialized cleaning services in healthcare facilities are contributing to the market's growth. Moreover, in Asia-Pacific region is experiencing rapid growth in the janitorial services market, driven by increasing urbanization, industrialization, and the expansion of commercial spaces. Countries such as China, India, and Japan are key contributors to the market's growth, where the rise of new infrastructure and commercial projects creates a strong demand for cleaning services. The hospitality and retail sectors, in particular, are expanding in this region, further fuelling the demand for janitorial services.Outsourcing facility management, including janitorial services, allows businesses to cut costs significantly. By outsourcing, companies avoid the expense of hiring, training, and managing in-house cleaning staff, purchasing cleaning equipment, and maintaining inventory of supplies. Specialized janitorial service providers can offer more cost-effective solutions due to economies of scale, better pricing on cleaning materials, and expertise in optimizing cleaning schedules. This makes outsourcing an attractive option, especially for large businesses and organizations with extensive facilities.Companies are increasingly focusing on their core competencies and leaving non-core functions such as cleaning and facility management to professionals. By outsourcing janitorial services, organizations can allocate more resources and time to improving their primary operations, such as customer service, production, or business development. This is particularly appealing to businesses in industries like healthcare, education, and hospitality, where the main focus is on delivering quality services to customers, patients, or students.Janitorial service providers bring specialized knowledge, expertise, and the latest technologies to facility management. With access to modern cleaning methods, eco-friendly products, and advanced equipment such as robotic cleaners and automated systems, outsourced providers can deliver high-quality services that meet industry standards. This allows businesses to benefit from cutting-edge cleaning solutions without the need to invest in expensive equipment or train staff.

Title: Will the AI Bubble Pop In 2025 or 2026? How About Nvidia and OpenAI?

Written by: Kyle Prevost Back in the spring I wrote about AI investing in Canada, and why I was pretty cautious about advising anyone to invest in the AI bubble. Well, so far, youâd have been right to completely disregard that advice and go 100% in on AI stocks like Nvidia! That said, Iâve been doing quite a bit of AI Bubble related reading in the past couple of weeks, and Iâm more sure than ever that folks should be looking to at least partially diversify away from the tech craze and into low risk investments. Once again, itâs worth pointing out right upfront that while I believe the AI bubble is real and verifiable, I have no idea whether it will âpopâ tomorrow, in 6 months, or a year from now. As I write this, tech stocks have had several down days in a row, so itâs even possible that the AI bubble is deflating in real time! As someone who uses a large language model AI (LLM) every day, Iâm also quite familiar with the real productivity gains that AI offers. Investors need to understand that artificial intelligence can be both a game-changing technology AND that many companies who are involved in the AI space are completely overvalued based on their current earnings and profit potential. Every few years, markets decide that one idea will change everything. In 1999 it was the internet. In 2006 it was housing (and the ability to re-sell mortgage contracts). In 2017 it was crypto (for the first time). In 2021 it was SPACs and meme stocks. Heck, in 1636 it was Dutch tulips. In 2025 it is AI. Some of those stories were truly world changing. Some were just world entertaining. The investment results depended on what you paid for shares of specific companies, how patient you were, and how concentrated your investment portfolio became. Answering the question of if AI is the next stock market bubble first becomes a matter of properly defining what a bubble is. While there are many different definitions out there, Iâll go with: A stock market bubble is when share prices disconnect from realistic future cash flows for an extended period. Usually it is the result of a great story, speculation over âeasy moneyâ to be made, and fear of missing out. One of my favourite Canadian commentators over at The Plain Bagel likes to frame it as: narrative running ahead of numbers. Most investment bubbles are not like the Dutch tulip crisis. Railroads did transform commerce. But itâs also true that speculation on railroad stocks also caused several massive stock market bubbles to form. Electricity did completely change day-to-day life. The internet did reshape business. Early investors who recognized those truths were not wrong. They were just often early, over-concentrated, or paying too high a price for shares of a specific company – even though there could be substantial future growth. Hereâs a brief look at the reasons I think the AI hype bubble is real – and why there are likely to be some very disappointed investors who are currently getting into the market. As always, check with your Canadian financial advisor before taking anyoneâs free thoughts on investing! 1) AI company valuations are very high. As I write this article, the cyber defence company named Planatir has a price-to-earnings ratio of over 400x. To put it mildlyâ¦ thatâs insane. By comparison, our best Canadian dividend stocks generally come in at 15-20x these days (and even that is somewhat high historically). Canadaâs biggest company – Shopify – isnât a pure AI stock, but itâs certainly tied to that world. It has a P/E ratio of about 100x. In order to live up to these crazy high future profit expectations, the companies will have to grow their revenue to insanely-high levels – and do that while keeping expenses low. The probability of being able to achieve that lofty outcome has to be less than 10% historically speaking. Aswath Damodaran and Scott Galloway are two prominent commentators that have repeatedly asserted that the AI hype story being told about these companies doesnât match the actual profit numbers being generated. I agree with the assertion that medium- and long-term profit potential just doesnât justify these wild valuations. 2) Concentration risk. A handful of mega caps explain an outsized share of market returns. We saw this in the Nifty Fifty era and the Dot Com run up. When breadth narrows and indices rely on a tiny cohort, you are fine until you are not. Right now, the five largest US stocks make up about 37% of the S&P 500 (meaning they are like 25% of the entire worldâs market cap). If you were to buy $100-worth of a Canadian all-in-one ETF (see our XEQT Review for more details) about $9.40 would be going to just three companies (Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft). You toss in a few more tech companies like Amazon, Shopify, Broadcom, Meta (Facebook), and Tesla – and now weâre talking more like $16.00.Â 3) Capex arms race is unsustainable. The tech ecosystem is currently spending staggering sums on GPUs, data centers, and power. That is great for the picks and shovels layer (Nvidia being the 800-pound gorilla in the proverbial room) while the virtual gold rush lasts. It becomes an issue when supply catches up and returns on incremental investment start to compress. Eventually, investors are going to get sick of burning money with no end in sight. Another capex issue is that those GPUs arenât like railway tracks – they will need to be replaced every 3-5 years. This will present a significant obstacle to ever realizing profits! 4) Copy & paste AI everywhere. With powerhouses like China putting out free open source AI applications such as Deep Seek, itâs doubtful that there will be many companies able to maintain large profit margins over the long term. Without those thick profit margins, the case for the high valuations goes south in a hurry. China is producing energy much much cheaper than we are in the West. Thatâs going to be a major AI input and choke point – so tell me again why Western AI companies are going to be so massively profitable? 5) FOMO marketing. From themed ETFs to viral threads, the sampling error of social media is large. Only the home runs get shared. Survivorship bias takes over. Kyla Scanlon is one of my favourite economic commentators (sheâs probably most famous for coining the term âvibe-sessionâ) has been clear about how emotions (aka: vibes) drive capital flows in the short term. There are very few emotional pulls out there stronger than the fear of missing out (FOMO). 6) Historical rhyme. The pattern looks familiar. Real tech, real adoption, valuations that start reasonable and drift into narratives that do not allow for normal business cycles. We have seen this movie (literally in the case of The Big Short). This Bloomberg graphic of the current AI supply chain and the money loops that keep it spinning really caught my eye recently. Note: The circle size roughly tracks market value. The colours show relationship types: who sells hardware or software, who provides cloud services, who is investing cash or venture capital. In the middle you see the four big hubs that everything flows through right now: OpenAI, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Oracle. Around them are chip makers and up-and-comers like AMD, Intel, CoreWeave, xAI, Mistral, Figure, and a handful of AI application startups. The picture says two things at once: the AI boom is highly interconnected, and a small number of firms sit at the choke points. The biggest arrows in the chart call out a few headline deals. Reports say OpenAI and Oracle struck a gigantic multiyear cloud agreement tied to Project Stargate, described as roughly 4.5 gigawatts of new data-center capacity and summarized by some outlets as about 300 billion dollars over five years, while the Financial Times framed it as about 30 billion dollars per year to lease capacity for 4.5 GW. Another set of arrows shows OpenAIâs pact with AMD: OpenAI plans to deploy up to 6 GW worth of AMD Instinct GPUs and received warrants or an option to buy up to 10 percent of AMD stock (about 160 million shares) as milestones are met. Nvidia shows up as both a supplier and an investor, with coverage describing a plan to invest up to 100 billion dollars in OpenAI, while Oracle, CoreWeave, and others are shown spending tens of billions on Nvidia chips to build out AI cloud capacity. Iâd argue the graphic makes the industry look like a circular money machine: vendors invest in customers who then commit to buy the vendorsâ products, sometimes with âup toâ figures, milestone triggers, or non-binding frameworks that will only convert if financing, power, and permitting line up. This diagram is either the blueprint to which companies will massively benefit from AI – or itâs a snapshot of a house of cards where power is concentrated in very few hands, and outside ecosystem revenue is counted on many different balance sheets. The prudent approach is to watch what shows up in financial filings over the next few quarters. Iâm looking at these questions specifically: 1) How much of Oracleâs cloud backlog converts to recognized revenue from OpenAI? 2) How AMD discloses any warrant exercises or dilution tied to OpenAI milestones? 3) Does Nvidiaâs alleged OpenAI investment actually close or is more of a âframework of a planâ? Now, to be fair, there are absolutely some good arguments that artificial intelligence is the real deal, and that it deserves all the hype and invested money. To be clear, I donât find this side of the debate as compelling, but itâs not like there isnât some solid rationale here. 1) Revenue is following the hype in some places. LLMs like ChatGPT are showing quickly increasing revenues. Some companies might have near-monopoly-style advantages for a while because of scale, talent, and ecosystem power. Google and Facebook have made headlines for paying AI engineers professional baseball-level salaries as trillions of dollars in infrastructure spending justify paying nearly any amount for top talent. 2) Unit economics are improving. Token costs, inference optimization, and model efficiency keep getting better. The more people use AI, the better it should get. (Itâs worth pointing out that Chinaâs token costs are substantially lower than the American AI giantsâ cost right now.) 3) Companies are using AI. Many CIOs are rolling AI into concrete workflows where ROI is measurable. AI isnât just for kids cheating on homework. Paying fewer employees means increased profits. 4) Policy tailwinds. It could certainly be argued that while many governments around the world are pro-AI, the Trump government in particular seems willing to give the big tech CEOs more or less whatever they want at this point. They also want semiconductor supply onshore, resilient electricity grids, and data security. Scanlon has written extensively about how the AI-powered stock market is absolutely essential to confidence in the government. This has created a mutually-reinforcing cycle for the industry. 5) Not all investment multiples are crazy. There are profitable, cash rich companies tied to AI trading at premiums, sure, but not face melting ones relative to their recent growth. That is different from 1999. The dot-com companies had very little profits and borrowed a ton of money. Google, Microsoft, Meta, et. al are cash-rich companies that can soak up a lot of losses due to their gobbling of the entire advertising world over the last couple of decades. New technologies tend to follow S curves as they diffuse into the real world. Slow early adoption. A sharp middle spike once the tech is proven. Then a long flattening as the efficiencies are gradually found implemented. Investors tend to project the steep middle forever. That is where bubbles live. Scanlonâs read is that we are in the middle of that S curve emotionally, while physically we are still building the plumbing. Power, compute, and data center capacity have to catch up to the hype. I honestly am not sure that they ever will! There are increasing stories about big chip data centres sitting dark because utilities canât book up the electrical grid to them. With electricity prices going through the roof in some areas, there will be considerable political pressure to address the issue. When you consider the Chinese competitive advantage here, the situation gets even more muddled. That is consistent with Damodaranâs reminder that growth, margins, and reinvestment are linked. If you want to grow faster, you have to feed the beast. That usually dents margins until scale efficiency shows up. No matter what else one believes about the AI bubble, one staggering truth is that there has never been a company like Nvidia. The combination of incredibly-quick risking revenues combined with a massive profit margin (although slowly shrinking as others catch up) makes this company an absolute juggernaut. However – at some point, the price becomes too high – even for a juggernaut. Nvidia is different from the companies like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic, in that they donât have to invent uses for AI or make AI better in order to make money. They are the proverbial picks and shovels sellers to the AI gold rush. Obviously the more gold that is âfound in them there hillsâ the more picks and shovels will be needed. But for now, as long as the biggest companies in the world (American tech companies) continue to buy Nvidia chips as fast as they can make them, the company can basically print money. And theyâre printing A LOT of money! Nvidia just released results from another monster quarter. (Unlike OpenAI Nvidia is a publicly-traded company, so they have to release their financials every 3 months.) Revenue came in at about $57.0B vs $54.9B expected, with EPS beating predictions as well. Management said cloud GPUs are effectively sold out. So, how can a company that is making like $30 billion in annual profits (and quickly growing) be in a bubble?! This isnât exactly Pets.com weâre talking about here! Letâs quickly look at two realities to determine if the Nvidia AI bubble story has legs: Multiples: Nvidiaâs trailing P/E sits around 53 today. That headline number is going to swing a lot this year because both the numerator (price) and the denominator (earnings) are moving fast. Even if you prefer forward P/E (around 28x), the key is not the exact digit. Itâs the path of earnings that has to keep compounding at an extraordinary clip for this valuation to make sense. That is possible when you are the toll road for a once-in-a-generation buildout. It is also how bubbles form when expectations outrun physics or budgets. Scale: Nvidiaâs market cap has been hovering in the multi-trillion range in late 2025, briefly topping $5 trillion. Thatâs an impossibly-large number to wrap your heads around. For context, the entire Canadian stock market is worth about $3.6 trillion. That includes all of the Canadian Dividend Kings (think about all the pipelines, all the railways tracks, all the banks, etc)! Nvidiaâs market cap is bigger than Germany and Australiaâs combined! Thatâs just wild to think about. Thatâs a huge price to pay – even for a company that is printing money! Back to the fundamentals. A few details from the latest update matter for valuation: So is Nvidia ultimately in a bubble? Nvidiaâs earnings justify a premium so long as AI capex keeps compounding and Nvidia is able to maintain their massive cutting edge advantage. The moment the buildout slows or other companies begin to eat away at Nvidiaâs market share, the multiple will compress first and the narrative will follow. That is how every hot-growth cycle cools off. I definitely like the short- and medium-term math behind Nvidia more than I do the newer AI companies. The huge companies in the US such as Meta and Google have committed to buying massive amounts of chips in the next few years. I donât see any reason why that wonât happen. Beyond that thoughâ¦ the stock is currently priced for the incredible growth story to continue for many years. Thatâs a super-tall order. Letâs say Nvidia maybe isnât a bubble compared to some of the other froth out thereâ¦ but itâs definitely not underpriced! For many many companies, weâd use publicly-available information to determine if they were in a bubble. But without sales and profit numbers, itâs impossible to âsee under the hoodâ and know what anyone is paying for equity in a company – let alone if thatâs a good deal. OpenAI isnât a publicly traded company, so they donât have to release their latest numbers anywhere. Just to clarify, that means if you login into your online brokerage account, you wonât be able to find an OpenAI ticker anywhere. Thereâs also no real-time way to determine the value of a company like there is when you have a handy stock ticker moving up and down. That said, there are a few clues we can use to give us some big picture answers. Private-market marks have moved wildly in 2025. Reuters reported in July that OpenAI was exploring a primary raise at roughly a $300 billion valuation, off the back of enterprise growth and rising ChatGPT revenue. A few months later, Bloomberg and the Financial Times both wrote that a secondary sale cleared at an even higher ~$500 billion headline valuation, which tells you how frothy late-stage demand has been this year. Treat these as guideposts, not gospel. Different deal structures, preferences, and timing can put two very different price tags on the same company. Many market watchers believe that if OpenAI went public today, it would have a valuation of close to $1 trillion (all numbers USD). As the hilarious show Silicon Valley taught us years ago in this NSFW clip, tech companies donât want to show a profit. If they show a profit, then guys like me put a P/E ratio on it (like I did with Palantir at the start of this article) and say itâs in a bubble. But as long as you never make money, then you can cash in on the dream of endless potential! It will likely be a very very long time before OpenAI makes a profit – and yet somehow itâs worth between $500 billion and a trillion dollars?! Reuters reported that OpenAI had revenues of âmore than $10 billionâ in mid-2025 and said management was targeting roughly $12.7 billion for full-year 2025. Thatâs a massive jump from late-2024 snapshots. Recently the company has claimed that it is running ahead of those numbers. That said, when asked directly about revenues and massive losses for the next few years, CEO Sam Altman walked off of Brad Gerstnerâs âEnoughâ podcast. Not a great look. The Wall Street Journal has been blunt about the math: even with revenue compounding, capital spending and compute costs are dramatically outpacing sales. Training and buying new GPU models is a furnace that eats cash and electricity (and will in perpetuity from what we can see). That makes sustainable gross margins and capacity planning the whole ball game.The Financial Times added another cold-water stat this fall â profitability for OpenAI isnât expected until around 2029. So is OpenAI in a bubble? The honest answer is that you canât buy it directly so itâs impossible to know for sure. Instead weâre stuck looking in Microsoftâs quarterly reports for clues (as they own a large chunk of OpenAI). What we can say is that OpenAI isnât making any money this year. Or next year. Or maybe for the next 10 years. But for that potential to make a lot of money one day in the future, private investors are willing to pay $500 billion today. Sounds like a probable-bubble to me, but what do I know? Scanlon has pointed out that OpenAI can be world-changing and over-valued at the same time. The credible path out of âbubbleâ territory is kind of a boring grey area. It would go something along the lines of more enterprise sales, a more clear gap between ChatGPT and other LLMs, model cadence that doesnât blow up serving costs, and a clear plan to control electricity and chip costs. âThis time is differentâ – famous last words when discussing the stock market. AI is a general purpose technology. It will help many companies increase their profits. That means that it is a valuable new invention – but it doesnât guarantee that specific companies will generate profits from it. Airplanes were an incredible invention that greatly improved productivity around the world. Yet very few airlines have ever managed sustainable profits. Itâs worth noting here that Nvidia is worth about 4.5x what the entire aviation industry is worth (if we assume that the IATAâs estimate is correct – with Delta airlines being the biggest in the world at about $40 billion, compared to Nvidiaâs $4 trillion+ valuation). Electricity, railways, telecommunications, the internet – all major game changers that allowed companies to make more money. All of them generated investment bubbles. These are practical signals, not trading calls. 1) Watch OpenAI closely. Any sign of shakiness there is going to be somewhat hidden – but when uncovered, itâs going to rapidly affect that entire circular diagram we mentioned earlier. 2) If China proves to be better at AI – or even just competitive in certain areas of AI – then these American companies arenât worth nearly what theyâre priced at. If China competes at something, prices go down. Period.3) Do we have enough electricity for these data centres? Letâs see how politicians respond. 4) Watch the boring regular companies. If Coke or Barrick or Enbridge start to scale back on AI spending because theyâve already squeezed all the juice they can out of it – then those falling sales numbers will quickly filter up the AI food chain. Look, if I knew how big the AI bubble was (and could somehow quantify exactly the appropriate price for these companies) AND when the bubble would pop – then we could all be multi-millionaires together. We could buy options and make a sequel to The Big Short. (I think Channing Tatum would be the obvious choice to play yours truly.) The truth is that we donât really yet know what this technology will eventually look like – let alone which companies will get the thickest profit margins from it. What we do know is that the current prices of the stocks indicate people believe an absolute best case scenario is about to occur. I think itâs fair to say rebalancing your portfolio, or deciding to take some risk off the table is likely a good move at the moment. Low risk investments such as high interest savings accounts or GICs can appropriately balance risk alongside appropriate levels of risk taking in the stock market. You can check out our EQ Bank review for more details on where I am currently getting the best interest rates. That said – is it possible that the Nasdaq could go up another 20% before it sees a correction? Sure. Iâd say itâs more likely weâll see it 30% off the highs than up 20% from the highs, but one has to be aware that in the short-term, the stock market is more âanimal spiritsâ driven than it is a sober price marking machine. Long-term, I have more confidence that all possible information will get priced in, and valuations will likely come back down to Earth. No. Take a look at our list of the Best ETFs in Canada. Forget niche themed ETFs. If you have to ask, it is probably too much. My rule of thumb is that a single stock should not be the reason your retirement plan fails. Size accordingly. If youâre an index investor, Nvidia and other AI stocks are likely already a massive part of your portfolio. If you are optimizing, US listed ETFs in the RRSP avoid US withholding tax on dividends. Most of these companies donât pay a lot of dividends anyway, so itâs not a huge deal. Not directly. If you own broad US indexes, you already have some exposure via Microsoft. I wish I had a better answer, but the undeniable truth is that timing is hard. As far as I can tell, we are almost certainly in a mild to moderate AI stock bubble – and itâs occurring alongside a very real productivity wave. Both predictions/observations can be true. Letâs anchor this statement to two old-school yardsticks. First, the Shiller CAPE. As of early fall 2025, several trackers put the U.S. CAPE north of 40, which is rarified air and well above the long-run average (which is high teens). Weâre not at the dot-comâs peak of ~44, but we’re in the same neighbourhood. That tells you prices already assume weâre going to see mega profits (and sooner rather later). Second, the Buffett Indicator (defined by the total market cap of the companies in the USA divided by GDP). The idea is that the total worth of all the companies should be somewhat tied to the size and growth of the broader economy. Makes sense to me! The long-term average for the Buffett Indicator is 80-100%. Right now the market is priced at 220%. Itâs probably no coincidence that Buffettâs current investment portfolio includes a massive lump of cash. Obviously thereâs more room to go down than up judging by these metrics. Now to the question Scott Galloway keeps raising: What happens to the whole market if everyone gets fired? The short version is that cost cuts can boost margins for a while, but you cannot fire your way to durable growth. For valuations to make sense, you need both margin gains and real revenue growth. Company-level layoffs also ricochet through the economy by lowering aggregate demand, which in turn pressures the same revenue lines investors are modeling up and to the right. Gallowayâs broader point on AI exuberance is that narratives are running ahead of unit economics, and that the last leg of a mania often leans on imagined efficiencies that cannot scale across every firm at once. Could the AI bubble inflate further? Absolutely. As Keynes used to say, âThe market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.â That fundamental truth makes it very difficult to predict how big the bubble can get and deciding when it will pop. While guys like Michael Burry are out there making short bets against stocks, I donât recommend anyone try it at home. Could the entire AI industry also slowly deflate into a long, sideways grind while earnings catch up over the next two decades? That boring outcome happens more often than headlines would have you believe (just ask Cisco). If you came here for a bold call, I apologize. I am not ready to put my flag in the ground on the exact month an AI bubble will peak. What I can say with conviction is that great technologies and bubbly valuations often travel together. The technology can win while many excited investors lose. The way to avoid being on the wrong side of that sentence is to own enough of the winners through low cost index investing, limit your concentrated bets, and keep adding money even when the headlines are dramatic. As The Plain Bagel likes to remind us, markets eventually weigh cash flows, not adjectives. As Damodaran would insist, you still have to tie the story to profit numbers at some point. If AI does half of what its boosters promise, productivity will rise, costs will fall, and your diversified portfolio will benefit. But if it ONLY does half of what it promises, then the AI bubble is going to mean tech stock prices come down (whether itâs slowly or all at once). At the moment the best AI in the world canât draw a clockâ¦ so Iâm keeping my expectations in check. Sign up below to get a copy of our free eBook: Can I Retire Yet? Thanks for subscribing!

November 20, 2025 02:00 ET | Source: PayPoint plc PayPoint plc PayPoint PlcResults for the half year ended 30 September 2025 Resilient half year performance with good progress on delivery of key growth projects GROUP FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Nick Wiles, Chief Executive of PayPoint Plc, said: “We have continued to build on an encouraging start to the year and in the first half we have reached important milestones in the delivery of major projects key to our long-term growth plans. Against the background of a generally weak economy and some specific business challenges, we remain confident in delivering further progress in the current year. “We expect underlying EBITDA for FY26 to be ahead of last year and broadly in line with current market expectations. While we continue to make progress towards delivering underlying EBITDA of £100 million in the current financial year – which remains a key financial objective the business is confident of reaching – it is likely we will take longer to do so. As the current year has progressed, we have faced two challenges: firstly, the impact from the disruption to our parcels network from the harmonisation of InPost and Yodel services combined with the commercial terms of our new 3-year contract has been greater than we had anticipated, and secondly, while obconnect continues to build its new business pipeline and range of opportunities, the pace of growth and monetising of these opportunities in year is slower than we had planned. In the first half, the underlying business performance has continued to trade in line with expectations and, throughout the Group, we have continued to broaden the adoption of our enhanced capabilities into our existing client base, develop and execute on strong new business pipelines and accelerate the execution of our key strategic projects. In Local Banking, we successfully launched our BankLocal service in August 2025 for the Lloyds Banking Group, enabling consumer cash deposits via their banking app across our extensive network of over 30,000 locations. In September 2025, we extended the service to enable deposits via card for their customers in 3,000 sites, and we are now working to enable further High St Banks for the service over the next 12 months. In Parcels, we announced the strategic investment by Royal Mail into the Collect+ business in September 2025, with over 3,000 sites now branded as Royal Mail Shop enabling customers to buy postage in store as well as collect, send and return parcels. In both these projects the key to the ramp up of significant transaction volumes is a strong follow-on communications and marketing campaign to support consumer awareness and adoption of these services through our network. In Open Banking and Digital payments, we have secured further wins as we grow our strong market position in the Housing sector particularly, including Peabody Housing for the full suite of MultiPay payment solutions and the Department for Work and Pensions and other government departments for Confirmation of Payee. In addition, we are delivering several open banking initiatives into our utilities client base while working closely with obconnect in identifying new sector opportunities for open banking. In Love2shop, our partnership with InComm Payments has continued to accelerate, with further expansion into major retailers and a material step up in billings ahead of peak. Consumer uncertainty and tightening household budgets are not new factors as we enter the peak trading period for several of our businesses. For the second half of the year, our focus remains on 1) tight cost discipline and driving efficiencies as we continue to work with Nile Partners to establish the right organisational framework for the future, 2) strong execution of the projects supporting our long-term growth plans, and 3) good operating disciplines across the business as a whole and agility to respond to the two specific business challenges and the broader changing market conditions. Our continued confidence in the growth opportunities in the business and making further progress in our long-term objectives has provided the platform for the Board to further enhance shareholder returns in the current year, with the business on course to generate returns to shareholders of over £90 million through a combination of our ordinary dividend, continuing share buyback programme and special dividend. The Board remain confident in delivering further progress in the current year” DIVISIONAL HIGHLIGHTS Shopping divisional net revenue increased by 0.6% to £33.1 million (H1 FY25: £32.9 million) E-commerce divisional net revenue increased by 7.5% to £8.6 million (H1 FY25: £8.0 million) Payments & Banking divisional net revenue increased by 4.4% to £26.0 million (H1 FY25: £24.9 million) Love2shop divisional net revenue decreased by 9.6% to £17.0 million (H1 FY25: £18.8 million) MANAGING SPECIFIC BUSINESS CHALLENGES As the current year has progressed, we have faced two specific business challenges: 1. Impact of renewed 3-year commercial contract and InPost/Yodel network harmonisation Following the acquisition of Yodel by InPost, a new 3-year commercial contract was negotiated and agreed for the combined business. This contract recognised the continued importance of the long-term partnership between InPost and PayPoint, including a commitment to a minimum level of volume through the Collect+ network and an expansion of the number of sites offered to InPost customers to reflect the existing Yodel network, albeit on less favourable commercial terms to PayPoint. Our expectation has been that the enlarged Collect+ network for InPost / Yodel customers would result in increased volumes to mitigate these less favourable commercial terms. In the second quarter this has not been the case, with the initiatives from InPost to harmonise the enlarged InPost/Yodel business resulting in significant disruption to service and parcel volumes across the Collect + network. We believe the immediate impact of this operational disruption has now reduced, largely managed through proactive actions from the two businesses and we expect to see volumes through the Collect + network recover as we move into the traditional peak trading period. 2. New business pipeline growth in obconnectIn obconnect, the first half has seen a consolidation in the business and reassessment of the new business opportunities following PayPoint taking a majority ownership of the business. For PayPoint, obconnect delivers the platform to drive growth for both new and existing clients through the provision of Open Banking services and payments channels. In obconnect, the focus is on providing the necessary support and expertise to deliver data sharing ecosystems for major banks and jurisdictions, as well as broader Open Banking solutions. We have retained and strengthened relationships with all existing clients (except for one US bank who exited the UK market) as well as adding 6 new client services in H1 FY26. The business has a small number of clients now live with Verification of Payee (VoP) in SEPA. However, the overall opportunity from VoP has been disappointing, and as a result the business has refocused on other growth areas as it builds its new business pipeline and opportunities for H2 FY26 and into next year. Our confidence in the opportunities obconnect brings from its range of capabilities and technology is undiminished. Promising discussions are underway with other jurisdictions and some large international banks for secure data-sharing ecosystems, replicating the success of Get Verified for the New Zealand Banking Association which has now been in operation for a year. The market for Account-to-Account (A2A) payments and account information across Europe, UK and USA remains strong and obconnect is well positioned to help organisations achieve connectivity to these ecosystems. A UK CoP rule variation championed by PayPoint was also agreed by Pay.UK and the scheme participants in September 2025. This expands CoP access to many more organisations, creating new opportunities for PayPoint and obconnect. Following a maiden contribution in the first half, we expect obconnect to deliver a stronger performance in the second half and an improvement in net revenue achieved for H2 FY25. DELIVERY OF KEY GROWTH PROJECTS The standout achievement of the first half has been the successful launch of multiple projects that enhance our consumer proposition in several areas of our business, establish important partnerships and strengthen the long-term prospects of the business. Each of these projects has required detailed planning and collaboration with our partners and a business wide effort to deliver. In each case the focus is now shifting from rollout to the necessary marketing and consumer awareness campaigns to drive awareness and adoption. 1. Launch of PayPoint BankLocal with the Lloyds Banking Group On 26 August 2025, we launched our BankLocal service enabling consumer cash deposits via app for customers of Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland across our extensive network of over 30,000 locations. This successful launch was supported by a business-wide effort to prepare and train our retailer partners to deliver this vital new service, with over 240,000 direct communications delivered, over 4,000 store visits completed and a Trustpilot score of 4.9/5 achieved from retailer feedback. The service has been adopted rapidly by customers, with over £10m of deposits processed7 since launch and further proactive consumer marketing activity underway by Lloyds to drive awareness of the service. On 30 September 2025, we enhanced this service further with over 3,000 sites launched for consumer cash deposits via card, particularly targeted at customers who are not digitally enabled. With over 40% of transactions taking place before 9am and after 5pm, and c.25% of transactions happening at weekends, this service has reinforced the vital role that our leading retail network plays in providing a vast range of essential services at the heart of communities across the UK, for everything from banking, utility, parcel, cash and government services. 2. Launch of Royal Mail Shop and strategic investment in Collect+ by Royal Mail As announced on 30 September 2025, International Distribution Services (IDS), owner of Royal Mail, completed a strategic investment in Collect+ to take a 49% ownership, with an investment of £43.9 million, valuing the Collect+ business at £90 million. The Collect+ business has seen strong growth over the past 5 years as we have established it as the leading open Out of Home (OOH) store network in the UK. Currently, Collect+ has a network of over 14,000 OOH locations in the UK, of which almost 8,000 offer Royal Mail collect, send and return parcel services today. As part of the next stage in this partnership, over 3,000 of these sites have now been upgraded with Royal Mail Shop branding, of which 2,200 have the ability to deliver Royal Mail over the counter services, enabling customers to buy postage in store. The balance of the 8,000 sites will have Royal Mail Shop branding rolled out over the course of the next 6 months. Over the next 12 months the intention is to expand the rollout of Royal Mail over the counter services through the network, including the launch of self-service kiosks by Q4 FY26. 7 As of close of business 16 November 2025 Establishing this partnership is important to the next stage of growth for Collect+ and its positioning as the leading OOH store network in the UK. As an open network, Collect+ will continue to work closely with the carrier partners with whom it has well-established relationships to support the increasing consumer adoption of OOH services across the UK and to invest in the technology and training required to deliver an outstanding consumer experience. 3. Acceleration of Love2shop partnership with InComm PaymentsFollowing the launch of our partnership with InComm Payments in October 2024, we have established a strong new sales channel enabling distribution of physical Love2shop gift cards into major grocers and High St brands. The partnership has delivered a strong half year performance, with sales of Love2shop physical gift card billings growing in consecutive half year periods by +43.5%. We have also delivered further progress developing our retailer channels for Love2shop gift cards, which has included an expansion to 800+ Sainsbury’s Local convenience stores and a recent expansion to The Range ahead of the key peak trading period. New Love2shop gift cards are also now being rolled out to further PayPoint retailer network locations, with sales in this channel +54% year on year, leveraging the strength of the Love2shop brand and reinforcing our expanded multichannel strategy for Love2shop gift card sales across digital and physical channels Opportunities for growth in these sales channels will be further enhanced with the launch of the Love2shop digital Mastercard in early 2026 which will enable spend in store, via digital wallet and online, initially as a B2C single load product ahead of B2B and multi-load enabled later in 2026.

Against the background of a generally weak economy and some specific business challenges we remain confident in delivering further progress in the current year. “We expect underlying EBITDA for FY26 to be ahead of last year and broadly in line with current market expectations. While we continue to make progress towards delivering underlying EBITDA of £100 million in the current financial year – which remains a key financial objective the business is confident of reaching – it is likely we will take longer to do so.

Our longer-term growth targets to the end of FY28 As announced at our full year results in June 2025, we have now established new targets for the Group for the next three years to the end of FY28, reflecting our confidence in the growth prospects of the business and our continued commitment to delivering enhanced returns for our shareholders: 1. Achieving net revenue growth in the range of 5% to 8% per annum across the Group Our strategy over the past five years to transform the business and its capabilities from our legacy cash bill payments history has created a more robust and higher organic growth platform. We believe a combination of our business mix today and the opportunities in each of our key building blocks for growth supports a consistent, underlying net revenue growth rate in the range of 5-8% per annum in the medium term. 2. Establishing an organisational framework which will deliver greater automation of processes and greater agility to support the delivery of our planAn important next step to support the delivery of this growth is to ensure as a business we have the necessary organisational framework to deliver better operational performance at a reduced cost and a higher level of customer service and experience. To achieve this, we have sought the support of Nile, an independent consultancy, in a project to review our operational structure and business processes today and develop a plan to deliver greater automation and business agility in the future to support the delivery of our plan. 3. Delivering a reduction of at least 20% of our issued share capital, with scope for leverage in the range of 1.2x to 1.5x The actions we are taking to deliver sustained organic growth across the business in a more efficient and agile business structure will further enhance the core cash generative characteristics of the business, enabling an accelerated share buyback programme over the next three years within a prudent capital structure of leverage in the range of 1.2x to 1.5x REVIEW BY DIVISION SHOPPING DIVISION In Retail Services, it has been an intensive period where we have focused our efforts on supporting our retailer partners to deliver more revenue from PayPoint services and a business-wide effort to prepare and train sites ahead of the major launches of BankLocal and Royal Mail Shops. Our new Store Growth Specialist team, launched at the beginning of the financial year, has continued to have a positive impact with retailers, driven by targeted data and support. The learnings from the success of this team are now being assessed, with a view to scaling best practice across our entire field team. Key focus areas in the half year have been merchandising new Love2shop physical gift card units in over 2,000 sites ahead of the key peak trading period and completing an extensive training and merchandising programme for our BankLocal and Royal Mail Shop rollouts. Over 4,000 site visits have been completed in total, with positive retailer partner feedback and successful launches delivered for both services. In our FMCG consumer engagement proposition, PayPoint Engage, 16 campaigns have been delivered for major consumer brands, leveraging our PayPoint One platform, advertising screens and vouchering capability. In ATMs, there are some early signs of progress from the actions already taken in the business with the estate performance now aligned with LINK industry transaction data. In addition to the recovery plan already implemented at the beginning of the year, we have completed a thorough strategic review of this business, with plans underway to optimise sites across the network driven by data and supported by our enhanced maintenance and support partnership with NoteMachine. In Cards, we continue to strengthen the operating foundation to the business with a greater focus on optimising profitability per merchant: a continued strong performance in Telesales, a reset of our Field sales approach and head count, further processes to support early life merchant experience and churn management, further proposition enhancements for merchants, supported by the improvements to pricing governance, time to transact and customer onboarding delivered in the last financial year. Proposition enhancements for merchants include an updated terminal application enabling split bill and digital receipt functionality, real-time transaction data now live in our merchant mobile app and app registrations in total on course to exceed our target of 10,000 merchants by the end of FY26. We now have 6 integrations and partnerships live for merchants to access our services. In October 2025, we launched our new e-comm product, in partnership with Global Payments, including Pay By Link functionality in the app and integration with major shopping carts. Over H2, there is an active roadmap of future proposition enhancements which will be delivered, including Tap to Pay in app, 7-day settlement and the launch of a ‘Pay Once’ proposition. We have also delivered a positive performance for Business Finance via YouLend, with over £14.6 million of funding provided to businesses, up 58% year on year. In Local Banking, we successfully launched our BankLocal service for the Lloyds Banking Group on 26 August 2025, enabling consumer cash deposits via app for customers of Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland across our extensive network of over 30,000 locations. The service has been adopted rapidly by customers, with over £10m of deposits processed since launch and further proactive consumer marketing activity underway by Lloyds to drive awareness of the service. On 30 September 2025, we enhanced this service with over 3,000 sites launched for consumer cash deposits via card, particularly targeted at customers who are not digitally enabled. With over 40% of transactions taking place before 9am and after 5pm, and c.25% of transactions happening at weekends, this service has successfully built on our existing neobank deposit service and has reinforced the vital role that our leading retail network plays in providing a vast range of essential services at the heart of communities across the UK, for everything from banking, utility, parcel, cash and government services. Looking ahead to H2, a second major bank is now going live later than planned in Q4 FY26 and we have plans in progress to enable more High St banks for the service over the course of the next 6 months, as well as enabling a more extensive use of our Counter Cash withdrawal service. In addition, we are well underway with plans to develop and launch an SME solution for cash deposits in 2026. Across the whole division, data analytics is now central to how we operate, make decisions, and deliver value to customers and partners. Analytics have been embedded into decision-making for external clients and retail partners, combining multiple sources like regional performance, demographic insights, and usage patterns. This unified view is a major step forward, and there is the opportunity to refine these models further, expand data sources, and improve predictive accuracy in the future. Our algorithms now recommend tailored product mixes for retailers and identify promotions that drive sales and partner returns, with our investment in AI and machine learning opening the door to further development of predictive analytics, enabling teams to act on insights quickly and effectively. The work ahead in this area will unlock even greater visibility, efficiency, and value for our customers, partners and the business as a whole. E-COMMERCE DIVISION In E-commerce, there continues to be strong momentum for Collect+, with net revenue +7.5% at £8.6 million and parcel transactions growing to 74.3 million. Collect+ is well-established as the leading Out of Home (OOH) store network in the UK and, as an open network, we will continue to work closely with our carrier partners to support the increasing consumer adoption of OOH services across the UK. In the half year, we have successfully grown the Collect+ network to 14,274 sites in new locations and demographics, including a new partnership with Gridserve, the leading EV charging network. As announced on 30 September 2025, Royal Mail has now taken a strategic investment in Collect+. Over 3,000 sites have now been upgraded with Royal Mail Shop branding, of which 2,200 have the ability to deliver Royal Mail over the counter services, enabling customers to buy postage in store as well as collecting, sending and returning parcels. This will form part of over 8,000 sites that will feature Royal Mail Shop branding over the next 6 months. In addition, we have now launched the sale of stamps across the 8,000 sites, including a retail exclusive set of 4 Christmas Stamps available at Royal Mail Shops. Over the next 12 months, the intention is to expand the rollout of Royal Mail over the counter services through the network, including the launch of self-service kiosks during Q1 2026. This partnership is important to the next stage of growth for Collect+ and its positioning as the leading OOH store network in the UK, again enhancing our retailer and consumer propositions delivering vital services at the heart of communities across the UK. In the half, we have also signed a new 3-year commercial agreement with InPost and Yodel, including the potential to utilise up to 6,000 Pick Up Drop Off (PUDO) locations within Collect+ network. We had underappreciated the disruptive impact of the InPost/Yodel harmonisation and subsequent logistical challenges in our parcels business but took proactive operational actions to mitigate impact this disruption, including establishing priority routing and collections for high volume stores, dedicated PUDO-only routes and regular communications with affected stores. We expect these actions have now addressed the operational issues in the network, resulting in volumes recovering as we enter the peak trading period. PAYMENTS & BANKING DIVISION In Payments & Banking, our integrated digital payments platform, MultiPay, continues to establish itself as a comprehensive payment solution for clients across card processing, Open Banking, direct debit and cash, with net revenue growth of 17.2% year on year. We have secured further strong wins in the Housing sector, with Peabody, RHP, Orwell Housing Association and Gloucester City Homes, and in the Charity sector with Thames Hospice and Firefighter’s Charity. There continues to be a focus on increasing opportunities to cross-sell payments services within our existing client base, leveraging our wider multichannel payments platform and Open Banking capabilities. Our Open Banking solutions are unlocking further pipeline opportunities, supporting major clients with cheque replacement solutions via our PayPoint OpenPay service and our new Suspense Manager solution, tackling the issue of unallocated customer payments. In Open Banking, we have made further progress in executing on our strategy. In PayPoint, we are focused on winning business with both new and existing clients delivering Open Banking services and payments channels, all enabled by obconnect and Aperidata, with 70 clients now live for our services, including the Department for Work and Pensions and other government departments, and AccessPay for Confirmation of Payee and Thirteen Group live for PISP. In obconnect, we have retained and strengthened relationships with all existing clients (except for one US bank who exited the UK market) as well as adding 6 new client services in H1 FY26. The business has a small number of clients now live with VoP in SEPA. However, the overall opportunity from VoP has been disappointing, and as a result the business has refocused on other growth areas as it builds its new business pipeline and opportunities for H2 FY25 and into next year. Promising discussions are underway with other jurisdictions and some large international banks for secure data-sharing ecosystems, replicating the success of Get Verified for the New Zealand Banking Association which has now been in operation for a year. A UK CoP rule variation championed by PayPoint was agreed by Pay.UK and the scheme participants in September 2025. This expands CoP access to many more organisations, creating new opportunities for both PayPoint and obconnect. In our cash through to digital category, we have now rolled out new display units to a further 2,000 sites, combining our leading portfolio of consumer brands, including Amazon, Netflix, Deliveroo and Uber, with physical Love2shop gift cards in store. This creates a strong consumer proposition, offering the choice of specific cash through to digital brands and our Love2shop multi-retailer redemption card, which is expected to generate meaningful additional card load and revenue opportunities for retailer partners. We intend to expand further the number of stores offering Love2shop physical gift cards and our digital Pin on Receipt brands over the course of H2. The strength of this proposition is evidenced by the sales momentum built with Love2shop gift cards in over 2,600 multiple retailers in the PayPoint network, with sales +54% year on year, and the continuing success of our partnership with InComm Payments offering Love2shop gift cards into a range of major retailers. In addition, our existing neobank cash deposit service processed over £342 million of deposits in the half, complementing our new BankLocal service for High St banks. In Cash, legacy energy bill payments net revenue decreased by 17.7% for the half year consistent with our expectations, with this part of the business continuing to be resilient. Over the half year, the energy price cap, updated by Ofgem on a quarterly basis, was set for pre-pay customers at £1,803 for April to June 2025 and £1,672 for July to September 2025. However, the price cap has been confirmed in the current quarter at £1,707 for pre-pay customers for October to December 2025. LOVE2SHOP DIVISION Overall, Love2shop continues to trade in line with expectations for the current year, with net revenue in H1 affected by the changes to the timing of revenue recognition for expiry of cards following the adoption of a more prudent accounting treatment in FY24. Under the previous policy ‘end of life’ revenue was recognised progressively over the life of the card. Proactive management of this accounting change ahead of the current financial year will result in a stronger H2 performance as the expiry dates of cards issued in prior periods are weighted towards the second half of the current year. While this change results in the deferral of revenue to the expiry date, it has no material impact on the total revenue expected over the life of the cards. Overall, the Love2shop division has had a solid half year, delivering growth in Love2shop Business, a resilient performance in Park Christmas Savings and strong progress in our partnership with InComm Payments. In Love2shop Business, we have delivered a positive performance, with billings +5.8% at £70.9 million (H1 FY25: £67.0 m), driven by a strong performance within Major Accounts and Platform sales. We are also leveraging AI across the business to better drive and target marketing engagement and new campaigns, with positive early results contributing to new business pipelines. Highstreetvouchers.com continues to trade in line with expectations. We have delivered a strong half year from our InComm Payments partnership, with sales of Love2shop physical gift card billings growing in consecutive half year periods by +43.5% since launch in October 2024. We have also made further progress developing our retailer channels for Love2shop gift cards, which has included an expansion to 800+ Sainsbury’s Local convenience stores and a recent expansion to The Range ahead of the key peak trading period. New Love2shop gift cards are also now being rolled out to further PayPoint retailer network locations, supported by our new Store Growth Specialist team, with sales in this channel +54% year on year. Opportunities for growth in these sales channels will be further enhanced with the launch of the Love2Shop digital Mastercard in early 2026 which will enable spend in store, via digital wallet and online, initially as a B2C single load product ahead of B2B and multi-load enabled later in 2026. Park Christmas Savings billings are expected to be broadly flat year on year for the Christmas 2025 season, against the backdrop of tighter consumer spending and fluctuating consumer confidence over the year. This has been supported by a strengthened Agent proposition, including the launch of Agent Perks and a new Agent App with over 13,000 downloads, an improved average order value for returning direct savers, and the launch of a more premium fulfilment experience and packaging for customers receiving orders for Christmas 2025. This again reinforces the enduring appeal and vital role this service plays in helping consumers budget for big occasions and avoid debt, with a Trustpilot rating of 4.6/5 and over £2 million of value delivered to savers each year. MBL, the leading gift card technology platform, processed £81.2 million in gift card value in in the half year (H1 FY25: £40.9 million), reflecting continued strong momentum as a gift card service provider for Greggs, B&M, New Look, Tapi, and schuh, and as a key distributor for over 150 UK retailers' gift cards DETAIL ON THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE IDS TRANSACTION The net proceeds of £34.1m on the £43.9m IDS investment in Collect+ is after deducting associated costs of £0.4m and £9.4m of tax from the gain on disposal. These proceeds were distributed in the form of a special dividend of 50 pence per share for c. 69 million eligible shares on 31 October 2025, with a resulting payment of £34.5m. Alongside this, the 12 for 13 share consolidation on 17 October 2025 reduced the issued share capital by c. 5.3 million shares to c. 63.7 million shares in issue as of this date. This investment entitles IDS to a 49% minority share of the profits of Collect+ Brand Limited, which as part of the transaction now includes all revenues and associated costs from the wider E-commerce division, with the previous holding company (Collect+ Holdings Limited) prepared for dissolution. The Board anticipates the transaction as a whole to be EPS enhancing in the first full year to March 2027 through a combination of the special dividend, share consolidation and expected growth in volumes from the Royal Mail services through the Collect+ network. EPS enhancement assumptions include investment costs associated with the branding of the 8,000 Royal Mail sites, technology to support over the counter services, plus the launch of self-service kiosks during Q1 2026. UPDATE ON ORGANISATIONAL FRAMEWORK PROGRAMME As announced in our full year results in June 2025, an important step to the delivery of growth is to ensure as a business we have the necessary organisational framework to deliver better operational performance at a reduced cost and a higher level of customer service and experience. To achieve this, the Group has recently completed the second phase of a project being supported by Nile, an independent consultancy firm. The key outputs from this phase have been the establishment of a target state framework for three key processes: onboarding, customer support, and billings and settlement. For each of these, key outcomes from moving to the target future state have been established. For example, in the case of onboarding, substantially reducing time taken to onboard new customers. In addition, for each process, this phase has quantified the benefits from moving to this future state, including both financial benefits (increased revenue, lower costs, lower operational risk events) and non-financial benefits (e.g. improved customer service/ satisfaction levels). Preliminary estimates have highlighted at least £2 million of operating profit upside, through a combination of reduced costs and improved net revenue, with the potential to grow this figure further through the next phase of work, which will include identifying technical solutions and external providers to support the shift to the future target state, along with the costs associated with this transition. This work is expected to be completed in advance of our full year results announcement in June 2026, with implementation commencing in early FY27. UPDATE ON CLAIMS AGAINST PAYPOINT In FY24, a number of companies in the PayPoint Group, including PayPoint Plc, received a claim from Global-365 plc and Global Prepaid Solution Limited (“Global 365”) relating to issues addressed by commitments accepted by Ofgem in November 2021 as a resolution of Ofgem’s concerns raised in its Statement of Objections received by the PayPoint Group in September 2020. The Ofgem resolution did not include any infringement findings. Global 365’s claim was heard at a trial at the Competition Appeal Tribunal between 10 June and 11 July 2025. PayPoint is confident that it successfully defended the claim by Global 365 and remains of the view that Global 365’s claim fundamentally misunderstands the energy market and the relationships between the relevant PayPoint Group companies and the major energy providers, whilst also over-estimating the opportunity available, if any, for the products offered by Global 365. The parties are awaiting judgment from the Competition Appeal Tribunal. OUTLOOK AND DIVIDEND The Board remain confident in delivering further progress in the current year and achieving our medium-term financial goals. Whilst as a business we cannot determine the pace at which new services are adopted by consumers, the delivery of our key projects in the first half of the year is a great reflection of the progress we are making in the delivery of our long-term strategy. Whilst there remain challenges in the broader UK economy and in particular weak consumer confidence and tightening household budgets, we remain focused on the delivery of the key initiatives across the business that will deliver the outcome for the current year and foundations for the longer-term growth in the business. We are now into the most important seasonal trading period for several of our business areas where focused execution is key to the outcome for the current year. Our continued confidence in the growth opportunities in the business and making further progress in our longer-term objectives have provided a strong platform for the Board to further enhance shareholder returns in the current year, with the business on course to generate returns to shareholders of over £90 million through a combination of our ordinary dividend, continuing share buyback programme and special dividend. The Board has declared an interim dividend of [19.8]p per share, an increase of [2.1]% vs the prior year interim dividend of 19.4p per share, consistent with our dividend policy and target cover range of 1.5 to 2.0 times earnings excluding exceptional items. Nick WilesChief Executive 19 November 2025 FINANCIAL REVIEW Total revenue increased by £9.1 million (6.7%) to £144.1 million (September 2024: £135.0 million). Net revenue increased by £0.1 million (0.1%) to £84.7 million (September 2024: £84.6 million). The increase in Love2shop revenue was driven by single-retailer redemption products which have an associated cost of revenue and therefore a relatively small impact on net revenue. Total costs increased by £1.3 million to £59.0 million (September 2024: £57.7 million). The increase includes £1.7 million current period obconnect costs (prior period: £nil). There were also increases in cost of sales, reflecting the increase in revenue, and in finance costs, reflecting the Group’s increased borrowing. These impacts were partially offset by lower overhead costs. Exceptional costs are one-off, non-recurring and do not reflect current operational performance. The £3.2 million charge to September 2025 comprises legal fees incurred in defence of claims served against the Group and costs associated with the organisational framework to deliver greater automation and agility. The prior period exceptional cost comprised legal fees in defence of the same claims, plus the accelerated amortisation of certain modules of L2s ERP systems. The underlying profit before tax decreased by £1.2 million (4.5%) to £25.7 million (September 2024: £26.9 million). The current period result includes £1.2 million from the Love2shop segment, a decrease of £1.1 million (47.8%) on the prior period’s £2.3 million. The Love2shop decrease reflects the change in expiry date of sold vouchers. The September 2024 result benefitted from significant non-redemption revenue from expiry on vouchers in August 2024, whereas the equivalent non-redemption revenue will be earned in the second half of the current financial year. Profit before tax decreased by £3.2 million (13.9%) to £19.9 million (September 2024: £23.1 million). The decrease is mainly due to the £2.7m adjusting item in the prior period for the increase in fair value of the Group’s investments in obconnect, prior to the acquisition of obconnect in October 2024. Underlying EBITDA decreased by £0.2 million to £37.3 million (September 2024: £37.5 million), comprising £33.3 million for the PayPoint segment (September 2024: £32.0 million) and £4.0 million for the Love2shop segment (September 2024: £5.5 million). Cash generation decreased to £24.2 million (September 2024: £30.7 million), delivered from underlying profit before tax of £25.7 million (September 2024: £26.9 million). There was a net working capital outflow of £6.1 million, £4.6 million of which relates to the timing of Love2shop product purchase and despatch and will unwind in the second half of the financial year. The remaining £1.5 million is principally due to professional fee payments in the current period, related to prior period exceptional items. Net corporate debt decreased by £13.4 million to £84.0 million at September 2025 (March 2025: £97.4 million). This is as a result of positive cash generation and proceeds from the part-disposal of Collect+, partly offset by working capital requirements in the first six months along with the exceptional settlement payment, share buy-back and tax, capex and dividend requirements. At 30 September 2025 loans and borrowings were £114.1 million (September 2024: £107.2 million). PAYPOINT SEGMENT Shopping net revenue increased by £0.2 million (0.6%) to £33.1 million (September 2024: £32.9 million). Service fees net revenue increased by £0.9 million (8.4%) driven by the additional PayPoint Mini sites and the annual RPI increase. Cards net revenue decreased by £0.5 million (3.0%); a reduction in acquiring revenue was partially offset by an increase in lending revenue, with rental revenue flat. ATM and Counter Cash net revenue decreased by £0.2 million (5.0%) due to a reduction in transactions driven by the continuing trend of reduced demand for cash across the economy. E-commerce net revenue increased by £0.6 million (7.5%) to £8.6 million (September 2024: £8.0 million), driven by strong growth in transaction numbers, which increased by 20.0%. This was due to our continued strength in the clothing/fashion category and the impact of new carrier partners, partially offset by the impact of the terms of the new commercial deal with Yodel. Payments & Banking net revenue increased by £1.1 million (4.4%) to £26.0 million (September 2024: £24.9 million), including £1.9 million net revenue from obconnect, acquired by the Group in October 2024. Excluding the impact of obconnect, net revenue decreased by £0.8 million compared with the prior period. Cash bill payments and top ups revenue decreased by £1.6 million (12.7%) to £11.0 million (September 2024: £12.6 million) driven by a 15.1% reduction in transactions caused by reduced usage of cash and the continued switch to digital payments. Digital net revenue, excluding obconnect, increased by £0.6 million (9.5%) to £6.9 million (September 2024: £6.3 million). The cost of commission to retailers increased by £1.3 million (6.5%) to £21.3 million (September 2024: £20.0 million). This increase in payment to our retailer partners reflects an increase in the number of transactions processed and a higher proportion of transactions with higher commission rates. Total costs (excluding adjusting items) increased by £2.0 million (4.9%) to £43.2 million, including a £0.9 million increase in finance costs due principally to the share buy-back programme, £1.8 million obconnect costs following acquisition in October 2024, £0.5 million additional depreciation on cards devices, partially offset by a £1.2m decrease in overhead and other costs, reflecting cost saving measures implemented. SECTOR ANALYSIS SHOPPING Shopping consists of services PayPoint provides to retailer partners, which form part of PayPoint’s network, and SME partners. Services include providing the PayPoint One platform (which has a basic till application), EPoS, card payments, terminal leasing, ATMs, Counter Cash and FMCG vouchering. Net revenue increased by £0.2 million (0.6%) to £33.1 million (September 2024: £32.9 million) primarily due to the growth in service fees. The net revenue of each of our key products is separately addressed below. As at 30 September 2025, PayPoint had a live terminal in 30,962 UK sites, an increase of 2.7% primarily due to new PayPoint mini sales. Service fees: This is a core growth area and consists of service fees from PayPoint One, PayPoint Mini and our legacy terminals. Service fee net revenue increased by £0.9 million (8.4%) to £11.6 million driven by an increase in the number of revenue- generating sites compared to the prior period. Card Payments: Card payments net revenue overall decreased by 3.0% to £16.1 million (September 2024: £16.6 million). Card payments acquiring services generated £10.3 million net revenue in the six-month period, a reduction of £0.9 million from the previous year (September 2024: £11.2 million), reflecting the decrease in the number of SME and retailer partners and in the average value processed per merchant. Card payments lending and other net revenue increased by £0.4 million to £0.6 million. Transaction values overall decreased by 4.4% to £3,428 million (September 2024 £3,585 million). Card payment terminal rentals remained at £5.2 million, with a slight reduction in the number of terminals. Net revenue reduced by £0.2m (5.0%) to £3.8 million (September 2024: £4.0 million) as transactions reduced by 9.4% to 11.5 million. This reflects a continuation of the reduced demand for cash across the economy, although net revenue from Counter Cash was flat. ATM and Counter Cash live sites increased 9.3% to 7,094, reflecting the new local banking service which went live in September 2025. Other: Other shopping services, which includes FMCG voucher campaigns, remained at £1.6 million. E-COMMERCE E-commerce net revenue increased by £0.6 million (7.5%) to £8.6 million (September 2024: £8.0 million) due to the continued increase in total parcels transactions, by 20.0% to 74.3 million. This was due to our continued strength in the clothing/fashion category and the impact of new carrier partners, partially offset by the impact of the terms of the new commercial deal with Yodel. Parcel sites increased by 6.4% to 14,274 sites. PAYMENTS & BANKING Payments & Banking divisional net revenue increased by £1.1 million (4.4%) to £26.0 million (September 2024: £24.9 million), benefitting from the £1.9 million contribution from obconnect. This was partially offset by the impact of fewer cash bill payments and top up transactions. Cash - bill payments and top ups net revenue decreased by £1.6 million (12.7%) to £11.0 million (September 2024: £12.6 million). Digital (MultiPay, Direct Debits, Cash Out and Open banking) net revenue increased by £0.6 million (9.5%) to £6.9 million (September 2024: £6.3 million) and digital transactions increased by 1.8 million (9.0%) to 21.9 million. MultiPay net revenue increased by £0.5 million to £3.4 million (September 2024: £2.9 million) with transactions remaining at 13.9 million. Cashout net revenue decreased by £0.1 million (7.3%) to £1.1 million (September 2024: £1.2 million). Cash through to digital (eMoney) net revenue increased by £0.1 million (2.9%) to £3.5 million (September 2024: £3.4 million) and transactions increased by 0.7 million (18.2%) to 4.5 million (September 2024: 3.8 million). eMoney transactions derive a substantially higher fee per transaction than traditional top-up transactions as they are more complex to process. Other Payments & Banking net revenue includes SIM sales, interest generated by investing cash received on client funds and other ad-hoc items which contributed £2.7 million (September 2024: £2.6 million) net revenue. LOVE2SHOP SEGMENT Love2shop (L2s) generated £106.7 million total billings in the period, an increase of 4.6% on the prior period. Billings are a measure of the total value of balance sold on cards and vouchers. The business is seasonal in nature, and profit is primarily generated in the second half of the financial year, which represents the peak trading period of the L2s corporate business and of the dispatch of Park Christmas savings prepaid products prior to Christmas The £5.7 million (11.5%) increase in revenue is largely attributable to single-retailer cards and vouchers, partially offset by a £2.1 million decrease in non-redemption income. The latter reflects the change in the annual expiry date of a significant proportion of cards and vouchers, from the first half of the prior financial year to the second half of the current financial year. Net revenue for the 6 months to 30 September 2025 was £17.0 million, a decrease of £1.8 million (9.6%) on prior period, principally due to the decrease in non-redemption income referred to above. PROFIT BEFORE TAX AND TAXATION The income tax charge of £5.0 million (September 2024: £5.8 million) on profit before tax of £19.9 million (September 2024: £23.1 million) represents an effective tax rate of 24.9% (September 2024: 25.1%). This is lower than the UK statutory rate of 25% due to the tax impact of share-based payments. GROUP STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION Net assets of £102.0 million (September 2024: £104.2 million) decreased by £2.2 million, reflecting the continuation of the share buyback program and dividends, partially offset by profit for the period and the part-disposal of Collect+. Current assets increased by £15.2 million to £364.6 million (September 2024: £349.4 million), mainly due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents. Non-current assets of £240.6 million (September 2024: £238.3 million) increased by £2.3 million, of which £16.6 million arose on the acquisition of obconnect (£12.2 million goodwill, £11.0 million intangible assets, less £6.6 million previously recorded as investments). Partially offsetting this was a £12.3 million decrease in the fair value of the Group’s investments in Yodel. Current liabilities increased by £6.5 million to £364.4 million (September 2024: £357.9 million), including a £7.4 million increase in the share buyback liability. Phase two of the share buy-back programme, which commenced in July 2025, was for £30 million of committed share purchases, compared with £20 million for phase one. Non-current liabilities of £138.9 million (September 2024: £125.6 million) increased by £13.3 million, including a £7.1 million increase in loans and borrowings, a £3.6 million increase in deferred tax, of which £2.5 million arose on the obconnect acquired intangible assets, and a £3.6 million settlement provision. At 30 September 2025 net corporate debt was £84.0 million (September 2024: £86.8 million), a decrease of £13.4 million from the year end position. This derives from positive cash generation and net proceeds from the part-disposal of Collect+, partially offset by tax, capex and dividend requirements, along with an exceptional settlement and share buy-back payments. Total loans and borrowings of £114.1 million (September 2024: £107.2 million), increased by £11.8 million from 31 March 2025, and comprise a £75.0 million non-amortising term loan, £40.0 million drawdown of the £90.0 million revolving credit facility, £0.4 million accrued interest less £1.3 million arrangement fees (September 2024: £63.0 million drawdown from the revolving credit facility, £45.0 million non-amortising term loan, £0.4 million accrued interest less £1.2 million arrangement fees). GROUP CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY The following table summarises the cash flow movements during the period. Cash generation decreased to £24.2 million (September 2024: £30.7 million) delivered from profit before tax of £19.9 million (September 2024: £23.1 million). There was a net working capital outflow of £6.1 million, £4.6 million of which relates to the timing of Love2shop product purchase and despatch and will unwind in the second half of the financial year. The remaining £1.5 million is principally due to professional fee payments in the current period, related to prior period exceptional items. The working capital outflow is higher than the prior period outflow, which benefitted from a £3.0 million cash collection from a key account in September 2024. The £10.4 million exceptional settlement payment relates to the Utilita accrual disclosed in the March 2025 financial statements. The £1.5 million pension contribution was to the L2s defined benefit scheme. The £43.5 million inflow from the part-disposal of subsidiary relates to the investment by IDS in the Group’s parcel division and is net of disposal costs. The £13.0 million share buyback outflow in the period exceeds the £4.4 million in the prior period, which included only 3 months’ share purchases of a lower annual committed amount than the current period commitment. Capital expenditure of £10.5 million (September 2024: £8.9 million) was £1.6 million higher than the prior period, primarily the result of software development investment to modernise heritage systems and Love2shop’s e-commerce project. DIVIDENDS In the six months to 30 September 2025, total dividend payments were £13.9 million or 19.6 pence per share (September 2024: £13.9 million or 19.2 pence per share), representing the final ordinary dividend for the year ended 31 March 2025. This is a 2.1% increase on the final dividend per share for the year ended 31 March 2024. On 17 October 2025 the Group approved a special dividend of 50.0 pence per share, paid on 29 October 2025 to shareholders on the register on 17 October 2025, representing c. 69 million eligible shares. Alongside this, the 12 for 13 share consolidation on 17 October 2025 reduced the issued share capital by c. 5.3 million shares to c. 63.7 million shares in issue as of this date. We have declared an increased interim dividend of 19.8 pence per share (September 2024: 19.4 pence) payable in equal instalments of 9.9 pence per share on 19 December 2025 and 27 March 2026 (to shareholders on the register on 28 November 2025 and 27 February 2026 respectively). This is an increase of 1.0% compared to the final dividend declared of 19.6 pence per share, and an increase of 2.1% compared to 19.4 pence per share interim dividend for prior year. In aggregate, the special dividend and interim dividends will result in £46.9 million (September 2024: £13.9 million) being paid to shareholders from the standalone statement of financial position of the Company which, as at 30 September 2025, had approximately £101.4 million (September 2024: £67.9 million) of distributable reserves. CAPITAL ALLOCATION The Board’s immediate priority is to continue to preserve PayPoint’s balance sheet strength. The Group maintains a capital structure appropriate for current and prospective trading over the medium term that allows a healthy mix of returns to shareholders and cash for investments. The Group’s capital allocation priorities are as follows: GOING CONCERN The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis having regard to the identified principal risks and uncertainties. Our cash and borrowing capacity provides sufficient funds to meet the foreseeable needs of the Group including dividends.

CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF PROFIT OR LOSS Earnings per share (pence) Underlying earnings per share – before adjusting items (pence) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Accounting policies Reporting entity PayPoint plc (‘PayPoint’ or the ‘Company’) is a public limited company, incorporated and registered in the UK under the Companies Act 2006. Its registered office is at Unit 1, The Boulevard, Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, AL7 1EL. Its shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange. These condensed consolidated interim financial statements (‘interim financial statements’) as at and for the six months ended 30 September 2025 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’). They were approved for issue on 20 November 2025. These interim financial statements do not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 March 2025 were approved by the board of directors on 11 June 2025 and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditor on those accounts was unqualified, did not contain an emphasis of matter paragraph and did not contain any statements under section 498 of the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been reviewed, not audited. Basis of preparationThe interim financial statements for the half-year reporting period ended 30 September 2025 have been prepared in accordance with the UK-adopted International Accounting Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority. Adoption of standards and policiesThe accounting policies applied by the Group in the interim financial statements for the period ended 30 September 2025 are consistent with those set out in the Group’s Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2025. Going concernThe interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt-to-equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, cash and cash equivalents, restricted funds held on deposit and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent comprising capital, reserves and retained earnings. The Group’s policy is to borrow centrally to meet anticipated funding requirements. Our cash and borrowing capacity provide sufficient funds to meet the foreseeable needs of the Group. At 30 September 2025, the Group had corporate cash of £30.1 million. On 11 June 2025, the Group completed an amendment to its borrowing facilities, to manage its working capital requirements and capital allocation. Its borrowing facilities now consist of: At 30 September 2025, £40.0 million was drawn down from the revolving credit facility (30 September 2024: £63.0 million). The Group’s statement of financial position shows net assets of £102.0 million as at 30 September 2025 (£104.2 million as at 30 September 2024), having made a profit after tax for the period of £14.9 million (30 September 2024: £17.3 million) and delivered cash from operations of £20.8 million for the period (30 September 2024: £36.4 million). The Group has net current assets of £0.2 million at 30 September 2025 (30 September 2024: net current liabilities of £8.5 million). The Directors consider the going concern period as twelve months from the date of signing of these interim financial statements and have reviewed detailed monthly cash flow forecasts from the Group over this period. In this ‘base case’ scenario, the cash flow forecasts show considerable liquidity headroom and debt covenants will be met throughout the period. In addition, the Directors have considered and confirm there are no significant or material events that have been identified beyond the going concern period that may cast doubt upon the continuing use of the going concern basis. In addition to the ‘base case’ scenario, the Directors have prepared a ‘downside’ scenario which includes the following assumptions: Shopping E-commerce Payments and banking Love2shop Even with the above assumptions, the forecasts indicate that there is sufficient headroom and liquidity for the Group to continue with its existing borrowing facilities. Based on this assessment, the Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of not less than 12 months from the date of approval of these interim financial statements and therefore have prepared the interim financial statements on a going concern basis. Use of judgements and estimatesIn the application of the Group’s accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. Critical judgement: recognition of cash and cash equivalents and restricted funds held on deposit The nature of payments and banking services means that PayPoint collects and holds funds on behalf of clients as those funds pass through the settlement process and retains retailer partners’ deposits as security for those collections. Following the Love2shop acquisition, it also holds card and voucher deposits on behalf of agents, cardholders and redeemers, some of which is held in trust. A critical judgement in this area is whether each of the above categories of funds, and restricted funds held on deposit, are recognised on the Consolidated statement of financial position, and whether they are included in cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Statement of consolidated cash flows. This includes evaluating: (a) the existence of a binding agreement, such as a legal trust, clearly identifying the beneficiary of the funds;(b) the identification of funds, ability to allocate and separability of funds;(c) the identification of the holder of those funds at any point in time; and(d) whether the Group bears the credit risk Where there is a binding agreement specifying that PayPoint holds funds on behalf of the client (i.e. acting in the capacity of a trustee) and those funds have been separately identified as belonging to that beneficiary, the cash (referred to as ‘Clients’ own funds’) and the related liability are not included on the Consolidated statement of financial position. In all other cases, the Group has access to the interest on such monies and can, having met certain conditions, withdraw the funds. The cash and corresponding liability are therefore recognised on the Consolidated statement of financial position. Corporate cash and cash equivalents consists of cash freely available to the Group for use in its daily operations and is presented as a separate line item on the Consolidated statement of financial position from non-corporate cash and cash equivalents, which is not freely available to the Group, either because of self-regulation and segregation or due to contractual or regulatory requirements. Non-corporate cash and cash equivalents comprises: Both corporate cash and non-corporate cash are included within cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated statement of cash flows. Restricted funds held on deposit (non-corporate), comprises gift card voucher cash and prepay savers’ cash. However, unlike the gift card voucher cash and prepay savers’ cash included in non-corporate cash and cash equivalents, restricted funds held on deposit (non-corporate) may only be accessed after a minimum of three months. Consequently, they are excluded from cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated statement of financial position and the Consolidated statement of cash flows. The amounts recognised on the Statement of financial position as at 30 September 2025 are as follows: Clients’ own fundsClients’ cash held in trust off the Consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 September 2025 is £50.8 million (30 September 2024: £49.4 million). Alternative performance measuresNon-IFRS measures or alternative performance measures are used by the Directors and management for performance analysis, planning, reporting and incentive setting purposes and have remained consistent with the alternative performance measures disclosed in the Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2025. These measures are included in these interim financial statements to provide additional useful information on performance and trends to shareholders. These measures are not defined terms under IFRS and therefore they may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies. They are not intended to be a substitute for IFRS measures. Underlying performance measures (non-IFRS measures)Underlying performance measures allow shareholders to understand the operational performance in the year, to facilitate comparison with prior years and to assess trends in financial performance. They usually exclude the impact of one-off, non- recurring and exceptional items and the amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition, such as brands and customer relationships. The adjusting items between the Group’s statutory and underlying performance measures are as follows: See note 5 for explanations of the above exceptional items. Love2Shop billings (non-IFRS measures relating solely to the Love2Shop segment)Billings represents the value of goods and services shipped and invoiced to customers during the period and is recorded net of VAT, rebates and discounts. Billings is an alternative performance measure, which the directors believe provides an additional measure of the level of activity other than total revenue. This is due to billings being recognised at a different time to revenue from multi-retailer redemption products being reported on a ‘net’ basis, whilst revenue from single-retailer redemption products and other goods are reported on a ‘gross’ basis. Net revenue (non-IFRS measure)Net revenue is total revenue less commissions paid (to retailer partners and Park Christmas agents) and the cost of revenue for items where the Group acts in the capacity of principal (including single-retailer vouchers and SIM cards). This reflects the benefit attributable to the Group’s performance, eliminating pass-through costs to create comparability of performance under both the agent and principal revenue models. It is a key consistent measure of the overall success of the Group’s strategy. A reconciliation from revenue to net revenue is included in note 4. Total costs (non-IFRS measure)Total costs comprise other costs of revenue, administrative expenses, financing income and finance costs. Total costs exclude adjusting items, being exceptional costs, amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition and net movement on convertible loan notes. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) (non-IFRS measure)The Group presents EBITDA as it is widely used by investors, analysts and other interested parties to evaluate profitability of companies. This measures earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Underlying EBITDA) (non-IFRS measure)The Group also presents adjusted EBITDA, which comprises EBITDA, as defined above, excluding exceptional items and net movements on convertible loan notes and other investments. Underlying earnings per share (non-IFRS measure)Underlying earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit before adjusting items attributable to equity holders of the parent by the basic or diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue. Underlying profit before tax (non-IFRS measure)Underlying profit before tax represents statutory profit before tax excluding adjusting items. Net corporate debt (non-IFRS measure)Net corporate debt represents corporate cash and cash equivalents less amounts borrowed under financing facilities (excluding IFRS 16 liabilities). The reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents to net corporate debt is as follows: 2. Segmental reportingThe Group considers its Love2shop business to be a separate segment from its legacy PayPoint business, since discrete financial information is prepared for Love2shop and it offers different products and services. Furthermore, the chief operating decision maker (CODM) reviews separate monthly internal management reports (including financial information) for both Love2shop and PayPoint to allocate resources and assess performance. The material products and services offered by each segment are as follows: PayPoint Love2shop Information related to each reportable segment is set out below. Segment profit / (loss) before tax and adjusting items is used to measure performance because management believes that this information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of the respective segments relative to other entities that operate in the same industries. The Group operates exclusively in the UK. 3. Revenue Disaggregation of revenue Service fee revenue of £11.5 million (September 2024: £10.7 million) and management fees, set-up fees and up-front lump sum payments of £0.7 million (September 2024: £0.7 million) are recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contract. Card terminal leasing revenue is recognised over the expected lease term using the sum of digits method for finance leases and on a straight-line basis for operating leases. Multi-retailer voucher, card and e-code service fee revenue is recognised on redemption by the customer. Multi-retailer non-redemption revenue is recognised when the product has expired (and, where applicable, when the right of refund has lapsed). The remainder of revenue is recognised at the point in time when each transaction is processed. The usual timing of payment by PayPoint customers is on fourteen-day terms. The usual timing of Love2shop’s corporate customers is fifteen-day terms; its consumer customers pay on ordering. Revenue subject to variable consideration of £6.5 million (September 2024: £8.0 million) exists where the consideration to which the Group is entitled varies according to transaction volumes processed and rate per transaction. Management estimates the total transaction price using the expected value method at contract inception, which is reassessed at the end of each reporting period, by applying a blended rate per transaction to estimated transaction volumes. Any required adjustment is made against the transaction prices in the period to which it relates. The revenue is recognised at the constrained amount to the extent that it is highly probable that the inclusion will not result in a significant revenue reversal in the future, with the estimates based on projected transaction volumes and historical experience. The potential range in outcomes for revenue subject to variable consideration resulting from changes in these estimates is not material. Love2shop revenue is recorded net of corporate discounts. Seasonality of operationsFollowing the Group’s acquisition of Love2shop on 28 February 2023, its performance is now considered “highly seasonal” under IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. The Love2shop business is heavily weighted towards the second half of the financial year, in particular the peak September to December pre-Christmas period when revenues from card, voucher and e-code redemptions are at their highest. The PayPoint business is far less seasonal, although its e-commerce division also generates its highest revenues in the pre- Christmas months. Bill payment transactions, which were historically higher during the winter months (H2), continue to be impacted by the shift in consumer behaviour towards making fewer, larger payments and structural changes in this market. Card payments typically generate higher value processed and revenue in the summer months (H1). Card terminal leasing revenue is relatively unaffected by seasonality. Other revenue Other revenue comprises: 4. Alternative performance measures Net revenue The reconciliation between total underlying revenue and net revenue is as follows: Total costs excluding adjusting items 5. Exceptional items The tax impact of the exceptional items is £0.79 million (September 2024: £0.62 million) Exceptional items are those which are considered significant by virtue of their nature, size or incidence. These items are presented as exceptional within their relevant income statement categories to assist in the understanding of the performance and financial results of the Group, as they do not form part of the underlying business. Legal feesThe current period legal fees relate to the Group’s defence of two claims served on a number of its companies in connection with issues addressed by commitments accepted by Ofgem as a resolution of its concerns raised in Ofgem’s Statement of Objections received by the Group in September 2020. The Group remains confident that it will successfully defend the claim served by Global-365. See note 12. Organisational framework costsThe current period organisational framework costs are fees to a third party engaged to support the Group deliver greater automation and agility. The work is expected to be completed during the year ending 31 March 2027, with total costs expected to exceed £1 million. 6. Tax 7. Earnings per shareBasic and diluted earnings per share are calculated on the net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue as follows: 8. Investments The fair values of the Group’s investments are as follows: No unrealised gains or losses arose in the current or prior period. Judge Logistics LtdJudge Logistics Ltd is the parent company of Yodel Ltd, a customer in the Group’s ecommerce parcel business. The Group’s investment in Judge Logistics Ltd is an equity investment of 4.5% of the ordinary share capital. This comprises an initial equity investment purchased for consideration of £100 on 26 July 2024 and a further 3.6% investment arising on conversion of the Group’s £15 million convertible loan note on 17 April 2025. At 31 March 2025 the Company revalued its investments at fair values of £540,000 for the equity investment and £2,159,000 for the convertible loan note, i.e. £2,699,000 in aggregate. At 30 September 2025, based on the Company’s fair value assessment, it has maintained the fair value of its investment at £2,699,000. Aperidata LtdIn May 2024, the Group acquired an equity investment of 19.9% of the ordinary share capital of Aperidata Ltd for £0.2 million and purchased a convertible loan note investment in Aperidata Ltd for consideration of £1.0 million. At 31 March 2025 and at 30 September 2025, the Company fair valued the investments at their respective costs. 9. Part-disposal of subsidiaryOn 18 July 2025, the Company disposed of 20% of its investment in a wholly owned subsidiary, Collect+ Brand Ltd, to International Distribution Services plc (“IDS”), a third-party partner in the Group’s e-commerce division. The consideration, net of transaction costs, was £11.9 million. On 30 September 2025, the Company disposed of a further 29% of its investment in Collect+ Brand Ltd to IDS for consideration of £31.6 million, net of transaction costs. Total net consideration received was therefore £43.5 million. The Group retains control of Collect+ Brand Ltd following the above transactions, due to the rights associated with the Group’s remaining 51% ownership. Consequently, the Group continues to account for Collect+ Brand Ltd as a subsidiary. It now also recognises a non-controlling interest, to which 49% of Collect+ Brand Ltd’s post-tax result is attributed in the Consolidated statement of profit or loss. The combined transaction gave rise to a post-tax gain on disposal of £34.0 million reported within equity, in accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements (see Consolidated statement of comprehensive income). 10. Share capital, share premium, merger reserve and capital redemption reserve In the current period 140,828 shares were issued (of 1/3p each) for share awards which vested in the period and 7,432 matching shares were issued (of 1/3p each) under the Employee Share Incentive Plan. On 17 October 2025, the Group carried out a share consolidation of 12 new ordinary shares for 13 existing ordinary shares, applicable to shareholders on the register on that date, following which the new ordinary shares have a nominal value of 0.3611 pence per share (see note 13). On 12 June 2025, the Group announced that the share buy-back programme, which it began on 1 July 2024 for an initial 12-month period, would be extended until the end of March 2028. The Group plans to purchase at least £30 million of shares per annum, in an extension to the programme which began on 1 July 2025. In accordance with IFRS 9, the Group therefore recognised an initial liability for the full amount of £30.2 million (including stamp duty and associated costs) in the current period, with a corresponding reduction in retained earnings. A total of 1,859,450 shares were purchased in the period, with a nominal value of £6k. This resulted in a reduction in share capital of £6k and a corresponding increase in the capital redemption reserve balance from £7k to £13k. The share premium of £1.0 million (September 2024: £1.0 million) represents the payment of deferred, contingent share consideration in excess of the nominal value of shares issued in relation to the i-movo acquisition. The merger reserve of £18.2 million (September 2024: £18.2 million) comprises £1.0 million initial share consideration in excess of the nominal value of shares issued on the initial acquisition of i-movo and £17.2 million share consideration in excess of the nominal value of shares issued in relation to the Love2shop acquisition. 11. Notes to the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows 12. Contingent liabilityOfgem statement of objectionsFurther to the update provided on 12 June 2025, the Group’s position remains unchanged: it is confident that it will successfully defend the claim by Global 365, which fundamentally misunderstands the energy market and the relationships between the relevant Group companies and the major energy providers, whilst also over-estimating the opportunity available, if any, for the products offered by Global 365. As a result, no accounting provision has been made for this claims. The Group will continue to update the market on a quarterly basis as part of its financial reporting cycle. HMRC assessmentIn February 2024, HMRC raised an assessment on the Group’s tax position for the accounting period ended 31 March 2021. The Group has appealed the assessment on the grounds that it is not valid from a tax technical and administrative perspective and no provision has therefore been recognised. 13. Events after the reporting dateShare consolidation and special dividendAt a special general meeting held on 17 October 2025, the Group’s shareholders approved a share consolidation of 12 new ordinary shares for 13 existing ordinary shares, applicable to shareholders on the register on that date. As a result of the share consolidation, the new ordinary shares have a nominal value of 0.3611 pence per share. In all other respects, the new ordinary shares are equivalent to the existing ordinary shares, including their dividend, voting and other rights. At the same special general meeting on 17 October 2025, following approval of the share consolidation, the Group’s shareholders approved a special dividend of 50 pence per new ordinary share, payable to shareholders on the register on that date. The special dividend payment of £34.5 million was made on 31 October 2025. PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES Our risk management and internal control framework is designed to ensure that the Group maintains an effective and dynamic risk management process which identifies our risk exposures, ensures our programme of mitigating controls operates effectively and provides assurance to our stakeholders that effective risk management is embedded in our operations. The Group’s principal risks and uncertainties remain closely aligned to those risks disclosed in the Strategic Report section of its Annual Report for the year ended 31st of March 2025 and are detailed below. RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT We confirm that to the best of our knowledge this set of interim financial statements has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as contained in UK-adopted IFRS and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority and that the interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.7 (indication of important events during the first half and description of principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining half of the year) and DTR 4.2.8 (disclosure of related parties’ transactions and changes therein). Nick Wiles Rob HardingChief Executive Finance Director Independent review report to PayPoint Plc Report on the condensed consolidated interim financial statements Our conclusionWe have reviewed PayPoint Plc’s condensed consolidated interim financial statements (the “interim financial statements”) in the Interim results of PayPoint Plc for the 6 month period ended 30 September 2025 (the “period”). Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting' and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority. The interim financial statements comprise: The interim financial statements included in the Interim results of PayPoint Plc have been prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting' and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority. Basis for conclusionWe conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK) 2410, ‘Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity’ issued by the Financial Reporting Council for use in the United Kingdom (“ISRE (UK) 2410”). A review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) and, consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. We have read the other information contained in the Interim results and considered whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the interim financial statements. Conclusions relating to going concernBased on our review procedures, which are less extensive than those performed in an audit as described in the Basis for conclusion section of this report, nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the directors have inappropriately adopted the going concern basis of accounting or that the directors have identified material uncertainties relating to going concern that are not appropriately disclosed. This conclusion is based on the review procedures performed in accordance with ISRE (UK) 2410. However, future events or conditions may cause the group to cease to continue as a going concern. Responsibilities for the interim financial statements and the review Our responsibilities and those of the directors The Interim results, including the interim financial statements, is the responsibility of, and has been approved by the directors. The directors are responsible for preparing the Interim results in accordance with the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority. In preparing the Interim results, including the interim financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim financial statements in the Interim results based on our review. Our conclusion, including our Conclusions relating to going concern, is based on procedures that are less extensive than audit procedures, as described in the Basis for conclusion paragraph of this report. This report, including the conclusion, has been prepared for and only for the company for the purpose of complying with the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this conclusion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

Title: A shorter shopping window complicates retail’s already challenging holiday season

Save 50% on a 3-month Digiday+ membership. Ends Dec 5. This story was originally published on sister site, Modern Retail. This season, retailers and shoppers alike are contending with a shorter holiday shopping window — on top of tariffs, waning consumer sentiment and recession fears. The 2025 holiday shopping season is shorter than usual, with 28 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. That’s one extra day compared to last year’s ultra-condensed shopping season, but four fewer shopping days than 2023. Cyber Monday will fall in December this year, and Christmas will be on a Thursday. By some metrics, the holiday shopping season is shaping up to be merry and bright. The National Retail Federation projects U.S. holiday sales will surpass $1 trillion for the first time in 2025, rising as much as 4.2% over last year. Similarly, EMarketer is forecasting holiday sales of $1.369 trillion, up 3.6% year over year. But the holiday season is unfolding against a backdrop of economic uncertainty. U.S. employment is worsening with the highest level of October layoffs in 22 years last month, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas. Retail was one of the most heavily impacted industries, Modern Retail previously reported. Tariffs and inflation have also negatively colored consumer sentiment heading into retail’s biggest sales season. Consumer sentiment has fallen about 6% in November so far, according to the most recent survey from the University of Michigan. All told, this year’s condensed shopping calendar is landing at a difficult moment for the industry. Retailers are already juggling tariff-related cost pressures that have complicated everything from inventory planning to pricing strategy, and now they have fewer days to make up crucial fourth-quarter sales. Consumers, meanwhile, are heading into the season with shaky confidence, tighter budgets and heightened sensitivity to prices. Taken together, a shorter runway and a more cautious shopper are reshaping when — and how much — people are willing to spend, adding yet another layer of uncertainty to an already strained holiday period.“We’re going to see a lot of different headwinds this year, and this is one of them,” said Katherine Black, a partner at global management consulting firm Kearney, where she leads food, drug and mass market retail. Here’s a look at how retailers and consumers are preparing for a shorter holiday season complicated by President Donald Trump’s trade war, inflation and a worsening labor market. Over the past few years, retailers have pulled forward the timing of holiday deals, kicking off the season outside of tentpole occasions like Black Friday and Cyber Monday. This year was no exception, as Amazon effectively kicked off the holiday season with its earliest ever “Big Deals Prime Day” sale in October. The sale ran from Oct. 7 through Oct. 8, slightly earlier than last year’s event, when the sales ran from Oct. 8 until Oct. 9. Retailers including Best Buy, Target, Walmart and Kohl’s introduced overlapping promotions to pull in early holiday demand ahead of the Black Friday peak. Some retailers introduced their holiday marketing campaigns well before Halloween. Macy’s, for instance, started its “100 Days to Christmas” campaign in September. Meanwhile, Nordstrom launched its holiday season campaign at the end of October. Walmart promoted its Thanksgiving meal basket in late October. That strategy may become even more important this year as retailers navigate fewer selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas Day, along with concerns about how tariffs and inflation may impact consumer spending. Kearney’s Black said that while Black Friday and Cyber Monday remain the season’s biggest tentpoles, this year’s economic backdrop is amplifying the need for strong early performance. “Cyber Monday and Black Friday have never been more important,” she said, adding that economic uncertainty and higher prices are motivating people to seek out promotions earlier in the season. According to Circana’s annual holiday outlook survey, 44% of U.S. consumers say they plan to begin their holiday shopping earlier than they normally would. That’s up four percentage points higher from Circana’s survey last year. Nearly half of consumers plan to start shopping before Thanksgiving. Less than 20% will wait until December, which marks the lowest level of late-season holiday shoppers since 2021, according to the survey. Black said the shorter holiday shopping calendar may also hinder impulse purchases. “You may be a little less likely to pick up the ‘Oh, I need to get another gift’ thing. … So, it can absolutely have an impact,” she said. A shorter shopping window means operational precision matters more. Retailers have only a few weeks to move inventory and meet tighter shipping deadlines. Black said the fundamentals will be critical: “They need to have fast shipping. It needs to be easy for [the] consumer. They need to have great in-stocks, and the experience really matters.” That pressure is pushing retailers to diversify last-mile options. Kevin Sides, CEO at logistics provider ShipMonk, said shifting volume to regional carriers has become one of the biggest logistics trends across his client base heading into the peak holiday season. Indeed, regional carriers like Jitsu, SpeedX and Veho ramped up their service coverage in the U.S. earlier this year, per Supply Chain Dive. “It’s not just FedEx and UPS getting orders out and delivered anymore. These regionals have way more of a market share,” Sides said, citing alternative parcel carriers like OnTrac and UniUni. “If 50% of your volume [is] not going with a regional, you’re leaving a lot on the table from both cost and performance.” More specialty retailers inked partnerships with delivery startups in 2025, rather than building out their own fulfillment networks, to better compete with behemoths like Amazon and Walmart. Old Navy and DoorDash, for instance, launched a nationwide partnership for same-day delivery of clothing and holiday items, making it one of the first major apparel retailers on the platform. Ace Hardware also inked a deal with DoorDash earlier this year, offering on-demand delivery from local hardware stores. Despite the compressed calendar, Sides said consumers shouldn’t expect widespread delivery disruptions, as long as they avoid last-minute ordering and pay attention to shipping deadlines. “There’s not a carrier that’s not [delivering] packages in time for the holidays when you’re shipping by the third [of December],” he said. “But consumers shouldn’t wait too much to the last minute.” As the season wears on and shipping cutoffs tighten, more shoppers may turn to stores. Bain & Company’s holiday forecast predicts that 36% of U.S. consumers will shop entirely or mostly in physical stores, up from 24% in 2024. Large retailers with expansive store networks can also lean more heavily on same-day and buy-online, pick-up in-store options. Brad Jashinsky, director analyst at Gartner. said these capabilities will become more important as shipping cutoffs approach. As he put it, “That’s where the advantage of Amazon, Walmart, Target and others [comes in], where they can utilize their very sophisticated supply chains or … in-store” fulfillment.
