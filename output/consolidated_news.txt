The Consumer Price Index for September increased at an annual rate of 3.0 percent, the Labor Department reported this morning. This was an increase from 2.9 percent in August, 2.7 percent in July, and around 2.3 percent this past spring, before Trump’s perverse policies began to bite. Inflation of 3 percent doesn’t seem too bad, but it conceals a great deal of softness in the economy. That weakness will be sufficiently worrisome for the Fed to likely proceed with its planned quarter-point rate cut when the Federal Open Market Committee meets next week. But after that, both inflation and unemployment are likely to worsen, leaving the Fed with no good options. More from Robert Kuttner On the inflation front, Trump’s on-again, off-again tariffs have yet to fully bite, but their impact is likely to increase over time. Other specific price hikes, as in health insurance under the ACA, will begin to hit only in November, although health insurance costs generally are already more than 6 percent over last year’s. In addition, Trump’s killing of antitrust enforcement and other consumer protections is allowing a lot of opportunistic price increases that reflect abuses of market power. Employment is also weakening. With the Bureau of Labor Statistics staff mostly on furlough because of the government shutdown, precise numbers on joblessness are not available. But myriad indicators of a soft job market are unmistakable. Trump’s rescissions of federal spending and layoffs of federal employees raise the unemployment rate directly, and have cascaded throughout the economy. As Paul Krugman has observed, every job indicator is soft and getting softer. New hires are barely above the rate of the Great Recession. The rate of long-term unemployment—more than six months without a job—soared in August, and updated numbers are likely to be worse but not available because of the government shutdown. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. Jobless rates were higher in August than a year earlier in 243 of the 387 metropolitan areas. More and more corporations are announcing or planning layoffs, including Microsoft, Meta, Intel, Target, and Kohl’s. Amazon plans to replace 600,000 warehouse workers with robots. One of the most alarming indicators of a risky economy is the heavy reliance on spending by the wealthiest consumers. In a recent speech, Fed governor Christopher Waller, one of Trump’s own appointees no less, pointed out that consumption is heavily skewed to rich people because of the gross inequality in the economy and the stock boom, which many economists think is a bubble. Waller said, “The highest-earning 10 percent of households are responsible for 22 percent of personal consumption. The top 20 percent of households spend 35 percent of the total. Their share of stock market wealth is even more skewed.” In fact, the top 10 percent of households own 87 percent of stocks, while the bottom half own hardly any. Moreover, a great deal of capital investment and the stock market boom are driven by artificial intelligence. “Artificial” is the right word. At some point, that bubble is likely to burst, and luxury spending with it. All told, the seemingly not-too-bad Trump economy is living on borrowed time. You might wonder how the BLS was able to release this report despite the government shutdown. The answer is that the September data were collected before the shutdown began. Even so, the release date had to be postponed from October 15 to October 24, while the BLS got a special exemption to bring back a skeleton crew of economists and IT specialists to get the report out, but only to work on inflation and not on employment. This was done because the Social Security cost-of-living increase for next year relies on third-quarter data. Next month’s CPI report, based on data that the BLS is supposed to be collecting right now, will likely be inadequate, and even more sketchy the longer the shutdown drags on. But other sources in the public domain are likely to show worsening trends in both prices and jobs. Trump inherited a strong economy. Tearing down the house is the right Trump visual. We’re coming up on the final stretch of our fall fundraising drive, and, candidly, we’re short of our goal.

The ripple effect of the four provinces all dipping deep into their reserves while the Ireland squad is in Chicago is that some All-Ireland League clubs have been obliged to do likewise. For example, Terenure beat Lansdowne with an impressive display under lights on the Aviva back pitch a couple of weeks ago in an encounter which was much more competitive than the final 34-13 score line indicated. Evidence of the game’s high quality is that Leinster have picked three of the Lansdowne starting XV – prop Jerry Cahir, hooker Bobby Sheehan and fullback Hugo McLoughlin – to face Zebre, as well as the Terenure pair of outhalf Caspar Gabriel and hooker John McKee. New signing Julien Valleise will make his third league start for Lansdowne in the front row away to Young Munster, while Sean Galvin and Tom Roche feature in the back three, with Todd Lawlor reverting to fullback. Evan O’Connell, Ruadhan Quinn, Shay McCarthy, and Jake O’Riordan are on Munster duty, so Harry Langbridge, Orin Burke, John Poland, Christian Foley, Oran O’Reilly, and Stephen McLoughlin come in to the Cookies team. After three one-score defeats, and a couple of attacking bonus points, Young Munster will be striving for a win. Ditto for Lansdowne after losing two of their first three outings. Terenure have their first home game under Carlos Spencer against newly-promoted Nenagh Ormond, who will be making their first-ever visit to Lakelands Park. Spencer makes six changes, Leinster under-19 talent Arthur Ashmore coming in to the back row. Nenagh came up just short of a first point in Division 1A in losing 25-17 to Cork Con a fortnight ago. Munster prop Roman Salanoa will make his first start for the club, while Argentinian Mateo Sentous, Jake O’Kelly and John O’Flaherty have also been added to the pack. Alex Usanov’s Leinster call-up has contributed to one of Clontarf’s three changes for their first visit to Old Belvedere in nine years, with Ivan Soroka, Ben Griffin and Jim Peters returning to the tight five. Hugh Flood replaces Hugo O’Malley in Belvo’s only change. St Mary’s, the only unbeaten team after three rounds, travel to UCD with all their big guns in situ, with Aaron O’Neill and Leandro Ramirez added to their back three. Centre Ben Brownlee returns from a spell with North Harbour in the NPC for UCD, who also welcome back Leinster Academy lock Conor O’Tighearnaigh. Cork Constitution, who sit second after successive wins, host free-scoring Ballynahinch, who are third after Ethan Graham’s six-try salvo last time out against UCD. Old Wesley, the only team with three wins in Division 1B, travel north to last season’s champions Instonians. Leinster Academy flyer Paidi Farrell will make his first start of the new season for Wesley, while Ulster’s John Andrew will make his debut for the home side. The 2B leaders Galwegians host fourth-placed Malone, just a point behind them, at Crowley Park. Galwegians also top the women’s league and take that unbeaten record to eighth-placed Cooke. All-Ireland League fixtures: (Saturday, 2.30pm unless stated) Division 1A: Cork Constitution v Ballynahinch, Temple Hill; Old Belvedere v Clontarf, Ollie Campbell Park; Terenure College v Nenagh Ormond, Lakelands Park; UCD v St Mary’s College, Belfield; Young Munster v Lansdowne, Tom Clifford Park.

Title: Target spotlights support for Black founders after DEI backlash

Ashley Lutz is an executive editor at Fortune, overseeing the Success, Well, syndication, and social teams. She was previously an editorial leader at Bankrate, The Points Guy, and Business Insider, and a reporter at Bloomberg News. Ashley is a graduate of Ohio University's Scripps School of Journalism. Target recently highlighted its ongoing partnership with a group dedicated to Black founders, following a turbulent year marked by backlash, boycotts, and leadership changes. The retailer’s renewed spotlight on Black businesses could signal a recalibration—and perhaps an effort to mend relations with communities that once helped define its brand ethos. In an Oct. 20 statement, Target pointed to its tie-up with the Russell Innovation Center for Entrepreneurs (RICE), which supports Black small business founders with education, mentorship, and access to retail opportunities. Through RICE’s Retail Readiness Academy, Target has helped fund initiatives that train emerging entrepreneurs in retail strategy and business scaling. The company also extended support through HBCU programs under its “HBCU, Always” series—an ongoing effort to connect graduates with Target’s mentorship network.​ The timing is significant, notes journalist Habiba Katsha in a blog post for People of Color in Tech. The announcement arrives just months after the resignation of CEO Brian Cornell, amid falling sales and customer traffic. Cornell’s leadership had been central to Target’s post-2020 DEI expansion, including its $2 billion Racial Equity Action and Change (REACH) initiative. Yet in January 2025, the company abruptly moved to end many of those DEI goals, citing a “realignment” of strategy and a focus on “business neutrality”.​ Target’s rollback of DEI initiatives set off a firestorm. As Fortune reported in early 2025, civil rights activists organized a nationwide boycott in protest of the company’s decision to scale back its DEI infrastructure, which had been celebrated in the wake of George Floyd’s murder. ​ The boycott came during Black History Month—symbolically amplifying the controversy—and led to dramatic declines in store traffic. Black business owners whose products were featured in Target stores voiced concern that the boycotts might inadvertently harm their own sales, prompting activists to urge consumers to buy directly from those brands online instead. ​Target sales have declined in 2025, and the stock has dropped 61% from its 2021 peak. The company also announced its first major layoffs in a decade and plans to cut 1,800 corporate jobs. While consumer boycotts have played a role, company leadership has also cited competition from Amazon and Walmart as factors in its decline. Target’s retreat mirrors a larger pattern across corporate America. Fortune has chronicled the growing pressure on companies to either scale back or quietly rebrand DEI programs amid shifting political and cultural winds. By mid-2025, only a small fraction of Fortune 500 firms continued to publish detailed diversity reports, as others transitioned to euphemistic “inclusion” or “corporate responsibility” frameworks.​ Earlier this year, analysts warned that companies dismantling DEI structures risk severe reputation damage and long-term brand erosion. “If the politics in society change, your values should not,” said consultant Ponce de Leon, underscoring the trust deficit companies face when perceived as abandoning equity commitments.​ Other Fortune coverage emphasized the financial risks of retreating from DEI. Boycotts, talent attrition, and eroding customer loyalty—particularly among younger and more diverse demographics—are emerging as critical market liabilities.​ Target’s decision to spotlight RICE and reaffirm support for Black-owned business development is being read as both a reputational hedge and a cultural reset. It offers the company a way to demonstrate continued engagement with racial equity without reviving the formal DEI frameworks that drew political scrutiny. Whether this recalibration can reverse Target’s declining sales remains uncertain. But in a corporate landscape where DEI language is declining 68% in filings from S&P 500 companies in 2025, Target’s move stands out as a strategic attempt to balance commerce, conscience, and survival in a politically polarized marketplace. ​For this story, Fortune used generative AI to help with an initial draft.

Title: Target is eliminating 1,800 corporate jobs as it looks to reclaim its lost luster

Lisa Leff, Associated Press Lisa Leff, Associated Press Leave your feedback Target said Thursday that it is eliminating about 1,800 corporate positions in an effort to streamline decision-making and accelerate initiatives to rebuild the flagging discount retailer’s customer base. About 1,000 employees are expected to receive layoff notices next week, and the company also plans to eliminate about 800 vacant jobs, a company spokesperson said. The cuts represent about 8% of Target’s corporate workforce globally, although the majority of the affected employees work at the company’s Minneapolis headquarters, the spokesperson said. WATCH: Pastor leading Target boycott on its impact and the retailer’s response Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke, who is set to become Target’s next CEO on Feb. 1, issued a note to personnel on Thursday announcing the downsizing. He said further details would come on Tuesday, and he asked employees at the Minneapolis offices to work from home next week. “The truth is, the complexity we’ve created over time has been holding us back,” Fiddelke, a 20-year Target veteran, wrote in his note. “Too many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life.” Target, which has about 1,980 U.S. stores, lost ground to Walmart and Amazon in recent years as inflation caused shoppers to curtail their discretionary spending. Customers have complained of messy stores with merchandise that did not reflect the expensive-looking but budget-priced niche that long ago earned the retailer the jokingly posh nickname “Tarzhay.” READ MORE: After Target backs away from diversity programs, civil rights activists call for a boycott Fiddelke said in August when he was announced as Target’s next CEO that he would step into the role with three urgent priorities: reclaiming the company’s position as a leader in selecting and displaying merchandise; improving the customer experience by making sure shelves are consistently stocked and stores are clean; and investing in technology. He cited the same goals in his message to employees, calling the layoffs a “necessary step in building the future of Target and enabling the progress and growth we all want to see.” “Adjusting our structure is one part of the work ahead of us. It will also require new behaviors and sharper priorities that strengthen our retail leadership in style and design and enable faster execution,” he wrote. READ MORE: U.S. inflation stays elevated but prices rose less than feared last month Target has reported flat or declining comparable sales — those from established physical stores and online channels — in nine out of the past 11 quarters. The company reported in August that comparable sales dipped 1.9% in its second quarter, when its net income also dropped 21%. The job cuts will not affect any store employees or workers in Target’s sorting, distribution and other supply chain facilities, the company spokesperson said. The corporate workers losing their jobs will receive pay and benefits until Jan. 3 as well as severance packages, the spokesperson said. Support trusted journalism and civil dialogue.

Title: Did Trump agree to 'bail out' Argentina? Unpacking the claim
URL: https://www.snopes.com//news/2025/10/24/trump-argentina-bailout/
Time Published: 2025-10-24T17:51:00Z
Full Content:
During the U.S. federal government shutdown in October 2025, rumors spread that President Donald Trump sent a multibillion-dollar "bailout" to help stabilize Argentina's economy using taxpayers' money. For example, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries commented on the alleged bailout in a statement to the press on Oct. 15 (archived): It's perplexing to us that Republicans refuse to spend a dime to protect the healthcare of the American people, but somehow the Trump administration found $40 billion to bail out a right-wing wannabe dictator in Argentina in ways that are also going to continue to hurt our soybean farmers in Iowa and in the Midwest. That's outrageous. This is corruption in real time. Critics lambasted the purported deal, with some saying the money would have been better spent paying air traffic controllers or government-covered health care costs during the shutdown. An anti-corruption nonprofit RepresentUs claimed on X the move benefited wealthy U.S. investors who supposedly bet on Argentina's economic success such as Robert Citrone, of Discovery Capital Management, an alleged close acquaintance to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (archived). (Snopes unpacks the origin and facts of that specific assertion, below.) It is true that the U.S. government said it agreed to help stabilize Argentina's economy with billion-dollar funding packages. First, it said it agreed to sending $20 billion and then it said it aimed to double that number. The Trump administration said on Oct. 9 that it had pledged the money, according to an X post by Bessent. The government inked the agreement on Oct. 20, according to another post by Bessent and a statement by Argentina's central bank. The administration said the move was strategic, tying it to an effort to maintain influence over Argentina — the Americas' southernmost country — against China. Some critics of the Trump administration framed the bailout as a gift using taxpayer dollars, and financial experts described the deal as unusually risky for the U.S. considering Argentina's history of defaulting on loans, per a Wall Street Journal report. In reality, the deal was a loan in the form of a currency swap. The money would come from the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF), an account the Treasury Department can use for emergencies without congressional approval. Further, the administration said half the money would come from private lenders, not the U.S. government. After agreeing to send the initial $20 billion, Bessent said the Trump administration pledged an additional $20 billion from the "private sector," such as banks and investors, as reputable news outlets such as The Wall Street Journal, NBC News and the The Associated Press have reported. Whether Argentina actually receives the money was uncertain, as of this writing. After the Trump administration announced the aid package, Trump said his government would only help the country if the party of Argentina President Javier Milei, a Trump ally, won the country's midterm legislative election on Oct. 26. Also, it was unclear whether banks would supply their half. Snopes contacted Argentina's central bank, the U.S. Treasury Department and the White House about details in this report, and we will update our reporting if we receive responses. Argentina defaulted on its debt nine times in its history, most recently in 2001, 2014 and 2020. In December 2023, Argentina elected Milei, who outlined during his presidential campaign a libertarian program to supposedly fix the country's longstanding economic woes. Milei promised to shrink the government, cut spending and get inflation under control. Milei took office and slashed spending on infrastructure, civil servant wages and welfare, among other things. Initially, his reforms fueled optimism, which led foreign investors — including Citrone — to bet on the country's economic recovery. Milei's policies brought the country's inflation rate from 211% in 2023 to 117.8% in 2024, according to Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA), a Spanish bank. After the economy contracted in 2023 and 2024, it grew in 2025. As of this writing, growth projections for 2025 ranged from 4% (BBVA) to 4.6% (World Bank). But economic uncertainty returned when Milei lost popularity among voters after his austerity measures resulted in a historically high poverty rate and a corruption scandal engulfed his sister, Karina Milei. As a result, his party, La Libertad Avanza, lost ground in Buenos Aires' provincial election on Sept. 7, 2025. Voters will next decide on the fate of Milei's party during the country's midterm legislative election on Oct. 26. The election results will determine Milei's ability to follow his plans for budget reform. The outcome of the Sept. 7, 2025, election triggered a panic in financial markets. Investors began selling Argentine assets, including the peso. The value of the peso dropped so sharply, the situation forced Argentina's government to sell nearly $700 million to prevent the currency from falling further. (Buying the peso with dollars helps increase its value.) That defensive move by Argentina's government depleted foreign-exchange reserves. In September 2025, the U.S. government stepped in to assist the Argentine government in its attempt to support the currency (archived): Bessent said in another post (archived) that the U.S. could help stabilize Argentina with tools such as "swap lines" and "direct currency purchases." Bessent said that "opportunities for private investments remain expansive." After Bessent's announcement, Argentine stocks soared. Weeks later, officials from the two countries met at the White House and agreed to a currency swap. In such a deal, one country uses its currency to buy the currency of another (the one that needs help). In this case, the U.S. agreed to buy pesos with dollars. The country that receives the help must buy back its currency before an agreed date. Currency swaps are loans, not gifts. On Oct. 9, Bessent announced the agreement on X, saying the Treasury had already bought pesos (archived): In that post, he said the U.S. purchased pesos directly, and that the two countries agreed to a $20 billion currency swap with Argentina's central bank. On Oct. 17, Bessent said the U.S. bought more pesos the day before, without giving a specific total. (archived): On Oct. 20, Argentina's central bank announced it had signed the deal with the U.S. The central bank's statement read: The agreement sets forth the terms and conditions for the implementation of bilateral currency swap operations between the two parties. Such operations will allow the BCRA [Banco Central de la República Argentina] to expand its set of monetary and exchange rate policy instruments, including the liquidity of its international reserves, in accordance with the regulatory functions established in its Charter. A day later, Bessent posted on X that this deal with Argentina was "a bridge to a better economic future for Argentina, not a bailout" (archived). Much was unknown about the deal, as of this writing. Neither party has shared specific terms to which they have supposedly agreed. They have not said when Argentina would have to buy back its pesos, nor have they reported the amount the U.S. has already purchased. We asked for those details in our inquiries to the Treasury Department, White House and Argentina's central bank. Money for this bailout would come from the U.S.'s ESF, which, as of August 2025, had a bit more than $43 billion available, federal records show. The U.S. government used the ESF once before to support a foreign government in trouble. That happened in 1995, when then-President Bill Clinton failed to obtain congressional approval to bail out Mexico during its peso crisis. But unlike the 2025 situation with Argentina, the U.S. did not rescue Mexico, a close trading partner, on its own. Clinton worked with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), an organization of 191 countries dedicated to helping nations regain economic stability when they can't finance themselves through usual means. The IMF imposed strict conditions on Clinton's aid package to Mexico. In the case with Argentina, the Trump administration agreed to the aid package without IMF backing and did not publicly outline conditions for repayment, as of this writing. Bessent said in the Oct. 9 X post Argentine Economy Minister Luis Caputo promised the government would maintain strict budgetary policies, following the IMF's conditions for repaying that organization money. The IMF has been supporting Argentina for years. The organization announced in April 2025 its 23rd scheme to support the country's finances. As of this writing, the country owes the IMF $57 billion (41.8 billion in special drawing rights (SDR), the IMF's monetary unit), the highest amount any country has owed the lender. The IMF expects the countries it supports to implement policies to rebalance their budgets, often leading to austerity measures. Argentina has made similar agreements with other governments before. In 2020, Argentina arranged an $18 billion currency swap with China, $5 billion of which Argentina activated in 2024 and renewed in 2025. (That happened despite the fact Milei called China an "assassin" state during his 2023 presidential campaign.) After Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese products in 2025, China — the world's biggest importer of soybeans that, under usual conditions, buys them from the U.S. — started relying more on Argentina for the product. This angered U.S. farmers. The Trump administration saw this rapprochement between Argentina and China as a threat. Asked if he was trying to "drive a wedge" between the two countries, Trump defended the U.S.'s support of Argentina as a strategy to maintain influence in the Latin American country. During the Oct. 14 meeting between Trump and Milei, Trump said, as part of the 2025 deal, Argentina should end its currency swap agreement with China. Economic experts reportedly expressed worry over the U.S.'s risk in offering the line of credit to Argentina, especially since some believe the country should let its currency depreciate rather than let it fluctuate within a tight band against the dollar. For example, The Wall Street Journal quoted Brad Setser, a former Treasury official under former President Barack Obama, as saying, "Should the peso depreciate, which many think is not only likely but necessary, the Treasury would be left holding assets that have fallen in value," after the currency swap with Argentina. In other words, Setser said the U.S. may not recover the entirety of the loan. In the same article, The Wall Street Journal reported concerns among IMF officials that the U.S. would demand repayment of the bailout before Argentina repays the IMF the $57 billion it owes. We asked for responses to these concerns in our inquiries to the White House, Treasury Department and Argentina's central bank. Also, whether private lenders will pull through on their portion of the Trump administration's declaration to help Argentina remained unknown. On Oct. 20, The Wall Street Journal reported that banks including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup were having difficulty finding collateral or obtaining guarantees from the U.S. government for the loan to Argentina, and that that portion of the deal may not happen as a result. Snopes contacted those four banks to independently verify The Wall Street Journal's reporting. Citigroup and Goldman Sachs declined to comment, and the others did not respond. Claims about wealthy investors supporting the U.S.-Argentina currency swap for their own financial gain stemmed from reports about Bessent's alleged ties to banks. Citrone, of Discovery Capital Management, was in touch with Bessent before he announced the deal, The New York Times reported, citing two anonymous sources. (Due to the anonymity of those sources, Snopes was unable to track them down for independent verification.) Meanwhile, Bloomberg News reported that Citrone increased his investment in Argentine bonds in early September 2025, before the aid package announcement. The New York Times named investment funds the bailout package would supposedly benefit, including PIMCO, Fidelity and BlackRock, and claimed the deal would favor investor Stanley Druckenmiller's interests. He, Bessent and Citrone reportedly worked together for billionaire George Soros' investment fund, though there was no verified evidence to definitively confirm that history. Snopes reached out to these investors for confirmation. Citrone's Discovery Capital declined to comment. In an interview with CNBC, Bessent dismissed the claim that the government agreed to the bailout package to help wealthy U.S. investors. The Oct. 26 midterm legislative elections in Argentina could affect the deal between the country and U.S. In the Oct. 14 meeting with Milei, Trump indiciated the U.S. would not go through with the deal if Milei's party loses on Oct. 26. "If he [Milei] does win, we're going to be very helpful," Trump said. "And if he doesn't win, we're not going to waste our time because you have somebody whose philosophy has no chance of making Argentina great again." We asked the White House if Trump intends to make good on this threat. Aldaya, Francisco. "Exclusive: Rob Citrone Says Argentina Will Lead Golden Decade for Latin America."

Title: Microsoft’s executive-mandated 30% profit target reportedly drove Xbox layoffs, studio shutdowns, and canceled projects
URL: https://www.notebookcheck.net/Microsoft-s-executive-mandated-30-profit-target-reportedly-drove-Xbox-layoffs-studio-shutdowns-and-canceled-projects.1146022.0.html
Time Published: 2025-10-24T17:33:00Z
Full Content:
Microsoft’s Xbox gaming division has reported been under intense pressure to deliver 30% profit margins, nearly double the video game industry’s 2024 average of 17%, a target set by executives in the fall of 2023. This extremely lofty target has directly contributed to widespread layoffs, studio closures, and project cancellations across the sector. According to a Bloomberg investigation reported on October 23, Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood introduced these “accountability margins,” Microsoft’s internal term for profit goals, as part of a broader corporate push to squeeze more efficiency from the gaming arm. This benchmark, which S&P Global Analyst Neil Barbour described as “usually reserved for a publisher that is really nailing it,” is in direct contrast to the division’s historical performance. Leaked FTC documents from 2023 revealed that Xbox achieved only 12% profit margins in the first nine months of fiscal year 2022, with averages hovering between 10% and 20% over the prior six years. The fallout from the aggressive target has been quite severe, resulting in over 10,000 job cuts in Microsoft’s operations in early 2023. This was further exacerbated by Microsoft's announcement of 1,900 layoffs within its gaming division in January 2024. During May 2024, Microsoft also closed down Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks, Alpha Dog Games, and Roundhouse Games. Later in September 2024, the gaming division was met with another 650 layoffs. In July 2025, Microsoft announced it would cut 9,000 jobs within its gaming division. These measures also resulted in the cancellation of many high-profile projects, such as the Perfect Dark reboot, Rare’s Everwild, ZeniMax Online’s Project Blackbird, and Avalanche Studios’ Contraband. In response to the report, an Xbox spokesperson stated that “success doesn’t look the same across every project or priority,” pretty much acknowledging the variable nature of gaming projects but offering little on the margin mandate. Critics, including former Xbox executives, have pointed to Game Pass’s “weird inner tensions,” where subscriber growth often comes at the direct expense of retail revenue, exacerbating the profit squeeze. To meet revenue goals, Microsoft bumped up the price of Game Pass Ultimate in recent months, though this move has drawn widespread backlash from subscribers, resulting in mass cancellations.

Title: How XRP’s renewed role is driving crypto-fiat settlement and innovation worldwide

Ripple's XRP Ledger emerges as a cornerstone for blockchain payments, boasting compliance and institutional integration in major markets Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. For nearly a decade, XRP has been the underdog of the digital-asset world, overshadowed by Bitcoin’s narrative dominance, Ethereum’s developer gravity, and Solana’s speed headlines. Yet while most of the market debated ETFs and exchange listings, XRP’s core network, the XRP Ledger (XRPL), kept quietly evolving in the background. It is now re-emerging as an infrastructure layer blockchain network that powers real-world payments, stablecoins, and the early wave of tokenized assets. Ripple’s long regulatory standoff ended in August 2025, closing a chapter that defined much of XRP’s last decade. A US court confirmed that XRP’s retail sales are not securities, while Ripple paid a $125 million civil penalty to settle institutional violations. With both sides dropping appeals, the decision gave Ripple the legal certainty it lacked for so many years. That clarity has allowed Ripple to secure over 40 US money-transmitter licenses, including New York, Texas, and California, granting it a nationwide footprint for crypto-fiat settlement. The effect has been immediate as XRP could finally integrate with regulated payment partners, which is something few US-linked blockchains can do. Behind those regulatory wins, the XRP Ledger itself began to show new life. Transactions tied to payment and treasury activity have risen sharply, reflecting renewed interest from financial institutions that once kept their distance. In regions like Africa and Southeast Asia, where stablecoins have become the default rail for remittances, XRPL is now positioning itself as a compliance-ready alternative to Tron and other permissionless networks. One clear example of this real-world comeback is the level of institutional adoption the blockchain enjoys globally. In September, SBI Group and Tobu Top Tours reportedly unveiled plans to issue prepaid travel tokens on the XRPL in Japan. Speaking on the importance of the move, Ripple’s Tatsuya Kohrogi noted: “This is significant as the market in Japan for prepaid payment instruments is $200 billion annually. The tokens will circulate in regional economic zones, from tourist hotspots to sports communities, driving local spending and digital innovation.” According to the Nikkei report, each token functions like a digital prepaid card, redeemable at local stores and tourism hubs. Users can top up with yen, spend instantly, and cash out without intermediaries. For a market where prepaid instruments already handle about $200 billion a year, moving those flows to XRPL represents one of the largest blockchain integrations attempted in a major economy. Essentially, the goal isn’t crypto speculation; it’s infrastructure modernization. By building on XRPL’s low-fee, high-throughput ledger, Japan is testing how digital tokens can drive cashless tourism and local commerce while fully complying with financial regulations. Another project, from Webus International, pushes XRP’s utility even further. The Singapore-based company is developing a tokenized travel-rewards exchange using XRPL’s stablecoin framework to link airline miles, hotel points, and retail loyalty credits. This market is worth nearly $100 billion worldwide. Webus plans to turn those isolated reward systems into transferable digital assets. Tokenizing balances lets consumers swap or redeem them across brands in real time, unlocking liquidity that loyalty programs have historically trapped. This also presents a subtle example of XRP’s renewed role in connecting previously closed financial systems without breaking compliance. Another clear evidence of XRPL’s growth is its growing footprint across the stablecoin and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization markets. Ripple, through its RLUSD stablecoin, is competing directly in the over $300 billion stablecoin market. While the RLUSD’s $898 million market capitalization pales in comparison to the billions of Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC, the digital asset has gained significant institutional usage. For context, crypto exchange Bullish recently disclosed that it used the stablecoin asset and others to settle its $1.15 billion IPO proceeds. This can be linked to RLUSD’s unique design, which prioritizes strict KYC and AML standards. Moreover, Ripple’s recent acquisition of firms like Hidden Road and Rail provides RLUSD an advantage over others, ensuring its reserves and distribution stay inside licensed channels. The compliance angle also differentiates XRPL from rival blockchain networks like Tron and Solana by embedding regulation into the network. Earlier this month, XRPL introduced the Multi-Purpose Token (MPT) Standard, which allows digital asset issuers to limit transfers to verified holders through decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials. That means every compliant stablecoin or tokenized asset can enforce regulatory controls directly at the protocol level, and no third-party filter is required. Martin Hiesboeck, the Head of Research at Uphold, said: “The MPT standard strategically positions the XRPL as the leading secure and compliant institutional blockchain for the future of tokenized finance.” This architecture is now attracting a mix of stablecoin issuers and financial institutions. Stablecoins like Circle’s USDC, EURØP, USDB, and XSGD all added XRPL support in 2025, signaling confidence in the network’s scalability and compliance-ready tools. Meanwhile, that vision extends well beyond stablecoins. Ripple’s roadmap positions XRPL as a base layer for RWA tokenization, which involves everything from US Treasuries to commercial credit products. This has already seen significant adoption from global authorities like Dubai and major financial institutions like Guggenheim and BlackRock. As a result, the blockchain network now ranks among the top 10 chains for RWA tokenization, handling more than $360 million in assets. Considering this level of adoption, crypto researcher Rob Cunningham concluded: “In a conservative “base case” [XRPL is] a serious corridor player and RWA registry/settlement layer; On the upside, it’s a GO-TO ledger for Stablecoin-settled cross-border Treasury and high-grade RWA settlement with MULT-TRILLION ANNUAL THROUGHPUT by 2030.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Restricting Capital Investment Is A Losing Energy Strategy

ByWayne Winegarden, Contributor. The U.S. energy grid stands at a crossroads. It is facing an unprecedented rise in electricity demand driven in no small part by the growth of artificial intelligence and high-tech manufacturing. Simultaneously, supply is being curtailed by growing power plant retirements. It doesn’t take an advanced degree in economics to foresee the consequences. Policy makers are scrambling for answers before the inevitable power shortages and skyrocketing prices kick in. But for every potential solution that would ease the grid’s strain – keeping plants online, expediting permitting reviews and cutting bureaucratic red tape – policy actions are being taken that would damage energy industries’ ability to attract and utilize capital investment. Last year, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) considered and then held off on changing its long standing blanket authorization policy for investment firms. The current rule requires investment firms to receive FERC approval for purchasing a utility company’s securities only when acquiring more than $10 million worth. The commission was contemplating whether this so-called blanket authorization level is too generous. Of particular concern were investment managers’ passive investment strategies – think index funds – that require these investors to continue allocate a set percentage of their assets into utilities and energy companies. Increasing the stringency of the blanket authorization would have adversely impacted the U.S. energy industry. At the time, I warned that creating “additional investment barriers” would hurt utilities’ ability “to raise the necessary capital,” hindering their ability to “expand capacity and improve the current energy infrastructure.” Thankfully the FERC agreed. As then-FERC Chairman Mark Christie wrote, while BlackRock’s environmental advocacy raises concerns, “public utilities face already large and still growing capital needs, including to fund investment in greatly needed utility assets, such as power generation.” Given these capital needs, and BlackRock’s pledge “not to use its holdings to influence utility management,” extending BlackRock’s blanket authorization will help ensure the utility sector has access to the resources it needs to continue expanding the grid’s capacity Having just dodged that bullet, a new threat to increased energy investment threatens to do the same – a lawsuit led by the Attorney General of Texas. The lawsuit alleges Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street conspired to artificially depress the coal market through anti-competitive practices. The lawsuit is a response to these investment manager’s investments in coal companies given their public support and past membership in these same environmental organizations, which are promoting policies that are detrimental to the coal industry. As I have previously argued, the asset manager’s support of these environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies is troubling and creates significant conflicts of interest between the asset managers fiduciary responsibilities and their ESG commitments. However, in practice, the AG actions will simply restrict the coal industry’s ability to raise capital – clearly contradicting the AG’s stated purpose. As the FERC decision emphasizes, prioritizing the need for an efficient allocation of capital is essential if the U.S. grid is going to deliver Americans cheap and plentiful electricity. The lawsuit also fails to account for fundamental market changes created by the fracking revolution. This market-driven innovation increased the supply – and subsequently drove down the costs – of natural gas. Relatively cheaper and lower-emission natural gas radically changed the economics of electricity generation. It is mostly thanks to relatively cheaper natural gas that coal operations have decreased across the country. In 2005, coal was the largest source for electricity, generating about 50 percent of the nation’s electricity. Natural gas generated roughly 19 percent. Over the latest 12 months, natural gas accounted for 42 percent of total generation while coal accounted for a mere 16 percent; their shares of electricity generation have swapped. This reversal of generation share was fostered by over 100 coal-fired plants that were converted to, or replaced by, natural gas-fired plants between 2011 and 2019. As the energy generation mix shifted towards natural gas and other technologies, coal’s downstream consumption and production subsequently declined. Although Attorney General Paxton claims to be protecting the coal industry, if the lawsuit is successful these investment firms would likely be forced to divest their holdings in the coal companies listed in the suit. This forced liquidation will deny the coal industry access to a significant source of capital. According to an analysis by the American Council for Capital Formation’s chief economist, the forced divestments would deny the collective coal industry more than $17.5 billion in capital. This downstream effect stands in stark contrast to the needs of the energy sector, which needs significantly more capital investment to keep up with our energy infrastructure. Ultimately addressing the expected growth in electricity demand will require more capital investment in energy production, transportation, and infrastructure. Cutting off investment sources – whether through FERC rule making or AG lawsuits – increases the likelihood of future blackouts and higher costs for consumers. If the goal is to promote widespread prosperity, such actions are simply the wrong policy path.

Title: The Struggle for the Future of the New York Democratic Party

© THE INTERCEPT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED In the final days of the NYC mayoral race, the Democratic Party faces a choice between a future defined by Zohran Mamdani or Andrew Cuomo. New York City is on the cusp of an election in which what once looked impossible has begun to seem inevitable. Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist member of the New York state Assembly, is heavily favored to beat Andrew Cuomo, New York’s onetime Democratic governor and a former icon of the party establishment, in a race for mayor that has become among the most-watched in the nation. Cuomo and Mamdani articulate two vastly different visions for New York City — and where the Democratic Party is going overall. This week on The Intercept Briefing, Akela Lacy speaks to people hoping to see each of those two visions fulfilled. “Traditionally, we’ve thought about politics as left, right, and center,” says Alyssa Cass, a Democratic strategist who has worked on local and national campaigns. “Zohran offered a message that was less about ideology and more about disrupting a failed status quo that is working for almost no one.” Cass, who worked on Andrew Yang’s mayoral campaign in 2021, isn’t working for Mamdani but says his candidacy indicates “that Democrats can win when we have ideas.” In the view of Jim Walden, a former mayoral candidate who is now backing Cuomo, those ideas are “dangerous and radical policies.” He says Mamdani’s popularity is an indication that “there’s going to be a flirtation with socialism and maybe some populist push” among Democrats. But “ultimately,” Walden says, “the party will come back closer to the center.” Chi Ossé, a City Council member who endorsed Mamdani, sees Mamdani’s success as evidence of the opposite. “We could have gone back to or continued this trend of electing centrist, moderate Democrats,” Ossé says. Instead, he thinks that New Yorkers want “someone who ran as a loud and proud democratic socialist who has always fought on the left.” While New York City is preparing for a general election, Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa is unlikely to win — turning the race almost into a second Democratic primary. “The party is now confronted with a choice,” says Lacy, “between a nominee who has become the new face of generational change in politics and a former governor fighting for his political comeback. The results could reveal where the party’s headed in next year’s midterms and beyond.” Listen to the full conversation of The Intercept Briefing on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you listen. Akela Lacy: Welcome to The Intercept Briefing. I’m Akela Lacy. There’s less than two weeks left before New Yorkers elect their next mayor. The race has drawn national attention — both from President Donald Trump and from observers who see it as a reckoning over the future of the Democratic Party. PIX11 News: Zohran Mamdani continues to hold an insurmountable lead over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the race for New York City mayor, as long as Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa stays in it. AL: Even though New York Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani decisively won the Democratic primary in June, the general election has pretty much boiled down to a contest between two candidates trying to claim the Democratic mantle. There’s Mamdani — the party’s nominee — and former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who resigned in 2021 amid sexual harassment allegations that he now denies and has been chasing the mayoralty as his political comeback. Since he lost the primary, Cuomo’s running on an independent ballot line called “Fight and Deliver,” but he’s still pitching himself as a Democrat. There’s also Curtis Sliwa — the founder of the Guardian Angels, Republican candidate, and a thorn in the side of those who want him out of the race to clear a lane on the right for Cuomo. That’s the position of billionaires like John Catsimatidis and Bill Ackman, who have been pushing to get Sliwa out. Curtis Sliwa: Come on Ackman, stay in your lane. Does he know anything about politics? No. Does he live in New York City? No. He lives in Chappaqua, the whitest suburb of America, where even the lawn jockeys are white. AL: It’s also the position of President Trump. Donald Trump: We don’t need a communist in this country. But if we have one, I’m going to be watching over him very carefully, on behalf of the nation. AL: The Trump administration already got its wish when current New York City Mayor Eric Adams dropped out of the race last month, and the conventional wisdom was that many Adams supporters would flock to Cuomo. But after a federal corruption indictment that disappeared when Trump swept into office — remember that? — Adams’s support was already plummeting. And with Sliwa unlikely to become mayor himself, the race is really seen as a contest between Mamdani and Cuomo. Now, Mamdani and Cuomo represent two possible paths the Democratic Party could take: a democratic socialist who was once deemed too far to the left to pull off a primary and is now heavily favored to win the general versus a former Democratic governor who can count the Republican president in his camp. What does the saga say about the state of Democratic politics across the nation? That question is facing Democrats at a time when the national party is still finding itself after a crushing loss that returned Donald Trump to the White House. Two years before that, a humiliating performance in the 2022 midterms threw the New York state Democratic Party into crisis, when Democrats in the state lost congressional seats and helped hand Republicans control of the House of Representatives. In the state that gave us both insurgent leader Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the two top Democrats in Congress — Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries — the party is now confronted with a choice between a nominee who has become the new face of generational change in politics and a former governor fighting for his political comeback. The results could reveal where the party’s headed in next year’s midterms and beyond. So today, we’re going to talk to people hoping to see each of those two visions fulfilled. First, we’ll hear from a City Council member backing Mamdani and a Democratic strategist who’s been following the race but isn’t working for any campaign. And after the break, we’ll hear from a former mayoral candidate who dropped out and endorsed Cuomo, saying he doesn’t want to see the Democratic Party veer toward socialism. Joining me now is Chi Ossé. He’s the Council Member for New York City’s 36th District. He endorsed Mamdani in April. Welcome to the show, Council Member Ossé. Chi Ossé: Thank you so much for having me on. AL: Also joining us is Alyssa Cass, a Democratic media strategist based in New York City and partner at Slingshot Strategies. She served as an adviser to top elected officials, candidates, and causes at the national, state, and local levels. Welcome to the show, Alyssa. Alyssa Cass: Hi. It is so good to be here. AL: We’re speaking on Wednesday, October 22nd. [Editor’s note: On October 24, Politico reported that Rep. Hakeem Jeffries will be endorsing Zohran Mamdani.] And just a note, we are not endorsing any candidate on this podcast, and we’re focusing on the pressures building both locally and nationally on the Democratic party. To start, especially for our listeners outside of New York, why has Mamdani’s campaign become a national story? You have Fox News running wall-to-wall coverage, Trump calling to deport him — what exactly is bringing so much national attention to this race? Chi, we’ll start with you. CO: Absolutely. Well, first and foremost, I believe that it’s one of the biggest races that we’re seeing post-November of 2024. And after Republicans secured levels within Congress as well as the presidency, people are looking at the Democratic Party and seeing how we respond to that especially within the New York City mayoral race. You know, we could have gone two ways. We could have gone back to or continued this trend of electing centrist, moderate Democrats — or we could have gone with Zohran Mamdani, someone who ran as a loud and proud democratic socialist who has always fought on the left, who speaks up about Palestinian rights and sovereignty. And this race showed that the party is accepting and willing to move to the left. Zohran ran a very creative, loud race that was centered around affordability and did so without being tied to the financial institutions and entities that usually elect our mayors here within New York City. And made a lot of noise during the campaign, galvanized a lot of people, and made some history in terms of how the campaign was run. So with all of that, it made this a historic race, one that has caught the ears of many and has skyrocketed Zohran into the place where he is today. AL: Alyssa, I want to bring you in. I mean, you worked on the 2021 mayoral race, you’ve worked on national races. What’s your perspective on what is making this resonate with people outside of New York or have the potential ramifications that go beyond the city? AC: I think about that question in kind of two primary buckets. The first is, why is this so interesting? One is, I think that it offers us a view of politics and the contours of politics that’s actually more realistic or how actual people think about it. Traditionally, we’ve thought about politics as left, right, and center. And I think that the major fault line in politics now, or how people think about it, is that the status quo is not working for almost anyone. “He fundamentally reconstituted the electorate. … He was able to put together a coalition of, frankly, almost everyone, just other than the very wealthy.” And if we don’t reform the status quo, we are going to break it. And Zohran offered a message that was less about ideology and more about disrupting a failed status quo that is working for almost no one. And that approach to the race offers Democrats a really powerful path forward. And as we think about how do we reconstitute winning coalitions — and that’s something I think has been a little under appreciated about Zohran’s win — he fundamentally reconstituted the electorate. If you live in New York City — if you are working class, middle class, or even upper middle class — New York City is not working for you. If you are anyone who interacts with public services on a daily basis, if you’re sending your kid to public school, if you’re taking the bus, if you’re riding the subway, New York City life is really like — hard. AL: You can say the f-word, it’s OK. AC: It’s really fucking hard. And he was able to put together a coalition of, frankly, almost everyone, just other than the very wealthy. And frankly offer an optimistic view of politics that brought us together about what unites us: that no one’s having an easy time. Obviously there are different degrees to that, but these parallel crises of affordability for almost every American tapping into that is the path forward for anyone who wants to win. And I think that those two reasons: of one, seeing the electorate not in these ideological terms that I think mostly people like us think about, but normal people don’t, and the ability to rebuild a democratic coalition, is exactly what people are talking about, and it’s not done through, like, big focus groups about what men are thinking or what words we’re saying, but how to build a coalition of people for whom the status quo isn’t working, which is almost everyone. AL: We’re speaking on the morning after a shocking immigration raid in Manhattan’s Chinatown where federal agents arrested multiple people. New York has sanctuary city laws that forbid cops and other local officials from coordinating with federal immigration enforcement. And as of this recording, Mayor Eric Adams and the NYPD say the city had nothing to do with the raid. Both Cuomo and Mamdani have put out statements condemning the raid. But more specifically in a moment like this, how should a New York City mayor respond? Chi, start with you. CO: Absolutely. Well, I don’t believe a word that comes out of Eric Adams’s mouth. And he is an accomplice if not a lapdog to Donald Trump. So in terms of the statements that were shared, I do not believe him. A mayor, and hopefully the next mayor, will uphold our sanctuary laws and also work with the NYPD and use his authority to make sure that all people who live here in New York City are protected regardless of their immigration status when it comes to federal agents infringing on the rights of the land here in New York. AC: Yeah, I think something we saw last night, but we’ve seen kind of throughout the past few months, are reminders of, is that Donald Trump is coming for New York City regardless. And what New Yorkers want is not someone who is promising to work with Trump, or can manage Trump, or who has a history of negotiating with Trump. That we’re actually seeing that like that doesn’t matter. “What New Yorkers want is not someone who is promising to work with Trump, or can manage Trump, or who has a history of negotiating with Trump.” We really need someone who is principled, incredibly disciplined in saying, “Donald Trump, hands off New York.” And we’ve actually seen this dynamic, I think, play out in a really interesting way throughout this general election. I think that you saw, at the end of the primary, you saw Cuomo beginning to try to socialize with New Yorkers. “If Donald Trump’s coming after New York, you want someone who can give him a call and talk him down.” We’re seeing that like that’s not possible, was never possible. There was so much coverage about New York City’s shift to the right, the increase in New York City voters who voted for Trump. They were voting for Trump, I think what we’re seeing now is not because they wanted ICE raids that destroy communities, destroy our economies, and rip our New York City neighbors from their schools and their homes — they wanted someone who was listening. So the best way to actually fight Trump and to rebuild a Democratic Party is not through compromise, but really through a pursuit of our principles and our values. AL: And I want to draw this out to the national level too, because this is extremely parallel with the criticisms, you know, facing national Democrats — Chuck Schumer, et cetera, Hakeem Jeffries in Congress — and this idea that at the beginning of Trump’s term, national Democrats really were sitting back and saying, “Is there a world in which we can play nice with Trump and have some leverage, some negotiating, leverage some power? Something to bring to the table.” And it quickly became obvious that that wasn’t going to work. But also that was extremely infuriating to voters. And I think that’s why you’re seeing Democrats pivot with this shutdown strategy. Whereas back in March, they were saying, let’s try to work with Republicans where we can. But I think what you’re saying, Alyssa, is that that is not something that voters have the patience for anymore. And I think that’s not just a New York City thing, that’s a national thing. AC: Yeah. I think part of why Donald Trump won or why you’ve seen Democrats struggle is that when the status quo isn’t working, bad ideas beat no ideas. And we’ve often been the party and had candidates that are “no ideas.” And what we are seeing is that Democrats can win when we have ideas. Zohran is a case study of that. So when trying to manage or handle Trump, the idea isn’t to go along or get along. That’s a “no idea.” “When the status quo isn’t working, bad ideas beat no ideas. … What we are seeing is that Democrats can win when we have ideas. Zohran is a case study of that.” We need new ideas and preparedness. I think one of the biggest tasks of the future mayor is getting prepared for an escalation in the assault on New York City. We know he’s coming. I think we have every reason to expect National Guard or federal troops and making sure we’re prepared, right? Making sure we are setting the rules of the road with NYPD and other agencies and cooperating with that sort of incursion. And that will be like day one after the general election, the real work of the mayor-elect. AL: Chi, do you want to add anything on the tail end of that? CO: I absolutely agree with Alyssa’s point. I also do want to note that on the topic of national Democrats and them wanting to work with Trump and at least see if there’s a middle ground — Trump doesn’t give a fuck, right? And his whole modem operandi is to embarrass Democrats and has been doing so both with Chuck and Hakeem. In addition to that, our leadership in the Democratic Party somewhat ushered this type of behavior in. Back when Mahmoud Khalil was disappeared right here in the city, both of those individuals were very quiet, if not timid, on making statements and being very loud about their statements in the disappearing of people and disappearing of Mahmoud Khalil. They kind of set the precedent for this to happen, especially here in this city. So to have a mayor-elect and future mayor who’s going to speak truth to power and stand on business when it comes to how evil ICE is, right? And call-out how un-American and Gestapo-like that ICE is, is going to be something that I believe will resound with New Yorkers. And that New Yorkers want to see their elected officials, their mayor, their Democrats fighting for, right? AL: So jumping back in time a little bit, shortly after the primary, there was a ton of reporting on how New York’s wealthiest business leaders were working to defeat Mamdani, including offering to help Adams find a private sector job if he dropped out. One of the city’s biggest real estate developers was floated as an option at one point. But last week, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he would support Mamdani if he won. What’s your reaction to that? If Mamdani wins, Alyssa, what sorts of roadblocks can he expect from the city’s elite? AC: Mamdani’s done a lot of work to assuage and do a charm campaign with the business community. AL: Right. AC: Not because he’s going to betray his agenda, but because it’s a savvy observation that they’re actually pretty easy to pacify, right? And is avoiding, I think, some of the missteps that Bill de Blasio did. Bill de Blasio got pretty beat up immediately by the business community. But the business community is actually easy to charm, right? The thing that they care about the most, that most materially impacts them — like, let’s say raising taxes — a mayor of New York City actually doesn’t have much, doesn’t have any control over. So when it comes to the business community, I think that a little bit of engaging, showing that you’ll pick up their calls — which Bill de Blasio was unwilling to do — goes a long way. And that ultimately, the mayor of New York City is not materially impacting these people who are really out for themselves. And that actually creates an environment where [it’s] easy to give them a little face-time and then I think they shut up. AL: To your point, you said he’s meeting with these people not because he is going to betray his agenda, but that is what some people are concerned about. AC: I think you want to like — Listen, being mayor is really fucking hard, and you have a very limited runway before everyone is going to start shitting on you and be very critical. And it’s hard to implement your agenda. Clearing the decks from a chorus of haters or trying to lessen them a bit is not kowtowing. It’s just paving the way for an easier time, because there are going to be actual crises to deal with. So I think it’s clearing a smoother runway for when you’re actually sworn in. And there’s so much out of your control — like there could be a snowstorm that becomes a disaster — that you want to clear the decks, shut up the haters by dishing out a little sugar. That’s savvy, not being compromised. AL: I want to put this to both of you. How can we expect those same people to react to a Cuomo win? Chi, we’ll start with you. CO: The business people? AL: Yeah. And you know, the elite of of New York, the people who, you know, originally were partnering with Bill Ackman to try to figure out how to— CO: Yeah. I mean, I think they want Cuomo to win, obviously. I do believe that a majority of the elite want Cuomo to win. I think it’s more about what Zohran means for politics, right? He was able to win without the backing and being tethered again to these financial institutions. And many of these elite folks want elected officials that they can control. And if someone can win as mayor of New York City without being tethered to their power, what could that mean for city council, state Assembly, state Senate, and even some of our congressional seats? “If someone can win as mayor of New York City without being tethered to their power, what could that mean for city council, state Assembly, state Senate, and even some of our congressional seats?” AC: Yeah. And like, here’s my thing through all of this, when Bill Ackman throws a temper tantrum, or John Catsimatidis, which I think that’s the right pronunciation, throws a temper tantrum, I think people see that and it moves people toward Zohran. Like, wasn’t the whole point of Zohran’s election is that people are sick and tired of people like Bill Ackman paying little in taxes and having a massive apartment and having the influence that they do, right? Like that status quo that these people are screaming about that Zohran is going to disrupt is the very thing people don’t like. So yeah, I’m sure they’re going to have a meltdown. And they are welcome to move to Boca, and we will be thrilled to convert their brownstones and mega penthouses into multifamily dwellings to further make a dent in our housing crisis. AL: Going back to Cuomo. I know that some members, some city council members, were stripped from their roles in budget negotiations after backing Cuomo. Chi, what is the mood toward Cuomo among city councilors right now? CO: There’s a higher definite chance that Zohran becomes the next mayor, and regardless of where people fall within that politically ideological spectrum, I think people do want to be on good terms with the mayor, right? So I do think that there has been a vast distancing from Andrew Cuomo. AC: And the councilman makes a great point. And I think that is revealing of a bigger dynamic that I think is worth pointing out. People who are really watching New York politics are like, this is not like a real race, right? It is being treated as a very competitive general election for reasons that are divorced from the mechanics and the central dynamics of the race. Zohran had a winning message and a winning coalition, and Andrew Cuomo did not. None of those dynamics have changed. And you see the rest of the political class in New York very much understanding that. And we are thrilled for the attention and continue to go along with the ruse that Andrew Cuomo would like us to believe that this is still a competitive election and that he somehow has a path, but he does not. “We are thrilled for the attention and continue to go along with the ruse that Andrew Cuomo would like us to believe that this is still a competitive election and that he somehow has a path, but he does not.” AL: So far, only five Democrats representing New York City in Congress have endorsed Mamdani, the party’s nominee: Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Nydia Velázquez, who both endorsed him before he won the primary; Adriano Espaillat, Jerry Nadler, and Yvette Clarke, who endorsed him after he won. Gov. Kathy Hochul and Attorney General Letitia James got on board. Notably absent are Democrats’ top two leaders in Congress — Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both of whom have addressed this in the last week or so and said they are still planning to weigh in. [Editor’s note: On October 24, Politico reported that Rep. Hakeem Jeffries will be endorsing Zohran Mamdani.] Many other Democrats have backed Cuomo, others whose candidates lost in the primary haven’t endorsed anyone else. What’s happening here? Are there two Democratic Parties? AC: So what is happening here is that the leaders, the elected leaders of the Democratic Party look so fucking stupid, I’m sorry. Honestly, it would’ve been better for them to just like, never endorse him and say like, “I’m just not going to make an endorsement in this race. I didn’t in the primary,” and like, move the fuck on. This is really the worst of both worlds. And just the message it sends. You hear from both of those leaders that we are a big-tent party, but apparently not so big if you have certain concerns about certain issues. The biggest discomfort with Zohran seems to be around foreign policy issues that have nothing to do with fucking New York City and also are so out of the mainstream of where the median Democratic voter is in New York City or beyond, it further reveals that there is a gap between the people who are calling all of the shots and regular voters. It only serves to put them, to make them seem more out of touch and more beholden not to rank-and-file Democrats but something else. AL: Chi, do you want to add anything? CO: Sure, yeah. Their donors won’t let them. AL: Who? Which donors? Who are we talking about? CO: All of them. AL: Can you say more? CO: Yeah. Probably BlackRock, the largest landlord in this country, probably AIPAC. Yeah, I think those donors will not let them endorse Zohran Mamdani for mayor. AC: Those sorts of donors give way more money at this point to the Republican Party and to Republican elected officials. Like, we are getting very little out of this. It shows a very — a view of politics and where to get money that is really out of date. CO: Yeah. It’s the same donors that don’t let them fight against Donald Trump, right? AL: Alyssa, you brought up the foreign policy thing, and Chi, you’re mentioning AIPAC too. Mamdani has also faced criticism from his left and much on his right, particularly on this Israel–Gaza issue. Last week, he was asked during the mayoral debate about the ongoing saga around this phrase Mamdani himself has never used — “globalize the intifada” — but which many Democrats and pro-Israel critics have urged him to denounce. This is a phrase that many pro-Palestine advocates say simply calls for the end of the Israeli occupation – “intifada” is an Arabic word meaning uprising or resistance. But many pro-Israel Mamdani critics have turned it into a political cudgel to spread this fear that Mamdani won’t keep Jewish New Yorkers safe. I wrote about this last week, and you can find the story at The Intercept. Mamdani has drawn criticism for similar comments, including that he threw the movement for Palestine under the bus or that he’s a Zionist. Is there a “right” way for Dems to play this? Chi, I’ll start with you. CO: I don’t necessarily see it as a right way for Democrats to play this. I think Mamdani has 38 percent of support from the Jewish vote to Andrew Cuomo’s 42 percent. That’s basically equally matched. I believe for this issue, this is something that Jewish voters are definitely taking a look at, and a sizable amount support Mamdani and his efforts. AL: Alyssa, is there a right way for Democrats to play this issue? AC: So it seems to me that his approach of not ever endorsing or supporting the flattening of Gaza was the right approach. This is an issue where you will never please everyone, but the majority of Jewish Democratic voters believe there there’s a genocide that’s been happening in the Middle East. AL: Right. “What is popular and what is morally righteous are the same position right now.” AC: Are uncomfortable with the current no-strings-attached relationship with a radical right-wing Israeli government. And to me, when you’re looking at where’s the right place to be, I’m not sure it’s that hard. Because what is popular and what is morally righteous are the same position right now. AL: I’m going to switch gears a little bit and go back to early this year, January, February. It’s cold out. The mayoral race is just beginning. Everyone’s wondering if Eric Adams will even run again because he’s still under indictment. There are whispers about Cuomo, the assumption is that if he does jump in, everyone else might as well pack it up and go home. Why was he considered such a shoe-in? CO: Cuomo did a really good job at creating this paper tiger effect on the political establishment. And it was very unclear as to what was going to happen within this mayoral race, especially with the amount of candidates that were jumping in and was able to secure some union endorsements from the get-go. There is this notion within our prior understanding of the New York City electorate, that a lot of voters who turn out in these elections — usual voters who turn out in these elections — will vote for the name that they know. And, you know, Andrew Cuomo was a name for older Black voters and Latino voters and outer borough voters, which was a strategy that Eric Adams used to win in 2021. So it created this effect that really galvanized a lot of the New York City press corp as well, right, political press corp to aid in Cuomo’s efforts of making him seem as unstoppable as he appeared. What was not taken into account was — and frankly could not be taken into account — was the movement that Zohran and New York City DSA were able to put together. It energized thousands, tens of thousands of new voters, folks who usually don’t come out and vote in New York City mayoral races. AC: Actually, when I look back, Zohran ran the most big-D Democratic campaign of any of the candidates in the primary. While many of us political consultants had our heads up our own asses, myself included, feeling very fearful, seeing the red wave that had happened in New York City and thinking — We forgot that this is a deeply Democratic town, and a liberal or progressive one at that. “We forgot that this is a deeply Democratic town, and a liberal or progressive one at that.” While the rest of the field was modulating on public safety or bringing in a more moderate tone to everything those campaigns were doing, Zohran ran a proud Democratic campaign, about making this city work for New Yorkers that was definitely democratic and the best sense of what being a classic Democrat was. And also understood — like they did something so well, but it was a very basic premise — that talking all of the time about the thing that people are thinking about and are keeping [them] up at night and are telling people is their number one concern is smart. The basic concept was not rocket science. And everyone else overcomplicating shit, created a real pathway for an insurgent candidate like Mamdani. AL: Thank you Council Member Chi Ossé and Democratic strategist Alyssa Cass, we really appreciate you joining us on the Intercept Briefing. CO: Thank you so much for having us. AC: Thank you. Original reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept? By signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. [Break] AL: We’re continuing the conversation about how the New York City mayoral race is shaping the future of the Democratic Party with Attorney Jim Walden. He’s endorsing Andrew Cuomo. Walden was running his own independent bid until early September, when he dropped out. His name will still be on the ballot in November — but he says he doesn’t want it there. Jim, welcome to The Intercept Briefing. Jim Walden: Thank you Akela. Thanks for having me. AL: We’re speaking to Jim on Thursday morning So we have been talking about the future of the Democratic Party. There’s been a lot of discussion in this past year since Kamala Harris lost the presidential election about a desire for a fresh start in the party. How does Cuomo fit into that future? JW: To the extent that the future of the Democratic [Party] as there’s a socialist future in there, I don’t think that Andrew Cuomo would ever be pushed that far. At the end of the day, he is a free market guy. He believes in the private sector. He believes that it’s critical for building, which is so important to the future of New York City. And so I think that it’ll be super interesting from the perspective of someone who’s been a long time independent to see across the country and in particular in New York, where the party goes. My guess is that there’s going to be a flirtation with socialism and maybe some populist push but that ultimately the party will come back closer to the center. AL: What are the policies that he’s running on right now that you see as emblematic of his potential to step into this leadership role at a critical moment in Democratic politics? JW: Housing in New York City, I can’t stress this enough, is central to solving the affordability crisis. And just today there was a number of press reports that came out that talked about the fact that the market for rent-stabilized housing, which represents about a million units across the city, that landlords are in financial distress and 1 in 5 buildings is underwater and they’re delaying things like repairs. And that is having a very, very significant impact on particularly Black and brown tenants who make up a significant portion of the rent-stabilized portfolio. “Andrew Cuomo is someone that has very close relationships with developers. He’s taken a lot of flack for that.” So Andrew Cuomo is someone that has very close relationships with developers. He’s taken a lot of flack for that. But you know, when you have a fire, you’re calling firefighters. When you have a criminal running down the street, you call the cops. We have a housing crisis that if we can’t solve it, it’s going to have collateral consequences across our economy. AL: So when you were running for mayor, you pitched yourself as the business community candidate, a reasonable moderate who knows how to work with the city’s elites and navigate the complexities of city government. And also as an outsider, who was someone who wasn’t a technocrat, someone who could appeal to some of the frustrations I think that people have had with the Democratic Party. What do you say to critics who might argue that the city’s billionaires are the people who most want Cuomo to win, and that this is a strategy to maintain the status quo? JW: That is an incredibly important question. And let me just double down in a show of self-awareness. I’ve said quite clearly that Andrew Cuomo getting into the race was one of the reasons that I decided to run because I thought that we needed change and we needed new leadership. So I’m not running away from any of my prior positions. Unfortunately, we have the candidates that we have, and I’ve said as clearly as I can that I think that they are all challenged candidates for different reasons, whether it’s experience, whether or not prior scandals and the like, but it was an uncomfortable choice that I had to make. But I made that choice, Akela, a long time ago. But it is actually really surprising to me that [Mamdani] has taken off the way that he has. And as I saw him ascend, I was actually one of the first people that predicted— I had run a whole Monte Carlo simulation before the Democratic primary in four of the 10 simulations, Mamdani won, and those were predictably accurate. And as I saw him rise, I saw him in some ways embrace more what I think are, you know, dangerous and radical policies. “They are all challenged candidates for different reasons, whether it’s experience, whether or not prior scandals and the like, but it was an uncomfortable choice that I had to make.” Akela Lacy: Yeah. So I want to go back to this idea of the status quo because — and I hear what you’re saying about your calculation both in jumping into the race and then removing yourself from the race because of the writing that you saw on the wall. But do you see Cuomo as a potential extension of that status quo? And if not, can you explain why not? Jim Walden: Status quo is, maybe we can sharpen that a little by saying that he’s an institutionalist, right? So I believe that it’s fair to say that, I’ll speak about me. I’m an institutionalist in the sense that for 23 years I’ve been bringing pro bono cases attacking city, state, and federal government for a lot of bad things that they’ve done to people. That doesn’t mean that I don’t support the institutions of democracy and our government. I do. And I believe that Andrew Cuomo is very much of the same ilk, although he may be more of an institutionalist because he’s been part of the governing elite, if you will. But at the same time I think that he will talk about changing the status quo, I think he’s going to change the status to quote completely when it comes to housing. I know for sure that his plan is — and again, to be clear, I’m not in the Cuomo campaign. I did this as a matter of my own personal politics and my own belief in what was the best for the city. I know that he’s going to do everything he could possibly do to start building things right away. And that’s what we need. I mean, if you think about the most recent data on housing, right? 2024 is the most complete picture that we have. Mayor Adams, to his credit, oversaw the building of about 25,000 rent-stabilized apartments. That’s great. That’s that’s a big bump from where we’ve been. The problem is that we lost 11,000 of older units that were being warehoused. And so 25,000 come on, 11,000 go off. We need somewhere between, depending on whose estimate you look at — My best estimate was 50,000 rent-stabilized units a year. Zohran Mamdani plan is only going to build 20,000 rent-stabilized apartments a year if it works. That’s something where I do trust Cuomo. AL: We have some breaking news as we’re speaking. New York City Mayor Eric Adams is endorsing Cuomo for mayor after joining him courtside at the Knicks game on Wednesday night. Can we get your reaction to that, Jim? JW: Yeah. So Adams endorsing Cuomo is really no surprise. You know, this kind of is a testament to again, all of the ways in which our political system is broken and in some ways dysfunctional. Eric Adams, whatever it was a month ago, said that Andrew Cuomo was a snake and a liar, and then they’re sitting at the Knicks game together, and then there’s an endorsement the next day. You know, I think that those sorts of things turn off people. They turn off voters. How can you have a positive reaction to that? “Those sorts of things turn off people. They turn off voters. How can you have a positive reaction to that?” But at the same time politics is politics, and at the end of the day it comes down to numbers. And with Cuomo and Sliwa in the race, Mamdani’s got a huge advantage. Just the math is the math. I mean, I’ve said this a million times and I don’t know how many people are listening to me on it. AL: You mentioned Adam doing this turn toward Cuomo after calling him a snake, but you had similar words for Cuomo in May. You described him as “a tired snake oil salesman, who’s on his last leg.” What is it about his policies that have made you change your mind? JW: So Cuomo while, I have deep, deep disagreements with him on a number of the things that have happened during the course of his career. He is a person that we need right now. Why? If you look at any projection — it doesn’t matter whether it’s inside the government or outside the government, unless some amazing, wonderful thing happens to the city — the minimum deficit that we’re going to have next year is $5 billion. And some of the estimates go up to something like nine, just next year. In the two years after that — again, unless there’s some sort of magic ointment that someone applies to our business community — the deficits are going to get much higher. And in that environment when we need so much, and we are already in a distressed situation with tax revenue, there’s going to have to be bold moves that pay the bills for all the things that we need to do. And Zohran Mamdani, he has said more times than I can count that he wants to dismantle or defund the police. And then he’s running on a platform that he says “I’m not trying to defund the police,” but he is trying to defund the police. And this is one of the things that’s so frustrating to see low-information voters bite on this hook. Which is, he’s saying he’s going to keep the current level of police the same. We are down — depending on whose estimate you want to look at — the range is somewhere between 5,000 and 8,000 cops. No one’s really looking at the rate at which senior officers and detectives are filing for early retirement. “ We need more cops. And he’s not being honest about the fact that he really is defunding the police by holding the current headcount.” And there hasn’t been an enormous push to recruit. I think that at the end of the day, at the end of the year, if we end up flat, I think we’ll be lucky. But we need more cops. And he’s not being honest about the fact that he really is defunding the police by holding the current headcount. And earlier when he was describing his community, his department of community safety, I was standing next to him at a full mayoral forum where he said he was going to fund that by taking $1 billion out of the NYPD overtime budget. I was standing right there. And then when he put the PRO plan out, maybe after getting some initial criticism and feedback, he claims that he’s going to pay for it by raising taxes, both corporate and individual. So I believe that he wants to defund the police, and I believe everything that he’s been saying for years about his perspective on NYPD, you know, he said he was going to apologize. He then pivoted and said, well, I’m going to do it privately with individual officers. I’m not going to issue a blanket apology. You know, I have a lot of cops who are friends and I can’t tell you the number of times, Akela, that cops have said to me, “Listen, if he’s going to be mayor and he’s going to change the CCRB, so the police commissioner has no power over choosing discipline for officers, I’m out of here.” So and those are two of the key reasons that cops are leaving the city is because the CCRB, it always was a broken agency. I had planned to get rid of it with something that was much more effective in terms of getting at the bad apples in NYPD and not victimizing cops that were trying to do their jobs and got into bad situations that they tried their best to control, but still had a complaint filed against them. So the CCRB, the extent to which they’re now being forced into overtime shifts that are akin to a indentured servitude at times, and lower starting salaries than is being competitive with other states outside of New York. That’s why we’re losing active-duty officers because it’s like, I don’t need this anymore. So that’s one example of a policy that I think is dangerous. AL: There’s more that I can talk about but we’re getting close to time. So, Jim Walden, thank you so much for joining us on the Intercept Briefing. Really appreciate your time.

What we’re seeing right now from Donald Trump is a full-on authoritarian takeover of the U.S. government. This is not hyperbole. Court orders are being ignored. MAGA loyalists have been put in charge of the military and federal law enforcement agencies. The Department of Government Efficiency has stripped Congress of its power of the purse. News outlets that challenge Trump have been banished or put under investigation. Yet far too many are still covering Trump’s assault on democracy like politics as usual, with flattering headlines describing Trump as “unconventional,” “testing the boundaries,” and “aggressively flexing power.” The Intercept has long covered authoritarian governments, billionaire oligarchs, and backsliding democracies around the world. We understand the challenge we face in Trump and the vital importance of press freedom in defending democracy.

Title: Watch These Intel Stock Price Levels After Chipmaker's Earnings Blow Past Expectations
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/watch-these-intel-stock-price-levels-after-chipmaker-earnings-blow-past-expectations-11836311
Time Published: 2025-10-24T15:20:53Z
Full Content:
Intel (INTC) shares rose Friday morning after the chipmaker swung to a profit that sailed past Wall Street expectations, signaling its closely watched turnaround plan is gaining traction. CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who took the helm in March and has refocused the company’s strategic direction, said the third-quarter results show Intel's "steady progress" in its turnaround, adding that demand for AI has created "attractive opportunities" across its portfolio. The stock was up 1.2% at $38.60 in recent trading, after surging above $41 early in the session to its highest level since April 2024. Coming into today's session, the stock had risen 90% so far this year, with the lion’s share of those gains coming in recent months as investors cheered multi-billion dollar investments from Nvidia (NVDA) and SoftBank (SFTBY), as well as the U.S. government’s 10% stake in the chipmaker. Below we analyze the technicals on Intel’s chart and identify important post-earnings price levels worth watching out for after the quarterly report. Intel shares have consolidated in a rectangle formation throughout most of October, setting the stage for a continuation of the stock’s recent uptrend. The trend for the stock has remained bullish since it broke out from a multi-month trading range in September, shortly after the 50-day moving average (MA) crossed above the 200-day MA to form a golden cross, a chart pattern that signals a sustained upward trend. Let’s apply technical analysis to project a potential near-term bullish target on Intel’s chart and also identify important support levels worth watching during future retracements. Investors can project an upside target on Intel’s chart by using the measured move technique, also known by chart watchers as the measuring principle. When applying the analysis, we calculate the distance of the strong move higher that preceded the rectangle in points and add that amount to the formation's top trendline. For example, we add $10 to $39, which projects a target of $49. During pullbacks in the stock, investors should initially watch the $36 level. This area on the chart could provide support near the base of the rectangle formation and a cluster of prices situated just below the July 2024 swing high. A close below this level could see the shares retreat to around $32. Investors may look for buying opportunities in this area near the high of last month’s breakaway gap and a sideways trend that formed on the chart between April and July last year. Finally, selling below this level opens the door for a retest of a lower trading floor near $29. Intel shares may find support in this location around the late September low, which also closely aligns with the Aug. 1, 2024 closing price that preceded the stock’s significant gap lower the following day.

Title: Judgment against three ‘dodgy box’ operators who may have to pay hundreds of thousands to Sky

Full Content:
Three people involved in selling “dodgy boxes” – which are used to illegally access TV streaming services – have been found liable by the High Court to pay possibly hundreds of thousands of euro which Sky says it has lost from their activities. Mr Justice Liam Kennedy granted judgment, in two separate cases, against the three to Sky UK Ltd which provides TV services in the UK and Ireland. The three, who failed to appear in court, are Andrew Keena of Mariner’s Court, Blackrock, Co Louth, and Stephen McBride and Carol Thornton, both of Defenders Row, Dundalk, Co Louth. The judge also granted permanent injunctions that they cease all copyright-infringing activities and not to continue to make the material available on their infringing services. They are also prohibited from taking, directly or indirectly, steps to transfer or give away any source code or other technology related to their infringing services and to cease all advertising of the services. The court will assess damages at a future date. An investigator employed by Sky Subscriber Services Ltd said in affidavits that the estimated annual loss from Mr Keena’s activities was conservatively put at €643,860 based on Sky’s average revenue per month of €73 per customer. Mr Keena is estimated to have had 735 customers paying an entity called “Interstellar Media” €95 per year, bringing in €69,825. The number of customers was based on members of a Facebook group set up for the purpose of providing information about the use of Interstellar Media. However, the investigator said in one Facebook post, in June 2021 during the UEFA Euro football tournament, it was stated there were “over 4,856 customers”. Interstellar Media was notable among infringers in that it used its own branded application to provide its services via downloads for internet protocol TV (IPTV) firesticks, computers and other devices, the investigator said. Most IPTV service providers use generic applications to stream their services. [ Confessions of a dodgy box owner: ‘It did give me pause for thought but the savings are incredible’Opens in new window ] Mr McBride and Ms Thornton charged a “competitive” €70 per year for their service, the investigator said. Infringing IPTV subscriptions regularly sell for €100 plus per year, he added. In the McBride/Thornton case, the investigator estimated an annual loss to Sky of €876,000. Mr McBride boasted of selling to more than 1,000, which meant a revenue for them of more than €70,000. The McBride/Thornton service involved customers downloading an application called “Dreambox Android XMBC” to an Amazon Firestick which provided Sky Entertainment, Sky Sports and Sky Cinema, among other channels. Mr McBride also sent an instructional video to customers on how to install and use the service. All three defendants advertised through Facebook while the McBride/Thornton service was also on Instagram using slogans like “Sick of paying ridiculous Sky bills” and “No more stupid Sky bills”. When “cease and desist” letters were sent by Sky’s lawyers to all three, Mr Keena said Interstellar Media was no longer in operation since around November 2021. He also claimed that his PayPal account, which received payments for Interstellar Media, had been used without his knowledge by a third party. He refused to name the third party. The investigator said Mr Keena also has an apparent connection with another infringing IPTV service called Showbiz Media and this means his infringing activities are not just limited to Interstellar Media. Interstellar was a very sophisticated service operating at scale and Mr Keena had been “very evasive and dishonest in his limited engagements” with Sky, he said. When Mr McBride received a cease and desist letter, he replied in April 2022 saying “Excuse me?. Is this spam or a joke?” The investigator said, at his request, Mr McBride’s Facebook profile was removed. But he created two new profiles, one in his own name and other called “Firesticks Dundalk”. [ The Irish Times view on dodgy boxes: enforce the lawOpens in new window ] In and around mid-2023, when Sky first commence legal proceedings against him and Ms Thornton, the infringing services ceased. The defendants, who have not otherwise engaged with the proceedings against them, will have an opportunity to turn up in court when the assessment of damages is being carried out.

Title: Trump Wrecks America. His “Patriotic” Fans Cheer. Is There Any Bottom?

I was going to write one more liberal column expressing outrage about what Donald Trump has done to the White House this week, but then I thought: Why? What would be the point? The people who would agree with me would agree with me, and the people who wouldn’t wouldn’t, and the world would go on its merry way. Of course the president’s destruction of the East Wing is beyond outrageous. It’s completely illegal and un-American—not just un-American, but anti-American: the unilateral, I-don’t-give-a-fuck desecration of a civic shrine that belonged to all the people. Democracies have appointed bodies that oversee such things. Dictators, actual and aspiring, ignore all that. Call it overreaction if you must, but I’m sure I’m hardly the only American to google “Albert Speer Germania” this week. And yet, it’s probably only the third-most-outrageous thing Trump has done since Monday. To place, in horse-racing parlance, I’d put the pardon of Changpeng Zhao, who “invested” in the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial cryptocurrency start-up and who pleaded guilty in 2023 to allowing his Binance crypto exchange to be used—get this now, and imagine a Democrat issuing a pardon to such a person—by, among other unsavories, Hamas’s military wing (not just plain old Hamas—its military wing!). And taking the gold medal this week would be the $230 million extortion that the sitting president of the United States demanded from the Department of Justice. (I cannot believe I just wrote that sentence.) A Pahlavi-level tacky ballroom can always be torn down; these other corrupt precedents cannot be undone. No—one more outraged liberal column won’t add much this week. The more interesting thing I’ve been thinking about lately is not the leader who perpetrates these acts but the people who allow them and cheer them. Because this is the truly maddening question, from a small-d democratic perspective. Authoritarian-fascist demagogues come along sometimes; that’s the world. But democratic societies stop them. Why hasn’t ours stopped Trump? We are cursed with four categories of fascism enablers. The interesting question about each group is not merely what they are doing, but why: What motivates them? Let’s go through them. First, obviously, are the Republicans in Congress and on the Supreme Court. Call them 1a and 1b, because I believe they have different motivations. The Republicans in the House and the Senate are mostly just tiny cowards who fear Trump, a possible primary challenger from the right, and most of all the MAGA base. The video clips that I hope they play over and over in future high school civics classes, assuming these thugs can’t fully erase our democracy, will be the ones of GOP legislators scurrying for the elevators as they deny having knowledge of Trump’s latest assault. Against stern competition, House Speaker Mike Johnson, the tiniest coward of them all, is the most pathetic exemplar of this: “I’m not gonna comment on something I haven’t read, so I’m not sure what you’re talking about,” he told reporters this week when they asked him about the DOJ bribe. The six conservatives on the Supreme Court, in contrast, aren’t cowards. They know what they’re doing, and they have no voters to fear. We must assume that they are consciously creating the America they want. That’s most true of the two deepest reactionaries, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. But to varying degrees, it’s true of the other four conservatives, John Roberts very much included. The record they are leaving behind of these terse, barely explained pro-Trump shadow docket decisions will be their legacy—of shame, if we manage to restore democracy after Trump, or of glory, if we descend into a Hunger Games society. Group two consists of the cowards in the corporate and business worlds who surely know on some level that Trump is dangerous. But they stay silent, for, I think, one of two reasons, or some combination thereof. One, they fear Trumpian retribution. Two, they want their taxes cut. Have a gander at this list of donors to Trump’s razing of the East Wing for his ballroom. Talk about a basket of deplorables. Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone. The Fanjul brothers, the megarich sugar magnates and welfare queens. Meta (Mark Zuckerberg). Amazon (Jeff Bezos). Palantir (Peter Thiel). Others are less blatantly offensive but obviously covering their corporate behinds. These are not by and large stupid people. On some level, they see what Trump is doing to this country. They just care more about other things. Third come the right-wing “media” outlets that serve as Trump’s propaganda arms. Among this group again I think we see dual motivations. The first is the kind of cynicism exposed in those publicly released Fox News depositions relating to the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit: Trump is good for business, so they lie for him to make money. The second motivation is more genuine: They truly despise liberals and liberalism and think we must be stopped at all costs, even when it involves lying to their audiences for a higher purpose. This mixture of the insincere and the sincere may seem incongruous, but actually the two motivations mesh together perfectly: The insincerity ensures that they defend and minimize every single thing Trump does, while the sincerity drives their coverage of Democrats and liberals, although it too is salted with plenty of cynicism, as when they try to persuade their viewers that some kooky neo-Marxist tenured postmodernist professor stands in for American liberalism. And finally—the MAGA faithful. Here let’s distinguish between the soft Trump supporters and the true red-hots. Of the 40 or 42 percent of Americans who still say they approve of Trump’s job performance, I’m guessing that a third or so are soft supporters. Some are swing voters. Some are evangelicals for whom a Democratic vote is basically out of the question. Some remember the first Trump economy fondly. There are lots of different motivations there, but what they have in common is that they don’t necessarily consider him America’s savior. But that other two-thirds … I hesitate to say these are bad human beings. But their rage at certain developments in the United States over these last 30-odd years is so overpowering that their civic and small-d democratic instincts have been buried by the antagonisms Trump has brought to the surface of American politics. They once knew, or they know, or a part of them knows, that no actual leader should be calling human beings “vermin.” But that empathic impulse isn’t much match for rage, which can be quite exhilarating and liberating (we all must admit that we know this feeling from personal experience). How deep does that rage run? We don’t yet know. We have yet to see its bottom. Tearing down part of the White House may lose him a portion of the softs, as polls suggest. But it won’t bother the red-hots, who’ll leap to point out, as I saw some nincompoop do on Newsmax Thursday night, that what Trump did was really no different from Barack Obama ordering the building of his basketball court. The pardon of Zhao is in fact the liberation of the crypto industry from the shackles imposed by Sleepy Joe. The DOJ bribe is money due to Trump fair and square. And so on and so on. I sometimes wonder what it will take for some of these folks to peel away. What if ICE agents just start shooting people? They already are; but I mean en masse. I doubt even that will change anything. Things will change when the rage stops being exhilarating, and I doubt that happens anytime soon. It takes all four of these groups to sustain Trumpism. If Republicans in Congress were doing their constitutional job, Trump would still be Trump but the legislative branch would have established the reality of limits. The corporate class could have said to him: We too know that we thrive best under democratic norms, and we cannot tolerate you breaking those. The right-wing media could still be basically pro-Trump while adhering more closely to the principles of conservatism than to genuflection before one man. And finally, his base too could at least from time to time acknowledge error on his part and demand that he adjust course. But none of these things are happening. And it’s hard to see them happening anytime soon. Bad as this week was, it’s not close to the bottom we’re going to hit. If you’ve heard any Republicans talk about Saturday’s No Kings marches across the country, you know what they’re calling them. House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday referred to the marches collectively as a “hate America rally.” He continued: “Let’s see who shows up for that. I bet you see pro-Hamas supporters. I bet you see antifa types. I bet you see the Marxists in full display.” Many others on the right have echoed these sentiments over and over, and Fox News and the other state propaganda outlets have followed suit, thus washing the brains of their viewers into accepting, once again, the exact opposite of reality. You will probably find the occasional Marxist or antifa type or even the odd Hamas enthusiast marching somewhere tomorrow, because this is still a free country, and people aren’t asked a series of litmus-test questions before they’re allowed to join the fray. But overwhelmingly, these are marches of mainstream Americans. These are marches of teachers, lawyers, laborers, service workers, accountants, nurses, Pilates instructors, bank tellers—everyone. These are marches of people who love their country and are horrified at what President Donald Trump and the Republicans are doing to it. These are marches of patriots. The real, actual, thoughtful, quiet, modest, non-flag-hugging patriots (because history teaches us over and over that the people who need to make a show of hugging the flag are often the people who hate a country’s true ideals but need to fool folks into thinking the opposite so they can trample on those ideals and have it called patriotism). Have a gander at this map of march locations for tomorrow. There are 16 in Wyoming—a state notoriously pulsing with Hamasniks. There are 18 in Oklahoma, that veritable hornet’s nest of antifa hooliganism. There are another 18 in my home state of West Virginia (go, Morgantown contingent!), where Marxism has obviously taken deep root among an unsuspecting populace. Once again, these are not mere lies from Johnson et alia. I make this distinction from time to time, and it’s worth making again here. A lie is a mere denial of truth—“I never said that” or “No, Mom, that isn’t my pot, I was just holding it for Mark.” What Republicans are doing here, as they do with such regularity, is more than lie. They invert the truth. They say its exact opposite. They do so with two express intentions: to make people believe that their political foes are doing that which they themselves are trying to get away with, and to make it easier to get away with defiling the Constitution. But don’t ask me. Let’s ask James Madison. Imagine that the chief author of the Constitution and Bill of Rights could watch tomorrow’s events and observe the post-event spin. What would he think? Whose side would he be on? It’s obvious. He’d be with the marchers. And it’s not even close. How do we know this? For a lot of reasons, but perhaps chief among them is Federalist 47, penned by Madison, which discussed the importance of separation of powers. One of the hallmarks of Trump 2.0—and indeed, from a constitutional point of view, perhaps the hallmark—is the way that, as Trump has made so many moves to concentrate power in his own hands, the other branches of government have supinely gone along with absolutely everything. Congress under Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune is a joke, and as for the Supreme Court, well, it’s too tragic to be a joke. We’ve seen many examples of both branches bending over for Trump at every turn, but arguably, the most egregious one just happened: Trump diverting other monies to pay troops during the shutdown. As TNR’s Matt Ford shows here, it’s blatantly illegal. The Constitution says clearly that Congress appropriates such funds. Trump claimed the power to do so as commander in chief, but he has no such power. The Republican Congress has lain down and said fine. And the really pathetic thing here is that Congress could move a bill directing the payment of troops during the shutdown. It would pass easily. But that can’t happen because Johnson won’t call the House into session, because there’s a new Democrat waiting to be sworn in whose seating has potential ramifications for Trump with respect to the Jeffrey Epstein affair. Again, it all revolves around the wishes and perceived needs of Dear Leader. As for the Supreme Court, it has given Trump practically everything he’s asked for. It has defied him on a couple of minor occasions, but even on the most notable of those, its holding was vague and pusillanimous: It ruled in early April that the administration must “facilitate” the return to the country of Kilmar Abrego García, but it also held that a district court judge had gone too far in ruling that the administration had to “effectuate” his return (he was finally returned to the United States in June). But on almost all other matters, the court has given Trump exactly what he’s wanted. And this week, during the Voting Rights Act hearings, we saw a court majority working nakedly to advance the partisan goals of one political party and its president. Now—back to Madison. Federalist 47 was Madison’s brief to the citizenry in favor of the concept of separation of powers—and his argument to them that powers were sufficiently separated in this new Constitution so as to guard against tyranny. Because tyranny was his great concern. In fact, he wrote: “The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective [emphasis mine], may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.” This accumulation has not, I admit, happened in a legal sense. But in practice, this is precisely where we are today. So had Madison been among us these last nine months to observe what Trump and the Republicans and the court’s majority have done, there is no question that he would say: “Yes. This is tyranny.” I asked Michael Klarman of Harvard Law School, author of the amazing book The Framers’ Coup about the Constitutional Convention, for his thoughts on the relevance of all this. He emailed back: Madison and other Framers believed that “ambition would counteract ambition,” by which they meant largely that Congress would check an autocratically inclined executive. Madison and the other Framers were not anticipating the development of a party system, which actually happened quite soon after the founding. Today, all that matters to Republican members of Congress is that they support Trump, whether he is hiding something in the Epstein files, nominating incompetent people to run agencies, destroying congressionally created agencies, murdering people off the coast of Venezuela, or sending troops into American cities to oppress the people. Cowardly, toadying members of Congress are providing no check whatsoever on a tyrannical executive. It is an abandonment of their oaths, really no different from their predecessors who resigned their positions to join the Confederacy in 1860–61. And the courts? Klarman wrote, “Lower court judges are doing a great job in trying to check that executive. But the Supreme Court—out of some combination of fear, calculated effort not to be defied, and underlying agreement with much of Trump’s agenda—has mostly been complicit in Trump’s authoritarian project.” This is tyranny. We’re not lurching toward tyranny. It doesn’t loom on some hypothetical horizon. It’s here. Right now. Madison was right about tyranny. But obviously he was wrong that the Constitution was strong enough to guard against executive accumulation of power. He assumed, as Klarman put it, that the other branches would do their jobs. But Patrick Henry, the noted anti-federalist, turns out to have had the more sober view. In his speech against ratification, he anticipated people such as Donald Trump, Mike Johnson, and John Roberts: Where are your checks in this government? Your strongholds will be in the hands of your enemies. It is on a supposition that your American governors shall be honest, that all the good qualities of this government are founded; but its defective and imperfect construction puts it in their power to perpetrate the worst of mischiefs, should they be bad men; and, sir, would not all the world, from the Eastern to the Western hemisphere, blame our distracted folly in resting our rights upon the contingency of our rulers being good or bad? The Americans who are marching Saturday are the Americans who embrace Madison’s principle but have sadly come to acknowledge Henry’s insight. And they—not Trump, not Johnson, not Roberts—are the people who truly love this country. Johnson also said Wednesday that Saturday’s marchers are “the people who don’t want to stand and defend the foundational truths of this republic, and that’s what we’re here doing every single day.” As ever with these frauds, he was talking about himself. He may be dense enough not even to know it. But Saturday’s marchers know it all too well. David Axelrod is far better known these days for occasionally wagging his finger at his fellow Democrats than for breathing partisan fire, so it caught my eye when he posted this on X Wednesday: “So far, the ICE gang has shot & killed an unarmed man & lied about the circumstances; shot a woman 5 times for obstructing their vehicle; roughed up elderly women and zip-tied small children; shot a clergyman in the face with a pepper ball; marched through downtown Chicago, masked and armed. And they’re not going after the ‘worst of the worse,’ [sic] as promised. Most of the people they’re snagging have clean records. Some are citizens. To be clear: This is NOT making Chicago safer. It’s state-sponsored mayhem; dangerous political theater calculated to provoke.” Historians sometimes say that when societies are descending into fascism, it can be hard for the people to notice it in real time. Well, historians of the future, I’m here to tell you: We are noticing. Millions of us are noticing. And we are horrified and enraged. We are well aware: We once lived in a country that, for all its frequent imperfections, was a place where the rule of law was a broadly shared value and where leaders acted with democratic restraint. We now live in a country where there is no rule of law; where leaders, especially the president but also others who support him, spit on the idea not only of democratic restraint but of democracy itself; and where the timorous first reflex of nearly every member of one of our two political parties is, at virtually all times, to do precisely what the leader wants. That’s fascism. It may be—for now—a comparatively mild form of fascism. Political opponents aren’t being jailed or shot, opposition media outlets aren’t being shuttered, and books aren’t being burned. But a lot of things are happening that are terrifying. And last year, we lived in a country where the three scenarios I just listed were barely conceivable. Today, we live in a country where they are more likely only a matter of time. Let’s go back to Axelrod, and specifically, his use of the phrase “state-sponsored mayhem.” That is exactly what President Trump is imposing upon Chicago. To take just one of the incidents Axelrod cites: Pastor David Black of the First Presbyterian Church was with a small gaggle of protesters outside a Chicago ICE facility. Three agents stood on the roof of the two-story building as Black and the others stood on the sidewalk maybe 15 feet away from the building. Black raised his arms to the sky, as if in prayer. Someone who appears to be a fellow protester approached Black to confer with him. Next thing you see in this video is a considerable puff of smoke explode from Black’s forehead as he falls to the ground. That’s a clergyman. Exercising his First Amendment right (he’s fine, and he’s suing). Black later told CNN: “We could hear them laughing.” Shooting an unarmed and peacefully protesting pastor is by definition an act of state-sponsored mayhem. State-sponsored mayhem starts at the top, with the president’s thuggish, lawless threat to imprison the governor of Illinois and the mayor of Chicago (by the way—Greg Sargent speaks to said governor, JB Pritzker, on his Daily Blast podcast today). From there, the people with the uniforms and the badges and the guns get the message, and they go out and do the things Axelrod listed above. Administration officials pile lie upon lie upon lie. With respect to Portland, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt refers preposterously to “the radical left’s reign of terror” there. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem declares antifa to be “just as dangerous” as ISIS, which was killing perceived apostates by the thousands at its peak and raping little girls. Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff, rants nightly about armed confrontations that either don’t exist or exist solely because the administration creates them so it can have the footage that will air over and over on its propaganda network, Fox News. It’s all toward the purpose of erasing dissent, erasing democracy. As Zeteo’s Kim Wehle put it last week, reporting on two Trump-issued “national security” directives: “The president is taking steps to criminalize being anti-Trump in America.” When a president and his aides are doing that, it’s no longer America. When masked government thugs take potshots at a priest, it’s no longer America. When a handpicked hack prosecutor with no prosecutorial experience indicts two honorable American citizens within a month of the president ordering their prosecutions, and when two real prosecutors quit rather than pursue these obscenely political prosecutions, it’s no longer America. When the third-ranking official in the country, the speaker of the House of Representatives, delays the swearing-in of a duly elected member of that body because he knows she will vote to release files that potentially may shed light on unsavory behavior by the president, it’s no longer America. When the presidential administration announces that it’s going after nonprofit charitable groups that have operated unmolested in this country for decades under Democratic and Republican administrations because they donate to causes the president disfavors, it’s no longer America. When naturalized citizens are canceling overseas trips because they can’t be certain they’ll be welcomed back to their own country upon return, it’s no longer America. When the Department of Education is bullying universities into agreeing to a “compact” under which they’ll promise not to “belittle” conservative ideas, it’s no longer America. When the president and his family have used his office to enrich themselves to the tune of $3.5 billion in nine months, and when the Congress, controlled by the president’s party, refuses to do a thing about this rancid, dictator-level corruption, it’s no longer America. When the Supreme Court of the United States has sold its soul to all this barbarity, it’s no longer America. And when this thuggish dictator-wannabe is also a buffoonish man-child who sits there in his breathtakingly tacky Oval Office with his fake face and fake hair next to another head of state (the president of Finland) as he boasts yet again about passing a simple dementia test that a 10-year-old could ace, and we realize that this man-child is the sitting president, it’s no longer America, at least for anyone who cares about how we look to the rest of the world. Historians of the future: Rest assured, millions of us know all this in real time. We are horrified, shocked, enraged, and ashamed. We are acting, in a thousand ways, to oppose it. This cannot, and will not, be how the United States ends. President Donald Trump has finally told the truth about something. He’s embraced Project 2025. Anyone who believed his disavowals last year during the campaign is, of course, a fool. And the media, reporting those disavowals, looked foolish. Trump knew, as he has known all his life, that all you have to do is lie about something, and the press, following the rules of objectivity, will report straightforwardly what you said. So he largely got away with it. The Kamala Harris campaign tried to tie Trump to the project, as in this ad; but it didn’t manage to convey the project’s extremism with any force. And now? The Democrats have another huge opportunity to hang Project 2025 around Trump’s neck. It should be easier now, for two reasons. One, it’s not purely hypothetical anymore. According to the Project 2025 Tracker, a community-driven initiative, the Trump administration has already checked off 48 percent of the project’s goals. Two, Trump and OMB Director Russell Vought’s open promises to shred the federal bureaucracy give Democrats a huge target. The question is, do they have the skill—and the guts—to hit it? Alas, that question, as usual with the Democrats, should have a clear answer but doesn’t. The obvious strategy is to call all hands on deck and, now that Trump has said what he said, make this shutdown about not only Obamacare subsidies but two other things: about the looming job cuts themselves and about Vought personally because his name and his extremist, un-American goals to remake the United States as a Christian nation should be known to every American. The first message should be simple: What Trump and Vought are about to do here is the second coming of Elon Musk and DOGE. The DOGE effort was not exactly popular: Last spring, poll after poll, like this one, showed that while the general concept of cutting the size of the federal government had appeal, people really didn’t like the way Musk and his minions were going about it. This time around, Democrats can plausibly say that it’s going to be worse. DOGE staffing cuts came to around 300,000. An estimated 750,000 federal employees are being furloughed due to the shutdown. Vought probably thinks most of them are expendable. It shouldn’t be hard to make these cuts deeply unpopular. Second, tell Americans who Vought is, what he believes, the things he has said. He’s a Christian nationalist who believes Trump is “God’s gift” to America and wants the U.S. to be “a nation under God.” These are of course completely un-American ideas. Article 6 of the Constitution contains the “no religious test clause,” which applies to holding a public office or trust in the U.S.; but beyond that, the Founders were crystal clear that American citizenship and civil rights were open to all—as Thomas Jefferson once put it, citing John Locke, neither “Pagan nor Mohametan [Muslim] nor Jew ought to be excluded from the civil rights of the Commonwealth [of Virginia] because of his religion.” George Washington said that “religious controversies are always more productive of acrimony and irreconcilable hatreds than those which spring from any other cause,” and therefore each should be left to worship (or not) as he or she saw fit. I could go on and on and on. Making these two arguments requires the Democrats to take two moral and unambiguous stands. The first is in defense of an activist federal government. The second is in defense of the religious pluralism upon which this country was founded. I’d love to be able to write with confidence that I think they’ll do it. Odds are they won’t. Most of them shy away from moral arguments. They’re afraid—not all of them, but most of them—to go toe to toe with Trump on a topic like religion. There is utterly no reason for this. Most Americans agree with them. Polls will often show that a disturbingly high percentage of Americans want this country to be a Christian nation, but when you look at crosstabs, you see quickly that the number is high because among Republicans it’s around 75 percent. It’s well under 50 percent among independents, which is the number that matters. Still, the Democratic Party has trained itself over the years to stay away from such matters. They also just don’t speak with one voice and hold together. Right now, the only poll I’ve seen on the shutdown looks very good for them. A Washington Post survey found that respondents blamed Trump and Republicans over Democrats by 47 percent to 30 percent. Interestingly, independents blamed Republicans over Democrats by 50 percent to 22 percent. You’d think and hope that would gird Democrats’ loins. And maybe it will. But remember: Three Senate Democrats voted for the Republican version of the bill to reopen the government. Four more need to cave for the Republicans to get their bill through. Democratic senators are heading back to their states this weekend, where they’re going to hear from furloughed federal workers about how they need their paychecks. In a sense this is understandable and defensible. Democrats tend to care about these people’s actual lives, whereas Republicans don’t give a crap about them since they’re just a bunch of deep-state Trump haters anyway. Also, Democrats genuinely don’t want to see hundreds of thousands of federal employees lose their jobs, both on a simple human level and because Democrats believe these people are doing important work. So that’s all nice. But at the same time, the Democrats could win this fight. If the Post poll is right, they’re already winning. And now that Trump has introduced the unpopular Project 2025 into the equation, the door is open for the Democrats to make Trump’s posture here even more unpopular. Also, I’d argue that to the extent the shutdown will result in chaos, well, people understand that it’s Trump who is the sower of chaos in this country. Majorities are far more likely to blame Trump for chaos than Democrats. So the Democrats can win this. They need to stand together and stick to principles. I just wish history suggested they were better at this. The suspension of Jimmy Kimmel was about the 2,786th objectionable thing this second Trump administration has done. Many of its attacks on the American way of life have been utterly horrific—some have been direct assaults on the rule of law, others have sent completely innocent human beings to detention camps. So why does an action taken against a late-night host stand out? It’s a frontal attack on the one element of our social contract that nearly everyone, from left to right, agrees on and values more than anything: freedom of speech. The delegates to the Constitutional Convention in the summer of 1787 decided against including a Bill of Rights, confident that everyone would understand that the federal government would exercise only the powers enumerated in the document itself. But many critics, mostly those known as the anti-Federalists, insisted that that wasn’t enough. They said: Add a list of specifically enumerated rights, or we’re not ratifying. And so, James Madison, who had been a strong opponent of such a list in 1787, turned around and, as a member of the first U.S. Congress representing the fifth district of Virginia, drew up the list the critics demanded. His original list included 17 rights. Congress passed 12, and the states ratified 10. There was never any question as to which right would be enumerated first. The First Amendment concerns both religion and speech, but over the centuries, freedom of worship has grown less contested, and it has been the cause of free speech rights for which people have fought and gone to prison. Historically, most attempts to suppress speech have come from those in power trying to silence various forms of protest or dissent (hence, from the right, generally speaking). Recent years have seen the emergence of a small but vocal anti–free speech left, whose presence is mostly limited to social media and college campuses, and which is about to make Bari Weiss a very rich woman. But the vast majority of us agree: Free speech is inviolate and applies to all of us, even those with noxious views. A poll last year found that 63 percent of Americans considered free speech “very important.” It was second only to inflation and ahead of crime, health care, immigration, and seven other issues. Not bad for an abstract idea. But abstract ideas last only as long as those who have power—political and financial power—agree that they should last. James Madison couldn’t have contemplated Donald Trump. And he never would have imagined Perry Sook and Chris Ripley. Wait, who are Perry Sook and Chris Ripley, you ask? They are the men, Sook in particular, who made this Kimmel cancellation, this direct attack against free speech, happen. Their names don’t appear in many news stories. More people need to know who they are. Sook is the CEO of Nexstar Media Group. He started the company in the 1990s with one local television station, in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Today, Nexstar owns 197 stations. It also operates NewsNation, the cable news channel trying to compete with Fox, CNN, and MSNBC. NewsNation is where disgraced CNN anchor Chris Cuomo landed, and its “talent” is somewhat ideologically mixed. But Sook, 66, has dropped broad hints in past interviews about his own leanings. Last November, he expressed the hope that “fact-based journalism will come back into vogue, as well as eliminating the level of activist journalism out there.” You might think that by “activist journalism,” he means, you know, the cable news network that paid a $787 million settlement to a private company to avoid being forced to admit that it told lies about the 2020 election. But you’d be wrong. On Wednesday, he showed us what and who he means by “activist journalism”: Jimmy Kimmel, over one comment that right-wing social media went to town on. Chris Ripley is the CEO of the Sinclair Broadcast Group. Sinclair is better known than Nexstar. It vaulted to public prominence after that chilling 2018 video went viral of dozens of local Sinclair anchors reading from the same Orwellian script about “fake news.” Sinclair is more avowedly right-wing than Nexstar. But they both passionately share and are pursuing one central right-wing goal: the end of media regulation in the United States. Under FCC rules, no single owner can reach more than 39 percent of households. These kinds of regulations go back to the 1920s, when radio first hit the scene, and they were designed to make sure that Americans heard a range of voices. No one on either end of the political spectrum challenged them for decades. In the late 1960s, a Pennsylvania right-wing radio preacher (why is it always people like this?) went on air to smear a local journalist who had attacked Barry Goldwater. The matter went up to the Supreme Court, which held—unanimously, left to right—that the FCC’s Fairness Doctrine was consistent with the First Amendment: That is, the court said, yes, the exposure to opposing viewpoints was an essential part of democracy. Traditional news and speech values, imperfect though they were, held for about six decades. Then merger mania hit in the 1980s, and we began to understand that media companies were companies—were interested in profit more than civic ideas such as truth and free speech. At the same time, the Reagan administration started going after the Fairness Doctrine. Later came Rupert Murdoch and Fox. Then came merger after merger after merger. Sad to say, it was Barack Obama’s FCC, under Chair Julius Genachowski, that finally killed off the Fairness Doctrine officially, but it had been long since functionally dead anyway. Right now, Sook awaits FCC approval of a merger that will allow Nexstar to be in more than 39 percent of American homes. And Sinclair wants to grow and grow. And that is what happened Wednesday night. Sook announced that his 32 ABC stations would not broadcast Kimmel’s show. Sinclair, with its 30 ABC affiliates, made a similar announcement shortly thereafter. And ABC—or really, Disney—caved. Even so, this might not have been quite the crisis it is with someone else in the White House. Under President Kamala Harris, for example, would Sook and Nexstar even be petitioning a Democratic FCC for this merger? Probably not. The current Democratic commissioner, Anna Gomez, has clearly stated her opposition (to TNR’s Greg Sargent, among others) to what Chairman Brendan Carr did in threatening ABC and Kimmel. Recent Democratic FCC Chairs Jessica Rosenworcel (Biden) and Tom Wheeler (Obama) have been strong voices for media diversity. It seems to me a safe bet that under President Harris, none of this would be happening. But she is not in the White House. Donald Trump is. And a right-wing hero was just assassinated. Trump and his movement will use Charlie Kirk’s murder to justify any number of unconstitutional and illegal actions. And it filters down from them. Clemson University has fired five faculty and administrators. Teachers are losing their jobs over their social media posts about Kirk. And it sure isn’t Trump firing them. He has created an atmosphere of fear that many, many others on down the right-wing food chain, from Sook and Ripley to local school administrators, will zealously enforce. And that’s why this week is different. It pitted a near-universally cherished American value against a combination of corporate power and authoritarian contempt for that value—and the value was smashed to pieces. If you’re terrified of where all this may end, you are right to be. Stephen Colbert is gone; Kimmel, possibly gone for good (I hope not). CBS is becoming conservative. Skydance, the company handing CBS to Bari Weiss, may be about to take over CNN. The Washington Post is cracking up. The New York Times faces another one of Trump’s $15 billion lawsuits. In this next year or two, we may well be counting on the Times to do what CBS and ABC have refused to do and fight this battle to the bitter end. The text of the First Amendment was edited down from Madison’s original language. His first-draft passage on speech and the press said: “The people shall not be deprived or abridged of their right to speak, to write, or to publish their sentiments; and the freedom of the press, as one of the great bulwarks of liberty, shall be inviolable.” I wish that language had remained—it’s clearer and more emphatic, especially that “inviolable” part. It might have stiffened the backs of the people we’re going to be counting on to preserve free speech in this country and made it harder for right-wing federal judges to chip away at these rights. It would not, alas, make any difference to tyrants, and as of Wednesday night, it’s clearer than it ever was before that tyranny is where we’re headed. I will admit that I learned some useful things about Charlie Kirk this week. I learned that he commanded a unique respect and even ardor on the MAGA right. Old high school friends who are MAGA pop up regularly on my Facebook feed, and they were distraught, several to the point of tears. They had him pegged for a future president, which sure had never occurred to me, but which made sense after I gave it some thought. He was young, articulate, nice-looking; possessed of a certain kind of charisma. He had an instinct for how to connect with young men emotionally. I’ve also read some liberals who knew him saying in these last couple of days that he was, in person, unfailingly polite, and that matters. This is the Kirk the right remembers: someone who engaged in civil debate and persuasion and who infuriated liberals only because he was smart and he usually won. Kirk’s most ardent fans can, and will, believe what they want. The truth is that he infuriated a lot of us because he spread toxic lies across this country like a blanket of Agent Orange (David Corn and Joan Walsh iterated a number of them this week). And while he often had an impressive battery of facts at his command, his manner of debating involved a lot of dishonest rhetorical legerdemain. I watched a clip Thursday in which he challenged a young white male student somewhere: “What can a white man do in this country that a Black man can’t do?” It’s a very clever question. That framing—the use of the verb “do”—reduces racism to matters of the freedom to move about in society. And in that sense, what’s the problem? Yes, we once had white and “colored” waiting rooms down South, but these days, a Black father can take his kids to a ballgame just the same as a white father can. But a real conversation about racism means talking, for example, about the historical legacies that have resulted in white households owning on average $250,400 in wealth and Black households $24,520. That’s a direct result of Blacks not being allowed to buy houses in most neighborhoods in this country until relatively recently. In addition, there is still tons of discrimination in mortgage lending. That’s what racism is, and the fact that Black men can “do” a lot of what white men can “do” in this country does nothing to mitigate these persistent facts—facts that only liberals, by the way, have ever had the courage to try to change. Was Kirk’s assassination a tragedy? It was absolutely a tragedy. Whether the killer had a political motivation or not, the silencing of a voice, even a toxic voice, in that fashion is ghastly. If you spend enough time online (and here’s a good reason why you shouldn’t), you’ll be able to find people, seemingly somewhere on the left of the political spectrum, chortling over Kirk’s death. It’s an understatement to say that this is very bad form. But you’ll struggle to find any prominent liberal leaders or elected Democrats saying anything like, oh, for example, the insanely irresponsible things Mike Lee—a U.S. senator!—said when Minnesota Democrat Melissa Hortman and her husband were executed by a right-wing extremist. Here’s what I have seen, though: I’ve seen a number of figures on the right saying, instantly and well in advance of an assailant being identified (news that the alleged gunman was arrested didn’t break until Friday morning) that “the left” was responsible for Kirk’s death. Dozens of them, from Donald Trump on down, jumped immediately to this conclusion. They did this to a ferocious degree after both assassination attempts on Donald Trump’s life. Especially after the first one, many prominent figures on the right started pointing fingers at people and organizations on the broad left (The New Republic included) for having Trump’s blood on their hands. This was relentless for about three days; I remember it very well. Then it turned out that would-be assassin Matthew Crooks in fact had no particular political motivation—he was a bullied loner probably seeking notoriety. But during those first days, it was taken as a given on the right that Crooks was a Trump-hating leftist. The second attempt on Trump’s life came a scant two months later. You might have thought, given how wrong they were the first time, they would have waited. But again, many figures on the right rushed to say Ryan Routh was a registered Democrat, which he once was but hadn’t been for a long time. This time, in fairness, figures on the left pointed to other evidence saying Routh had Republican sympathies. But it turns out that he is just a confused man, as he proved this week in (as fate would have it) Judge Aileen Cannon’s courtroom where he is on trial for the assassination attempt—and where his rambling opening statement touched on Adolf Hitler, Henry Ford, and the Wright brothers. The right always jump to such conclusions, and to talk of revenge, not justice. The biggest jumper of all is Trump himself, who delivered an absolutely chilling address Wednesday night from the Oval Office. He said his administration would ferret out “those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence, including the organizations that fund it and support it, as well as those who go after our judges, law enforcement officials, and everyone else who brings order to our country.” If another president had said something like that, we could take it as playing to his peanut gallery. But when Trump says it, we should assume that he and his movement mean it. “Those who contributed to this atrocity” could mean thousands of people and organizations, and “other political violence” can mean anything Trump and Stephen Miller want it to mean. They will use this tragic event to try to bully non-Trump America into submission. Some people on the right are genuinely in mourning. They may choose not to see the sides of Charlie Kirk they don’t wish to see (and I’m still having trouble understanding how spewing such hatred and provocation is consistent with the teachings of Jesus Christ), but that’s what grieving human beings often do—right, left, and in between. Let them mourn in peace. But Trump and many leaders on the right are vowing to use this tragedy to do what they’ve always wanted to do anyway: to make this a more authoritarian society in which blunt criticism of the regime becomes redefined as incitement to violence and even terrorism. On Thursday, the State Department warned immigrants not to mock Kirk’s death. In Trump’s America, we can be sure it’s not going to stop there. More ghastly, parallel-universe news this week. The man in charge of America’s public health said he didn’t know how many people died of Covid and added, despite his ignorance, that he is certain that the Covid vaccine has killed more people than Covid itself did (all this while he’s denying Americans access to the Covid vaccine). We committed a probable act of war against Venezuela. The president of the United States was mocked by the leaders of China, Russia, and India. And as of Friday, the Department of Defense is apparently going back to the future and becoming the Department of War, I guess because “defense” is too passive a cognomen for the real men of MAGA-land. But maybe the most ominous development of the week doesn’t concern the Trump administration at all. It’s the news that Bari Weiss is apparently about to become the head, or something, of CBS News. This is bad for CBS, sure. But it’s a lot bigger than that: It is the securing for the right wing of another key beachhead in the American media landscape, which, as I’ve warned repeatedly, will within a generation (or sooner) consist of a lot of large, noisy, avowedly right-wing outlets and a small handful of mainstream outlets that are too weak and feckless to defend what remains of our democracy—and will thus be acting as the handmaidens of their own destruction, if they aren’t already. This is certainly an “only in America” story, but I do not mean that in the normal, heroic sense. I mean it in the creepy, corporate, it’s-all-about-profit sense. CBS began life in 1927 as a radio network, expanding into television as that medium grew. It had entertainment and news divisions, and later sports; its news division was considered the best in the United States, and, along with the British Broadcasting Corporation, a model for mainstream media standards in democracies. It wasn’t being “liberal” when Edward R. Murrow helped take down Joe McCarthy. It was acting in defense of democracy against a sinister and dishonest demagogue. Over the decades—and this was a natural-enough progression—CBS became a huge corporation, expanding into movies, amusements, even musical instruments (it was said to have ruined Fender guitars for about 20 years, although today those guitars—I own one—are considered vintage, go figure). But even this wasn’t so horrible, until the age of megamergers brought on by what was essentially the end of antitrust enforcement in the U.S. Fade in, fade out: CBS formed Viacom, then they split, then they remerged. Paramount, which had owned part of CBS back in the 1930s, came back into the picture. In 2009, Paramount announced a partnership with this new thing called Skydance, which had been created in 2006 by David Ellison. In July 2024, Skydance and Paramount, now CBS’s parent, announced their intention to merge. You will recall what happened next. That fall, as the merger was under governmental review, and during the presidential campaign, 60 Minutes broadcast an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris. With no evidence, Donald Trump charged that it was edited to make Harris look good. And so, exactly 70 years after CBS (and Murrow) took down one demagogue, it cowered and crumbled when confronted by another. The reason was obvious: Ellison and others wanted Trump’s Justice Department to approve the merger. In other words, profit was put ahead of the journalistic reputation of CBS News’s crown jewel program. CBS—actually, Paramount Global—decided to pay Trump $16 million (toward his “library”). It was an implicit admission that maybe Trump was right; that their most venerated news program perhaps was guilty of liberal bias, even though Trump never produced one lick of evidence that 60 Minutes had done anything wrong, anything that wasn’t part of standard broadcast practice. But Trump was clearly appeased, and, lo and behold, two months ago, the Trump administration approved the merger. On August 7, Ellison gave a press conference in New York, where he swore that no favors had been promised Trump. “We are not going to politicize anything today,” Ellison said. “We want to entertain first.” One can call Bari Weiss many things, but “apolitical” is not among them. She’s undoubtedly smart, and, with her wildly successful Substack publication The Free Press, she cunningly saw a market niche in identifying private-school wokery—rather than, say, the fact that one of our two major political parties is descending into fascism—as the gravest threat to the American way of life. I readily concede that what we call “wokeism” contains some excesses, some illiberal manifestations that run counter to the values of tolerance and open-minded debate. But the idea that students and administrators at a handful of universities are a bigger danger to democracy than Donald Trump and JD Vance and Pete Hegseth and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is absurd and dangerous. That is the view, however, of a certain slice of the American elite: wealthy people who tend to have gone to those schools, or who send their kids to them, and who, while not openly racist or sexist in most cases, nevertheless get the heebie-jeebies from all those Black and brown and trans people screaming about their rights—and who, more than anything else, in fact far more than anything else, want their tax cuts. And soon, CBS News will reflect their priorities and tell them the stories about the threats to the U.S. that they want to hear. In doing so, it will join not only Fox News and Newsmax and Sinclair, which increasingly controls local media. The Washington Post too appears to be traveling in that direction. In a few years, there just won’t be much mainstream media left. And I hate to say this, but that is partly their fault too. Weiss first became famous at The New York Times, when she expertly parlayed a hullabaloo over a controversial op-ed by GOP Senator Tom Cotton into a victimhood narrative about left-wing intolerance. She published a resignation letter that was praised by Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Donald Trump Jr., among others. All that attention led to her getting the funding to launch and grow The Free Press, for which David Ellison is now reportedly paying her at least $100 million, maybe more. An American success story, I suppose. But here’s the thing. The Times never should have been hiring someone like Weiss in the first place. She was at The Wall Street Journal editorial page before. Ask yourself: Has the Journal opinion page ever hired a liberal away from the Times? Maybe, although I can’t think of one. But in 2017, after Trump won, the Times hired both Weiss and Bret Stephens from the Journal. And at some point in there, the Times hired yet another young right-winger, Adam Rubenstein, who was the primary editor of the Cotton op-ed. Well, a Times defender would say, the liberal Times is more committed to diverse viewpoints than the conservative Journal, and that is a good thing. Up to a point, that’s true. And once upon a dear old time, a newspaper like the Times could hire, say, William Safire—hack and propagandist though he was—as an act of magnanimity to give a prominent platform to a conservative voice because conservative voices were indeed underrepresented in the media at the time. But that is hardly the case now. It brings to mind that old joke about some liberals being so open-minded that their brains start falling out of their ears. That open-mindedness, to circle us back to where we started, is on regular display at the Times these days, as I noted a month ago. The RFK Jr. Senate hearing Thursday was a shitshow. He obfuscated, he lied, he evaded, he humiliated himself. He is dismantling his agency and destroying public health. People will die because of his decisions, if they aren’t already. All of this was on horrid display Thursday. And the Times’ original headline on its account of the hearing? “A Defiant Kennedy Defends Vaccine Changes and C.D.C. Shakeup.” Great. Kennedy was savaged by senators of both parties for his lies and for shredding American public health to pieces, and the Times rewards him with the adjective “defiant.” Be assured that Bari Weiss’s CBS won’t be guilty of such equivocation in the name of “fairness.” That’s the difference, and that’s a big part of the reason why this democracy is dying. Donald Trump has, of course, done a lot of shocking things as president, things even previous Republicans wouldn’t have done. We focus most of our coverage on those things, and rightly so. But on one issue, he’s been a pretty standard Republican president, which is to say to say he’s been horrible and wicked in the standard way. The issue is guns. Before the Minneapolis shooting fades out of the news cycle, let’s look at the grisly Trump record, which has largely passed under the radar. We begin with his February 7 executive order called “Protecting Second Amendment Rights.” It stated in the opening paragraph: “Because it is foundational to maintaining all other rights held by Americans, the right to keep and bear arms must not be infringed.” It then directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to review existing laws and regulations and so on “to assess any ongoing infringements of the Second Amendment rights of our citizens.” This has led to a process that seeks to restore the gun rights of convicted felons. And so, on July 18, the Justice Department published a rule to that effect. The press release’s opening sentence reads: “President Trump directed the Department of Justice to address the ongoing infringements of the Second Amendment rights of our citizens—all of them.” Further down, the release quotes Ed Martin, the administration’s pardon attorney and a MAGA extremist whose nomination for a U.S. Attorney position was withdrawn because he probably couldn’t get the votes: “General Bondi’s support of the rebooted 925(c) program is consistent with President Donald J. Trump’s promise to the American people to support the beautiful Second Amendment.” So that’s number one: The DOJ is going out of its way to restore gun rights to convicted felons—a category, of course, that includes Donald Trump himself. But the EO and other actions by the administration go a lot farther. Trump ordered a review of every gun-regulating move made by the Biden administration. For example, on April 7, Bondi revoked a Biden-era rule that allowed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to rescind the licenses of gun dealers that break the law by falsifying records. Ponder that: Businesses that knowingly break the law now have immunity from federal oversight. There’s plenty more. On May 16, the administration agreed to a settlement of several lawsuits under which the Justice Department would no longer enforce machine-gun ban laws (which date to the 1930s) against guns with forced-reset trigger (FRT) devices. An FRT, which is a recently developed technology, allows the shooter to fire at an increased rate. The NRA and manufacturers say it’s no big deal, the shooter still has to fire each shot separately; gun-safety advocates counter that by mechanically resetting the trigger position after a shot is fired, FRT’s still dramatically increase the fire rate, essentially turning some semiautomatic weapons into machine guns. So these will now be sold again. FRT’s have been after-market devices, but now, they might be installed at point of sale. The Republicans’ big, ugly budget bill factors in here, too. A transfer tax on silencers has been part of U.S. law since 1934. The tax was imposed for the obvious reason that silencers tended to be used by the bad guys. You don’t need silencer to shoot a grouse or defend your family from an intruder. It was paid by either the buyer or seller and was set at $200. In all those decades, it was never raised ($200 then would be close to $4,900 today). But at least it existed. As of next January 1, it will be $0. This is who Trump is: a cynical and strictly transactional person who, once upon a time, spoke reasonably sensibly about guns, but who realized once he entered politics that anyone who wants the GOP presidential nomination has to sell his soul to the NRA, so he sold his (probably wasn’t expensive). This is another thing we kind of stopped paying attention to, because he does so many other things that are, or appear to be, so much more outrageous. But I take note every year of what Trump tells the NRA. In the summer of 2024, he spoke to the group in person and said, among other things: • “Let there be no doubt the survival of our Second Amendment is very much on the ballot. You know what they want to do. If they get in, our country’s going to be destroyed in so many ways. But the second Amendment will be … It’s under siege. But with me, they never get anywhere.” • “If the Biden regime gets four more years, they are coming for your guns, 100% certain. Crooked Joe has a 40-year record of trying to rip firearms out of the hands of law-abiding citizens.” • “They’re going after the ammunition. When the radical-left Democrats tried to use Covid to shut down gun sales during the China virus, I proudly designated gun and ammunition retailers as critical infrastructure so they couldn’t touch it.” This April, the group convened in Atlanta, and Trump addressed the assemblage via video, bragging about all the above and more, saying: “There is much more to come. Americans are born free, and under the Trump administration, we will live free—always live free. With me in the White House, your sacred rights will not be infringed.” Now, after Minneapolis, Vice President JD Vance and Melania Trump are out there trying to shift the topic from guns to mental health. It’s a total dodge, an attempt to talk about anything but guns; but okay, we have an obvious five-alarm mental healthcare crisis in this country, so to the extent that this administration really wants to do something about that—great. But as usual, the rhetoric is completely the opposite of the reality. The drastic Medicaid cuts in the big, ugly bill will impact mental health services in a vast array of ways. MindSite News, which covers mental health policy, wrote after the bill became law: “The previous five years—including the final year of Trump’s first presidency—had seen the renewal of a federal commitment to mental health. Over those years, federal funding for mental health services increased. New programs like the 988 hotline were created and funded. Funding streams were established to boost crisis response services and to support school-based mental health. Tough new health insurance regulations were enacted to improve access to coverage for mental health services.” That last point is especially key. Insurers don’t cover mental health the way they cover physical health (this, by the way, is an issue the Democrats should seize; mental health doesn’t interest the media much, but I guarantee you it is of keen interest to parents everywhere, of all political stripes). But this bill, the site notes, signals that “the days of a federal commitment to addressing the U.S. mental health crisis are essentially over.” So they’re even hypocrites on the one issue on which they’re showing “concern.” But let’s conclude by going back to gun policy. The guns purchased by the Minneapolis shooter were bought legally. Press accounts note this and then quickly move on, as if to say there’s no point in discussing gun laws here. But there is. There always is. Authorities haven’t revealed what kinds of guns, beyond saying there were three—a shotgun, a rifle, and a pistol. Maybe they’re not even in the categories of weapons we debate. I’d still like to know how someone with such obvious mental health issues passed the background checks. Minnesota strengthened its background check law under Governor Tim Walz in 2023, but someone somewhere still decided that Robin Westman could own guns responsibly, and we deserve to know more about who and why. In the meantime, Trump 2.0 so far shows every sign of doing anything the NRA wants it to do. They can offer all the thoughts and prayers they want, and they can prattle on about mental health until the sun sets. But it’s their actions that matter, and their actions say they’re perfectly content to let more children die. This article first appeared in Fighting Words, a weekly TNR newsletter authored by editor Michael Tomasky. Sign up here You may not know the name Lindsey Halligan. She’s not a scholar. Not a Ph.D. She hasn’t written any books on history. She has, however, worked as an insurance claims lawyer. Her most celebrated achievement, apparently, was defeating a 2019 claim seeking $500,000 in damages from her client over a damaged roof. How she managed to join Trump’s defense team remains unclear, but she was called to Mar-a-Lago the day the FBI came in with its warrant to collect those classified documents. Once on the team, she did what they all do, namely, grovel—she made an appearance on Steve Bannon’s podcast where she vowed to sue CNN for claiming that Trump was lying about the 2020 election results. Trump sought $475 million in damages in that case, but in July 2023, a federal judge dismissed it. Today, Halligan holds something few others in government probably do: a very fancy title that runs to a full 19 words (Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and the Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Staff Secretary). She is overseeing the … what’s the right word here? There are so many to choose from … “reimagining” of the Smithsonian Institution. That’s right. An insurance claims lawyer is now in charge of making sure that the Smithsonian’s 21 museums, 21 libraries, 14 research centers, one zoo, and 157 million items and artifacts are brought into line with the wishes of the Mad King. I see, looking back over them, that the tone of the above two paragraphs is a bit jocular. But this is no laughing matter. Forget Halligan. Maybe she’s smarter than I think, maybe she’s not. Maybe she’s a hardcore racist, maybe she’s not. But she’s not the point. The point here is Trump. He is not smarter than I think. I suspect he’s never read a history book in his life, and chances are pretty decent he’s never been to a museum, except to galas Ivana dragged him to back when. And about his hardcore racism, there is utterly no question. But we don’t talk about it enough. Trump long ago established to the satisfaction of everyone outside of MAGA world that he’s a racist to the bone. He and his father wouldn’t rent to Black people. He said those sick things about the defendants in the Central Park jogger case (they weren’t guilty). He said, “Laziness is a trait in Blacks.” He said some white supremacists in Charlottesville were “very fine people.” I could go on and on. Being long-established, Trump’s racism is not “news.” Regular readers of mine will know this is one of my longtime complaints about the nature and structure of the media. There are lots of things that aren’t “news,” per se, but are true, important, and defining of our reality. Trump’s racism is one of those things. It hovers over everything. It defines nearly everything he does. And it is making the United States of America a cruel, sick, mean place. His racism is what’s propelling this edict over the Smithsonian. “The Smithsonian is OUT OF CONTROL, where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was,” he whined Tuesday on Truth Social. When he talks this way, he’s sending a much broader message that is widely understood, by both his political foes and (especially) his supporters. Each group knows it’s part of a broader attack that is designed to keep certain Americans “in their place.” It’s just that the latter group approves. His racism is what’s driving the presence of these National Guard troops in Washington, D.C. His motorcade, traveling from the White House to his Virginia golf club, passes a small greensward along what’s called the E Street Expressway where there are (or were) a few tents, and that’s probably how he got his entire impression of D.C. crime, along with the background knowledge that D.C. is a heavily Black city (Black residents are no longer a majority, but still a plurality). The troops aren’t even fighting actual crime. They’re mostly around the National Mall, where it’s as safe as Mayberry in the 1960s. The troops are just a symbol for white MAGA world that he’s cracking some Black heads. His racism is behind this sick redistricting madness in Texas. Nonwhite people make up 60 percent of the state’s population. By the time the Texas legislature is finished, the Texas congressional delegation will likely be more than 70 percent white and Republican. In Missouri, the redistricting under consideration would slice a Black Democratic district in Kansas City into maybe three different pieces. Republicans have done this sort of thing long before Trump, but under Trump, of course, it’s being taken to extremes because Republicans now know that anti-Black extremism on such matters is the only thing that gets the boss’s attention. His racism is behind his talk about mail-in ballots and early voting and all his phony allegations about fraudulent voting. Everybody knows very well what, and whom, he’s talking about when he talks about such things. He means Black and, to a slightly lesser extent, Latino people. His racism is the fundamental reason for these mass detentions. Would Trump, and the right wing in general, be this worked up about illegal border crossings if it was mostly white people doing it? Of course they wouldn’t. There would be no rhetoric about immigrants “poisoning the blood” of the nation. Finally—although surely there’s more—it’s racism that animates a lot of his rhetorical attacks on individual Americans. It’s no accident that his recent targets prominently include Oprah Winfrey, Gayle King (her close friend), Beyoncé, Al Sharpton, Letitia James, and Charlamagne tha God. He goes after lots of people of all races, but Black people are disproportionately targeted, and it’s not an accident. I have no idea where Lindsey Halligan fits in here. She’s spent most of her adult life thinking about hurricanes. She’s interchangeable with any other Mar-a-Lago sycophant who happened to be in the right place at the right time. But the fact that Trump put someone in charge of remaking the Smithsonian who’s totally unqualified is what’s important here because it tells us that the person is there solely to follow his orders. Trump’s orders will be based on his worldview. And his worldview is the most blatantly and openly racist worldview that’s been held by an American president since Woodrow Wilson. We need to remember this—even, or especially, when the media forgets. Republican Representative Bryan Steil thought it would be a good idea to go have a meetup with constituents Thursday night in Elkhorn, Wisconsin. Steil represents Paul Ryan’s old district and in fact used to work for Ryan. He’d had a rocky week: A few days before, some protesters plopped some flowers and a coffin on the doorstep of his Janesville home, an act meant to symbolize the ill effects of the Republicans’ big, ugly bill on the most vulnerable. Things didn’t get much better Thursday night. Steil was booed repeatedly, particularly on immigration, with one woman saying, with reference to Alligator Alcatraz: “The difference between a prison or a detention center and a concentration camp is due process.” Asked another, about ICE agents, to robust applause: “Why are they wearing masks, and why are they unidentified?” Congress is in recess now for the new month, so we can be sure that Steil’s fellow Republicans took note and will spend the month hiding from constituencies and hanging out at country clubs where tax cuts for the rich are popular and nobody needs Medicaid (or at least they think they don’t). Donald Trump, it is said, is frustrated. He wonders why he’s not more popular. He complains, we read, that he’s accomplished a great deal and that he’s keeping his campaign promises, and looked at a certain way, these statements are true, to a point. So he can’t figure out why he’s at 37 percent. I could tell him why. Two reasons, and they’re both obvious. First, his policies are horrible, and people don’t like them. If you’re “accomplishing” things that large majorities of people don’t want, do they count as accomplishments? Film director Uwe Boll somehow manages to keep making movies. But he’s a punch line. Most of his movies have been commercial flops and critical train wrecks—a career so lame that he once promised to quit the business if a petition demanding that he do so garnered a million signatures (alas, it fell short). That’s Trump: the Uwe Boll of policy. The recent polls have told us over and over and over. The big, ugly bill—unpopular. Rounding up poor guys hanging out at Home Depot looking for work—unpopular. Putting people in, yes, concentration camps—unpopular. Cutting his Palm Beach pals’ taxes—unpopular. Imposing these absurd tariffs—unpopular. I could go on. There is literally not a single important item on the Trump domestic agenda that polls well. Then there are the promises he’s broken. He said he’d lower prices on day one. Which, you’ll recall, was the same day on which he was going to end Russia’s war on Ukraine. And bring peace to the Middle East. It’s a pleasant surprise here lately that he’s talking smack about Putin and Netanyahu because they’re gumming up his glide path to the Nobel Peace Prize. But his criticisms don’t change the fact that the crises in both Ukraine and Gaza have gotten worse, not better, since he took office. Look, I’m glad that he’s flip-flopped on aid to Ukraine. But still, it’s a flip-flop. I remember when Republicans thought flip-flopping on a matter of war and peace was a sign of weakness. So that’s number one. He has either (1) executed his policies as promised, but people hate them, or (2) blown them off or reversed himself, exposing his campaign statements as nonsense. That the Harris campaign couldn’t figure out how to mock his obvious bullshit—don’t get me started. One thing I’m not celebrating this summer is Kamala Harris’s reemergence on the public stage, and I pray she’s not delusional enough to think she ought to run again in 2028. Number two is also simple. He’s a sleazeball, and more and more people are finally coming to realize it. The Jeffrey Epstein matter is Exhibit A, of course, but there is much more. The way he and his family are getting rich from the presidency is just obscene. Have you ever gone to TrumpStore.com? If not, have a look. It’s relentlessly garish, of course, but more than that, it’s relentlessly and proudly, defiantly overpriced. Yet these idiots buy this crap by the millions. But it’s Epstein that is catching up with him. And that story is a long, long way from being over. We cannot of course at this point state that Trump is guilty of anything. But allegations are out there. Have you read the testimony of “Katie Johnson”? You might want to familiarize yourself with it. Obviously, I have no idea whether it’s true. If a third of it is, and it’s ever corroborated, it will be by far the biggest presidential scandal of all time. And even if none of it is true, we’re still dealing with a president of the United States whose best friend for 15 years was a serial child rapist. Let that sink in. Again, why the Democrats couldn’t make this an issue last year—aarrgh. I know. I’m sure they have all kinds of reasons. But you know what? If Donald Trump were running against someone whose best friend for 15 years was a serial child rapist, he’d have made sure America knew. In any case, they’re figuring it out now. And if he pardons Ghislaine Maxwell or commutes her sentence or anything like that, millions of Americans will jump to the obvious conclusion. It all leaves Bryan Steil and his GOP congressional colleagues ducking their constituents, because God forbid they have to explain to voters why they voted for a sick bill that punishes working people and lines the pockets of the megarich and will shove many billions of dollars into the creation of a police state no one wants. That would be accountability, which would be uncomfortably close to democracy. Can’t have that.

Title: Google’s XR Studio Releases ‘Job Simulator’ Style MR Experience Exclusive to Android XR
URL: https://www.roadtovr.com/google-xr-studio-job-simulator-sequel-android-xr/
Time Published: 2025-10-24T14:22:20Z
Full Content:
Owlchemy Labs, the Google-owned XR studio, released a new mixed reality title exclusively for Android XR which expands the Job Simulator universe. Owlchemy Labs, the studio behind VR games Job Simulator (2016) and Vacation Simulator (2019), released both games on Android XR’s first officially supported headset, Samsung Galaxy XR. Alongside it comes a free mixed reality experience, called Inside[JOB], which the studio says in a blogpost offers up the “same blend of chaos, humor, and hands-on interaction that helped define modern VR, as well as a first look at our next evolution in spatial experiences.” As an Android XR platform exclusive, Inside Job isn’t a full title as such, but rather what Owlchemy calls an “interactive XR playground,” which puts the series robotic protagonist ‘JobBot’ in the spotlight as he discovers your reality. In Inside Job, users tweak system settings, fish for data, and repair PCs in VR, blending passthrough MR with full VR segments set in the Job Simulator universe. The studio says Inside Job isn’t a sequel as such, but rather “a chance to experiment with our latest hand-tracking tech while solving a series of lighthearted repairs.” The game launched alongside Samsung Galaxy XR this week, priced at $1,800, which is currently the only Android XR headset on the market. You can find Inside Job for free over on the Playstore here. I think it’s pretty clear that Galaxy XR’s high price tag basically excludes it from being a viable outlet for large-format, system-selling exclusives, which is why gamers probably shouldn’t wring their hands and yell into the heavens with full-on FOMO just yet. Basically, it’s a Vision Pro, but cheaper, and with access to Android apps and maybe a few Quest ports. That’s very cool for XR obsessed people like you and me, and also companies looking to build enterprise apps, but not many others right now. The real question on my mind is “what’s really next for Owlchemy Labs?” I suspect the answer to that question won’t materialize so quickly. As a reminder, Owlchemy Labs has developed some of the best-selling games in the medium, so they’re probably hoping to jump in at the right moment—but it’s difficult to intuit when that might be. Olwchemy Labs says in a recent blogpost that porting their games to Android XR has allowed them to “experiment with new layers of immersion through native support for hand, eye, and face tracking.” I can bet other established XR studios are interested in mobilizing those hardware features too, if only in service of deepening user immersion, but I’m skeptical of whether will be enough. I’ll admit it: the next XR headset wave may well come when consumers can eventually choose between a cheap and cheerful Android XR headset, a next-gen Quest, and possibly even Valve’s rumored Steam Frame (aka ‘Deckard’). But I have a hard time believing face and eye-tracking alone will be additive enough to the glut of consumers. Yes, future headsets will probably have higher resolutions, more processing power, and hopefully be lighter and more comfortable than they are now. But at risk of belaboring the point, all of it needs to hit a real consumer price point to move the needle. Notably, there are a few consumer headsets on the market with face and eye-tracking currently: VIVE XR Elite, Pico 4 Pro, and Apple Vision Pro, the latter of which just launched its M5 hardware refresh for $3,500. None of those have garnered the incumbent consumer support to make them de facto competitors to Meta’s Quest 3/3S platform though. As an aside, Quest 3 is essentially a Quest Pro without face and eye-tracking—or the $1,500 price tag—which was eventually reduced to $1,000 to flush stock before it was discontinued earlier this year. Meta learned that lesson early on, it seems. Assuming the studio wants to continue pushing the boundaries of immersive design at scale like it did with Job Simulator in 2016, I’d imagine they’re doing what most developers are at this point: i.e. using these prosumer headsets as ad hoc developer kits in preparation for the next big consumer headset generation yet to come. When that will be, I just can’t say. This article may contain affiliate links. If you click an affiliate link and buy a product we may receive a small commission which helps support the publication. More information. I hope the guys at Owlchemy Labs have made some improvements in their hand-tracking interactions for the new Galaxy XR game. When they added hand-tracking to Job Simulator, I gave it a try on my Quest 3. During the short-order cook job, there is a spot where you have to pick up a can of soup and move it from one counter to another. Without any tactile feedback, I could not maintain the exact distance between my thumb and index finger while turning. Every time, my fingers would move slightly apart and the software said, 'Oh, you want to release the can', and the can would drop to the floor. Versus just holding down the grip button on the controller to hold the soup can. Okay, this particular instance could have been solved with a minor adjustment of the tolerances on their part, but it just highlights limitation on hand-tracking when you are trying to grip something that is not there in the real world versus using a controller. Already 1000 downloads on play store, not a bad start!

Title: Walking, talking humanoid robots are coming to society in 4-5 years: WEF
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/walking-talking-humanoid-robots-are-coming-to-society-in-4-5-years-wef/
Time Published: 2025-10-24T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
Humanoid robots will be walking and talking among us in the next four or five years, according to a discussion on tech regulation at the World Economic Forum (WEF). The joint WEF Annual Meetings of the Global Future Councils and Cybersecurity concluded on October 16, with discussions ranging from neurotech to food liberation and tech regulation. Speaking during the panel called “Regulation: Friend or Foe?” SandboxAQ CEO Jack Hidary said that humanoid robots would be entering society by 2030. “Introducing humanoid, walking, talking robots in our society is going to be a much bigger shock than any ChatGPT […] That’s only four-to-five years away”Jack Hidary, WEF Annual Meetings of the Global Future Councils and Cybersecurity, October 2025 "Introducing humanoid, walking, talking robots in our society is going to be a much bigger shock than any ChatGPT.. That's only 4-5 years away": SandboxAQ CEO Jack Hidary WEF Global Future Councils & Cybersecurity Meetings #AMGFCC25 https://t.co/Wj69Ccq95q pic.twitter.com/lpjkOPo2ua “This is going to be a very big shock to the system as we now have them [humanoid robots] enter into society. That’s only four or five years away“Jack Hidary, WEF Annual Meetings of the Global Future Councils and Cybersecurity, October 2025 “Right now in this room, as far as I know, we are all human, but four or five years from now at this very room when we have a global leadership futures council of the WEF in the UAE, we’re going to have humanoid robots in this room,” said Hidary. “They’ll be robots; they’ll be sitting in a chair; they’ll be taking notes, or doing other things, and we’re going to have to grapple with this as governments, as regulators, and as companies,” he added. One of the positives of having humanoid robots in society, according to Hidary, is that they are going to take care of the elderly in their own homes, so they don’t have to go to nursing homes. “As people get older, instead of having them go to a nursing home or other kinds of places, they can stay in their homes; they can be cared for by a robot”Jack Hidary, WEF Annual Meetings of the Global Future Councils and Cybersecurity, October 2025 “As people get older, instead of having them go to a nursing home or other kinds of places, they can stay in their homes. They can be cared for by a robot,” said Hidary. “I think we all think this is a very positive thing.” While robots looking after the elderly may be viewed as a positive thing, especially for those without family members, it does eliminate the human connection that people may crave. Let’s just hope it doesn’t turn into a dystopian sci-fi scenario like in the Netflix series “Cassandra” where the robot caregiver called Cassandra has some rather horrifying abandonment issues that lead to quite nefarious outcomes. Dystopian or not, Hidary said that “Introducing humanoid, walking, talking robots in our society is going to be a much bigger shock than any ChatGPT that we’ve now engaged with. “This is going to be a very big shock to the system as we now have them enter into society. That’s only four or five years away.” As far as which country will be best equipped to manage and integrate robots into society, Hidary made the case for Japan. “Japan I predict will be one of the society’s that best uses robots […] Because they have an aging society […] They see robots as part of the solution, not as a danger”Jack Hidary, WEF Annual Meetings of the Global Future Councils and Cybersecurity, October 2025 "Japan I predict will be one of the society's that best uses robots.. Because they have an aging society.. they see robots as part of the solution, not as a danger" SandboxAQ CEO Jack Hidary WEF Global Future Councils & Cybersecurity Meetings #AMGFCC25 https://t.co/Wj69Ccq95q pic.twitter.com/bYGOxTrZv2 Hidary praised Japan for preparing for the coming robots over the past 40 years while putting in place “regulations that make sure that robots are safe.” The SandboxAQ CEO’s words echo those of WEF interim co-chair and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink when he spoke at the 2024 WEF Special Meeting on Global Collaboration, Growth, and Energy Development. There, Fink argued that developed countries with shrinking populations would be better prepared for the social problems that come from “substituting humans for machines.” “I can argue in the developed countries the big winners are countries that have shrinking populations […] These countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology […] The social problems that one will have in substituting humans for machines is going to be far easier in those countries that have declining populations”Larry Fink, WEF Special Meeting on Global Collaboration, Growth, and Energy Development, April 2024 Larry Fink tells the WEF depopulation is a good thing. "In developed countries the big winners are those with shrinking populations.. They'll rapidly develop robotics/AI.. transform productivity.. elevate living standards.. substitute humans for machines" https://t.co/iPDzO9wyDw pic.twitter.com/0Xrw2grWFp “We always used to think shrinking population is a cause for negative growth, but in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries that have xenophobic immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in, shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology,” said Fink in April, 2024. “And if the promise, and it’s going to happen, if the promise of all of that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will, we’ll be able to elevate the standard of living of countries, the standard of living of individuals, even with shrinking populations,” he added. While Fink didn’t mention Japan directly, his words align with those of Hidary about robotics and aging populations. Going back to what Hidary said about humanoid robots entering society in four or five years, what will it take to get there? We can look to the 2025 WEF Annual Meeting of the New Champions, aka “Summer Davos” for some insights. On June 24, 2025, University of Twente professor Vanessa Evers explained that a digital twin of the entire world would be required to achieve “true robot intelligence.” “For true robot intelligence, you need to build a model of the world, like a digital twin of the entire world”Vanessa Evers, WEF Annual Meeting of the New Champions, June 2025 "For true ROBOT INTELLIGENCE, you need to build a model of the world, like a DIGITAL TWIN OF THE ENTIRE WORLD.. We can add SUPERHUMAN CAPABILITIES [listen to your heart, watch your breath to detect stress & pain]" Vanessa Evers, WEF Summer Davos #AMNC25 https://t.co/2U3dFg5CP0 pic.twitter.com/0jPjGG6HpD “We could add superhuman capabilities, listen to the heartbeat or watch the breath of a person to know stress, to know pain. We can detect dominance, aggression, creative flow — there’s all things you could detect in an automated way”Vanessa Evers, WEF Annual Meeting of the New Champions, June 2025 Creating a digital twin of the entire world is an extremely complex undertaking that goes way beyond Large Language Models like ChatGPT. In order to achieve true robot intelligence, a Large Behavioral Model would be needed to access and process enormous data from real world phenomena, which is far more complicated than creating and feeding Large Language Models. “ChatGPT has to choose from 26 characters. What is the best next character? But what about the real world? Imagine vision alone and we don’t have hearing, touch, taste, everything like that — just seeing stuff — if you would freeze-frame and then predict what is the next thing that’s going to happen in the visual, it would be impossible to know at the pixel level”Vanessa Evers, WEF Annual Meeting of the New Champions, June 2025 "In theory it would be possible to train a robot like a LLM, but then a Large Behavioral Model – to use a lot of data from the real world & have it predict the next best action" Professor Vanessa Evers, "Social Robots and I" WEF Summer Davos #AMNC25 https://t.co/2U3dFg54Zs pic.twitter.com/AELHRvffQO According to Evers, “In theory it would be possible to train a robot like a Large Language Model, but then a Large Behavioral Model — to use a lot of data from the real world and have it predict the next best action. “A Large Language Model predicts what is the next best token, but of course that is super complicated in the real world.“ Getting back to Hidary, he believes, that through periodic meetings between stakeholders, humanoid robot regulation should have the capacity to update itself. He said, “One way to make sure there’s a level playing field for all players in the field is for the government to convene the players, to listen to them, and to keep a process that in the regulation itself, it says, every six months or something like that, there should be a convening of the key stakeholders, and we shall update it. “Put that into the regulation itself to recognize that any robot law we say today is irrelevant four or five years from now, and that law four or five years from now is irrelevant 10 years from now.” “Let’s build in the ability to update itself into the very regulation itself.” The special joint session of the WEF “Annual Meeting of the Global Future Councils and the Annual Meeting on Cybersecurity” convened more than 500 experts from business, government, civil society, academia and media, alongside 150 of the world’s foremost cybersecurity leaders from October 14-16 in Dubai, UAE.

Wall Street bank JPMorgan (JPM) upgraded Coinbase (COIN) to "overweight" from "neutral" and raised its price target to $404, citing new monetization opportunities and reduced risks that make the crypto exchange appear more attractive compared to its peers. The shares were about 4% higher in early trading, around $332. The bank highlighted two key catalysts: a potential Base token and enhanced USDC payouts. JPMorgan analysts said that Coinbase is exploring a token for Base, its Layer 2 blockchain launched in August 2023, which has grown into one of the largest in the ecosystem. A token could allow Coinbase to capture more of Base’s growth, with the bank estimating a possible $12 billion to $34 billion market cap and up to $12 billion in value accruing to Coinbase. The move, JPMorgan said, could spur development, community participation and long-term infrastructure growth. The bank's analysts also noted Coinbase’s efforts to better monetize USDC by offering yields to customers through its Coinbase One subscription service. By segmenting users and offering 4% returns to subscribers, Coinbase could add about $1 per share in annual earnings, JPMorgan said. While competition from decentralized exchanges (DEXs) remains a risk, the analysts said market share between DEXs and centralized exchanges has stabilized. It added that Coinbase’s integrated model, spanning brokerage, market making, exchange and custody, should help sustain profitability even if fees decline. JPMorgan valued Coinbase at 50 times projected 2027 earnings, factoring in $4 billion from a potential Base token, and set a December 2026 price target of $404.

A SECOND MAN has been found guilty of the murder of a man whose skeletonised remains were found in a jute bag in a ravine in Whitewell, Rostellan in East Cork last year. Kieran Quilligan (47) from Togher in Cork was last seen alive on 1 September 2023. He was missing for five months when his remains were detected on 29 January 2024 after gardaí brought a cadaver dog to scrubland in the county. The jury of ten men and two women at the Central Criminal Court in Cork heard that he had been beaten with a hammer like weapon. Mr Quilligan suffered multiple bone fractures. However, an exact cause of death could not be determined because of the decomposition of organs. The jury spent close to six hours deliberating before today finding Luke Taylor (27) previously of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock in Cork guilty of murder. His co accused Niall Long (33) formerly of St Michael’s Close in Mahon in Cork was yesterday found guilty of the murder of Mr Quilligan. Justice Siobhan Lankford thanked the jurors for their diligent service and excused them from jury service for a period of ten years. Both men now face mandatory life sentences. Long and Taylor were remanded in custody for sentencing on 29 October next at 10.30am. Meanwhile, over the course of the trial Prosecution senior counsel, Donal O’Sullivan, noted that the jury had watched a “staggering amount” of CCTV with gardaí harvesting thousands of hours of footage. O’Sullivan also indicated that but for the incredible garda investigation the remains of Mr Quilligan might never have been found. In his opening speech to the jury O’Sullivan said that the “instigating factor” in the murder was an incident where Kieran Quilligan and another man allegedly stole drugs and cash from Niall Long on 1 September 2023. The jury heard that Mr Quilligan left his apartment in Cork later that evening with Luke Taylor telling his partner he would be back in a matter of minutes. Mr Quilligan was tracked walking to St Finbarr’s Place in Cork city alongside Luke Taylor. He never emerged from the lane. The Prosecution evidence was that a car was brought to the top of the lane and that Mr Quilligan was bundled in to the boot. Advertisement The car was tracked going to Little Island in Co Cork and subsequently heading to Rostellan where the remains of the deceased were found on 29 January 2024. In his closing speech to the jury, O’Sullivan said that Kieran Quilligan was “lured” to his death by Luke Taylor. He stated that Taylor brought him to a laneway at St Finbarr’s Place in Cork city on 1 September 2023 where he and Long “ambushed” him. He described the activities of the two men as a joint enterprise. The jury also heard evidence from Assistant State Pathologist, Dr Margaret Bolster who carried out a postmortem on the remains of Mr Quilligan. Dr Bolster made an examination of the body at the scene. She described going down a ravine off a roadway where there was a jute grave. Underneath this was another jute gravel bag with a “pelvic bone protruding.” Dr Bolster said she could see ribs and a skull with a “bag around it tied with a knot.” The skull was separate from the body and there was a large amount of silt and vegetation. Dr Bolster noted a cable tie around the left ankle and right shin of the remains and two knotted pieces of plastic around the neck. She said that they were likely to have been used for the purposes of moving the body. Dr Bolster said that the injuries sustained by Mr Quilligan were consistent with a “severe assault in a laneway.” Those injuries included fractures to his ribs, chest, leg and hand bones, jaw bones, neck and skull. Dr Bolster said whilst the remains were skeletonised there was a small piece of skin remaining which consisted of a tattoo with the word “Mother” and a date. In the course of the trial the jury heard evidence from Garda James Byrd who said that on 8 September 2023 Luke Taylor called to Anglesea Street Garda Station. He said that he was “concerned for the welfare of his friend and wanted to assist gardaí.” He informed gardaí that he had been in the company of Quilligan on the night he was last seen but that they had parted ways in Cork city centre. The trial also heard evidence from Det Garda Anne O’Sullivan who said that in March of 2024 Luke Taylor sent a text to his girlfriend saying that this man Quilligan “was killed in an unknown place unknown time.” He further stated “I’m not the person that was robbed. I had nothing to do with that.” In the text exchange Taylor insisted that his only involvement was that he bought drugs off Niall Long. He also texted “they’re trying to put me in the mix.” The jurors also heard evidence from Sgt Maurice O’Connor. He said that Niall Long had sent a text message to his mother Janice Long on 2 September 2023. She texted him saying that her jeep smelled of Dettol. Sgt O’Connor said that Long texted his mother. In his reply he stated that the boot of the car was cleaned because “the fella that robbed me got a hiding and was thrown in the boot after.” To embed this post, copy the code below on your site 600px wide <iframe width="600" height="460" frameborder="0" style="border:0px;" src="https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/second-man-found-guilty-of-murdering-kieran-quilligan-in-cork-6854440-Oct2025/?embedpost=6854440&width=600&height=460" ></iframe> 400px wide <iframe width="600" height="460" frameborder="0" style="border:0px;" src="https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/second-man-found-guilty-of-murdering-kieran-quilligan-in-cork-6854440-Oct2025/?embedpost=6854440&width=400&height=460" ></iframe> 300px wide <iframe width="600" height="460" frameborder="0" style="border:0px;" src="https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/second-man-found-guilty-of-murdering-kieran-quilligan-in-cork-6854440-Oct2025/?embedpost=6854440&width=300&height=460" ></iframe> Create an email alert based on the current article

A second man has been found guilty of the murder of a man who was bludgeoned to death and dumped in scrub land following a row over the robbery and theft of drugs and cash in Cork City. Luke Taylor (27), formerly of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock, Cork, had denied the murder of Kieran Quilligan (47) on a date unknown between September 1st, 2023, and January 29th, 2024, when he was arraigned at the Central Criminal Court sitting in Cork earlier this month. On Friday afternoon, the jury of 10 men and two women returned after five hours and 44 minutes of deliberations and found Taylor guilty of the murder of Mr Quilligan, whose skeletal remains were found five months after he was murdered by Taylor and co-accused Niall Long. Ms Justice Siobhan Lankford remanded both Taylor and Long, formerly of St Michael’s Close, Mahon, Cork, in custody for sentence on October 29th when the court will hear victim impact statements from the Quiligan family. Long was convicted on Thursday of the murder. During the trial, the jury heard Mr Quilligan’s murder had its origins in an incident where he and another man robbed Long of drugs and cash in Cork City on September 1st, 2023. Mr Quilligan disappeared later that day. The deceased man’s partner Colette O’Driscoll said the last time she saw her partner was when he left their apartment at Riverview on Anderson’s Quay in Cork City centre, accompanied by Taylor, shortly before 9pm on the night of September 1st, 2023. When he failed to return home, she reported him missing to An Garda Síochána three days later on September 4th. She said she reported Mr Quilligan’s disappearance because she was starting to hear rumours. When she met Luke Taylor in town some days later he said he didn’t know what happened to Mr Quilligan, as he had left him at Morrison’s Island on September 1st. The jury heard gardaí tracked Mr Quilligan on CCTV walking with Taylor up the quays in Cork City to St Finbar’s Place. He went up some steps near St Fin Barre’s Cathedral but there was no sign of him ever emerging at the top of the steps on to Fort Street. They heard evidence a white Toyota Rav 4, registered to Long’s mother Janice, was seen entering Fort Street and reversing into the steps at the top of St Finbarr’s Place. It left the area and drove to Little Island in east Cork. They were shown CCTV footage of the same vehicle calling to the Rochestown Park Hotel in Cork on September 4th, where Taylor got in.It again headed towards Rostellan in east Cork where Mr Quilligan’s skeletal remains were found on January 29th, 2024. Assistant State Pathologist Dr Margot Bolster said she was unable to say exactly when Mr Quilligan had died or give a precise cause of death, due to the length of time between his death and the postmortem which had resulted in the decay and disappearance of all soft tissue and organs. Dr Bolster said it was clear Mr Quilligan had been the victim of a serious assault, as he had suffered numerous injuries, including fractures of the temporal bone, parietal bone and mandible or jawbone in the head as well as fractures to several ribs, leg bones and hand bones. She said several of the fractures suggested a blow with a blunt instrument like a hammer. Dr Sarah Fleming of Forensic Science Ireland said blood stains found in the boot of the Toyota Rav 4 provided a DNA match with Mr Quilligan.

Title: How High Will David Ellison Go in Paramount’s Bid to Bag Warner Bros. Discovery?

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Warner Bros. Discovery is smack in the eye of the latest media M&A maelstrom — and staffers are bracing for the possibility that they’ll get a new corporate overlord in the near future. The leading takeover candidate is aspiring Hollywood empire-builder David Ellison, son of one of the world’s wealthiest people. Ellison, fresh off orchestrating Skydance’s merger with Paramount, is now aggressively chasing a much bigger quarry in Warner Bros. Discovery. Related Stories Music Industry Moves: Kid Harpoon Named First Producer in Residence at Abbey Road Studios Music Industry Moves: Melanie C of the Spice Girls Partners With Virgin Music Group for New Releases This week, WBD chief David Zaslav and the company’s board publicly announced that they’re doing due diligence on in-bound acquisition interest from “multiple parties.” The company didn’t name Paramount or any others that have made M&A overtures. But Ellison has been driving especially hard to win over WBD and Zaslav with a series of escalating offers backed in part by his dad, Larry Ellison (net worth: more than $330 billion). Popular on Variety In three letters to the WBD board, Ellison proffered bids of $19, $22 and $23.50 per share, the last coming Oct. 13, a source with knowledge of the matter says, confirming a New York Times report. That last offer would value WBD at more than $58 billion; separately, the company carries net debt of nearly $36 billion. (Warner Bros. Discovery shares closed at $21.25 a share on Oct. 23, up 69% since news of Ellison’s interest broke last month.) Ellison, looking to do some ego-massaging, even gave Zaslav the opportunity to become co-chief executive and co-chairman of a merged Paramount-WBD in his most recent missive. Each bid was rejected by WBD’s board. (Company reps declined to comment.) What Happens if Paramount Acquires Warner Bros. Discovery? HBO Max-Paramount+ Combination, Huge Layoffs and More Obviously, the Ellisons and their investment partners have a ceiling: They’re not going to go after Warner Bros. Discovery at any price. Their latest $23.50/share proposal is not a best and final offer. Now that WBD’s board has kicked off an M&A review process and is opening its books, the Paramount camp will have an opportunity to come back with a higher (or modified) bid. But it’s understood that Ellison believes he has the pole position among would-be buyers of WBD and is unlikely to go much higher on deal price. Zaslav, of course, is eager to pit rival suitors against each other to get a maximum dollar figure for WBD, either as a whole or in pieces. “It’s no surprise that the significant value of our portfolio is receiving increased recognition by others in the market,” he said in the company’s statement Tuesday. Netflix, Amazon and Apple are said to be in the mix as prospective buyers, but likely only for WBD’s studios and streaming businesses. That aligns with Warner Bros. Discovery’s already-underway plan to split into two companies by mid-2026: Warner Bros., housing HBO Max and the studios, and Discovery Global, largely comprising the TV networks. But one senior industry exec tells Variety that for the tech-oriented companies, WBD as a whole — inclusive of TV networks — “is just not core” to their growth strategies. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos told investors on its Q3 earnings call that the company has “no interest in owning legacy media networks,” pouring cold water on the prospect of a deal for WBD in its entirety. While Sarandos left the door open by saying Netflix can be “choosy” about its M&A targets, he added: “Nothing is a must-have for us to meet our goals that we have for the business.” In its announcement, WBD said it would consider a sale of the separated Warner Bros. entity to a third party, alongside a spinoff of Discovery Global to shareholders. Meanwhile, there’s been speculation that Sony might make a play for WBD, but sources tell Variety the company is not interested. Comcast is circling Warner Bros., but it is also unloading most of its cable TV assets into spinoff company Versant, potentially complicating any talks to buy WBD. Plus, analysts say, Trump’s enmity toward CEO Brian Roberts gives the Ellisons — who are palsy with the president — a better shot at getting a deal cleared. Trump, upset about MSNBC’s coverage of him, once called Roberts the “chairman of ‘Concast’” and a “lowlife.” “Given past commentary against all-things-Comcast from both the White House and the FCC over the past year, a successful Comcast acquisition of almost anything seems nearly unthinkable,” MoffettNathanson principal analyst Craig Moffett said in an Oct. 21 note to clients. What’s behind Ellison’s desire to marry Paramount with Warner Bros. Discovery? It’s the same trends that have whipped across the media biz for the past several years, says Scott Purdy, media strategy leader for professional services firm KPMG U.S. Big media companies have seen a decline in their linear TV business, and “industries in decline tend to consolidate,” Purdy says. “The one major factor is scale.” In addition, he says, buyers often want to snap up high-value entertainment franchises and intellectual property — partly to keep them out of the hands of competitors. A Paramount-WBD megamerger would entail a massive tranche of layoffs, letting the new entity consolidate functions across corporate divisions, studios, TV and streaming. In the meantime, Ellison and his team are expected to begin mass layoffs at Paramount Skydance next week, eliminating around 2,000 jobs in the U.S., with additional cuts internationally. Ellison, speaking earlier this month at L.A.’s Bloomberg Screentime conference, would not confirm that Paramount Skydance has made a bid for WBD. But he explained why he thinks Paramount needs to bolt on more content-producing engines to achieve sustainable growth in a streaming-centric world. He even cited Zaslav’s comments from a year ago that the industry needs more consolidation. “I do think there’s a lot of [M&A] options out there in terms of what actually might be actionable in the near future,” Ellison said. “You actually need more content to yield more engagement.” Now that Warner Bros. Discovery has commenced a formal M&A review process, the question is whether Ellison will come back with an even higher offer — and whether the WBD board believes it’s really the best path forward.

Title: This 7.7% Dividend Is The Last Cheap AI Stock
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2025/10/24/this-77-dividend-is-the-last-cheap-ai-stock/
Time Published: 2025-10-24T12:15:00Z

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. If I can give you one piece of advice now, it’s this: Don’t fear this talk of an AI bubble. In fact, we should love it, because it’s set to hand us a shot at big dividends and gains—especially in closed-end funds (CEFs), which yield around 8% today and regularly hand us “dividend deals” that simply shouldn’t exist. Our job: Buy, then ride along as CEF investors, who tend to be slowpokes compared to stock buyers, finally come around and bid our funds’ prices up. And we collect those rich dividends—often paid monthly—while we wait. One CEF is giving us just such a nonsensical discount today: a 7.7%-payer called the Virtus Artificial Intelligence & Technology Opportunities Fund (AIO). This one holds many key AI players, including Meta Platforms (META), NVIDIA (NVDA), Oracle (ORCL) and Microsoft (MSFT), as well as some companies that stand to gain as they work AI into their daily operations, like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Citigroup (C). With most of these stocks skyrocketing, AIO should be pricey (“artificial intelligence” is right in the name, after all!). But it’s ridiculously cheap, trading at a 6.7% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of the AI stocks it owns). And any selloff in AI stocks would make it even cheaper. Which leads us back to the question on everyone’s mind: Are we in an AI-driven bubble? That’s critical to a buy of AIO now, so let’s dive in. We’ll start with an often-overlooked measure of where people’s heads are: a chart of common Google searches, in this case for the term “stock market bubble.” You can see at the right side of this chart that the term has been gaining since hitting a low in September 2024. It’s now at its highest point in almost five years. Why the bubble fears? Well, if you’ve been investing for a long time, your experience likely includes the popping of two major bubbles: the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s and real estate in 2008. A couple generations were traumatized by those events, and as a result, we’re now in a kind of “bubble” of bubble talk. But are we really in an AI bubble? I’d say no. To start, let’s present the bubble case at its most dire: A Harvard academic recently suggested that, without AI investment, America’s GDP growth would’ve been a meager 0.1% in the first half of 2025. There are a lot of problems with this argument. For one, it ignores the fact that a lot of AI investment is imported from abroad (Bloomberg estimates that imports account for about half of all AI investment), and GDP only measures productivity inside a country. Bloomberg estimates that America’s 1.6% growth in the first half of 2025 would probably be more like 1.1% without AI investment. So, to be sure, AI is contributing much, but not most, of the country’s GDP growth, let alone all of it. Anyone trying to convince you otherwise is simply fear-mongering. Don’t take the bait—especially when other indicators point to a stable economy: This chart, for example, tells us that over the last year, Americans have been less delinquent on their credit cards than they were a year ago, and the overall percentage is pretty small—now about 3.1%, much lower than it was in the 1990s and 2000s. But let’s keep the focus on AI for a moment longer, because it sets up just how out of step that discount on our 7.7%-paying AI fund, AIO, really is. This chart comes from a recent Yale study showing that the share of workers exposed to AI hasn’t changed since the tech was released. “If AI were automating jobs at scale, we would expect to see a smaller share of workers in some of the jobs that are most negatively impacted,” the authors wrote. Yet this chart shows no change at all. In other words, AI isn’t making Americans poorer. It isn’t taking their jobs, and it isn’t a bubble set to burst. That doesn’t mean it won’t turn into any of those things—but it is none of them now. And that sets us up for a tempting trade. If AI starts taking jobs or making Americans feel more uncertain, we should expect a stock pullback that would hit all sectors, including AI names like Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta and, of course, NVIDIA. If AI doesn’t take jobs because the tech doesn’t wind up meeting expectations, AI investment will drop and, again, take down names like Google, Meta and NVIDIA. Of course, everyone is watching these companies’ stocks like hawks, eager to sell at any sign of trouble. And that’s why, if we see a selloff driven by fear that any of the above-mentioned things will happen without data backing that up, they’ll be great buys. That’s where AIO comes back into the picture. It’s a diversified play on AI that rewards investors with that healthy 7.7% dividend, which comes our way monthly. It’s also a fund we know well at my CEF Insider service: We bought it in September 2020—long before AI was on investors’ radar—and rode it to a nice 23% total return (including its 6.4% dividend at the time we bought) in the following three years. And, as I mentioned before, AIO is cheap today. In fact, it’s cheaper than it was during the April “tariff terror, ” if you can believe it. That’s a setup that makes no sense at all! Yet here it is: We saw last spring’s deep discount flip to a premium by June. Now that premium has disappeared again, and AIO is back in bargain-bin territory. That doesn’t mean it’s worth buying now—but it does mean AIO is more sensitive to sentiment than the AI stocks it invests in. If investors sell off AI stocks, they’ll sell off AIO aggressively, opening up an even bigger discount and boosting its yield (since prices move in opposition to yields). That will be the time to pounce. Meantime, we’ll keep watching AIO and waiting for that bigger dividend, and discount, to materialize, thanks to the crowd’s overwrought bubble fears.

A second man has been found guilty of the murder of a 47-year-old man whose remains were found in a jute bag in a ravine in Whitewell, Rostellan, in Cork, last year. Luke Taylor, aged 27, with an address at Cherry Lawn, Blackrock, in Cork, was found guilty by a jury this morning. His co-accused, 33-year-old Niall Long, formerly of St Michael's Close, in Mahon, in Cork, was yesterday also found guilty of the murder of Kieran Quilligan. Mr Quilligan, 47, from Togher in Cork, was last seen alive on 1 September 2023. He was missing for five months when his remains were discovered on 29 January 2024, after gardaí brought a cadaver dog to search an area of scrubland. The Central Criminal Court sitting in Cork heard that he had been beaten with a hammer like weapon. Mr Quilligan suffered multiple bone fractures. However, an exact cause of death could not be determined because of the decomposition of the body. Both men now face mandatory life sentences and were remanded in custody for sentencing on 29 October. In his closing speech to the jury, prosecution senior counsel Donal O'Sullivan said that Mr Quilligan was "lured" to his death. He stated that Taylor brought him to a laneway at St Finbarr's Place in Cork city on 1 September 2023 where he and Long "ambushed" him. Mr O'Sullivan said that the men then threw Mr Quilligan in to the boot of a car. He said that the "instigating factor" in relation to what occurred involved Mr Quilligan stealing drugs from Long earlier that day. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Frustrated by AI? How to Turn the Hype Into Real Results for Your Business

In some ways, Gartner's annual IT conference was a departure from previous years. There was a lot more discussion of disappointing returns on AI investments thus far, alongside suggestions for how enterprises should plan for AI playing a more important role over the next few years. Gartner analysts Alicia Mullery and Daryl Plummer acknowledged that it's easy to dismiss the impact of AI since most firms have yet to see the transformative impact. However, they cautioned against falling for the hype and instead backed a "golden path" whereby value can be found in between those two extremes. In 2025, Gartner put the odds of an AI initiative achieving a return on investment at one in five, Mullery said. The odds of an AI initiative achieving true transformation was just one in 50. Plummer noted that a recent study of chief financial officers showed that 74% say they are seeing productivity gains, but only 11% are seeing return on investment. To counter this, Mullery and Plummer proposed a new "positioning system" looking at both the readiness of AI systems and the readiness of humans to take advantage of that. When neither is ready, Plummer said, you should be highly skeptical of AI. When both are ready, "we flip a switch into AI optimism." Right now, he said, AI systems are almost halfway up the scale, but humans are only a quarter of the way. This makes value hard to achieve. Mullery noted that most AI systems currently have questionable readiness; for instance, generative AI systems have an error rate of up to 25% depending on the use case. That may be good enough for some applications, but not all. Worse, she said, Gartner surveys suggest that 84% of CIOs and IT leaders say they don't have a formal process to check accuracy, beyond having a "human in the loop." "AI can make mistakes faster than we humans can catch them," she said, calling on IT leaders to create their own "accuracy survival kit" with things such as formal metrics, a two-factor error checking, and a "good enough ratio." This is "harder to achieve than you think," she argued. Plummer noted that AI agents "are at the top of the hype cycle" now, with 17% of organizations saying they have adopted agents already and another 42% expecting to adopt them in the next 12 months. "But not all agents are created equal," he said, noting that 88% of the IT leaders are focused on conversational agents, not ones involved in decision making. For that, he said, we'll need multi-agent systems, with reasoning and autonomous decision making that can actually perform the "jobs to be done" such as one that could create the slides for a presentation by just listening to him talking. This kind of agent won't be cheap. Mullery noted that the big problem is that even if you think you know the costs of running AI on day one of the project, you don't know what it will cost on day 100, unlike most IT projects. In fact, 74% of organizations are breaking even or even losing money on their AI investments. That's partly because they don't recognize the ancillary costs, such as managing access credentials, acquiring new data sets, or accuracy tools, as well as time spent on training and change management, Plummer explained. Then there is the issue of picking the right AI vendor. Plummer noted that large AI vendors are acting like "Digital Nation States," spending more on AI infrastructure per quarter than the annual GDP of 47% of the world's countries. Mullery suggested that if you're planning a massive rollout of AI to your enterprise, you should bet on a major hyperscaler such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Alibaba, or Oracle. But if you want industry-specific use cases, you'll need to partner with startups. And for leading edge capabilities, you should look to "wild card" vendors such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, DeepSeek, and Mistral AI. Within this is also the question of "AI sovereignty"—not just the data, but also the models, results, and users. Plummer said the US, China, and the European Union are building sovereign AI solutions with proprietary models that they control and predicted that 35% of countries will be locked into region-specific AI platforms using proprietary contextual data by 2027. He warned that if you're a global enterprise, you might get locked out of a long-term partner relationship, so he suggested big companies look into digital tokenization solutions that anonymize data, so the real data doesn't leave your shore. When it comes to human readiness, Mullery noted that 71% of CIOs and IT leaders say their workforce is not ready for AI "because AI unleashes a toxic mix of steep learning curve and the primal fear that AI is going to replace us." But despite the scare headlines, while 60% of CFOs are expecting they can reduce head count due to AI, in reality only about 1% of job loss is due to AI today. "It's not about job loss. It's about job chaos," Plummer said, noting that job and role restructuring is having 20 times more impact than layoffs. Instead, he said, Gartner is seeing hiring restraint for junior level jobs. So instead of looking for a "talent remix," Mullery urged executives to think about a "value remix" —doing things such as cutting the backlog and increasing roles that require human empathy. While there may be some layoffs, demographic shifts and labor force stagnation will balance it out. "By 2027, AI will create more jobs than it destroys. But the sad fact is, there won't be enough new people to hire," she said. So, the best thing you can do is train your workers to use AI well, with one intent being creating "Swiss army knife" workers who can pick the tools to solve any given task. For that, she said, you need AI literacy and experiential knowledge. They both discussed how it was important to be on the lookout for behavioral changes driven by AI. Perhaps no department is as likely to see disruption as IT itself. "In 2030, your IT organization will look completely different," Mullery said. According to a Gartner study of CIOs, 81% of IT work is done by humans without AI. By 2030, CIOs expect 75% of IT work will be done by humans augmented with AI, and 25% will be done by AI alone. Zero percent of IT work will be done without AI. This will change your entire IT estate, she said, and create extra capacity, so it's up to leaders to demonstrate extra IT value. One issue Plummer identified was using this extra capability to make up for worker shortages caused by the demographic changes. Other changes will impact the business more directly, creating what Plummer called "shock waves." For instance, he said, as AI takes over more diagnosis and virtual care allows more recovery at home, hospitals will become primarily treatment centers. Today, we are gradually adding machine autonomy around the edges of our organizations, Mullery said, moving us towards autonomous business. This is the new "agentic battleground" where multiple vendors compete to deliver teams of machine workers ready at a moment's notice. But Plummer insisted that "If we keep fighting to protect our roles of the past, we'll never reimagine our roles for the future." He said the day may come when we collectively decide we will choose not to do things like managing operations or configuring system and instead choose to have people primary nurture human connectedness. "We decide what humans will do and what AI will," he said. He even showed a digital twin of himself – AI Daryl – that could present ideas the way he would when he's not available. Such technology might uncover value hidden in the data you already have and prevent the "retirement brain drain" by training such systems on the documentation, code reviews, and meeting records of retiring employees. "When humans and AI are ready, we can transcend and ride the AI shockwaves," Mullery concluded. "Let's bring it all together and retrace our path to find, capture, and sustain value. You have to get both Ai and humans ready." Michael J. Miller is chief information officer at Ziff Brothers Investments, a private investment firm.

Title: Frustrated by AI? How to Turn the Hype Into Real Results for Your Business

Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. In some ways, Gartner's annual IT conference was a departure from previous years. There was a lot more discussion of disappointing returns on AI investments thus far, alongside suggestions for how enterprises should plan for AI playing a more important role over the next few years. Gartner analysts Alicia Mullery and Daryl Plummer acknowledged that it's easy to dismiss the impact of AI since most firms have yet to see the transformative impact. However, they cautioned against falling for the hype and instead backed a "golden path" whereby value can be found in between those two extremes. In 2025, Gartner put the odds of an AI initiative achieving a return on investment at one in five, Mullery said. The odds of an AI initiative achieving true transformation was just one in 50. Plummer noted that a recent study of chief financial officers showed that 74% say they are seeing productivity gains, but only 11% are seeing return on investment. To counter this, Mullery and Plummer proposed a new "positioning system" looking at both the readiness of AI systems and the readiness of humans to take advantage of that. When neither is ready, Plummer said, you should be highly skeptical of AI. When both are ready, "we flip a switch into AI optimism." Right now, he said, AI systems are almost halfway up the scale, but humans are only a quarter of the way. This makes value hard to achieve. Mullery noted that most AI systems currently have questionable readiness; for instance, generative AI systems have an error rate of up to 25% depending on the use case. That may be good enough for some applications, but not all. Worse, she said, Gartner surveys suggest that 84% of CIOs and IT leaders say they don't have a formal process to check accuracy, beyond having a "human in the loop." "AI can make mistakes faster than we humans can catch them," she said, calling on IT leaders to create their own "accuracy survival kit" with things such as formal metrics, a two-factor error checking, and a "good enough ratio." This is "harder to achieve than you think," she argued. Plummer noted that AI agents "are at the top of the hype cycle" now, with 17% of organizations saying they have adopted agents already and another 42% expecting to adopt them in the next 12 months. "But not all agents are created equal," he said, noting that 88% of the IT leaders are focused on conversational agents, not ones involved in decision making. For that, he said, we'll need multi-agent systems, with reasoning and autonomous decision making that can actually perform the "jobs to be done" such as one that could create the slides for a presentation by just listening to him talking. This kind of agent won't be cheap. Mullery noted that the big problem is that even if you think you know the costs of running AI on day one of the project, you don't know what it will cost on day 100, unlike most IT projects. In fact, 74% of organizations are breaking even or even losing money on their AI investments. That's partly because they don't recognize the ancillary costs, such as managing access credentials, acquiring new data sets, or accuracy tools, as well as time spent on training and change management, Plummer explained. Then there is the issue of picking the right AI vendor. Plummer noted that large AI vendors are acting like "Digital Nation States," spending more on AI infrastructure per quarter than the annual GDP of 47% of the world's countries. Mullery suggested that if you're planning a massive rollout of AI to your enterprise, you should bet on a major hyperscaler such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Alibaba, or Oracle. But if you want industry-specific use cases, you'll need to partner with startups. And for leading edge capabilities, you should look to "wild card" vendors such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, DeepSeek, and Mistral AI. Within this is also the question of "AI sovereignty"—not just the data, but also the models, results, and users. Plummer said the US, China, and the European Union are building sovereign AI solutions with proprietary models that they control and predicted that 35% of countries will be locked into region-specific AI platforms using proprietary contextual data by 2027. He warned that if you're a global enterprise, you might get locked out of a long-term partner relationship, so he suggested big companies look into digital tokenization solutions that anonymize data, so the real data doesn't leave your shore. When it comes to human readiness, Mullery noted that 71% of CIOs and IT leaders say their workforce is not ready for AI "because AI unleashes a toxic mix of steep learning curve and the primal fear that AI is going to replace us." But despite the scare headlines, while 60% of CFOs are expecting they can reduce head count due to AI, in reality only about 1% of job loss is due to AI today. "It's not about job loss. It's about job chaos," Plummer said, noting that job and role restructuring is having 20 times more impact than layoffs. Instead, he said, Gartner is seeing hiring restraint for junior level jobs. So instead of looking for a "talent remix," Mullery urged executives to think about a "value remix" —doing things such as cutting the backlog and increasing roles that require human empathy. While there may be some layoffs, demographic shifts and labor force stagnation will balance it out. "By 2027, AI will create more jobs than it destroys. But the sad fact is, there won't be enough new people to hire," she said. So, the best thing you can do is train your workers to use AI well, with one intent being creating "Swiss army knife" workers who can pick the tools to solve any given task. For that, she said, you need AI literacy and experiential knowledge. They both discussed how it was important to be on the lookout for behavioral changes driven by AI. Perhaps no department is as likely to see disruption as IT itself. "In 2030, your IT organization will look completely different," Mullery said. According to a Gartner study of CIOs, 81% of IT work is done by humans without AI. By 2030, CIOs expect 75% of IT work will be done by humans augmented with AI, and 25% will be done by AI alone. Zero percent of IT work will be done without AI. This will change your entire IT estate, she said, and create extra capacity, so it's up to leaders to demonstrate extra IT value. One issue Plummer identified was using this extra capability to make up for worker shortages caused by the demographic changes. Other changes will impact the business more directly, creating what Plummer called "shock waves." For instance, he said, as AI takes over more diagnosis and virtual care allows more recovery at home, hospitals will become primarily treatment centers. Today, we are gradually adding machine autonomy around the edges of our organizations, Mullery said, moving us towards autonomous business. This is the new "agentic battleground" where multiple vendors compete to deliver teams of machine workers ready at a moment's notice. But Plummer insisted that "If we keep fighting to protect our roles of the past, we'll never reimagine our roles for the future." He said the day may come when we collectively decide we will choose not to do things like managing operations or configuring system and instead choose to have people primary nurture human connectedness.

Such technology might uncover value hidden in the data you already have and prevent the "retirement brain drain" by training such systems on the documentation, code reviews, and meeting records of retiring employees.

Title: JPMorgan Chase to start accepting Bitcoin, Ethereum as loan collateral: report

Time Published: 2025-10-24T11:02:30Z
Full Content:
JPMorgan Chase & Co. is reportedly preparing to let institutional clients use BTC and ETH as collateral for loans by the end of the year, as per a Bloomberg report. The move marks one of the most significant steps yet by a major US bank toward integrating digital assets into traditional finance, signalling how fast cryptocurrencies are moving from the periphery to the core of global banking. For years, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon was one of the fiercest critics of Bitcoin, calling it a “decentralised Ponzi scheme” and claiming that only criminals used it. Dimon’s comments often shaped how Wall Street viewed the cryptocurrency market. But Dimon’s tone has softened in recent years, especially since Donald Trump’s 2024 election win, which brought regulatory changes that have made it easier for banks to engage with digital assets. Now, Dimon’s JPMorgan is taking a major step that would have seemed unthinkable just a few years ago. The bank’s new program will reportedly allow institutional clients to pledge their Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings as collateral for loans. The assets will be held by a third-party custodian, ensuring compliance with existing financial and regulatory standards. Speculation about JPMorgan’s crypto-collateral plans first emerged earlier this year when the Financial Times reported that the bank was exploring such a move, potentially by 2026. At the time, scepticism ran high. Dimon’s long record of dismissing Bitcoin, combined with banks’ cautious approach to regulatory uncertainty, made the plan seem remote. However, the landscape has changed rapidly in 2025. With Bitcoin trading above $111,000 and Ethereum nearing $4,000, the digital asset market has reached unprecedented maturity and capitalisation. Bitcoin’s market cap has surged to over $2.2 trillion, while Ethereum’s market cap has climbed to nearly $478 billion. The rise in these asset prices, combined with increased institutional demand, has made cryptocurrencies more appealing as loan collateral. JPMorgan’s initiative will expand on its earlier decision to accept crypto-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as collateral. JPMorgan’s shift mirrors a broader transformation across the financial sector. Morgan Stanley plans to open cryptocurrency access to retail investors through its E*Trade platform in the first half of next year. State Street, BNY Mellon, and Fidelity are all expanding their digital asset custody services, while BlackRock recently introduced new mechanisms allowing investors to convert Bitcoin directly into ETF holdings. Even long-time sceptics like Standard Chartered have revised their stance, recognising the growing importance of cryptocurrencies in global finance. These moves indicate that digital assets are no longer being viewed as speculative outliers but as legitimate components of diversified financial systems.

Title: Wall Street Banks Come to the “Rescue” of Milei’s Argentina Just Days Before Make-or-Break Elections

JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon landed in Buenos Aires this week to attend an event the Wall Street lender is holding, precisely at a time that the bank is in negotiations to arrange a $20 billion loan for the Argentine government. The timing was apparently pure coincidence, given the event was organised long before talk of a rescue package, reports Bloomberg: [B]ut it means some of the bank’s top brass will be on the ground just as doubts grow that US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will be able to pull off the second half of his rescue package for the Javier Milei government: a $20 billion bank-led loan. Other Wall Street banks involved include Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Citigroup. If they were to activate credit lines for Argentina, it would bolster the USD 20 billion currency swap that was formalised on Monday, notes Bloomberg. Time is of the essence, however, given the country will vote in mid-term legislative elections on Sunday and the country’s peso continues to sink despite the Trump administration’s rescue package. There’s a lot riding on the results, including that rescue package: BREAKING: In a shocking moment, Trump appears to engage in foreign election interference, saying the U.S. will only give Argentina foreign aid if his pal Milei wins. "If he loses, we will not be generous with Argentina." Extreme corruption.pic.twitter.com/RJ1DjFMgm8 — Really American 🇺🇸 (@ReallyAmerican1) October 14, 2025 Dimon will be joined on his visit by the current joint chairman of JP Morgan’s International Council, Tony Blair, who will be taking a few days out from his new role as “modern-day high commissioner” of Gaza, and former US Secretary of State Condeleeza Rice, who also sits on the council. On the weekend, he will take part in a polo tournament. Before that, Dimon is expected to meet with members of Milei’s senior economic team during his stay. He should receive a warm welcome considering all four of them, including Economy Minister Luis Caputo and Central Bank Governor Santiago Busilli, are former JP Morgan Chase executives. The following photo has been doing the rounds in recent days. Argentina's right-wing libertarian government is run by Wall Street, both indirectly and directly. President Javier Milei's minister & vice minister of the economy, and the president & vice president of the central bank, all previously worked for JPMorgan, the largest US bank. https://t.co/k9yqKikxge pic.twitter.com/1LUSXhrq3O — Ben Norton (@BenjaminNorton) October 21, 2025 What were the odds of all four of them having previously worked for the same New York-based mega lender whose operations in Argentina are apparently expanding quite nicely right now? That same bank is now helping the Milei government carry out a sovereign debt buyback operation ostensibly aimed at “reducing the country’s cost of financing and strengthening investment in education”? An Oligarch’s Libertarian It was Milei’s appointment of Caputo and Bausili back in December 2023 that was the obvious tell that the fix was once again in, that Milei’s government was not going to honour his main electoral pledges to abolish Argentina’s central bank or adopt the dollar. As Yannis Varoufakis argues in an excellent piece for Unherd (and as we’ve been arguing for the past two years), Milei is not a libertarian by any means but is instead beholden to Argentina’s oligarchy: Milei never really broke with Argentina’s sad oligarchic practices of the past. He merely rebranded a type of heist practised by a long succession of his predecessors — from Peronist Carlos Menem and anti-Peronist Fernando de la Rúa to hapless Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, whose presidency lasted a mere seven days, and, more recently, neoliberal Mauricio Macri who now supports Milei. While Milei used libertarian narratives successfully to distance himself from these people, his actual policies fail the most important libertarian litmus test. Before you, dear reader, dismiss me as a Marxist (that I admittedly am) intent on dismissing a political opponent’s success as a dismal failure (something I avoid like a mortal sin), let me put it to you in simple, libertarian terms. If you (unlike me) truly believe in the markets’ superior wisdom, and want to rid Argentina of political constraints placed on the market mechanism, which market do you liberate first? The money market, surely. Which price distortion do you drive your chainsaw through first? The fixed (or bounded) exchange rate, unquestionably. And what is the last thing you do? Precisely what Milei did: borrow zillions of dollars, pile them up on top of an already unbearable heap of public debt, to prevent the money market from choosing freely the exchange rate of your currency. Defending a currency as weak as the peso for almost two years is, of course, a fool’s errand, and the results have been depressingly familiar. In less than two years, the Milei government has burnt through tens of billions of dollars of foreign exchange reserves in a futile bid to keep the peso artificially high and, by extension, inflation artificially low. It has brought misery for the man in the street while making a mint for financial speculators. Yes, Milei’s austerity has reduced inflation, but at the cost of smothering economic activity for two long years and squandering the country’s limited currency reserves. It is also utterly unsustainable. Everyone knows the moment the elections are over, the government will once again devalue the peso, sending inflation soaring once again — that’s why everyone is buying dollars despite the US’ direct support of the peso. To avert an all-out currency collapse, the Milei government has needed not one, but two, massive $40 billion bailouts in the space of just six months — the first from the IMF, World Bank and InterAmerican Development Bank, the other from the US Treasury Department’s Exchange Stabilisation Fund and Wall Street Banks. The half-lives of the financial interventions are growing dangerously short. From Benign Neglect to Malign Meddling Both of these bailouts came with big strings attached, but it is the latter that has the most onerous terms — including Trump’s exhortation to Argentine voters to choose the right party in Sunday’s election. Otherwise, he warns, the bailout funds will be withdrawn, tipping Argentina’s economy over the edge. This, lest we forget, is occurring at the same time that the US is bombing speedboats into smithereens in both the Caribbean and the Pacific while beating the drums of war for direct military intervention in Venezuela. In recent days, it has threatened “very serious actions” against Colombia’s left-leaning governments as well as crippling tariffs against Nicaragua. Today, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War carried out yet another lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO). Yet again, the now-deceased terrorists were engaged in narco-trafficking in the Eastern Pacific. The… pic.twitter.com/PEaKmakivD — Secretary of War Pete Hegseth (@SecWar) October 23, 2025 After two decades of benign neglect of Latin America (while it bombed the Middle East, Libya and Afghanistan to pieces), the US is back to its traditional practice of malign meddling in its resource-rich “backyard”. The old policy of plata o plomo (silver or lead) is back on the agenda as the Trump administration tries to drive a wedge between Latin America and China. Take the money or take a bullet: that is the option on offer. This is not a new thing, of course. The US has been meddling in Latin America for nigh on two centuries. As Chomsky told the British journalist Seamus Milne back in 2009, US foreign policy has long been “straight out of the mafia”: [S]ince government officials first formulated plans for a “grand area” strategy for US global domination in the early 1940s, successive administrations have been guided by a “godfather principle, straight out of the mafia: that defiance cannot be tolerated. It’s a major feature of state policy.” “Successful defiance” has to be punished, even where it damages business interests, as in the economic blockade of Cuba – in case “the contagion spreads”. Will Trump’s overt election meddling and outright extortion practices concentrate the minds of Argentine voters, helping to tip the balance in Milei’s favour this Sunday? It’s unlikely but you never know. Milei still has millions of fanboys and girls (despite scamming thousands of them in his Libra meme coin con) and the opposition is still broadly reviled. However, Trump’s meddling is just as likely, if not more so, to have the opposite of the intended effect. A large majority of Argentines (60%) already have a negative image of Donald J Trump while 56% have a negative image of the United States overall, according to a poll conducted for Bloomberg in April. What’s more, the last six months of economic crisis and non-stop scandals have taken their toll on Milei’s approval ratings. The following exchange, from a recent interview of Milei on a friendly news program by Eduardo Feinmann, a presenter with a strong pro-government bias, shows just how quickly Milei’s carefully crafted image as an expert on economic matters is unravelling: Presenter: Eighty percent of Argentineans barely make it to the end of the month, and 60 to 70% of them only make it to the 20th of the month. Milei: How do you want me to fix that? How can I get money to the people? Interviewer: You are the economist. You are the expert in economic growth with or without money. In recent days, even with make-or-break elections looming, an allegedly heavily medicated Milei has refused to do any more interviews with the media, presumably at the insistence of his campaign team. As Luis Majul, another pro-government news presenter put it (emphasis my own), “Milei was going to do an interview (with us) but he took the decision not to come on in case there were questions he could not answer, which seems reasonable to me.” An analysts’ report published by JP Morgan notes that the markets are already discounting a bad election result for Milei’s ruling Libertad Avanza party, which will make it even harder for the government to govern. However, the analysts do not rule out a sharp rebound in Argentine stocks from next week if the result exceeds expectations. As El País reported a month ago, Argentina’s stock market is the world’s worst performer in 2025. Analysts from Wells Fargo have warned that the current exchange bands scheme “does not seem sustainable” and have predicted a further depreciation in the peso of close to 30% by the end of 2026 — the largest among all emerging currencies analysed. They also cautioned that the US Treasury’s support may offer a few days of stability – or even strength – for the Argentine peso, but it does not constitute a sustainable exchange rate policy. In the meantime, the private sector-led rescue agreement still faces obstacles. The banks involved — including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup — are demanding clear guarantees to back the loan, either from the US Treasury or the Argentine State itself. From Perfil (translated by yours truly): At the crux of the negotiations is the question of who will serve as guarantor of the loan: the Argentine government or the US Treasury itself. Banks are pushing for tangible backing, whether with assets, reserves or official coverage from Washington, that minimizes the risk of losses. In this context, The Wall Street Journal points out that Argentina could offer sovereign bonds or future tax revenues as collateral, although those options are considered unviable. Local bonds are worth well below their face value, and compromising future collections could generate political rejection within the country. Throughout history, this type of operation had solid collateral. In 1995, for example, Mexico guaranteed a $20 billion loan with oil exports during the so-called “Tequila Crisis.” By contrast, the currency swap between the Treasury and Argentina, which is also part of the $40 billion package, does not legally require collateral, increasing risks for the U.S. Treasury. At the same time, the Trump administration is facing a gathering backlash from its MAGA base for trying to rescue Argentina, a major agricultural competitor, while the economic pain from Trump’s tariffs intensifies. 🚨 TRUMP: “We’ll buy Argentine beef.” Asked what he’d tell U.S. ranchers losing their farms, he said: “Argentina is fighting for its life… they’re dying.” So are our ranchers, 77 go under every single day. America First apparently ends where the steak begins. pic.twitter.com/sbPImhQc6x — Brian Allen (@allenanalysis) October 21, 2025 Trump’s recent call to buy beef from Argentina could be, if you’ll excuse the pun, the final straw for some of his America-first voters, and is heaping pressure on Republican lawmakers. From Fortune: Trump proposed on Sunday that the U.S. could purchase beef from Argentina as a way to bring down prices for American consumers. Beef costs have ballooned as much as 12% in the past year. The suggestion was met with exasperation from U.S. cattle ranchers, who argued the move would disrupt the free market and introduce unnecessary risk factors to domestic beef supply. “This plan only creates chaos at a critical time of the year for American cattle producers, while doing nothing to lower grocery store prices,” National Cattlemen’s Beef Association CEO Colin Woodall said in a statement on Monday… A potential intervention with Argentina would come just as the U.S. cattle industry was beginning to recover from a dismal 2024, in which it saw its smallest herd since 1951, a result of severe droughts withering pastures and hiking up livestock feed costs. U.S. beef imports have also shrunk due to a ban on Mexican beef in an effort to prevent the spread of screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite found in cattle across the border… Cattle ranchers join the chorus of soybean farmers, who have been outspoken about the impact Trump’s ties with Argentina have on the soybean industry. Amid proposals to offer financial assistance to Argentina last month, the South American country also dropped several export taxes as an effort to stabilize its economy—including its soybean tax. As a result, China, which previously purchased about a quarter U.S.’s soybean exports, ordered several cargoes of the crop. China has not ordered U.S. soybeans since May. “The frustration is overwhelming,” the American Soybean Association (ASA) President Caleb Ragland said in a statement last month. “The farm economy is suffering while our competitors supplant the United States in the biggest soybean import market in the world. Jamie Dimon has a different take, joking that Argentina has “professionals, land, education… even meet.” On the political level, he remarked that Argentina has a real opportunity to become a strategic partner of Washington. “Argentina should be an ally of the United States; Trump and Milei are close, and I celebrate that effort to shorten the distance.” Dimon also contrasted the US presence in Latin America to China’s “Belt and Road” initiative promoted by China, expressing concern about Washington’s lack of a clear strategy to boost economic development in the region. (NC: When has it ever done that?) By contrast, the Chinese initiative — based on free trade, investment in infrastructure and international cooperation — has massively strengthened Beijing’s influence in Latin America. This is one of the reasons why the US is so keen to prop up the Milei government, even if it risks alienating a core section of Trump’s electoral base: the potential advantages of “driving a wedge between Argentina and China” (as the WSJ puts it) outweigh the political and economic costs. At least that’s the calculation. In the following interview with Democracy Now, the Argentine author and journalist Pablo Calvi offers three possible explanations for Washington’s support of the Milei government: geopolitics (removing China from the equation as much as possible); the interests of Trump-adjacent tech bros in Argentina, including Peter Thiel, Elon Musk and Sam Altman; and the ideological affinity between Trump and Milei. Trump's $20 billion bailout for Argentina is meant to bolster his right-wing ally President Javier Milei, but the plan "could backfire" for both leaders, says journalist @plcalvi. Argentina is holding legislative elections later this month. pic.twitter.com/Ap0L5Rtoml — Democracy Now! (@democracynow) October 16, 2025 One other possible explanation that Calvi doesn’t mention is the personal and business interests of US Treasury Secretary (and former hedge fund manager) Scott Bessent. As the NYT reported a couple of weeks ago, some hedge fund managers, including Stanley Druckenmiller and Robert Citrone, both former colleagues of Bessent at Soros Asset Management, bet large on Argentina and will indirectly benefit from a financial rescue of Argentine assets. Another major beneficiary will be the IMF, given Argentina now owes the Fund close to $60 billion. Another Argentine default, which may be inevitable anyway, could cause the institution serious embarrassment given that both of the last two bailouts, in 2018 and April 2025, were strongly opposed by senior members at the Fund, some of whom were even prepared to sacrifice their jobs rather than sign along the dotted line. Another source of embarrassment for the Fund: Just a reminder that the IMF's market access debt sustainability framework and in particularly its medium term assessment doesn't use external debt or fx reserves as analytic variables — it is an "it is all fiscal" framework. — Brad Setser (@Brad_Setser) October 22, 2025 Neither the people of Argentina nor the people of the United States stand to benefit from this bailout. As reader Rabid Gandhi pointed out in a comment to Curro’s post yesterday on Latin America, the money will “barely even touch Argentine soil before being whisked away to the Caymans accounts of various hedgies and oligarchs, some of them nominally Argentines, others not even that”: When this capital flight occurs, once again as it always has in the past, it will not be a surprise to Messers Bessent, Trump, Caputo…, because it is by design… What Argentina, the 45 million Argentines, will be getting as their ‘reward’ is a debt in USD, a central bank bereft of reserves and the concomitant austerity/cuts to social services that inevitably follow. With friends like these… So, this leaves us with one final question: what will the Wall Street banks be asking for as collateral for its $20 billion loan? Or put another way, what does Argentina have left to plunder? The last time the US Treasury used ESF funds to bail out another country, it was for Mexico during the 1994-5 Tequila Crisis. Not only are the Mexican people still paying off the debt for that bailout today, 27 years later, but the total amount outstanding has almost doubled in size despite the fact that the country has already paid $200 billion pesos more than the principal: the magical wonders of compound interest. In its bailout of Mexico, the US government made sure the Mexican government put up as collateral for the loan the revenues from oil exports of Mexico’s state-owned oil company, Pemex. Will the Wall Street banks be demanding the same sort of treatment from Argentina’s state-owned company YPF? In its Vaca Muerta (Dead Cow) field, Argentina boasts the world’s fourth largest reserves of shale oil and more shale gas than anywhere except China. Such a move could be complicated, however, by a ruling issued a few months ago by US federal judge Loretta Preska — yes, the same judge who persecuted US lawyer Steven Donziger for daring to represent the people of Ecuador against Chevron — ordering the Milei government to hand over 51% of YPF to firms affected by the oil firm’s 2012 nationalisation. That ruling has been put on hold by a US appeal court but is hanging over Argentina like a sword of Damocles. Alternatively, the Milei government could be asked to put up Argentina’s vast lithium deposits, the second largest in the world, as collateral, or even its uranium deposits. The negotiations between the Milei government and the US Treasury Department have reportedly included demands to restrict Chinese access to critical resources and prioritise agreements with U.S. companies in infrastructure and telecommunications. The Milei government has already begun the process of privatising Argentina’s four hydroelectric power plants, and there will presumably be a lot more of that sort of thing to come — unless, of course, the people of Argentina vote overwhelmingly against Milei’s party on Sunday. If that were to happen, Milei would effectively be stripped of the ability to rule by decree and veto, as he has done for the best part of the past two years. In which case, Bessent’s rescue package will presumably be withheld. And in that case, all bets are off. Austerity and borrowing money in a foreign currency… it’s like the economic version of getting into a land war in Asia. Is there Spanish translation of Mark Blyth? And is there an equivalent of his book on national governments borrowing in a currency they don’t control? Varoufakis certainly has first hand experience, with Greece and the Euro. looks like a target rich environment re: “Trump’s recent call to buy beef from Argentina could be,…:” It’s a gift to Amazon and Walmart, imo, both selling beef and looking for the cheapest buy-price for themselves to sell at the greatest profit to consumers. The Big Four Just Became Five: Walmart Quietly Captures the Beef Chain https://beefnews.org/the-big-four-just-became-five-walmart-quietly-captures-the-beef-chain/ Regarding the final question – I’m no expert in bond markets, but is it possible this is being done with the expectation that Argentina won’t be able to pay? Then Paul Singer of some other vulture capitalist can come in and swoop them up for pennies on the dollar. Could be. See this Mother Jones magazine article. https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/09/trump-argentina-bailout-hedge-fund-billionaire-rob-citrone-scott-bessent/ Oh, and, what is guaranteeing the repayment by Argentina to the US Banks? The US govt! That means US taxpayers. The US Banks won’t take any loss. On the topic of the risks the US taxpayer may be forced to bear, one of the best articles I’ve come across so far is one by Sebastian Pellejero, for Reuters Breaking Views (Spanish language edition). He points out that: 1) These drastic measures are effectively a band-aid to help President Javier Milei get through the difficult midterm elections. Even if they work, Washington may be forced to do more. 2) The cash available in the Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund is not unlimited by any means, spread out as it is among the coffers of the International Monetary Fund, foreign exchange reserves and previous commitments, leaving only $23 billion in direct assets of the US government, as of August. 3) The Central Bank of the Argentine Republic’s provisions are now dangerously scarce: around $13 billion, according to the Financial Times. By contrast, Argentina has a short-term foreign currency debt of more than $95 billion. A $20 billion International Monetary Fund loan, approved in April, was supposed to bolster those buffers. However, in August, Argentina had not reached its reserve accumulation target. 4) If Milei’s party loses in Sunday’s election, the United States will have financed a failed economic experiment and will be left holding billions (or more like trillions) of pesos that will collapse in value as soon as market confidence disappears, mainly to the benefit of the lenders who have been paid in full in the interim. 5) Even if Milei’s party wins, the vicious cycle will remain intact, inviting further interventions. There could be pressure to monetise more stabilization fund assets. And leaders of other countries aligned with the Trump White House will see that Uncle Sam can be counted on to lend a helping hand if and whenever necessary. Talk about moral hazard… As I read this thorough and well-written article, Nick, I just continued to shake my head back and forth in wonder and dismay. I’m pretty cynical, but even then, I miss half the connections and schemes. The Due Dissidence guys likened this to the way mobsters drain money from businesses, finally torching them for the insurance money. These billionaires are really, really confident in their suppression technologies. No wonder the first question they asked Rushkoff was how they could insure the loyalty of pilots, security guards, etc. I think the one thing these billionaire sociopaths will never have is true human loyalty. They will have to program it, I guess. Thanks. And thanks for the link to the archived NYT article. The currency swap provided by the US, and the loans made by US banks, are both $20 billion. That has to be just coincidence. That is very good point. So none of this money will go to pay off IMF loan Remember, Austrian economics cannot be failed. Only the government that instills it can fail it. “The Milei government has already begun the process of privatising Argentina’s four hydroelectric power plants, and there will presumably be a lot more of that sort of thing to come — unless, of course, the people of Argentina vote overwhelmingly against Milei’s party on Sunday.” It is always about the future grift, isn’t it. Perhaps there will be a US company lining up to purchase Argentinian public infrastructure at pennies on the dollar? Your email address will not be published.

Title: DAS London 2025: Keep Calm And Carry On Trading Crypto
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencewintermeyer/2025/10/24/das-london-2025-keep-calm-and-carry-on-trading-crypto/

ByLawrence Wintermeyer, Contributor. The autumn conference season in the U.K. continued last week with Blockwork’s Digital Asset Summit (DAS) London 2025 leaving its indelible mark on the city. With over 150 speakers, 2,500 attendees, 45 sessions, the three-day summit is at the crossroads of TradFi and Defi and focused on topics like institutional crypto adoption, ETFs, tokenization, stablecoins, and regulatory frameworks. It was a suit with no tie meets hoodies event with no dinosaurs. Speakers included a blend of TradFi and DeFi rockstars including, Matt Kunke – Blackrock, Mathew McDermott - Goldman Sachs, Jeffrey Kendrick - Standard Chartered, Danny Masters - Coinshares, Simon Taylor - Tempo, Catherine Chen – Binance, Chuck Mounts – S&P Global, Mark Jennings – Gemini, Laura Navratnam – Crypto Council for Innovation, Dan Moorehead – Pantera, Sandy Kaul – Templeton, Mara Schmiedt - Alluvial, Dave Cunningham – Citi, Samantha Bohbot - RockawayX, Victor Jung – Hamilton Lane, Ryan Hayard - Barclays , Peter Left – Lloyds, Matt Hougan – Bitwise, Antaoly Crachilov – Nickel, Chris Tyrer – Bullish, Baron Holmes of Richmond - U.K. House of Lords, and many more HERE. Nigel Farage, U.K, Reform MP, was the keynote politco speaker and claims he was on his best behavior meeting the Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, a few weeks ago and chimed in on the bank’s proposed individual stablecoin limits, making the point that limits were not required and only referring to Bailey as a dinosaur once during the meeting. DAS London’s big takeaway was, “The integration is further deepening at the crossroads of TradFi and DeFi.” Mark Jennings, Gemini's head of Europe, said, “DAS has shown that the demand is there to integrate digital assets into traditional finance, whether that's holding bitcoin in their treasuries, trading derivatives or accessing DATs. “This is certainly fueled by the regulatory clarity from the first pro-crypto U.S. Administration, the implementation of MiCA in Europe, and the regulatory roadmap outlined by the U.K. government in their ambitions to become a global crypto hub. The big talk at the summit was of the previous Friday’s crypto flash crash where over $19 billion in leveraged positions were wiped out within hours. The liquidations were nine times larger than any previous single-day total, marking the largest deleveraging in market history. Insights VC notes bitcoin fell about 14% from $122,000 to $105,000 and Ether dropped 12% to $3,436. Major altcoins saw extreme intraday losses with Solana falling over 40% at one point, Toncoin briefly trading at $0.50 (−80%), and Worldcoin loosing 70% of its value before partial rebounds. Uber analyst, Blockworks Byron Gilliam in his daily mail The Breakdown, elegantly walked us through “auto-deleveraging” (ADL), when leveraged crypto options or “perps” on the wrong side of the trade unwind at such a velocity, margin rapidly deteriorates, and liquidity dries up resulting in ADL liquidating positions on the right side of the trade. Notes Gilliam, “Sometimes, however, no one has any margin left, so there’s no one to sell a losing position to. In that case, the only thing left to do is close the seller’s bet as well, because the game is over, for everyone. Closing a winning bet is called “auto-deleveraging” (ADL) and it’s what caused nearly all of crypto to crash on Friday. Gilliam notes, “You and I are not the only ones who had never heard of it [ADL] before then. ADL is a way of kicking people off the perps market,” and refers to Doug Colkitt’s comments to Empire, “It happens infrequently enough that even seasoned perps traders are often barely aware of it.” The pithy Gilliam quotes Gordon Gekko on markets, “It’s a zero-sum game. Somebody wins, somebody loses. Money isn’t lost or made, it’s simply transferred.” Arguably, with ADL kicking in, everyone is a loser. On a positive note, by the start of DAS on Monday, many crypto prices were recovering with bitcoin hitting $115,000 and finding support around $110,000 for the week. Anatoly Crachilov, CEO and founder of the crypto fund Nickel Digital Asset Management, noted in his DAS panel that his fund endured the market stress event quite well and even ended the weekend positive. “I think this reflects the important saturation of the industry where more and more sophisticated pod shops like Nickel will enter the crypto market and the market structure will mature significantly, said Felix Jauvlin, on The Breakdown daily mail, filling in for Gilliam. While a number of centralized crypto exchanges experienced outages and delays, Hyperliquid, an on-chain perp DEX, saw over $10 billion of positions force-closed, the highest of any venue, as its transparent on-chain engine liquidated positions to avoid any bad debt, triggering its first ADL event in over two years. Adds Jennings, “Whilst DAS’s timing was shortly after the market downturn experienced on Friday, volatility is one aspect that comes along with the crypto market, bringing both opportunity and risk for investors. “Nevertheless, reliability is a key function that builds trust on centralized exchanges, and we have many guardrails in place to ensure we can offer the same market execution and functionality that our customers depend on, regardless of market conditions, which is what institutions expect.” Elise Soucie, executive director of Global Digital Finance, called in her analysis of the crypto crash to CNBC Europe from DC Fintech Week, “This is not actually a crypto specific event, it is a policy-induced crypto liquidation cascade in a market already nervous about the dollar, interest rates, the private credit market, and the deficit.” Soucie notes that it was not until Trump’s Truth social posts on Chinese tariffs at 4:30 in the afternoon on Friday that the crypto market, which was already selling off and in decline, went into a liquidation cascade. The crypto crash was a as big a discussion focal point during DC Fintech Week as it was at DAS London, especially in the policy community - market analysts and traders should take note, with crypto trading 24/7/365, it looks like the new canary in the coal mine for headlines on emerging policy and macroeconomic uncertainty. Crypto market infrastructure builders now have their head buried in work, as always after a volatile event with unintended consequences, and are focused on building the next generation of market circuit breakers and liquidity lifelines to avoid the future ADL of positions that are in the money. Nothing exemplifies the TradFi DeFi crossroads as well as the strategic partnership announced between S&P and Chainlink to deliver S&Ps Stablecoin Stability Assessments (SSAs) on-chain. Chuck Mounts, chief DeFi officer at S&P Global said, "The launch of SSAs on-chain through Chainlink underscores our commitment to meeting our clients where they are. The collaboration provides real-time access to S&P’s comprehensive stablecoin evaluations, enhancing transparency and empowering investors with critical data within the evolving digital asset landscape. And how cool is it that financial institutions like S&P have a chief DeFi officer. Adds Mounts, "By making our SSAs available on-chain through Chainlink's proven oracle infrastructure, we're enabling market participants to access our assessments seamlessly using their existing DeFi infrastructure, enhancing transparency and informed decision-making across the DeFi landscape." Samantha Bohbot, partner a chief growth officer at RockwayX highlights, “Last week’s DAS conference highlighted what many industry insiders have known for quite some time: this cycle was marked by institutional adoption. This was underscored by the event’s attendees and topics of discussion. “Clear areas of industry growth were highlighted; for example, liquidity in on-chain private markets, but now that the industry is gaining institutional attention, there needs to be a shift towards further innovation. “Blockchain’s advantages for traditional finance have yet to be fully realized. One area that has drawn institutional interest is tokenization, and yet so far, tokenization has been simply taking what was there and putting it on-chain. The next cycle will be dictated by structured products that are blockchain native and uniquely on-chain, rather than copy and paste.” Mara Schmiedt, co-founder and ceo of Alluvial says, “RWA tokenization was a key DAS theme and discussion topic with issuer-led demand, institutional infrastructure readiness and regulatory clarity improving, Larry Fink's “tokenization as the future of financial markets” feels more real and tangible now. “DATs (Digital Asset Treasuries) were another subject of debate after amassing billions of dillars in the first half of this year, as public companies and treasurers pivot away from passive BTC holdings towards productive and stakeable assets including ETH, SOL and others. “Tons of chatter around Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) as a new form of yield-bearing collateral supporting DeFi money legos and as a viable liquidity solution for ETFs given expanding ETH staking queues and with staking-enabled ETFs in the US (Grayscale leading) hitting the market this month.” Danny Masters, chairman of Coinshares, a European crypto ETP pioneer, had a message about its recent U.S. public markets debut that European markets should pay attention to: European markets under-value digital assets public companies. Masters didn’t move Coinshares to the U.S. market to raise money in the capital markets but rather to focus on achieving market multiples as high as 25x achieved by companies Coinshare’s U.S. peer group, versus 2x in Europe. Masters is a poster child for the TradFi DeFi crossroads, like many former Tier 1 Wall Street traders who bring their capital markets experience to crypto to strengthen market conduct and deploy their own time and capital founding innovative businesses. At one of my Association dinners a few years back, Masters told the story of how his then European-based regulated investment management business dealing in crypto was being persecuted by a European regulator. In trying to do the right thing and work with regulators he was also personally persecuted – no respect. It is easy to understand the popularity of the U.S. Administration’s approach and why European fintech firms are flocking to the U.S. – you are a digital innovation hero in the US - respect. The final day three of DAS closed with a panel on Goldman Sachs play book with a perennial London conference favorite, Mathew McDermott, Goldman Sachs digital assets czar, in a fireside chat with Blockworks with Blockwork’s Michael Ippolito. No grey hair on this youthful 20-year GS veteran who looks like he could be starring in a Hollywood movie about Wall Street’s digital space race. McDermott points to the rise in stablecoins and tokenized money market funds that will drive greater collateral mobility, a killer app if not the holy grail in the TradFi and derivatives space. Watch the full panel session HERE. The final word goes to Baron Holmes of Richmond, MBE, the U.K.s digital champion in the House of Lords (U.K Upper House of Parliament). He could not have summarized DAS London 2025 better. "There's been great conversations at DAS and that's what we need more of,” said Holmes, “more conversations, connections, and public engagement for this digital asset space." My only disappointment with DAS London 2025 was mot meeting Byron Gilliam, he didn’t make it to London - I was even wearing my Hermes tie! I’ll keep my fingers crossed for DAS NYC 2026.

Title: IBM Replaced Employees With AI And Made A Fascinating Discovery

Innovations in artificial intelligence are among the various reasons why companies are shedding jobs, pulling back on hiring, and eliminating positions. AI enabled tech companies Microsoft, Meta, and Google to announce huge layoffs in 2025. The massive food and beverage company Nestlé also announced it was cutting 16,000 jobs worldwide, many of which were replaced with automation and AI. And the CEO of Amazon, a corporation that will soon pay a $2.5 billion settlement to eligible Amazon Prime customers, hinted there would be further AI-initiated job cuts in a letter to shareholders. Yet it turns out that when corporations do invest in AI, it can eventually lead to the creation of more jobs. At least, that was the case with IBM when, in 2023, it eliminated 8,000 jobs as it utilized an artificial intelligence program, AskHR, to automate 94% of the company's human resources functions. Two years later, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna revealed to the Wall Street Journal that his company's "total employment has actually gone up" as it seeks to employ software engineers and sales and marketing staff who are focused on "critical thinking" to do less systematic jobs that "face up or against other humans." In other words, IBM still needed people to handle tasks that dealt with people. This was found out in 2024 when, on the positive side, IBM reported saving $3.5 billion through its use of AskHR as it handled more than 11.5 million interactions. Unfortunately, IBM's AskHR could not deal with complicated workplace issues, ethical problems, and other things that required a human touch, per online magazine Resident. IBM's discovery mirrored what the World Economic Forum's (WEF) Future of Jobs Report outlined: that AI will make 92 million jobs disappear but create another 170 million new jobs between 2025 and 2030. The jobs that are expected to grow are positions requiring critical thinking, human interaction, and opposable thumbs. This means farmworkers, salespeople, food processing workers, healthcare workers, social workers, counselling professionals, construction workers, delivery drivers, and teachers could be safe, or even see an outright growth in their opportunities. On the tech side, big data specialists, financial technology engineers, machine learning specialists, and experienced software and application developers will remain in high demand. The report also anticipates there will be big growth in renewable energy engineering jobs. The jobs that will continue to head toward the chopping block thanks to AI include administrative assistants, data entry clerks, ticket clerks, and cashiers. Additionally, the WEF estimates that 39% of employees can expect to see their skills either altered or outdated by 2030, meaning a large portion of today's global workforce will need to be retrained within a few years. This disruptive trend is taking place in entry-level white-collar jobs, too. Chatbots and artificial intelligence programs are replacing the tasks once done by junior software developers, paralegals, retail associates, and even newly graduated attorneys "who once cut their teeth on document review," LinkedIn chief economic opportunity officer Aneesh Raman wrote in a New York Times op-ed. Andy Challenger, an outplacement consultant at Challenger, Gray & Christmas, told Bankrate that AI was among the many reasons why companies are letting people go. President Donald Trump's tariffs have had an impact on the job market as well, as companies struggle to absorb the new taxes his administration has put on imports along with a sluggish economy and an overall hangover from the post-pandemic hiring boom.

Title: JPMorgan Opens Door to Bitcoin and Ethereum Collateral for Institutional Clients

Written & Edited byKamina Bashir JPMorgan, an American multinational investment bank and financial services company, will allow its institutional clients to use Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as loan collateral by the end of 2025. This move marks one of the most significant steps yet by a major traditional bank toward integrating digital assets into mainstream finance, reflecting growing confidence in cryptocurrencies as legitimate financial instruments. Bloomberg revealed that the program will be offered globally and will rely on third-party custodians to securely hold the pledged crypto assets. Notably, in July, BeInCrypto reported that such an initiative was under consideration. At that time, sources suggested the bank might begin offering crypto-backed loans sometime next year. However, the latest update indicates that the launch could now happen by the end of this year. The latest pivot builds on JPMorgan’s earlier step of accepting crypto-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as collateral. The bank first began offering financing against BlackRock Inc.’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), marking its initial step toward integrating digital assets into its lending operations. This comes even as CEO Jamie Dimon’s personal views on crypto remain cautious. In 2023, Dimon described Bitcoin as a “hyped-up fraud” and even referred to it as a “pet rock.” That December, he doubled down on his criticism, saying he was “deeply opposed to crypto and Bitcoin.” “We are going to have some kind of digital currency at some point. I’m not against crypto. You know, Bitcoin itself has no intrinsic value. It’s used heavily by sex traffickers, money launderers, ransomware,” Dimon said in an interview in January 2025. Nevertheless, the latest initiatives reflect that the bank is adopting a more pragmatic approach. In May, it began allowing clients to purchase Bitcoin. The bank also introduced its own alternative to a stablecoin — the J.P. Morgan Deposit Token (JPMD). This token operates on Base. “JPMD represents the first product to be offered by J.P. Morgan on public blockchain infrastructure, and will provide institutional clients a digital money alternative to stablecoins,” the bank noted. Furthermore, JPMorgan’s blockchain network, Kinexys, has experienced significant expansion, with its average daily transaction volume surpassing $2 billion. During Q3 2025, Kinexys broadened its presence across carbon markets, supply-chain finance, and cross-border payments. This highlighted the bank’s goal of making blockchain infrastructure a core element of institutional settlement. JPMorgan is also among the 30 global banks participating in SWIFT’s initiative to create a shared digital ledger. It is designed to facilitate real-time, cross-border payments.

Title: AI chip challenger Groq eyes APAC expansion

BAIVECTOR - AdobeStock US startup Groq has been challenging semiconductor powerhouses Nvidia and AMD in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip race with a novel chip architecture that can perform inferencing tasks at breakneck speeds. Unlike graphics processing units (GPUs), which have become the industry standard for both AI training and inferencing, Groq’s chips – dubbed language processing units (LPUs) – are built specifically for inference, the process of running a trained AI model to get a response. But while GPUs rely on external memory to store the AI model, making them prone to performance bottlenecks, Groq’s system distributes AI models across thousands of chips, storing them directly in faster, on-chip memory with lower latency and higher energy efficiency. Groq CEO Jonathan Ross, a former Google engineer who worked on the cloud provider’s tensor processing unit (TPU), likened the company’s chip architecture to a ballet performance. “It’s like a ballet choreography, where everyone just knows where to be,” Ross told Computer Weekly during a trip to Singapore. “Our chips know when to accept the data,” he said. GPU systems, on the other hand, are unpredictable, added Ross, comparing them to showing up for an unscheduled meeting and having to wait. Groq’s focus on inference workloads was deliberate. “We weren’t going to make customers’ lives better by working on training, which is too expensive, uses too much energy, and requires too much effort to get the software stack to work, but inference was not a solved problem,” he said, adding that it’s also a much bigger problem with 10 to 20 times more compute being deployed for inferencing compared with training workloads. During a demonstration, Ross showed how an AI model running on the company’s LPUs generated a complex, multi-day travel itinerary in the blink of an eye from a voice prompt, responding to a flurry of edits and requests almost instantaneously. “We’re dramatically faster than GPUs,” he said. “Normally, people have to put a lot of work into streaming the audio. We actually generate the entire audio and then start playing. That’s how fast it is.” Groq’s compiler was designed before the chip, allowing it to onboard some of the largest AI models much faster than others. Ross said a trillion-parameter model was up and running in production on a Monday after it was released on a Friday. “We actually spent less time compiling it than downloading it,” he quipped. And, with large AI models running faster and more efficiently, Ross believes there will be less need to use smaller models or fine-tune a large model, which could be quickly superseded by a newer foundation model that performs just as well. “It has become largely about getting one of the larger models to run as inexpensively and as fast as possible, which is what we do,” he said. Groq’s work to speed up inferencing has attracted a developer following in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, where there are 45,000 registered developers on Groq’s platform in Singapore alone, with India having the second-highest number of developers globally. The company, which was founded in 2016, also claimed that usage of its application programming interface (API) increased from 17% to 36% in the past year, surpassing Amazon’s, citing a recent industry survey. To meet the rising demand for its chips and the GroqCloud service, the startup has expanded from one datacentre to 13 in the past 12 months. It is now planning to open its first datacentre in APAC later this year. While datacentre operators continue to grapple with the power and cooling demand of AI workloads, Groq’s air-cooled chips can be deployed in older facilities that don’t support the liquid-cooling requirements of power-hungry GPUs. “In Finland, Microsoft was moving out of an Equinix datacentre that’s air-cooled because it’s useless to them, and as they moved out, we moved in,” said Ross. “There’s an enormous amount of air-cooled datacentre space that others can’t use because GPUs have to be liquid-cooled.” The company also lets organisations with data sovereignty and security requirements deploy its chips on-premise through partnerships with datacentre hardware suppliers. On-premise customers can get their own custom region, and also use GroqCloud if they require more capacity than they bought, he said. Groq’s growth has been fuelled by strong financial backing from key investors. In September 2025, it raised $750m in a Series E funding round led by Disruptive, with participation from major investors like BlackRock, Samsung and Cisco, valuing the firm at $6.9bn.

Title: Bitcoin was the LIFELINE TEN YEARS AGO to counter economic damage caused by governments and big banks

This isnât hypothetical. Itâs the reality for millions of young Australians, Americans, and Westerners under 40 who watched Bitcoin climb from $400 to over $100,000 while they were told to trust the same institutions that inflated housing prices beyond reason. The question isnât just about missed opportunities anymore. Itâs about whether an entire generation will ever recover from a financial betrayal orchestrated by central banks, corrupt politicians, and a rigged real estate marketâor if cryptocurrency, despite its risks, remains their only lifeline. Now, as governments scramble to regulate crypto, the same forces that locked young people out of homeownership are positioning themselves to control the one asset that could set them free. The irony is brutal. The system that failed them now wants to dictate how they use their last escape route. Key points: A decade of theft: Younger generations were sold the lie that student debt, low wages, and skyrocketing home prices were just "market realities"âwhile Bitcoin, dismissed as a gamble, surged 23,000% in the same period. The housing trap: Australia ranks as the sixth most expensive property market globally, with millennials and Gen Z now viewing crypto as their only shot at financial independence. Regulation as a double-edged sword: While proper oversight could legitimize crypto, history shows governments use "protections" to seize controlâjust as they did with fiat currency, stocks, and real estate. The surveillance trade-off: A staggering 33% of Gen Z would accept government surveillance in their homes, revealing a dangerous naivety about how financial control leads to totalitarian overreach. The Bitcoin awakening: Younger investors are shifting from stocks to crypto, but will they recognize the deeper gameâwhere banks and states manipulate every asset class to keep them dependent? How Big Banks and Big Government stole the dream For decades, the script was simple: go to college, get a job, buy a house, retire comfortably. But somewhere between the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-era money printing, the script was rewrittenâwithout telling the actors. Central banks slashed interest rates to near-zero, inflating asset bubbles that only the already-wealthy could access. Wages stagnated while corporate landlords and BlackRock snapped up single-family homes to turn them into rental cash cows. The result? In Australia, 40% of under-35s now say their biggest financial regret isnât splurging on avocado toastâitâs ignoring Bitcoin when it was cheaper than a used car. The numbers donât lie. In 2015, Bitcoin traded between $172 and $465. Today, it hovers around $107,000. A $1,000 investment then would be worth over $2.3 million now. Meanwhile, the median home price in Sydney has surged past $1.4 million, with wages failing to keep pace. The message to young people is clear: the traditional paths to wealth are closed. The only question left is whether theyâll let the system close the alternatives, too. Swyftxâs survey reveals the desperation. Eighty percent of Australians under 50 regret their financial decisions over the past decade. Crypto isnât just an investment for them; itâs a rebellion. "Housing unaffordability at this scale is a predicament other generations didnât face," a Swyftx spokesperson told Cointelegraph. "Crypto is seen as an opportunity to get ahead." But hereâs the catch: the same institutions that priced them out of homes are now moving to regulateâand potentially strangleâcrypto. Australiaâs Labor Party has already proposed folding crypto exchanges under existing financial laws. On the surface, this sounds like "protection." In reality, itâs the first step toward co-opting the one asset young people still control. The surveillance stateâs endgame Thereâs a disturbing paradox in the data. While younger generations flock to crypto as a hedge against a broken system, a third of Gen Z would willingly invite government surveillance into their homesâostensibly to "monitor domestic violence." This isnât just ignorance; itâs a failure to recognize how financial control morphs into total control. History shows that once governments gain a foothold in monitoring assets, they rarely stop there. Look at Canadaâs 2022 trucker protests, where Prime Minister Justin Trudeau froze protestersâ bank accounts without due process. Or the U.S. IRSâs push to track transactions over $600, a move that would give the state real-time visibility into every citizenâs spending. Crypto was supposed to be the exit ramp from this kind of overreach. But if young investors donât wake up to the patternsâhow fiat currency became a tool of debt enslavement, how stocks are manipulated by hedge funds, how real estate is hoarded by institutional buyersâtheyâll watch crypto suffer the same fate. The warning signs are already here. The Biden administrationâs 2021 infrastructure bill included crypto tax reporting requirements so onerous that even The Wall Street Journal called them unworkable. The European Unionâs MiCA regulations, while less draconian, still impose KYC (Know Your Customer) rules that erode privacy. And letâs not forget the World Economic Forumâs gleeful predictions of a cashless society where "you will own nothing and be happy." Cryptoâs original promise was decentralization. But if Gen Z trades financial freedom for the false security of government "protections," theyâll repeat the same mistakes their parents madeâtrusting the very system thatâs fleecing them. The Bitcoin regulation reckoning The shift is happening. Swyftxâs data shows that within two years, younger Australians may be just as likely to buy Bitcoin as traditional stocks. But momentum depends on two things: regulation and education. The first is a double-edged sword. Yes, clear rules could bring institutional money into crypto, stabilizing prices and reducing volatility. But as weâve seen with every other asset class, regulation is a Trojan horse. Banks didnât enter the crypto space out of altruism; they did it to co-opt the competition. Morgan Stanley now offers Bitcoin exposure to its wealthy clientsânot because it believes in decentralization, but because it wants to profit from the revolution it once dismissed. The second factorâeducationâis where the battle will be won or lost. Younger generations understand the basics of crypto, but do they grasp the deeper game? Do they know that the Federal Reserveâs money-printing binges devalue their savings? Do they realize that the same politicians pushing "affordable housing" policies are often the ones taking donations from BlackRock and real estate lobbyists? Do they see the connection between central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and Chinaâs social credit system, where dissenters can have their funds frozen with a keystroke? The answers will determine whether crypto remains a tool of liberation or becomes just another cog in the machine. Right now, the signs are mixed. On one hand, you have Gen Z traders making nearly $10,000 in profits on averageâproof that theyâre learning to navigate the space. On the other, you have a generation thatâs disturbingly comfortable with surveillance, seemingly unaware that financial privacy and personal freedom are inseparable. The housing crisis wasnât an accident. It was the result of deliberate policies. Crypto offered an escape hatch, but the window is closing. Governments and banks are circling, ready to turn Bitcoin into just another regulated, taxed, and surveilled asset. The question for millennials and Gen Z is no longer about whether to invest. Itâs about whether theyâll fight to keep crypto freeâor hand the keys to the same institutions that stole their future in the first place.

Wages stagnated while corporate landlords and BlackRock snapped up single-family homes to turn them into rental cash cows. The result? In Australia, 40% of under-35s now say their biggest financial regret isnât splurging on avocado toastâitâs ignoring Bitcoin when it was cheaper than a used car. The numbers donât lie. In 2015, Bitcoin traded between $172 and $465. Today, it hovers around $107,000. A $1,000 investment then would be worth over $2.3 million now. Meanwhile, the median home price in Sydney has surged past $1.4 million, with wages failing to keep pace. The message to young people is clear: the traditional paths to wealth are closed. The only question left is whether theyâll let the system close the alternatives, too. Swyftxâs survey reveals the desperation. Eighty percent of Australians under 50 regret their financial decisions over the past decade. Crypto isnât just an investment for them; itâs a rebellion. "Housing unaffordability at this scale is a predicament other generations didnât face," a Swyftx spokesperson told Cointelegraph. "Crypto is seen as an opportunity to get ahead." But hereâs the catch: the same institutions that priced them out of homes are now moving to regulateâand potentially strangleâcrypto. Australiaâs Labor Party has already proposed folding crypto exchanges under existing financial laws. On the surface, this sounds like "protection." In reality, itâs the first step toward co-opting the one asset young people still control. The surveillance stateâs endgame Thereâs a disturbing paradox in the data. While younger generations flock to crypto as a hedge against a broken system, a third of Gen Z would willingly invite government surveillance into their homesâostensibly to "monitor domestic violence." This isnât just ignorance; itâs a failure to recognize how financial control morphs into total control. History shows that once governments gain a foothold in monitoring assets, they rarely stop there. Look at Canadaâs 2022 trucker protests, where Prime Minister Justin Trudeau froze protestersâ bank accounts without due process. Or the U.S. IRSâs push to track transactions over $600, a move that would give the state real-time visibility into every citizenâs spending. Crypto was supposed to be the exit ramp from this kind of overreach. But if young investors donât wake up to the patternsâhow fiat currency became a tool of debt enslavement, how stocks are manipulated by hedge funds, how real estate is hoarded by institutional buyersâtheyâll watch crypto suffer the same fate. The warning signs are already here. The Biden administrationâs 2021 infrastructure bill included crypto tax reporting requirements so onerous that even The Wall Street Journal called them unworkable. The European Unionâs MiCA regulations, while less draconian, still impose KYC (Know Your Customer) rules that erode privacy. And letâs not forget the World Economic Forumâs gleeful predictions of a cashless society where "you will own nothing and be happy." Cryptoâs original promise was decentralization. But if Gen Z trades financial freedom for the false security of government "protections," theyâll repeat the same mistakes their parents madeâtrusting the very system thatâs fleecing them. The Bitcoin regulation reckoning The shift is happening. Swyftxâs data shows that within two years, younger Australians may be just as likely to buy Bitcoin as traditional stocks. But momentum depends on two things: regulation and education. The first is a double-edged sword. Yes, clear rules could bring institutional money into crypto, stabilizing prices and reducing volatility. But as weâve seen with every other asset class, regulation is a Trojan horse. Banks didnât enter the crypto space out of altruism; they did it to co-opt the competition. Morgan Stanley now offers Bitcoin exposure to its wealthy clientsânot because it believes in decentralization, but because it wants to profit from the revolution it once dismissed. The second factorâeducationâis where the battle will be won or lost. Younger generations understand the basics of crypto, but do they grasp the deeper game? Do they know that the Federal Reserveâs money-printing binges devalue their savings? Do they realize that the same politicians pushing "affordable housing" policies are often the ones taking donations from BlackRock and real estate lobbyists? Do they see the connection between central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and Chinaâs social credit system, where dissenters can have their funds frozen with a keystroke? The answers will determine whether crypto remains a tool of liberation or becomes just another cog in the machine. Right now, the signs are mixed. On one hand, you have Gen Z traders making nearly $10,000 in profits on averageâproof that theyâre learning to navigate the space. On the other, you have a generation thatâs disturbingly comfortable with surveillance, seemingly unaware that financial privacy and personal freedom are inseparable. The housing crisis wasnât an accident. It was the result of deliberate policies. Crypto offered an escape hatch, but the window is closing. Governments and banks are circling, ready to turn Bitcoin into just another regulated, taxed, and surveilled asset. The question for millennials and Gen Z is no longer about whether to invest. Itâs about whether theyâll fight to keep crypto freeâor hand the keys to the same institutions that stole their future in the first place.

Do they realize that the same politicians pushing "affordable housing" policies are often the ones taking donations from BlackRock and real estate lobbyists? Do they see the connection between central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and Chinaâs social credit system, where dissenters can have their funds frozen with a keystroke? The answers will determine whether crypto remains a tool of liberation or becomes just another cog in the machine. Right now, the signs are mixed. On one hand, you have Gen Z traders making nearly $10,000 in profits on averageâproof that theyâre learning to navigate the space. On the other, you have a generation thatâs disturbingly comfortable with surveillance, seemingly unaware that financial privacy and personal freedom are inseparable. The housing crisis wasnât an accident. It was the result of deliberate policies. Crypto offered an escape hatch, but the window is closing. Governments and banks are circling, ready to turn Bitcoin into just another regulated, taxed, and surveilled asset. The question for millennials and Gen Z is no longer about whether to invest. Itâs about whether theyâll fight to keep crypto freeâor hand the keys to the same institutions that stole their future in the first place. Sources include: CoinTelegraph.com CoinTelegraph.com Enoch, Brighteon.ai For decades, the script was simple: go to college, get a job, buy a house, retire comfortably. But somewhere between the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-era money printing, the script was rewrittenâwithout telling the actors. Central banks slashed interest rates to near-zero, inflating asset bubbles that only the already-wealthy could access. Wages stagnated while corporate landlords and BlackRock snapped up single-family homes to turn them into rental cash cows. The result? In Australia, 40% of under-35s now say their biggest financial regret isnât splurging on avocado toastâitâs ignoring Bitcoin when it was cheaper than a used car. The numbers donât lie. In 2015, Bitcoin traded between $172 and $465. Today, it hovers around $107,000. A $1,000 investment then would be worth over $2.3 million now. Meanwhile, the median home price in Sydney has surged past $1.4 million, with wages failing to keep pace. The message to young people is clear: the traditional paths to wealth are closed. The only question left is whether theyâll let the system close the alternatives, too. Swyftxâs survey reveals the desperation. Eighty percent of Australians under 50 regret their financial decisions over the past decade. Crypto isnât just an investment for them; itâs a rebellion. "Housing unaffordability at this scale is a predicament other generations didnât face," a Swyftx spokesperson told Cointelegraph. "Crypto is seen as an opportunity to get ahead." But hereâs the catch: the same institutions that priced them out of homes are now moving to regulateâand potentially strangleâcrypto. Australiaâs Labor Party has already proposed folding crypto exchanges under existing financial laws. On the surface, this sounds like "protection." In reality, itâs the first step toward co-opting the one asset young people still control. The surveillance stateâs endgame Thereâs a disturbing paradox in the data. While younger generations flock to crypto as a hedge against a broken system, a third of Gen Z would willingly invite government surveillance into their homesâostensibly to "monitor domestic violence." This isnât just ignorance; itâs a failure to recognize how financial control morphs into total control. History shows that once governments gain a foothold in monitoring assets, they rarely stop there. Look at Canadaâs 2022 trucker protests, where Prime Minister Justin Trudeau froze protestersâ bank accounts without due process. Or the U.S. IRSâs push to track transactions over $600, a move that would give the state real-time visibility into every citizenâs spending. Crypto was supposed to be the exit ramp from this kind of overreach. But if young investors donât wake up to the patternsâhow fiat currency became a tool of debt enslavement, how stocks are manipulated by hedge funds, how real estate is hoarded by institutional buyersâtheyâll watch crypto suffer the same fate. The warning signs are already here. The Biden administrationâs 2021 infrastructure bill included crypto tax reporting requirements so onerous that even The Wall Street Journal called them unworkable. The European Unionâs MiCA regulations, while less draconian, still impose KYC (Know Your Customer) rules that erode privacy. And letâs not forget the World Economic Forumâs gleeful predictions of a cashless society where "you will own nothing and be happy." Cryptoâs original promise was decentralization. But if Gen Z trades financial freedom for the false security of government "protections," theyâll repeat the same mistakes their parents madeâtrusting the very system thatâs fleecing them. The Bitcoin regulation reckoning The shift is happening. Swyftxâs data shows that within two years, younger Australians may be just as likely to buy Bitcoin as traditional stocks. But momentum depends on two things: regulation and education. The first is a double-edged sword. Yes, clear rules could bring institutional money into crypto, stabilizing prices and reducing volatility. But as weâve seen with every other asset class, regulation is a Trojan horse. Banks didnât enter the crypto space out of altruism; they did it to co-opt the competition. Morgan Stanley now offers Bitcoin exposure to its wealthy clientsânot because it believes in decentralization, but because it wants to profit from the revolution it once dismissed. The second factorâeducationâis where the battle will be won or lost. Younger generations understand the basics of crypto, but do they grasp the deeper game?

Title: Halo Co-creator slams EA for leaving Ridgeline Games devs out of Battlefield 6 credits
URL: https://www.notebookcheck.net/Halo-Co-creator-slams-EA-for-leaving-Ridgeline-Games-devs-out-of-Battlefield-6-credits.1145574.0.html
Time Published: 2025-10-24T04:21:00Z
Full Content:
The co-creator of the Halo franchise and former art director on the original Halo games at Bungie, Marcus Lehto, publicly expressed disappointment over the lack of proper credits for himself and several colleagues from the now-defunct Ridgeline Games in the recent release of Battlefield 6. In a LinkedIn post on October 20, Lehto mentioned that many team members who contributed to the game’s early development were either omitted or relegated to a brief “Special Thanks” section at the end, despite playing a major role in laying the game’s foundation. In the LinkedIn post, Lehto stated, “I’m disappointed to see that many of my former teammates from Ridgeline Games were not properly credited in the recent release of Battlefield 6.” He initially pointed out that five individuals were missing from the credits section, including software engineers Jessica Moore and Dan Carr, lead tech artist Rohan Knuckey, and lead character artist Andres Naranjo. He later corrected himself and clarified that three of them were actually credited elsewhere in the game. To honor their contributions, Lehto shared a custom image listing dozens of names and roles across cinematics, design, art, animation, engineering, and production, presenting it as how he believed the credentials should have appeared in Battlefield 6. He concluded in the post, “Game development is a team effort, and every contributor deserves fair acknowledgment.” EA established Ridgeline Games in Seattle back in October 2021 and appointed Lehto as game director to lead the studio on FPS titles, specifically the campaign for the next Battlefield game. The studio began hiring developers in July 2022 and collaborated with Ripple Effect, formerly DICE LA, to build the game’s narrative of what would later become Battlefield 6. Lehto left EA in February 2024 of his own accord, stating he wanted to take time away from the industry to think about his future. Just a week later, EA shut down Ridgeline Games as part of a broader restructuring and laid off approximately 670 employees, and shifted away from future licensed IPs, with some staff relocated to Ripple Effect to continue work on Battlefield 6’s multiplayer development. At the time, Lehto stated that he was “incredibly upset and very sad” about the closure and layoffs, further adding that he had “nothing positive to say about EA” following his departure.Buy Battlefield 6 on Amazon Marcus Lehto – LinkedIn

Title: Companies Are Hiring Like It's 2009

Posted on 10/23/2025 5:38:34 PM PDT by SeekAndFind Key TakeawaysHiring by U.S. employers has slowed to a crawl, according to recent data from Vanguard.The job creation rate is at its slowest sustained pace since 2009, when the U.S. was in a recession.Vanguard's report is one of a handful of privately created data sources available in the absence of government reports that have been delayed by the shutdown. The last time job growth was as slow as it is now, Boom Boom Pow by the Black Eyed Peas was at the top of the charts, a Bitcoin cost a quarter of a cent, and Donald Trump was best known as the host of a game show. Vanguard data found the U.S. job growth rate was just 0.1% in seven of the first nine months of 2025—an ominous sign, as the last time job growth was that slow for a sustained period was during the Great Recession in 2009. That's less than a third of the recent job growth peak of 0.36% in 2022.What This Means For The EconomyVanguard's data highlights the job market's uneasy balance: job creation is slow, but there haven't been any waves of mass layoffs. Officials at the Federal Reserve view the job market as increasingly fragile and are expected to cut interest rates to support job growth and prevent a severe increase in unemployment. Vanguard's data is one of a handful of reports on the job market created by private companies, which are still being published in the absence of official figures from the government that are being delayed by the ongoing shutdown. Vanguard's data reinforces recent findings indicating a "low hire, low fire" job market in an uneasy equilibrium. Many employers remain reluctant to either expand or reduce their workforces as they contend with the economic policies of the White House, particularly tariffs and a crackdown on immigration, according to recent surveys. The slow rate of job creation is bad news for anyone currently looking for work, but the labor market isn't yet in crisis. Unlike the early 2000s, people who currently have jobs can count on relatively stable employment, according to Vanguard. "Hiring has slowed, but low layoff rates and solid income growth point to a labor market that remains strong for those currently employed," the company said in a blog post. Article Sources 1. Vanguard. "Data show labor market strength despite slower hiring."

Companies from Amazon and JPMorgan to Ford, Salesforce, and Walmart have all said AI will replace a significant share of white-collar work. Goldman Sachs estimates that 6–7% of jobs could eventually disappear, while Stanford researchers say entry-level hiring in AI-related fields has already dropped 13%. Meanwhile, Gad Levanon of the Burning Glass Institute calls it the start of a “multi-decade transformation” of the labor market. On the bright side, sectors like construction and healthcare may prove more resilient, but many desk jobs look increasingly vulnerable. BLS labor data will be key to tracking the aftershocks in the economy. The irony is that data isn’t even being published right now. 2 posted on 10/23/2025 5:39:58 PM PDT by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Learn to wire. 3 posted on 10/23/2025 5:42:09 PM PDT by shelterguy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind “since 2009, when the US was in a recession” No, we were taking the the full force of Obama Care.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind I still say that most of the jobs that were sent home during COVID are extremely vulnerable to AI. People who worked in cubicles filling out spreadsheets or processing electronic paperwork just went home and kept doing the same thing at their kitchen table. That work can be automated and done without people. That’s a lot of jobs that can evaporate in the near future. And driverless cars seem to be moving forward. I saw a lot of Waymo cars in Phoenix recently. Think of the truckers and the Amazon/Fedex/UPS delivery guys. That’s a ton of jobs. If that work can be automated it will impact many people. People need to think about what happens to society when a big percentage of the population no longer contributes to the national economy. Universal Basic Income? Will people sit quietly at home and write poetry? Or will they take to the streets just to liven up their day? 5 posted on 10/23/2025 5:53:43 PM PDT by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination. They are sociopaths.

Officials at the Federal Reserve view the job market as increasingly fragile and are expected to cut interest rates to support job growth and prevent a severe increase in unemployment. Vanguard's data is one of a handful of reports on the job market created by private companies, which are still being published in the absence of official figures from the government that are being delayed by the ongoing shutdown. Vanguard's data reinforces recent findings indicating a "low hire, low fire" job market in an uneasy equilibrium. Many employers remain reluctant to either expand or reduce their workforces as they contend with the economic policies of the White House, particularly tariffs and a crackdown on immigration, according to recent surveys. The slow rate of job creation is bad news for anyone currently looking for work, but the labor market isn't yet in crisis. Unlike the early 2000s, people who currently have jobs can count on relatively stable employment, according to Vanguard. "Hiring has slowed, but low layoff rates and solid income growth point to a labor market that remains strong for those currently employed," the company said in a blog post. Article Sources 1.

Goldman Sachs estimates that 6–7% of jobs could eventually disappear, while Stanford researchers say entry-level hiring in AI-related fields has already dropped 13%.

Title: Target is eliminating 1,800 corporate jobs as it looks to reclaim its lost lustre

By LISA LEFF, Associated Press Target said Thursday that it is eliminating about 1,800 corporate positions in an effort to streamline decision-making and accelerate initiatives to rebuild the flagging discount retailer’s customer base. About 1,000 employees are expected to receive layoff notices next week, and the company also plans to eliminate about 800 vacant jobs, a company spokesperson said. The cuts represent about 8% of Target’s corporate workforce globally, although the majority of the affected employees work at the company’s Minneapolis headquarters, the spokesperson said. Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke, who is set to become Target’s next CEO on Feb. 1, issued a note to personnel on Thursday announcing the downsizing. He said further details would come on Tuesday, and he asked employees at the Minneapolis offices to work from home next week. “The truth is, the complexity we’ve created over time has been holding us back,” Fiddelke, a 20-year Target veteran, wrote in his note. “Too many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life.” Target, which has about 1,980 U.S. stores, lost ground to Walmart and Amazon in recent years as inflation caused shoppers to curtail their discretionary spending. Customers have complained of messy stores with merchandise that did not reflect the expensive-looking but budget-priced niche that long ago earned the retailer the jokingly posh nickname “Tarzhay.” Fiddelke said in August when he was announced as Target’s next CEO that he would step into the role with three urgent priorities: reclaiming the company’s position as a leader in selecting and displaying merchandise; improving the customer experience by making sure shelves are consistently stocked and stores are clean; and investing in technology. He cited the same goals in his message to employees, calling the layoffs a “necessary step in building the future of Target and enabling the progress and growth we all want to see.” “Adjusting our structure is one part of the work ahead of us. It will also require new behaviors and sharper priorities that strengthen our retail leadership in style and design and enable faster execution,” he wrote. Target has reported flat or declining comparable sales — those from established physical stores and online channels — in nine out of the past 11 quarters. The company reported in August that comparable sales dipped 1.9% in its second quarter, when its net income also dropped 21%. The job cuts will not affect any store employees or workers in Target’s sorting, distribution and other supply chain facilities, the company spokesperson said. The corporate workers losing their jobs will receive pay and benefits until Jan. 3 as well as severance packages, the spokesperson said. Correction: This story was first published on Oct. 23, 2025. It was updated on Oct. 24, 2025, to correct the date until which terminated corporate employees will continue receiving pay and benefits. It’s Jan. 3, not Jan. 8.

Title: Bitcoin Poised To Top $1.5 Million, Says Ex-PayPal President
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-top-1-5-million-ex-paypal-president/
Time Published: 2025-10-24T00:00:34Z
Full Content:
In a wide-ranging Coin Stories interview published October 21, David Marcus—co-founder and CEO of Lightspark, former president of PayPal and co-creator of Diem, the cryptocurrency project initiated by Facebook—laid out a thesis that Bitcoin will ultimately surpass gold in value and evolve from a purely “store-of-value” asset into the invisible, neutral settlement layer of the internet for money. “I think Bitcoin will be more valuable than gold,” Marcus told host Natalie Brunell. “At today’s gold price, it’s, you know, $1.3 million a bitcoin that [it] will have a higher market cap than gold.” He emphasized he is “decent at directional predictions” but “terrible at timing,” framing the trajectory as inevitable over a five-to-ten-year horizon rather than a near-dated call. The implication of outgrowing gold’s market capitalization places Bitcoin’s potential value well north of $1.3 million per coin and, at Gold’s recent ATH at $4,381.58/oz, above $1.53 million. Marcus’s price view is inseparable from his broader contention that BTC must progress beyond a narrow “digital gold” narrative. Echoing a line from analyst Matt Pines that Brunell cited—“if Bitcoin is only a store of value, it has failed”—Marcus agreed “fully,” but added a critical caveat: the savings-asset phase was a necessary precondition for utility. “We believe that the store-of-value phase is absolutely essential for us to be able to actually build a utility phase of Bitcoin on top of it,” he said, arguing that institutional adoption, ETFs and nation-state accumulation conferred enough legitimacy to begin scaling real-world payments. “Now that every institution… whether it’s BlackRock, Fidelity or others, are actually supporting Bitcoin… we can actually really start building payment utility on top of it.” That utility vision hinges on using Bitcoin more like TCP/IP—an invisible settlement substrate—than as a volatile unit of account for everyday spending. Marcus was blunt about behavioral and economic constraints: “People don’t want to use Bitcoin for everyday purchases because it’s volatile and people want to actually benefit from appreciation… they don’t want to be the Bitcoin pizza guy.” Lightspark’s approach is to move fiat end-to-end while using BTC in the middle. “You can send dollars from a US bank account to someone in Mexico receiving Mexican peso… the settlement asset is Bitcoin in between. So you have dollars, Bitcoin, Mexican peso and it’s invisible to people using it.” Technically, Lightspark is pushing beyond Lightning’s channel model while remaining backward-compatible. Marcus lauded Lightning’s trust model and speed, but highlighted its liquidity and self-custody frictions when scaled to “billions of endpoints.” The company’s newly launched “Spark” is described as a Lightning-compatible, non-channel payment system that enables spinning up “billions of wallets” with “minimal new trust assumptions.” Crucially, he said, it preserves safety valves: “It’s not as trustless as Lightning, but we believe it’s trustless enough and has unilateral exits to Layer 1… you can pull a rip cord and no one can prevent you from recovering your funds on L1.” Marcus also argued that stablecoins—despite their centralized issuer model—are an unavoidable component of global payments, and that anchoring them to BTC’s settlement layer enhances resilience. He described a personal “schizophrenic journey” with stablecoins, disliking the “single throat to choke,” yet accepting their ubiquity and attempting to minimize trust by avoiding separate gas tokens and preserving unilateral exits to Bitcoin L1. On adoption, Marcus pointed to shifting institutional sentiment. Recounting a panel in New York “put together by Citadel Securities,” he said a “majority” of a roughly 450-person room of large traditional-finance investors indicated they own BTC, versus far fewer holding ETH, stablecoins, or any token. “This is a room that traditionally would have been very resistant to Bitcoin… now the times have changed so profoundly.” Yet he still framed retail penetration as early, estimating “low hundreds of millions” of unique holders globally and significant headroom from there. Overall, Marcus’ thesis returns to first principles: BTC as neutral, scarce, programmable collateral and a credibly decentralized settlement layer. Dismissing critiques that it lacks “intrinsic value,” he argued, “Underlying scarcity of Bitcoin secured by code is the intrinsic value… this is the only thing that’s deflationary by nature.” That, he contends, is why Bitcoin should outcompete gold over time: “When the first gold ETFs were launched, they started mining more gold. You can’t do that with Bitcoin.” If and when that market-cap crossover arrives, it would validate the structural call embedded in his remarks—and, by extension, the headline-grabbing notion that BTC’s fair value is not just above seven figures, but ultimately “more valuable than gold,” which today maps to $1.5 million. At press time, BTC traded at $109,060. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: Peter Bart: Companies Are Pitching MOGA (Make Offices Great Again), But AI-Wary Workers Are Barely Budging

By Peter Bart Editor-At-Large For a glimpse of turmoil these days, look no further than the nearest office. “It’s an incipient war zone,” says a McKinsey study. That’s despite the fact that offices are mostly empty — both federal and corporate. The MAGA-era U.S. government pretends to function despite the absence of its workforce due to layoffs and the prolonged shutdown. Even flights take off with minimal air-traffic controllers. Meanwhile, down the block, millions in the private workplace are refusing corporate demands that they return to their offices. Having survived cutbacks and Covid, employees prefer taking Zoom calls at home in their sweat pants rather than coping with traffic or office politics. They also don’t want to read ominous forecasts about incursions from AI. Confession: I used to like going to the office; others apparently did, too. A benign show called The Office was once a TV hit in the UK and U.S., its characters sharing gossip over the water cooler. Offices brought busy people together for a common purpose. Some even hooked up. Watch on Deadline Yet employees today are rebuffing powerhouses like Amazon, J.P. Morgan and studios like NBCUniversal even as they offer compromises to lure them back. Discovering myself in the minority on the office issue troubled me, so I decided to find a way out: I asked ChatGPT to write an unbiased column in my “voice” to learn where Peter Bart really stands, or has stood. That’s what’s known today as research. Within a minute or two I was reading that offices presently are a relic — at least according to my digital avatar’s viewpoint. “Creativity doesn’t need proximity,” I wrote — apparently. My chatbot even cited a Harvard study declaring: “Gen Z executives who were schooled on Zoom and hence addicted to their phones and screens are not coping well with office interaction.” Further, the new “open plan landscape” of offices leaves workers feeling “both distracted and defenseless.” Was all this correct? Thinking back on my own scattered past, I actually enjoyed these “distractions.” I relished the high-decibel exchanges when I was a young member of the news staff of the New York Times. Also the fierce debates voiced by the motion picture production staffs at Paramount or, later, MGM. To be sure, I was occasionally pummeled as a newcomer in one job and second-guessed as the company president in another. Office life can be noisy. Hence, were I to occupy an office today I think would agree, not with the AI Peter Bart’s “voice” but with Bartleby, the superbly informed columnist of The Economist. He wrote last week that he “welcomed the constant background hum of generative AI, even though meetings now routinely end with phrases like ‘I guess I still have a job.’” Still, the overall AI lexicon troubles him: “People have no clue what they are talking about with words like ‘agentic’ or ‘non-determinism,’” he writes. Bartleby, to be sure, often works at home as do most newsmen. So what’s the bottom line? Last week the Wall Street Journal reported that, as more companies try to herd workers back to the office, average office attendance “has barely budged.” And managers are reluctant to crack down too intensively. “There are more pressing things for companies to worry about right now,” the Journal quotes one CEO as admitting. Hence Microsoft now demands three days a week in the office starting next February, while NBCUniversal asks for four. Ironically, Amazon’s more rigid rules have actually caused that company briefly to run short of desks. One executive admitted, ”It’s still a cheap way to reduce head count but you don’t get to choose who stays or who leaves.” What’s the solution? I asked my chatbot, who replied, “Maybe it’s not about mandates but about making the office truly matter again, not with pizza parties but with a mission.” I agree this time with my chatbot, but I hope I don’t have to settle with an AI company for the right to misquote myself.

Comment Name Email Website Δ So many of these companies what people to return to work, yet they’ve sold off their real estate, so now you don’t have a steady desk or office to call your own or personalize. It feels like you’re going to work at a coffeehouse every day you’re in the office. Or, now that so many jobs have been “globalized’, you’re now having meetings at 5 or 6am so you can meet with your European counterpart, or as late as 8 or 9pm to work with your Asian or Australian counterpart. And now they expect you to be in the office for these calls? The lack of a designated desk has definite psychological impact – we all know jobs are transitory but to not even be welcomed at the one you currently have enough to know you *will* have a seat treats every unassigned worker as a temp. It turns the whole office experience into a temporary one – which these days half the workers are temps anyway. When is the last time a Hollywood company instituted a policy that was *good* for their employees? Genuine question. Yea nothing says job security like refusing to do what your bosses tell you… these lazy bums should be replaced. Go back to the workplace and get out of your pajamas please.

Title: Headgum Lays Off 30% of Staff in Latest Sign of Podcast Struggles

By Gene Maddaus Senior Media Writer Headgum, the comedy podcast network, laid off about 30% of its staff earlier this month amid continued headwinds in the podcast industry. Casey Donahue, the head of video, was among those affected. “It was tough, but a reminder of how volatile the industry has become,” he said. “My focus has always been on building shows and visuals that elevate the talent and the brand, and I am proud of what I was able to accomplish with my team at Headgum.” Related Stories Music Industry Moves: Kid Harpoon Named First Producer in Residence at Abbey Road Studios Music Industry Moves: Melanie C of the Spice Girls Partners With Virgin Music Group for New Releases Marika Brownlee, the head of marketing, was also let go after nearly a decade at the L.A.-based company. It was only the second round of layoffs during her tenure, following another round in 2022. Popular on Variety “It was definitely a shock,” she said. “It was communicated in the grand scheme of — ‘These problems are happening industrywide’ — which I know is true.” Headgum had about 22 staffers before the layoffs, which were announced on Oct. 2. The company also recently vacated its New York studio. Some were told that if the cuts were not made immediately, the company would last only a few more months. The company did not respond to a request for comment. The podcast business has been hit hard this year. In June, Pineapple Street Studios was shut down by its owner, Audacy, costing nearly 30 jobs. Spotify also cut 15 jobs in its podcast division, curtailing the headcount at The Ringer and Spotify Studios by about 5%. Wondery laid off nearly 100 employees as Amazon reorganized the company in August. Headgum, which has remained independent, appeared to have weathered the storm to some degree. In August, the company celebrated its 10th anniversary as leaders spoke about growth. “We’ve built shows streamed billions of times,” CEO Marty Michael wrote on LinkedIn in August. “We’ve grown a team I love working with. But we’ve also hit major speed bumps; talent departures, ad market freezes, all the stuff they don’t include in pitch decks. Somehow, ten years later, we’re still here. Still growing. Still having fun. But now, with a real business underneath it.” The “restructuring” was discussed Thursday on the “Doughboys” podcast, a Headgum food show hosted by Mike Mitchell and Nick Wiger. “Really they just fired a bunch of people,” Wiger said. “We don’t have any sort of comprehension of what happened. We’re just living in the aftermath. But it’s a huge fucking bummer. These are very talented people who no longer have jobs.” The network hosts dozens of other shows, including “What’s Our Podcast?” with Beck Bennett and Kyle Mooney; “Not Another D&D Podcast”; “Factually! with Adam Conover”; and “Handsome” with Tig Notaro, Fortune Feimster and Mae Martin.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Target will lay off 1,000 corporate employees and close 800 open roles — affecting roughly 8% of its global corporate workforce — the company said Thursday. The layoffs and changes “set the course for our company to be stronger, faster and better positioned” for the future, incoming Target CEO Michael Fiddelke said in an email to employees. Fiddelke will take over from veteran CEO Brian Cornell next year, the company announced in August. The layoffs, which come ahead of the critical holiday shopping season, are the latest sign of struggles at the Minneapolis-based company. It has been been reeling from slumping sales and fierce blowback to its retreat on DEI programs. Its decision to end some of those initiatives angered supporters of diversity and inclusion policies, who felt blindsided. Target had staked out a reputation as a strong corporate supporter of DEI. Target said its move weighed on sales, which have fallen for three straight quarters. Economic conditions and competition from Walmart, Amazon and Costco have also taken a toll on Target. Customers have shifted their buying patterns, purchasing less of the company’s home goods and clothing. The company’s (TGT) stock has dropped 30% in 2025, putting it among the worst-performing companies in the S&P 500 this year. A Target spokesperson said the company did not lay off employees to cut costs. Instead, it was a step to rewire its organization to make decisions more swiftly.

Title: Crypto M&A surges 30-fold as niche firms shift to mainstream

21shares spent years building its crypto franchise outside Wall Street’s orbit. From Zurich, it launched exchange-traded products that gave European investors access to Bitcoin and Ether long before the U.S. would allow them. Now, in selling itself to FalconX—a crypto prime broker backed by Tiger Global and Singapore’s GIC—the company is trading autonomy for scale as crypto moves closer to the financial mainstream. The deal underscores a broader shift: crypto specialists are entering traditional investment channels through regulated products. And the FalconX-21shares deal is part of a broader surge. Crypto M&A topped $10 billion for the first time in the third quarter, a more than 30-fold increase from a year earlier, according to Architect Partners. For years, crypto was an M&A backwater as it slowly recovered from the 2022 market crash under the glare of hostile regulators. Ten months after Donald Trump returned to the White House and transformed the Securities and Exchange Commission from industry bogeyman to key ally, the tables have turned. Trump’s policies, and the deals bonanza they’ve ignited, have changed the strategic calculus for companies like 21shares. Regulatory hurdles have eased, and the stalwarts of Wall Street are getting into crypto — putting the onus on incumbents to build a competitive moat around themselves. “The regulatory environment finally allowed this to happen faster,” said Russell Barlow, 21shares’s chief executive officer, in an interview, declining to disclose the size of the deal. In terms of its roadmap, “what we thought we could do in five years we can now compress in two to three years.” For most of the past decade, the firm carved out a niche in Europe while U.S. authorities blocked spot-crypto ETFs. Then, in early 2024, the SEC under then-President Joe Biden lifted that ban. Switzerland-based 21shares suddenly found itself competing in a far more crowded field. Speed comes with a cost: the same regulatory clarity that enables deals also invites new competition. Low-cost Bitcoin and Ether ETFs overseen by giants like BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity started raking in multibillion-dollar investor flows and now command more than $173 billion in assets taken together. BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin and its Ether ETF oversee $87 billion and $15 billion respectively, compared with the $11 billion total for 21shares across more than 50 products. As crypto merges into mainstream finance, firms like FalconX and 21shares are racing to stay competitive in an increasingly crowded field, according to Nate Geraci of NovaDius Wealth Management. “We’re witnessing a land rush in crypto ETPs,” he said. “With new listing standards in place, the floodgates are set to open—making this an ideal time for a deal like this.” FalconX, founded in 2018 and valued at $8 billion in a 2022 funding round, earlier this year bought Arbelos Markets, a trading firm focused on crypto derivatives. Its capabilities in trading and financing now extend to product creation. 21shares will retain its 100-strong staff and operate independently, with plans to launch 18 U.S. funds this year and expand into the Middle East and Asia. FalconX and 21shares aim to design strategies that weave digital assets into traditional markets, tokenized bonds and equities—for instance, by using blockchain to settle trades, per Barlow. The FalconX-21shares tie-up is one in a string of billion-dollar bets redrawing crypto’s industrial map, beyond ETPs and prime brokerage. This year’s completed deals include several multibillion-dollar transactions. Coinbase Global Inc. acquired derivatives platform Deribit for $2.9 billion in May, while Ripple spent more than $2 billion buying prime broker Hidden Road and corporate-treasury firm GTreasury. Crypto targets have also drawn bidders from outside the sector, including CoreWeave Inc.’s $9 billion offer for Bitcoin miner and data-center operator Core Scientific Inc. in July. “Consolidation in crypto is pushing firms to integrate vertically,” said Karl-Martin Ahrend, cofounder of digital-asset investment bank Areta. “Market makers, custodians, and infrastructure players are moving closer to the end investor as ETFs and regulation open new channels for institutional capital.” Some crypto heavyweights have already moved to tap the rebound in sentiment, going public to build cash and acquisition firepower. Circle Internet Group Inc., issuer of the second-largest stablecoin, raised $1.1 billion in June, while exchange operator Gemini Space Station Inc. collected $425 million in September. The question now is whether this burst of dealmaking will be enough to hold off global banks such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc.—and payment groups from Stripe Inc. to Revolut Ltd.—as they step in to exploit clearer regulation and rising demand for digital-asset offerings. Traditional finance has scale and distribution on its side; crypto firms have speed and technical depth. The window for that advantage is narrow, and consolidation may be their best chance to use it. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Nokia Vaults Higher On Proof of Growth In AI Infrastructure

ByR. Scott Raynovich, Contributor. It sounds like a cliché, but I was recently asked about Nokia on the golf course. I had returned from a Nokia-sponsored analyst conference at the swank Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix, and a friend of mine was curious about what they were up to. “Are they still doing phones?” asked the friend, who is a retired wealth advisor. This might be a question that most people would ask, unaware that the company has been in the process of a long effort to diversify from telecom infrastructure. Nokia does, in fact, still sell phones. But it now has new growth in the best neighborhood: AI infrastructure. In its quarterly earnings announced early today in Europe, the Finnish company reported results reflecting 9% overall revenue growth and big gains in its renewed strategic focus on datacenter networking and AI infrastructure. As proven by its recent earnings, Nokia has shown it can grow in new markets, including AI. Investors love that. Nokia’s stock vaulted 10% in U.S.-based trading today following the results. Nokia reported third-quarter profit ahead of market expectations on Thursday, driven by strong optical and cloud demand. This included growth in AI-focused datacenter sales following its acquisition of optical networking specialist Infinera. In announcing its results, Nokia management said artificial intelligence and cloud customers accounted for 6% of group net sales and 14% of network infrastructure sales, with optical networks up 19%. Some key takeaways: With the news, Nokia shows that the turnaround architected by former Nokia CEO Pekka Lundmark is bearing fruit. Lundmark, frustrated by years of sluggish growth in telecom, saw the need to diversify by boosting products geared toward datacenter infrastructure. This also included a large acquisition of optical networking company Infinera for $2.3 billion, which was announced in 2024 and completed this year. In the quarter, the company showed impressive growth of 11% in network infrastructure, growing to €1.95 billion ($2.26 billion US). Cloud and Network Services surprised the street with sales of €645 million ($750 million US), 17% above estimates, according to Raymond James. Nokia now expects annual operating profit between 1.7 billion and 2.2 billion euros, a slight upgrade to the previous range of up to 2.1 billion. Lundmark’s turnaround plan, which was described by himself as very difficult, now appears to be prescient. The company is finally emerging from under the long dark cloud of telecom, where for years it was weighed down by disappointing returns in the 5G infrastructure investment cycle. This year, ahead of the industry’s big Mobile World Congress trade conference in Barcelona, Lundmark handed the reigns over to an American, Justin Hotard, who brings a background in datacenter and enterprise. Hotard held previous executive roles at Intel, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and NCR Corporation. “We have seen some improvements in CSP [communications service provider] expectations, along with the strong order intake I mentioned in AI and cloud,” said Hotard on the company earnings conference call. “In fact, entering the fourth quarter, our backlog coverage is stronger than in recent years. We’re also pleased with our progress on the Infinera acquisition." It’s possible that the telecom frustration was a blessing in disguise. Now, Nokia can sail into the land of rainbows and unicorns: AI. Nokia has now shown proof that a successful pivot is underway and it is now well-positioned with datacenter networking products, including its high-performance SR Linux-powered routing and switch portfolio as well as the Infinera optical products. At the recent analyst even in Arizona, Nokia highlighted customers and potential wins in AI infrastructure, including GPU clouds. That area has already been anchored by a deal with recent IPO CoreWeave. But some analysts say that bigger game may be in the mix, including Meta and Google. “We believe Nokia shares a new Meta optical scale-across project with Ciena, and the optical book-to-bill again meaningfully exceeded 1x," Raymond James analysts Simon Leopold wrote in a research note. “IP traction is emerging with footholds with Microsoft, Google, and CoreWeave, and a new deal with Nscale.” Many Wall St. analysts rushed to bump up their estimates on the news. Raymond James and Deutsche Bank both lifted their price estimates for Nokia, with Raymond James raising its target to $6.50 from $5 and Deutsche Bank going from €4.75 to €4.25 on European exchanges. Futuriom has been highlighting Nokia's potential success with AI-focused clients like CoreWeave. Nokia's flexible, open-source SR Linux operating system has been a key differentiator, with customers citing its simplicity, reliability, and economics. Nokia's solution provided high performance while also demonstrating significant energy efficiency, a critical factor for large-scale AI networking infrastructure. This quarter may well represent the start of a new era for Nokia, as it has boosted its reputation as major supplier of networking infrastructure for data centers and AI. Futuriom provides paid research and marketing services to technology companies, including Nokia, with the goal of providing accurate insight into how cloud and AI infrastructure markets are evolving. These services include subscription research, custom research, and report sponsorships. The author holds no positions in individual technology stocks mentioned in this article.

Title: Republic Technologies announces US$100 million to buy ETH
URL: https://www.blogto.com/sponsored/2025/10/republic-technologies-partner-content/
Time Published: 2025-10-23T19:39:32Z

This content was provided by one of blogTO’s client partners. blogTO was not involved in the creation of the content. Republic Technologies (CSE: DOCT) (FSE: 7FM0) (WKN: A41AYF) (“Republic”), a publicly traded Ethereum infrastructure company, has announced a US$100 million secured convertible note facility with a leading institutional investor to expand its Ethereum infrastructure and ETH treasury. The financing carries 0 per cent interest and features an initial US$10 million tranche. Under the terms of the facility, over 90 per cent of proceeds will be allocated to acquiring ETH to support Republic’s expanding validator infrastructure and attestation operations. Republic has secured some of the best terms in the market for financing of its size. The facility carries 0 per cent interest and has no mark-to-market requirements on collateral, meaning Republic can never face margin calls or default events. This provides strong financial stability and flexibility for the company to deploy capital efficiently. In comparison, similar facilities in the market typically charge 8 to 10 per cent interest and require up to twice the collateral. Republic’s business model combines treasury management with blockchain infrastructure, distinguishing itself among the few companies that treat cryptocurrency as a productive asset rather than a passive holding. In practice, Republic deploys its ETH treasury to operate validator infrastructure that produces attestations, which are cryptographic signatures that secure the Ethereum network. These validator activities not only contribute to network integrity and performance but also generate sustainable, recurring income for the company. This the “DAT++" approach integrates traditional treasury holdings with infrastructure-driven validator revenues and creates dual revenue engines that compound growth. Building on this foundation, Republic takes income generation a step further. When acquiring ETH, the company employs sophisticated purchasing strategies collectively referred to as “Synthetic Mining” — to generate additional returns and compound its ETH holdings without issuing new equity. According to company disclosures, these strategies have delivered weekly returns of around 1.75 per cent, translating to annualized returns between 80 per cent to 100 per cent, enabling Republic to expand its balance sheet without diluting shareholders. The company has partnered with QCP Capital — one of Metaplanet’s earliest and most significant trading partners — to design and execute its structured strategies. In parallel, Republic is onboarding leading validator infrastructure providers to streamline ETH deployments and consolidate recurring income streams. Together, these initiatives form a self-reinforcing cycle in which Republic’s treasury and infrastructure business strengthen one another, compounding long-term growth. Blending experience from traditional finance and digital assets, Republic’s leadership team includes professionals with successful exits and prior roles at Goldman Sachs, Apollo Global Management, IDG Capital, and OKX. Chief Executive Officer Daniel Liu comes from a long-established energy family. The Liu family has led multiple publicly listed energy companies around the world, including Canadian Solar (NASDAQ: CSIQ) and GCL Group (NASDAQ: GCL). Before building the world’s most successful Bitcoin exchange with OKX in 2019, Liu worked at CIT Bank, where he specialized in renewable energy financings and oversaw more than US$5 billion in utility-scale power and infrastructure transactions across California and Hawaii, according to people familiar with the team. Rooted in this background, Liu and the Republic team were early to frame Ethereum as “digital fuel” — a foundational resource powering the next generation of financial and computational systems. “Coming from a family with decades in energy and infrastructure, I’ve seen how industry veterans are now turning their attention to the next wave of innovation,” Liu was quoted as saying in the company’s investor presentation. “When introduced to Ethereum infrastructure and ETH treasury strategies, many recognized parallels to oil decades ago—as a foundational asset with outsized potential.” Ethereum blockchain is the world’s largest decentralized computing network, powering smart contracts, tokenized assets, and trustless financial settlement. To keep Ethereum secure and running around the clock, participants operate validator infrastructure that stakes ETH, the network’s native asset, and generates attestations that verify data interactions across the network. Therefore, ETH functions as the essential fuel of the digital economy, much like oil powers the physical world. As on-chain economic activity expands, the value of ETH grows in tandem. As of Oct. 2025, more than US$300 billion in value is secured on Ethereum. By Feb. 2025, over 50 major institutions, including BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Franklin Templeton, Deutsche Bank, and Visa, had begun building infrastructure and launching financial products on Ethereum. Ethereum is also being adopted in central bank and government pilot programs across major economies. ETH is the only cryptocurrency besides Bitcoin that has been formally recognized by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as a commodity. The rise of real-world applications is driving on-chain activity and deepening demand for ETH, reinforcing its role as the backbone of a growing digital financial system. Republic Technologies Inc. is a publicly traded technology company integrating Ethereum infrastructure into the global economy. Backed by an ETH‑denominated treasury, we operate proprietary validator and attestation networks to safeguard data integrity for universal applications.

Title: After OpenAI’s new ‘buy it in ChatGPT’ trial, how soon will AI be online shopping for us?

View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AA.fra5rxskp Share article Print article Buying and selling online with e-commerce is old news. We’re entering the age of A-commerce, where artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly able to shop for us. At the end of September, OpenAI launched its “Buy it in ChatGPT” trial in the United States, using AI agents built to interact with us to do more of people’s browsing and shopping. The technology is known as “agentic commerce”, sometimes shortened to A-commerce. American shoppers can now ask for shopping suggestions from US Etsy sellers within a ChatGPT chat – then buy a product immediately, without having to navigate away to look at individual shop pages. Looking ahead, big companies are now spruiking the next phase of “autonomous A-commerce”, which experts predict could see AI checking out for some shoppers within the next few years. But is handing over more of our shopping decisions to AI a good thing for us as shoppers, for most businesses or for the planet? For most people using AI to help them shop, the AI agent is still mostly just searching and recommending products. It still has to shift the customer to the retailer’s website to complete the checkout. For instance, AI can do most steps to order a pizza – though sometimes slower than doing it yourself – apart from paying at the end. That’s when we step in: we still need to sign in if we’re part of a loyalty program, enter our personal and delivery details, then finally pay. With the “Buy it in ChatGPT” trial now underway in the US, the customer never leaves the chat, where the checkout is completed. Shopify has said more than 1 million of its merchants will soon be able to check out within ChatGPT too. Major US retailer Walmart has similar plans. In May 2025, Google launched “AI mode shopping”. Some features, like using a full body photo of yourself to virtually “try-on” clothes, are still only available for US shoppers, with limited brands. At the time, Google said its next step will be a new “agentic checkout […] in coming months” for products sold in the US. It would give shoppers the option of tracking a product until its price drops to within a set budget – then automatically prompting them to buy it, using Google Pay. That checkout option is yet to launch. Credit card giants Visa and Mastercard are also working on ways to make it easier for AI agents to shop for us. Both the current and coming forms of A-commerce have the potential to spread fast worldwide, because they run largely on the same global digital infrastructure powering today’s e-commerce: identity, payments, data and compliance. Consultants McKinsey forecast: “We’re entering an era where AI agents won’t just assist – they’ll decide.” Overspending is a big risk. A-commerce removes many steps of the shopping journey found in e-commerce or physical commerce, leading to fewer abandoned carts and potentially higher spending. People would need to trust AI systems with their private data and preferences, and ensure they’re not misused. Permitting AI to shop on your behalf means you are responsible for the purchase and can’t easily demand a refund. Read more: OpenAI slipped shopping into 800 million ChatGPT users' chats − here's why that matters AI systems might focus on price or speed, but not always for what you value most: from how sustainable a product is, to the ethics of how it was made. Fraud could be a real issue. Scammers could set up AI storefronts to trick the AI, collect the money and never deliver. Banks will need to figure out how to spot fraud, process refunds, and manage consent when it’s not a person pressing “buy”, but an algorithm doing it on their behalf. Regulators will need to consider A-commerce in their competition, privacy, data, and consumer protection rules. A-commerce could offer some limited environmental benefits compared to today’s way of shopping, such as fewer missed deliveries – if you’re happy to share your calendar so your AI agent knows your availability. But greater consumption would also mean greater environmental impacts: from AI’s voracious energy and water use, to the damage done by fast fashion, more deliveries and indirect pollution. If you have even a small business, the way you make your products and services discoverable online will have to change. Instead of just having websites built for customers and search engines, all businesses will need to build AI accessible online stores. Those will not look like the websites we see today. It will be more like a data-soaked digital catalogue, filled with everything an AI agent needs to place orders: product specifications, price, stock, ratings, reviews, through to delivery options. All those years of bigger brands buying attention and dominating search results might start to matter less, if you’re able to build a good AI accessible online store. It could be a quiet but massive shift in how trade works. However, each business’s visibility will depend on how AI systems read and rank sellers. If a business’s data isn’t formatted for AI, it may disappear from view. That could give larger players an edge and once again make it harder for smaller businesses to compete. How much are we happy to delegate our shopping to AI agents? Our individual and collective choices over the next few years will shape how radically shopping is about to change for years to come.

Title: With $1 trillion pay package on the line, Elon Musk blasts influential firms telling shareholders to reject it: ‘Those guys are corporate terrorists’

Role: ReporterMarco Quiroz-Gutierrez is a reporter for Fortune covering general business news. Elon Musk stole the show in the final minutes of Tesla’s Wednesday earnings call to label the advisory firms pushing shareholders to reject his $1 trillion pay package “corporate terrorists.” After months of being relatively quiet following his resignation from the Department of Government Efficiency and subsequent fallout with President Donald Trump, Musk slammed proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis. “I just don’t feel comfortable building a robot army here and then being ousted because of some asinine recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis, who have no freaking clue,” Musk said. “I mean, those guys are corporate terrorists.” Musk, in a separate X post on Wednesday, also called into question the role of proxy advisory firms generally. The Tesla CEO echoed criticism from ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood by saying these firms—which issue recommendations to shareholders for how they should vote on proposals at public companies’ annual shareholder meetings—have too much sway, especially with passive investors like index funds, which have substantial voting power because of the shares they hold for clients. “ISS and Glass Lewis have no actual ownership themselves and often vote along random political lines unrelated to shareholder interests! This is a major problem that is not just limited to Tesla,” Musk wrote on X. However, advisory firms do not vote directly in annual shareholder meetings and merely recommend positions that are also individually analyzed by some of the biggest institutional investors, including BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, which do their own in-house research. Both ISS and Glass Lewis twice recommended voters reject Musk’s previous 2018 pay package. Shareholders ultimately approved the package twice. A spokesperson for Glass Lewis told Fortune in a statement its job is to provide analysis and recommendations to its clients. “Those that are Tesla shareholders will ultimately make their own decisions about Mr. Musk’s pay proposal and the Board directors that put it forward for shareholder vote,” the statement read. ISS declined to comment. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Musk, who has a net worth of $455 billion, said he needs an ownership stake “in the mid-20s approximately” to achieve his goals at Tesla. The pay package in question would give Musk about $1 trillion over 10 years if he meets performance metrics, one of which includes boosting the company’s market cap more than 500% to $8.5 trillion. ISS and Glass Lewis both issued reports earlier this month questioning Musk’s pay package, in part because of the package’s size and because it would dilute existing shareholders’ holdings. While Tesla claimed regular benchmarking doesn’t apply to Musk’s pay, because no other company has “remotely similar goals embodied in their compensation programs,” Glass Lewis wrote in its report that Musk’s 2025 performance award is “unprecedented” compared with that of other public companies, and around 33.5x larger than its predecessor from 2018. “It is clear that the quantum, on a realizable and granted basis, outpaces all other pay packages.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Can Google’s 13,000× “quantum echoes” put Bitcoin’s keys on a clock?

Google’s Willow chip earned verifiable quantum advantage this week; here’s what that does, and doesn’t, mean for ECDSA, SHA-256, and coins with revealed public keys. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. For decades, physicists have promised that quantum computing would one day outrun classical machines. That day may have arrived. On Oct. 22, Google’s Willow quantum processor completed a task that supercomputers would need 150 years to finish by compressing centuries of calculation into two hours. Industry experts say the result, verified by Nature, isn’t only a triumph for science. It’s a tremor through the foundations of digital security, sparking a renewed question in financial circles: how close are we to a future where quantum power can break Bitcoin’s cryptography? The breakthrough centers on the Out-of-Time-Order Correlator (OTOC), or “Quantum Echoes,” algorithm. By running it on 105 physical qubits at 99.9% fidelity, Willow became the first processor to achieve verifiable quantum advantage, proving that a quantum computer can solve a complex physical model faster and more precisely than any classical supercomputer. In simple terms, Willow didn’t just calculate; it perceived. Its output revealed molecular structures and magnetic interactions that were mathematically invisible to traditional systems. The processor outperformed classical machines by a factor of 13,000, completing the computation in hours instead of years. This milestone follows years of incremental progress. In 2019, Google’s Sycamore chip first demonstrated “quantum supremacy.” By 2024, Willow had corrected its own quantum errors in real time. The 2025 achievement goes further, offering the first fully verifiable, independently confirmed result that transforms quantum computing from theory to proof. Speaking on the milestone, Sundar Pichai, Google’s CEO, said: “This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we’re excited to see where it leads.” Bitcoin’s architecture rests on elliptic curve and hash-based cryptography, specifically the SHA-256 algorithm. Its security depends on how long it would take even the fastest computer to reverse a private key from its corresponding public key. This is a feat that would take classical machines billions of years. However, a quantum computer capable of running Shor’s algorithm could, in theory, crack those cryptographic primitives exponentially faster. In practice, Bitcoin remains secure for now. Google’s Willow uses just 105 qubits, far below the millions of error-corrected, logical qubits needed to threaten real-world cryptography. Yet, that doesn’t fully comfort analysts like Jameson Lopp, who estimates that around 25% of all Bitcoin (roughly 4.9 million BTC) sits in addresses whose public keys are already exposed. These coins, belonging mostly to early users and dormant wallets, would be the first to face risk if a cryptographically capable quantum system emerged. Moreover, institutional concerns have also begun to surface. Earlier in the year, BlackRock, issuer of the world’s largest Bitcoin ETF, flagged quantum risk, warning that advances in computing could “undermine the cryptographic framework underpinning Bitcoin.” While the firm noted that such threats remain “theoretical at this stage,” it stressed that disclosure was necessary to inform investors about technology that “could alter [BTC’s] fundamental security assumptions.” Despite the headlines, most industry experts caution against panic. Bitcoin expert Timothy Peterson also argued that Willow’s impressive results are far from posing a practical threat. According to him: “Even under wildly optimistic and incorrectly extrapolated assumptions (that the quantum device can do SHA-256 at that rate and sustain it), it would still take ~10 hours on average to find one block. And Bitcoin’s entire global network produces one every 10 minutes.” Bitcoin entrepreneur Ben Sigman agrees with this view, while pointing out that: “[Google] still need millions of stable, error-corrected qubits before quantum computers can reach a ‘useful’ scale – the kind that could threaten encryption or Bitcoin.” In fact, Anis Chohan, the CTO of Inflectiv.ai, told CryptoSlate that “we’re looking at least a decade, possibly two, before it becomes a real concern.” Still, not everyone is reassured. Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole, warned that ignoring quantum risk could result in the “biggest bear market ever” by next year. Meanwhile, Jeff Park, CIO at ProCap BTC, offered a more philosophical view by framing quantum computing as the “climate change” of Bitcoin. He said: “Quantum computing is basically the climate change of Bitcoin. Plenty of idiots who deny it because they can’t possibly grasp the amorphous or the astronomical, and plenty of scientists that understand it yet have no socially compelling solutions to offer.” Beyond speculation, developers are already exploring post-quantum cryptography that involves new systems based on lattice problems, multivariate equations, and hash-based signatures that can resist quantum attacks. The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has shortlisted several such algorithms for standardization. At the same time, Bitcoin Core contributors have floated proposals for gradual migration toward quantum-resistant address formats. However, implementing them requires broad consensus across miners, exchanges, and wallet providers, which is a governance feat nearly as complex as the technology itself. Still, Chohan concluded: “We’ve seen similar fears before. People once thought RSA encryption was unbreakable, then feared it could be broken overnight. Each time, we adapted. Quantum computing presents a genuine challenge, but we’re already working on post-quantum cryptography. Since governments, banks, and crypto networks all rely on similar encryption standards, everyone has a shared stake in protecting them. It’s not a question of if we’ll solve this—it’s about managing the transition responsibly and smoothly.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Massachusetts's Millionaire Tax Still Going Very Well, Thank You!
URL: https://www.wonkette.com/p/massachusettss-millionaire-tax-still
Time Published: 2025-10-23T17:43:35Z
Full Content:
Last May, we were very happy to report that the Millionaire Tax instituted in the state of Massachusetts was working out very well, not scaring off all of the rich people, and raising funds for necessary education and transportation initiatives. The state had raised $1.8 billion — $800 million more than they predicted — and none of the terrible things the naysayers had predicted happened at all. But how are things going a year later? Even better! The tax has now generated $3 billion more than expected, for a total of $5.7 billion that has been spent on projects that are positively benefiting Massachusetts residents and “being used to bridge repairs, bolster literacy programs and address the transportation system’s budget deficit.” In case you need a refresher, the tax is a 4 percent tax on anything people make over a million dollars. Yes. One million dollars. This means that if you make $1,100,000, they will be taxed a whopping $4,000 extra. That’s like, a single Chanel bag. They can deal — and deal they have! Most of them, anyway. Loving this post? Not a free or paid subscriber yet? Let’s fix that! Bloomberg reports that, although many millionaires (who still haven’t left) have been pushing for ballot measures to end it, some are actually pretty okay with the situation. “At the end of the day, I happen to believe it’s a phenomenal place to live,” said Sam Slater, a real estate developer who lives in the Boston suburb of Weston and pays the millionaire’s tax. […] [H]e’s staying put. His family has roots in the region, and they also like Boston’s culture, sports teams and seasons, Slater said. Josh Isner, president of taser manufacturer Axon Enterprise Inc., said the millionaire’s tax makes it harder to recruit talent — particularly well-paid artificial intelligence specialists — to the Northeast hub the company opened in Boston last year. But the office is based in the city because “Boston breeds super-talented people,” he said earlier this year. But they did find one guy who split! Robert Reynolds, 73, the former chief executive officer of Putnam Investments, has moved down to Florida, citing the millionaire tax and the Massachusetts estate tax as a concern. Other people, of course, might just call that “retiring” after the company you work for is acquired by another company. According to an admittedly sketchy-seeming website that I’m not going to link to because no one needs that many pop-ups, Reynolds has a net worth of $319 million. My heart is not exactly breaking for him and the 4 percent tax he would have to pay on any money he’d make over $1 million. I think he’d be okay, personally! The fact that the state generated more money in the second year of its Millionaire Tax implementation than in the first suggests that not too many people have gone the way of Bob Reynolds — even if, according to him, he hasn’t “been to one meeting in Boston since this passed where there haven’t been a number of people saying that they’re moving out of the state.” Sure, people complain. Rich people are always going to complain about taxes. But they never flee the way they threaten to, largely because whether or not they like to admit it, they prefer to live in the kinds of areas where things are made nicer by the taxes they don’t want to pay. One of the biggest things that the “low tax” hysterics refuse to (or pretend not to) get is that there is a reason why rich people and big corporations are still centered in higher tax areas — and it’s because, really, what good is money if you can’t actually do much of anything with it? Sure, there are some people who like the idea of living out in the middle of nowhere, on a ranch, with nature. There are guys in their 70s who want to just move to Florida and play golf (though they almost always live in gated communities there with enormous HOA fees that serve a similar purpose as taxes). But, clearly, a whole lot more people like living in places where there are things to do. For especially rich people, they want to be able to spend some money on nice dinners, on fashion that people are actually going to see and appreciate, on cultural activities, on events. They want to be able to send their kids to a good school, public or private. This usually entails living at least somewhat near a city, and very frequently in a “blue” state. It’s not just rich people, either. Many of the comedians who followed Joe Rogan to Austin now regret the move because, well, there’s not enough for them to do and power grid failures aren’t as much fun as we guessed they thought they’d be. Corporations need to be situated near good colleges they can pluck from, where a lot of talent is located. Sure, they could move to a state with extremely low taxes and hope that other people will move along with them, but they’ll be cutting their talent pool by a lot. People who don’t have kids aren’t going to want to move to places where there isn’t anything to do, and smart people who have kids don’t want said kids learning all about how Jesus rode dinosaurs or being taught by random military personnel (or their spouses!) who haven’t even completed a Bachelor’s degree, because so few actual teachers actually want to live in their state. I think even successful people who lean conservative and might want those things for other people’s children still want their own kids to be competitive. This is why rich people aren’t going to flee New York City if Zohran Mamdani institutes something similar. There are people living in walk-in closets just to get to live there — I’m pretty certain that there are rich folks who will be willing to deal with an imperceptible tax increase to do the same. We are talking about people who pay $50,000 a year for preschool. They will manage. And it’s worth noting that, if they can’t, it’s hardly as though there are not people willing and able to step up and take their places and make just a pinch less than a bajillion dollars a year. Because there are. Lots of them. Donate Just Once! It’s also why they aren’t going to flee the United States if Elizabeth Warren gets her way and a similar tax is implemented nationwide. Pretty much any other place they’d want to live would have higher taxes. The places with the highest quality of life in the world also tend to be the places with the highest taxes, and that is not a coincidence. You get what you pay for. But it’s not just about how the millionaires and billionaires feel. It’s about how everyone else feels, and 58 percent of the country would like to see taxes raised on those making more than $400,000 a year — including 23 percent who say they should be raised a lot. Sixty-three percent say they want to see taxes raised on corporations. Hell, 43 percent of Republicans say that taxes on these groups should be raised. Maybe we could have nice things after all?

Title: BlackRock is Buying BTC and ETH While Grayscale is Selling; What’s Next?

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. BlackRock withdrew $97.63M in Bitcoin and Ethereum from Coinbase Prime while Grayscale deposited $138.06M, signaling potential capital rotation between ETF managers. Onchain analyses suggest BlackRock could be buying more Bitcoin BTC $111 661 24h volatility: 0.3% Market cap: $2.23 T Vol. 24h: $40.51 B and Ethereum ETH $3 954 24h volatility: 0.1% Market cap: $475.74 B Vol. 24h: $23.02 B for its exchange-traded funds (ETFs), while Grayscale, another ETF manager, could be selling theirs. These diverging signals often show up in times of high volatility and price consolidation, as market participants place their bets on different outcomes, but can also appear in capital rotation from one product to another. In particular, Lookonchain spotted the most recent activity and reported it in a post on Oct. 23. According to the post, BlackRock withdrew 681 BTC and 6,000 ETH, valued at $74.72 million and $22.91 million, respectively, from Coinbase Prime. Withdrawing from crypto exchanges usually means a purchase has been made and the assets are being moved to a more secure wallet. Grayscale is selling while BlackRock is buying! Grayscale deposited 525 $BTC($57.22M) and 21,030 $ETH($80.84M) to #CoinbasePrime 3 hours ago. Meanwhile, BlackRock withdrew 681 $BTC($74.72M) and 6,000 $ETH($22.91M) from #CoinbasePrime an hour ago.https://t.co/OcQGQe8US6… pic.twitter.com/enqkl7tBKU — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 23, 2025 Meanwhile, Grayscale was seen depositing $57.22 million and $80.84 million of 525 BTC and 21,030 ETH, respectively, also to Coinbase Prime. Depositing to crypto exchanges usually means intention to sell, which may or may not be consolidated in the orders book. Interestingly, BlackRock’s highest dollar-denominated value is for its Bitcoin withdrawals, while Grayscale had a more significant volume for its Ethereum deposits—suggesting a higher demand for BTC and a higher supply pressure to ETH if we consider these two players in isolation at the Coinbase Prime market. These movements match ETF net flow data from Oct. 22, per CoinGlass data, suggesting a capital rotation from Grayscale ETFs to BlackRock ETFs. For Bitcoin, Grayscale’s GBTC registered an outflow of 522.85 BTC, while BlackRock’s IBIT registered a 679.88 BTC inflow. Grayscale’s ETHE and ETH, together, registered 20,690 ether outflow, absorbed by BlackRock’s ETHA plus nearly 8,000 ETH more (28,600 ether inflow for ETHA). Bitcoin and Ethereum net flow for GBTC, IBIT, ETHE, ETH, and ETHA | Source: CoinGlass In their lifetime, GBTC sold 245,430 BTC, while IBIT purchased 667,270 BTC. Out of that, both sold, respectively, 3,310 BTC and 310 BTC since Oct. 10 alone, following the unprecedented crash that liquidated more than $19 billion from crypto traders. Something similar happened to Ethereum ETFs, having outflows in these past nine days over their lifetime activity. Grayscale sold more than 1.08 million ETH from the two ETFs combined, with 145,270 since Oct. 10 alone. BlackRock’s ETHA had a 4.03 million total inflow and a 4.10 million inflow from its launch to Oct. 9, losing around 70,000 ETH in the past nine days. As Coinspeaker reported, all Bitcoin ETFs combined experienced $101 million in outflows on Oct. 22, with analysts turning bearish. Yet, market participants started to turn bullish as Donald Trump pardoned Changpeng Zhao (CZ), Binance founder, who recently predicted Bitcoin will eventually flip gold in market value.

Earnings boosts from brands such as Gucci maker Kering kept European markets in the green as losses from major components reversed yesterday’s gains in Dublin. Dublin The Iseq All-Share index ended the session down 0.49 per cent to 11,603.88. Kerry Group topped the Iseq after the release of its Q3 results showed volume growth and strong margin expansion. It closed up 4.73 per cent to a share price of €83.05. Agriculture group Origin Enterprises also had a good day, adding 3.84 per cent to reach €3.79. Permanent TSB led the way for the banks, gaining 0.87 per cent while Bank of Ireland and AIB lost ground, falling 1.05 per cent and 1.72 per cent. A number of major Iseq components fell on the day, dragging down the index. Airliner Ryanair saw its shares fall 1.91 per cent on the day, while fellow big cap Kingspan fell 1.22 per cent to €68.75. London Britain’s stock market ended the day at a new high. The blue chip FTSE 100 share index posted a new closing high after new US sanctions on Russia drove up the value of UK energy companies. This takes its gains so far this year to more than 17 per cent. BP, up 3.7 per cent and Shell up 2.9 per cent were among the big risers, after Donald Trump announced new sanctions on Russia’s two biggest oil producers, Rosneft and Lukoil. In another blow to Russia, European Union countries agreed a new package of sanctions against Russia for its war against Ukraine that includes a ban on Russian liquefied natural gas imports. Pest control firm Rentokil, up 8.3 per cent, ended the day as the top riser, after cheering the City by reporting improved trading at its US pest control division. The London Stock Exchange Group was also in demand and rose 7.1 per cent, after reporting strong growth, an investment by a consortium of banks into its Post Trade Services division and a new £1bn share buy-back programme. The mood in the City was not shaken by the news that UK manufacturing orders have fallen at their fastest rates since July 2020, with factory bosses expecting further weakness. An index of UK precious metal miners advanced, tracking gold prices, as U.S. sanctions against Russia and possible new export controls on China stoked geopolitical concerns, buoying demand for safe-haven assets. Europe The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.35 per cent as European Union countries approved a 19th package of sanctions on Moscow that included a ban on Russian liquefied natural gas imports. Gains in heavyweight energy stocks kept the index in the green after the US imposed new sanctions on Russia and strong corporate earnings, while the US-China trade frictions capped gains. Among corporate updates, Nokia jumped 10.84 per cent after reporting third-quarter profit well ahead of expectations. Kering’s overall group sales fell less than analysts expected in the third quarter. Shares of the French luxury group rose 8.71 per cent. BE Semiconductor rose 4.15 per cent after the chipmaking equipment supplier posted a quarterly operating profit beat. Dassault Systemes fell 12.98 per cent, just off the bottom of STOXX 600, after the French software company cut its full-year revenue growth guidance and published third-quarter results below consensus. Sodexo declined 7.3 per cent after the caterer forecast slower revenue growth in 2026 than in 2025. New York Wall Street was unsettled in midafternoon trading on Thursday, as underwhelming earnings from Tesla and IBM, as well as simmering US-China trade tensions, kept risk appetite on a tight leash. Tesla, which kicked off the ‘Magnificent Seven’ earnings parade, missed third-quarter profit estimates, dragging its shares down with its revenue beat offering little comfort. But even as Tesla slipped, the rest of the tech titans stepped up – with bargain hunters scooping up megacap names. The ‘Magnificent Seven’ cohort, which makes up nearly 35 per cent of the S&P 500’s weight, saw modest gains. Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Broadcom saw single digit growth. Honeywell rose after the industrial giant raised its 2025 profit forecast despite the looming spin-off of its advanced materials unit. The gain kept the Dow afloat. But IBM weighed on the index, sliding due to a slowdown in its key cloud software segment. – Additional reporting, Reuters, Guardian.

Title: Man found guilty of murder of Kieran Quilligan in Cork
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/courts/2025/10/23/man-found-guilty-of-murder-of-kieran-quilligan-in-cork/
Time Published: 2025-10-23T16:04:49Z
Full Content:
A man has been found guilty of the murder of Kieran Quilligan whose skeletal remains were found dumped in scrubland in Cork City over two years ago. Niall Long (33), formerly of St Michael’s Close, Mahon, Cork had denied the murder of Mr Quilligan (47) on a date unknown between September 1st 2023 and January 29th 2024. The jury of 10 men and two women returned after four hours and 47 minutes of deliberations on Thursday and found Long guilty of the murder of Quilligan. Long was remanded in custody by Ms Justice Siobhán Lankford for sentence at a later date. Meanwhile, the jury asked for more time to consider the evidence against Long’s co-accused, Luke Taylor (27), formerly of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock, Cork and Ms Justice Lankford asked them to return on Friday to continue their deliberations with regard to Mr Taylor. During the trial, the jury heard that Quilligan’s murder had its origins in an incident where he and another man allegedly robbed Long of drugs and cash off York St in Cork City on September 1st 2023 and Quilligan disappeared later that day. Quilligan’s partner Colette O’Driscoll said that the last time she saw her partner was when he left their apartment at Riverview on Anderson’s Quay in Cork City centre accompanied by Mr Taylor shortly before 9pm on the night of September 1st, 2023. “He [Quilligan] said he would be back in five to 10 minutes when he left with Luke Taylor – I never saw him again,” said Ms O’Driscoll, adding that when he failed to return home, she reported him missing to An Garda Síochána three days later on September 4th. The jury heard that gardaí were able to track Quilligan walking with Mr Taylor up the quays in Cork City to St Finbar’s Placebut there was no sign of him ever emerging at the top of the steps on to Fort Street. However, they heard evidence a white Toyota Rav 4 was seen entering Fort Street and reversing into the steps at the top of St Finbarr’s Place and it was later tracked on CCTV going to Little Island and Rostellan in east Cork where Quilligan’s skeletal remains were found on January 29th, 2024. Assistant State Pathologist, Dr Margot Bolster said she was unable to say exactly when Quilligan had died or give a precise cause of death due to the length of time between his death and the postmortem which had resulted in the decay and disappearance of all soft tissue and organs. However, Dr Bolster said it was clear Quilligan had been the victim of a serious assault as he had suffered numerous injuries, including fractures of the temporal bone, parietal bone and mandible or jawbone in the head as well as fractures to several ribs, leg bones and hand bones. The jury also heard evidence from Dr Sarah Fleming of Forensic Science Ireland that she forensically examined blood stains found in the boot of a white Toyota Rav 4 belonging to Long’s mother Janice, and it provided a DNA match with Quilligan. A mat from the boot of the car had DNA profile matches for both Quilligan and Long while bloodstaining on a headrest had a DNA profile match for Quilligan and a light bloodstain on a label of part of a T-shirt found in the car matched both Quilligan’s and Long’s DNA. The jury also heard from Sgt Maurice O’Connor how gardaí were able to retrieve a text sent by Long’s mother, Janice from her phone on September 2nd, 2023, in which she said she noticed a smell of Dettol in the boot of her white Toyota Rav 4. Although gardaí never found Long’s phone they were able to establish the content of a replying message he sent in which he said, “Yeah, it does, the fellow who robbed me and cut my neck got a hiding and got thrown in the boot, so the boot was cleaned.” The case continues.

Title: City-States Without Limits – Part 2
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/city-states-without-limits-part-2/
Time Published: 2025-10-23T16:00:00Z
Full Content:
In Part 1, we discussed the NRx technocrats’ ideas and how they have influenced the city-state model that seeks to capitalise on the global proliferation of Special Economic Zones (SEZs). We examined the role of functional oligarchies in this endeavor. In Part 2, we look at how that city-state model manifests internationally and what it implies, not just for global governance structures, but for humanity. In Part 1, we explored the ideology that has been adopted by a powerful group of NRx technocrat-oligarchs and how their proposals align with the interests of their international oligarch partners. We discussed the venture capital impact investment strategy the NRx technocrats call “accelerationism” and how governments are actually “functional oligarchies.” The model of “government” the NRx technocrats propose is unlike anything we are currently familiar with. It is much more akin to the kind of authoritarian dictatorships exercised by the feudal monarchs of Medieval Europe. These gov-corp Technates, as envisaged, effectively amount to dictatorial city-states under the direct control of oligarchs. The NRx technocrats seek to break nation-states apart into technologically governed “enclaves” (gov-corp Technates). These “realms” will form an international “Patchwork,” with each enclave or “network archipelago” represented as a digital node, almost certainly on a single, overarching blockchain or “unified ledger.” The digital access permissions to the node, which serves as the digital twin for the physical realm of the city-state “enclave,” will be controlled by the “founder” or their selected administrators of the realm. This forms a gov-corp Technate ruled by a CEO King (oligarch) where “nothing officially exists” unless it is represented digitally on the realm’s ledger (blockchain). The citizens of the realm are customers of the sovereign corporation (sovcorp) that rules the gov-corp Technate. The customers will have no individual sovereignty unless they purchase it from the “founder.” All value is digital in the realm. The life of your “digital twin,” monitored through the requirement to use digital ID, seamlessly links a customer’s offline life to that of their online digital twin. By controlling the programmable digital currency allotted to the customer’s digital twin, via their digital ID, any misbehaviour can be punished by the founder or their delegated system administrators. For example, by freezing “their deposits” or locking people “out of all doors for a time period as a punishment.” There are no means of recourse in a gov-corp Technate. The only option open to the persecuted customer is to flee, if they have the means. We also discussed how governments around the world have already started carving out nascent gov-corp Technates in the form of thousands of Special Economic Zones (SEZs). Some of which, such as Shenzhen in China, have already been established as de facto city-states with their own increasingly independent jurisdictions and embryonic city-state governments. At the heart of this effort to create a global patchwork of city-states are the NRx technocrats, perhaps most notably Peter Thiel, Elon Musk and Marc Andreessen in the US, and venture capital firms like NeWay Capital and Pronomos Capital. But they are far from alone. The NRx technocrat network is global and, at the highest governmental and intergovernmental level, the hope is to bring about the global governance of a patchwork of city-state gov-corp Technates. NRx technocrats want to create a global “patchwork” of digital surveillance societies where “nothing officially exists unless it’s on-chain.” All value is digital and the private founder[s], by virtues of the supreme sovereignty they have purchased with their investment, control their private fiefdoms as CEO “kings” of the ruling corporations. In effect, by exploiting digital technology and, most notably, Artificial Intelligence (AI), the NRx technocrats want to create a global network of privately financed smart-cities. A smart-city can be said to be “an urban area where technology and data collection help improve [. . .] the sustainability and efficiency of city operations. [. . .] Technologies to collect data—including real-time data—are central to smart-city initiatives.” The objective of smart-city design is to control the urban environment and its inhabitants’ behaviour. Taking a positive view of smart-city behavioural control, researchers from the Indonesian Journal of Information Systems and Informatics nonetheless noted: The influence of smart city technology on consumer behavior in urban environments and people’s daily routines and lifestyle habits is significant. [. . .] The development of smart-cities through the application of various technologies such as smart transportation systems, traffic management applications, and smart sensors [. . .] has changed the behavior of people. [. . .] Thus, the application of smart city technology not only transforms city infrastructure and services, but also brings significant changes in citizen behavior. Though behavioural control exercised by smart-city operators could possibly be benign, it could also be abused by despots to effectively program our lives. That is certainly what the NRx technocrats have in mind—engineering the “unthinking demos” whose sovereignty will be treated with “derision.” Regardless of the risks, smart-cities are being constructed the world over. The China Global Television Network (CGTN) is part of the state-run China Media Group. In July of this year, CGTN reported how the Chinese government was “accelerating” the development of smart-cities. CGTN revealed that Shenzhen won an international award for smart-city of the year from the 2024 Smart-City Expo World Congress (SCEWC). The SCEWC emphasised how the congress was impressed with Shenzhen’s application of the Chinese “Smarter City, Better Life” policy initiative that seeks to address “urban challenges” through the rapid deployment of technology. Just like the NRx technocrats in the West, Chinese policy think tanks apparently see technology as the solution; full stop. The SCEWC said: The initiative has pursued an aggressive digital transformation strategy to address these challenges across various sectors. Key components include the development of high-speed broadband networks, using digital twin technology to model and manage city systems, and integrating artificial intelligence and data-driven governance into city operations. [. . .] The city has also fostered an environment that encourages technological innovation and has attracted significant investment from private companies developing smart-city technologies. Again, there is no notable difference between the stakeholder capitalist—public-private partnership—finance model for smart-city construction in China’s SEZs than that found anywhere else. The SCEWC continued: Shenzhen has pioneered the “4321+X” model for smart community development, emphasizing integrating government networks, video networks, IoT sensor networks, and the internet to create comprehensive data and service platforms. These platforms provide a foundation for various smart city applications, including public safety management, community governance, and the delivery of public services. The 4321+X smart-city “community” is controlled based upon a set of clearly defined processes. The “4” refers to the integration of four data networks: the government’s network, private community CCTV networks, the internet, and specifically the Internet of Things (IoT). The “3” relates to the three areas of community activity to be integrated within and surveilled through the four networks: all business, public security (public conduct), and the local governance of services, including local security services. The “2” Refers to two major service sectors—called “platforms”—that combine to effect the monitoring of the three key areas of activity linked to the four networks. The two “platforms” are local government and law enforcement. Finally, the “1” refers to the master database which, when Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)—such as blockchain—is used, could be called the “unified ledger.” The ledger ties all the surveillance of the entire smart-city, combining 4, 3, and 2 together, into one centrally administered smart-city system. The smart-city supposedly facilitates “X” which is the artificially intelligent delivery of governance and services to the citizen. The unified ledger (“1”) is monitored and controlled by the “Urban Brain” or “City Brain” which is the central command system for the smart-city. The Urban Planning Society of China—a non-governmental organisation (NGO) that operates by approval from China’s Ministry of Construction and Ministry of Civil Affairs—states that the purpose of the “Urban Brain” is to allocate “public resources” and enhance “social governance” in order to provide “new pathways for promoting sustainable economic and social development.” As we noted in Part 1, China’s modern technological innovation is overwhelmingly the result of public-private partnership. In Hangzhou, for instance, the City Brain is managed by one global corporation: Alibaba is the powerhouse of the technology from data platforms to advance analytics algorithm that enables all the smart city application. In NRx technocrat terms, Alibaba Group is the sovereign corporation (sovcorp) of the city of Hangzhou, with a considerable ability to potentially control the lives of its nine million citizens or “customers.” As with all smart-city developments, the media only reports the realised or projected social benefits. The likely pitfalls are studiously ignored. To understand the danger we all face, if we take to living in such cities, we first need to consider how social credits systems are intended to work. There are many, persistent myths peddled in the West about China’s Social Credit System (SCS). The mainstream media will sometimes have you believe that it is already a totalitarian nightmare and some in the independent media will try to convince you that is doesn’t exist. The truth lies somewhere in between. China is the only country to have formally established an SCS, but it is not the only country to have implemented one. The purpose of social credit is to reward or punish citizen behaviour, not through the courts or any legal process, but through the enhanced or restricted access to both public and private services. Operation Choke Point in the US saw the Department of Justice collaborate with private banks to cut-off access to finance for entirely legal small to medium size businesses deemed to present a “reputational risk.” Similarly, in Canada, the government worked with private banks, and insurers to shut down the small businesses of lawful and legitimate protestors. These are just a couple of the many clear examples of SCS operating in the West. China’s SCS was formally established in 2014. It is a sprawling and often confusing slew of government directives and regulations that each provincial authority has to decipher and apply as best as it can. The overarching objective is to establish a measure of “societal creditworthiness.” This does not just mean “credit” in the financial sense. It relates to the degree of “trustworthiness” the state credits to its own departments and local administrations, to businesses and to individuals. China’s SCS refers to “entities,” meaning both public and private organisations, including businesses. Much of the SCS is focused upon cleaning up public sector corruption, eliminating the “untrustworthiness” of those entities in order to promote a “harmonious” society. It also focuses on the “untrustworthiness” of individuals. An SCS objective is to “put untrustworthy individuals on a credit blacklist.” Another is to develop online systems to evaluate individual’s online social credit “trustworthiness” and, for instance, to punish those who engage in online “rumour-mongering;” it talks about systems to assess the “individual character” of citizens and the enforcement of “citizen morality.” In China, a “natural person” is a legal construct that means a human being or citizen. In its 2025 announced improvements to its SCS, the Chinese government encouraged regional authorities to promote “the credit construction of natural persons” and to establish “sound credit records of natural persons.” Looking at the development of the smart-city in Shenzhen, and the risks of pooling “big data,” researchers from the Berlin Institute of Chinese Studies found: [T]he digital systems in Shenzhen entail a creeping centralisation of data that potentially turns lower administrative government units into mere users of the city-level smart platforms rather than being in control of their own data resources. Smart city development and big data ambitions thereby imply shifting stakeholder relations at the local level and also pull non-governmental stakeholders, such as information technology companies and research institutions, closer to new data flows and smart governance systems. In a world shaped by stakeholder capitalism, “smart governance systems” are invariably controlled by the private sector. Local governments become the “mere users” of the “City Brains” overseen by multinational corporations. The evident objective is to link the behavioural control afforded by smart-city technology to SCS. As pointed out by MIT Technology Review in 2022, there is currently no crushing, universal social credit score in China that enables totalitarian control: There’s no evidence yet that this system has been abused for widespread social control (though it remains possible that it could be wielded to hurt individual rights). Indeed, smart-city technology combined with SCS certainly could be wielded to socially engineer populations. The push towards smart-city developments capable of applying SCS “rules” are by no means restricted to China. It is a global governance policy agenda and the rollout of the necessary digital infrastructure is worldwide. Though most of us are yet to experience the looming overt systematic oppression, it is extremely unwise to ignore that fact that the likely digital panopticon is being erected around us. If we accept the ongoing transformation of the places we live into smart-cities and smart-suburbs, it is the “trust” we will have placed in our rulers, whoever they may be, that is the salient issue. We will have no choice but to trust that the digital control systems we will live in are purely for our benefit. We will have to trust that the enforcement of the SCS rules will be equitable. There is currently no reason to think that will be the case. The potential urban future that the oligarchs driving this agenda have in mind is aligned with the ambitions of the NRx technocrats. It appears that our planned smart city-state future is an envisioned tyranny. The global proliferation of SEZs provides plenty of enticing investment opportunities for NRx technocrats and other oligarchs (See Part 1). SEZs, however, are just one avenue for the potential location of gov-corp Technates. The global transition toward urbanization offers many more. Ironically, the United Nations (UN) both reports on the rampant criminality common to many SEZ developments but also advocates the rapid and significant expansion of SEZs. As noted in Part 1, there is currently little or no evidence that SEZs deliver socioeconomic growth. There is considerable evidence that they seize national territory and transform it into effective private jurisdictions. Yet, in 2022, the UN established the Global Alliance of Special Economic Zones (GASEZ) to increase the SEZ global footprint. GASEZ claims: Special economic zones (SEZs) can make important contributions to economic growth and sustainable development. Zones can help attract investment, create jobs, boost exports, and build productive capacity. [. . .] Collectively SEZs can be more effective in modernization and policy advocacy, and bring on board stakeholders, including governments, the private sector and international organizations. Again, there is virtually no evidence to support GASEZ’ assertions about economic growth. The reason the UN is enthusiastic about SEZ hybrid zone/city developments is that the UN considers them a more effective route for its global “policy advocacy.” Launching GASEZ in 2022, the UN announced: UNCTAD [United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ] joined hands with seven global, regional and national associations representing over 7,000 special economic zones (SEZs) to launch a global alliance. [. . .] They [SEZs] go by many different names, including free-trade zones and industrial parks, and are widely used by developed and developing economies. The Global Alliance of Special Economic Zones (GASEZ) seeks to drive the modernization of these zones across the world and maximize their contribution to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). [. . .] A new model of sustainable special economic zones is therefore rapidly taking shape and they are contributing to more inclusive, resilient and sustainable economies in the countries where they operate. The UN calls the towns and cities we live in “human settlements.” Charter Cities, SEZs with residential capacity, hybrid zone/city developments, resilient cities, 15-minute cities, etc., are all “human settlements” as far as the UN is concerned. Furthermore, all such urban renewal consistently embraces smart-city technology. In 1977, the UN created the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) in order to promote “socially and environmentally sustainable towns and cities.” UN-Habitat states: UN-Habitat is the focal point for all urbanization and human settlement matters within the UN system. [. . .] UN-Habitat collaborates with governments, intergovernmental, UN agencies, civil society organizations, foundations, academic institutions and the private sector to achieve enduring results in addressing the challenges of urbanization. Urbanization is the process of the population shift from rural to urban living environments, or human settlements in the vernacular of the UN. UN-Habitat has wholeheartedly adopted the public-private partnership, or stakeholder capitalist, model of development to address “the challenges of urbanization.” In 2018, the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) reported the findings of its research into World Urbanization Prospects: Today, 55% of the world’s population lives in urban areas, a proportion that is expected to increase to 68% by 2050. Projections show that urbanization [. . .] combined with the overall growth of the world’s population could add another 2.5 billion people to urban areas by 2050, with close to 90% of this increase taking place in Asia and Africa. [. . .] By 2030, the world is projected to have 43 megacities with more than 10 million inhabitants, most of them in developing regions [. . .] many of them located in Asia and Africa. [. . .] As the world continues to urbanize, sustainable development depends increasingly on the successful management of urban growth, especially in low-income and lower-middle-income countries where the pace of urbanization is projected to be the fastest. With this urbanization prospectus in mind, and with a particular focus on managing urban development in the “Global South”—an umbrella term for developing nations wherever they are located—UN-Habitat released its Strategic Plan 2020-2023: UN-Habitat, in its role as a focal point, will call upon all development actors and stakeholders, [. . .] to work in concert to assist it in implementing its Strategic Plan. [. . .] An important effort is required to rethink engagement with the private sector to leverage investment in sustainable urbanization and to promote more appropriate models of development. The UN is eager to liberate private finance in order to construct human smart-megacity settlements, especially in the emerging and developing markets of the Global South, that meet UN sustainable urbanization targets. Sustainable Development Goal 11—SDG 11—defines the global public-private partnership’s city development agenda. The UN calls this its “New Urban Agenda.” The New Urban Agenda emphasises the importance of building “smart-cities” to meet SDGs: The New Urban Agenda calls for technology and communication networks to be strengthened and for smart-city approaches that use digitalization, clean energy and technologies. [. . .] Innovative funding opportunities and partnerships need to be explored and the capacity of local governments to effectively procure, test and implement frontier technologies needs to be significantly strengthened. [. . .] To contribute effectively to urban sustainability, frontier technologies and innovations need to be applied. The “smart-city” is constructed by deploying so-called “frontier technologies” within its infrastructure. A smart-city could be built from scratch or developed in an existing city or conurbation. The UN explains what smart-city frontier technology it considers essential for urban sustainability: [Frontier technologies] currently include, among others, the Internet of things, sensor networks, machine-to-machine communication, robotics, artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, 3D printing, geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing, autonomous unmanned vehicles, drones, blockchain, cryptographic computing, and big data processing and visualization. The UN’s “frontier technologies” are, of course, exactly the kind of technologies that the NRx technocrats allege to be the technological solution to everything (see Part 1). Gov-corp Technates are practically indistinguishable from the hybrid zone/city developments envisaged by the UN’s New Urban Agenda. The downside, from humanity’s perspective, is that at both the global intergovernmental level and at the global multinational corporate-network level, there is a firm commitment to install the biometric digital surveillance state that threatens to enslave us all. Though the UN calls this “sustainable development.” Not only is the UN amenable to the NRx technocrat’s digital panopticon plans, it also favours their “patchwork of realms” idea. The UN considers the future of global governance to lay in centralised global authority exerted over a transnational network of city-states. Or, as UN-Habitat puts it, “connectivity across urban networks, between cities and their surroundings [. . .] must be strengthened. That requires a country-wide – and sometimes cross-border – approach to development.” The UN’s global governance model has been moving in this direction or a while. In 2005, then London Mayor Ken Livingston convened the C20 city network, inviting mayors from another eighteen cities to work collectively to reduce so-called climate pollution (CO2 emissions). In 2006, the addition of 22 city mayors created the C40 cities network. The C40 cities network is financed by, among others, the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) which is heavily backed by the Gates Foundation. The aim of CIFF is to improve the lives of children living in the Global South by “lobbying” their governments to create regulatory “enabling environments” to stimulate national carbon trading in the global Emissions Trading Scheme (ETF) markets. Another prominent C40 funder is Bloomberg Philanthropies, led by oligarch and former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg. Always driven by a commitment to UN global governance policies, in 2011, C40 formalised its relationship with the UN by agreeing on a climate action partnership with the World Bank—a specialized agency of the UN. Such UN partnerships are in keeping with UN ambitions to cultivate its global governance through an international network of city-states. In 2013, American political theorist Benjamin R. Barber (1939 – 2017) published If Mayors Ruled the World: Dysfunctional Nations, Rising Cities. Barber contended that city administrations were more closely connected to their populations and thus more democratically representative than nation-states. He argued that city administrations, in countries around the world, had more in common with each other than they had with their own national governments. Unencumbered by political divisions and national rivalries, he posited that cities were better “building blocks of global governance.” Advocating a global network of cities, Barber wrote: If democracy is to survive globalization, imagining a global democratic order with the city at its core may be crucial. Envision not states but cities as building blocks for global governance. [. . .] Global governance in which the city predominates is the aim. Evidently enthused by Barber’s vision, Michael Bloomberg announced he was stepping down as Mayor of New York and set up the first CityLab summit in 2013. Mayors from cities around the world were invited to network and collaborate in order to “exchange ideas and tackle some of the most urgent issues affecting cities around the world.” In 2014, a month after officially leaving office in New York, Bloomberg was appointed as the UN’s first Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change. Thus strengthening the link between urban development and the implementation of the global governance agenda. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the objective of creating the post for Bloomberg was for the UN to consult “with mayors and related key stakeholders” in order to “mobilize action among cities as part of [the UN’s] long-term strategy.” Already the president of the board of the C40 cities network, Bloomberg soon established the Compact of Mayors committing city leaders to implement UN SDGs. In 2016, the UN’s Global Compact of Mayors joined with the similar European Union’s (EU’s) Covenant of Mayors to become the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy (GCoM). Currently acting as the UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy on Climate Ambition and Solutions, Michael Bloomberg is the current co-chair of the GCoM. The GCoM established the INVEST4CITIES initiative to generate “massive and targeted investment” to construct smart-cities. The private sector investment opportunity is set to provide “$23 trillion in investment potential” by 2030. The public sector’s (local government’s) role is to create “the enabling environments that support local investment.” The GCoM plan is that “large-scale financing instruments” will fund “local implementation” of frontier technologies to construct global governance (SDG) compliant smart-cities. In the same year (2016) that the GCoM was signed by an international network of mayors, Bloomberg created the Global Parliament of Mayors (GPM) to give the civic leaders formal global governance roles. The GPM was first mooted in 2013 by Bloomberg CityLab based on Benjamin Barber’s “idea of a global governance platform for cities.” Barber was personally involved in the formation of the GPM and, when he died in 2017, the GPM created the annual Benjamin Barber Award, given to the most global governance compliant mayor of the year. The purpose of the GPM is to attack the supposed political sovereignty of national governments and reimagine international relations. The GPM champions “the city’s right to self-government” and promotes “collective city decision-making across national borders.” The GPM is “actively engaged in decision-making by international organisations.” The GPM is the UN’s expression of Barber’s vision of “global governance in which the city predominates.” In 2017, adopting the NRx technocrats’ accelerationism, the C40 network started implementing a number of “High-Impact Accelerators.” The C40 accelerators form one of the “project pipelines” that contributes toward the GCoM’s INVEST4CITIES strategy. The GCoM aims to “accelerate city and local government access to financial resources” by “removing barriers to investor-oriented climate action plans and projects, and unlocking large-scale financing instruments to boost urban action implementation.” As you can imagine, with $23 trillion of investment opportunities in sight, the envisaged ROI is not only mouthwatering, if the planned city-state is a startup project it also promises oligarchs possible city ownership rights (see Part 1). The UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) convened the Day of Cities in 2019. Mayors from across, what the UN called, “the region”—meaning Europe—met to discuss “how to create smart sustainable cities.” This resulted in the 2020 Geneva Declaration of Mayors. In response to multiple alleged global crises—the pseudopandemic, the climate crisis, natural disasters, etc.—the UNECE mayors noted how the global policy response to the pseudopandemic could be adopted as a model for urban development: [C]ities were in lockdown – and many industries, transport networks and businesses closed – we [. . .] started to experience an unknown urban life: better air quality, the return of nature to our cities, and empty streets giving space to cyclists and pedestrians. [. . .] The pandemic provided a testing ground for what cities could look like; the transformation of urban spaces happened overnight. If there is only one lesson to learn from this crisis, it is that rapid change of our urban reality is possible [and] behaviour patterns can be adapted. [. . .] Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 calls for action to work towards [. . .] resilient and sustainable cities – it is now in our hands to place the SDGs at the centre of our recovery efforts and create new urban realities. Today, boasting “over 13,500 cities and local governments” from “6 continents and 147 countries” the GCoM alleges that it represents “more than 1.2 billion people.” It is, however, hard to see how GCoM “represents” anyone other than its public-private “stakeholders.” One wonders how many people who elect their local and city “representatives” in these GCoM coordinated cities and suburbs are told that they are consenting to global governance and the transformation of their communities into smart-city gov-corp Technates. Empty streets, no cars, drone ports, driverless AI controlled public transport, protein labs growing artificial food substitutes, augmented reality, insect-based snacks, and new religious identities are part of what leading oligarch-led think tank Chatham House (The Royal Institute of International Affairs) predicted in 2021 with its notion of our Futurescape. Whether this is the future city-life any of us want is irrelevant. At every level, NRx technocrats and their fellow oligarchs view such “urbanization” as the pathway to establishing effective global governance. That the UN considers societal lockdowns as an exemplar of what it calls a “better urban life” betrays the oligarchs’ true intentions. The United Nations (UN) declares that it is responsible for global governance. The UN also says that “governance” means: “the process of decision-making and the process by which decisions are implemented.” Therefore, the UN asserts that it is the body which makes and implements decisions—which manifest as government policy—for the world. UN-Habitat—the UN’s “focal point for all urbanization and human settlement matters”—with its New Urban Agenda to transform the urban environment into a global network of smart-cities, extols stakeholder capitalism and is keen to use the associated public-private partnership model. In 2022, UN-Habitat and the World Economic Forum (WEF) created the The Global Partnership for Local Investment (GPLI). The GPLI immediately set up the G20 Global smart-cities Alliance and clarified its public-private purpose: Public-private collaborations reflect a form of indirect management in public administration, where [. . .] public, private or non-profit partners make decisions jointly. [. . .] Public-private collaborations can repurpose city assets for the deployment of digital infrastructure. [. . .] Physical assets, such as rooftops, utility poles, street lights, traffic lights, ducts and more, can become smart assets and be used to drive efficiencies and new services. Public spaces and airspace can take on new value as technology, such as drones, enabl[e] [sic] new use cases. UN-Habitat and the WEF highlight the private sector investment opportunity for those with the wealth to capitalise on them—oligarchs: [S]mart-city services can generate new revenue streams and revenue savings to be shared between partners. The Futurescape imagined by Chatham House is under construction with the support of the United Nations and the “leading” multinational corporations aligned under the WEF umbrella. It is also a project shared by the BRICS+ group of nations and their corporate partners. The BRICS have established the General Assembly of Cities and Municipalities which will focus on “inter-municipal cooperation” rather than international cooperation. Following the 2025 BRICS summit in Brazil, the BRICS group issued a joint statement: One of the key topics shaping the future of the BRICS is the development of smart-cities supported by emerging technologies, particularly artificial intelligence (AI). [. . .] With the recent expansion of the BRICS to include countries such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, and Iran, the bloc is establishing itself as a leading platform for Global South cooperation [. . .] particularly in the realm of sustainable urbanization driven by technologies such as AI. [. . .] Artificial intelligence is increasingly being adopted in major BRICS cities, notably impacting urban planning, public service management, and civic engagement. China is at the forefront of developing AI-powered smart-cities, particularly in Shanghai and Shenzhen. The BRICS+ group emphasises the importance of the BRICS New Development Bank (NDB) to “finance sustainable infrastructure” and “increase lending for AI-driven public service projects.” The group observes that “South-South cooperation through the BRICS creates active dialogue.” The UN considers cooperation in the “South-South”—referring to partnerships between Southern hemisphere countries—“a key development modality to accelerate progress towards achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.” The UN Office for South-South Cooperation (UNOSSC) collaborates strategically with the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB). In turn, the IsDB has a close working partnership with the NDB. Both the IsDB and the NDB have joined seven other “Multilateral Development Banks” (MDBs) to form a global collaborative partnership coordinated by the UN’s World Bank Group: A much scaled up global effort is thus required to [. . .] tackle transboundary [meaning cross-national border] challenges. [. . .] We [Heads of MDBs] will deepen our collaboration around joint innovative mechanisms for boosting private capital mobilization, both domestically and globally. [. . .] We recognize the need to explore further avenues for strengthening mobilization of private capital. Regardless of where you live on the Earth, your government’s commitment to creating a global network of smart hybrid zone/cities financed by “private capital” is unshakable because your government is following a global policy agenda it did not create and cannot change. In Vietnam, for example, the commitment to constructing smart-cities is significant. Vietnam’s state media, The Voice of Vietnam (VoV), reports: Vietnam is undergoing a sweeping transformation with a clear goal: to build smart-cities that serve the people. The effort is based on national strategies like the Sustainable smart-city Development Plan 2018-2025 with a vision to 2030, the National Digital Transformation Program until 2025 with a vision to 2030, the E-Government Development Strategy toward a Digital Government, and Project 06 on population data and digital identity. The VoV states that residents in smart-cities can “report issues directly to authorities, who respond and take corrective action.” Vietnamese digital smart-city citizens can raise concerns relating to “public security[,] environmental management, healthcare, [. . .] education,” and more via their installed smart-city app. The VoV enthusiastically notes that centrally located AI monitored Intelligent Operations Centers (IOCs)—Urban or City Brains—linked to peoples’ devices and their Vietnam Electronic Identification (VNeID), issued by Vietnam’s Ministry of Public Security (MPS), effectively turn the Vietnamese smart-city citizens’ “smartphones into ‘microphones.’” The VoV adds: Citizens must also play their part: verifying VNeID at level 2, uploading personal documents to their digital accounts, using the national portal [. . .] for public services, downloading their local smart-city app, and using cashless payments wherever possible. Every tap on a screen lays another brick in building Vietnam’s vision of modern, intelligent, liveable cities for the future. The state taking almost unimaginable control of every “citizen’s” life is part of Vietnam’s digital transformation plan—Project 06. The Vietnamese government has already started the process of freezing up to 86 million of Vietnam’s estimated 200 million banks accounts unless they are “verified” using state approved digital ID (biometric authentication or VNeID). So clearly, every citizen “must” comply and the digital transformation, despite all the fluffy rhetoric about inclusion, is avowedly exclusionary. Project 06 is led by the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) working closely with the Ministry of Public Security (MPS). A major part of the role of the MPS is to ensure social order and to collect, analyse and evaluate information with a view to “prevent, detect and defeat any plots and acts of violation against national security and eliminate any threats to national security,” to protect the “Party” and the “State,” and to “implement international commitments and obligations.” The digital surveillance plan has been promoted by Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and other government officials, but the Project 06 policy initiative did not originate with the Vietnamese government. With its stated “vision to 2030,” Project 06 is firmly rooted in the United Nations’ (UN’s) global governance agenda. The Vietnamese Ministry of Planning and Development noted that the country’s digital transformation will contribute to the reduction of (CO2) emissions, though it is obviously designed to enable state surveillance of the population. Speaking in January this year, UN Under-Secretary-General Amandeep Singh Gill said he was impressed with Vietnam’s public-private partnership (multistakeholder) approach to “harness digital technologies for inclusive, sustainable development.” He added: I saw with my own eyes how Viet Nam is pushing forward strongly and proactively in the areas of digital transformation and AI. [. . .] [F]rameworks are needed to ensure that everyone benefits from the technical advancement, and that no one is left behind. [. . .] The Global Digital Compact offers such a framework at the global level, and Viet Nam’s willingness to play an active role in key areas of the [sic] is welcomed and appreciated by the United Nations. The Global Digital Compact, adopted without a vote in September 2024 by UN member states as an annex to the UN’s Pact for the Future, is the UN’s “global framework” to facilitate “multi-stakeholder action” to enable “the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals.” The UN defined “digital public goods” as software, data, AI models, and all content published online. Further, it decided that “digital public infrastructure” essentially meant all hardware and the physical infrastructure for all digital communication systems. The UN said that it considered “digital public goods and digital public infrastructure to be key drivers of inclusive digital transformation and innovation.” It added that “[g]overnments, the private sector, civil society, technical and academic communities and international and regional organizations” should work together to to “leverage digital public goods and digital public infrastructure to advance solutions for the Sustainable Development Goals.” In other words, the UN decided that the internet and digital technology, in its entirety, should be leveraged to deliver the UN’s global governance policy agendas. The UN invited the “private sector and philanthropic actors [oligarchs]” to finance the digital transformation. Populations might not want to go along with the digital transformation of their world, nor the degree of public-private state surveillance foisted upon them. Perhaps anticipating some pushback, the UN decided that anything that questioned its transformative global governance agenda constituted a “form of violence” it calls “misinformation and disinformation”: We must urgently counter and address all forms of violence, including [. . .] all forms of hate speech and discrimination, misinformation and disinformation. [. . .] We commit to, by 2030, [. . .] assess the impact of misinformation and disinformation on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. [. . .] We further urgently [. . .] [c]all on social media platforms to provide researchers access to data [. . .] to build an evidence base on how to address misinformation and disinformation and hate speech that can inform government and industry policies, standards and best practices The idea that governments and private corporations should form “policies” to address “misinformation and disinformation” might sound reasonable at first, but that all depends upon who decides what constitutes misinformation and disinformation. The UN is clear that misinformation and disinformation incudes information that undermines its policies related to “public health and climate action.” Questioning the global digital transformation that is designed to “advance solutions for the Sustainable Development Goals” threatens “climate action” and is therefore disinformation that governments and private corporations should “counter and address.” Governments around the world are implementing laws and regulations to seize control of the information we can share with that goal in mind. Of course, this could not be more anti-democratic, but governments serve as functional oligarchies not democracies. None of the governments that have passed or intend to pass online censorship laws are the instigators of these policies or legislative moves. They emanate from the global governance of the UN and its agencies where real Orbital Authority is exercised. In Part 1, we discussed NRx technocrat Curtis Yarvin’s metaphorical exploration of global government that he termed “Orbital Authority.” The global transformation of our urban environments is already being propelled by such authority. It is an oligarch-led public-private, or multistakeholder, global governance authority. Oligarch-backed policy think tanks, such as Bloomberg’s CityLab, and the state-funded public-private partnership think tanks, like the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT), form the policy and design the corresponding implementation initiatives. The CAICT calls itself “a specialized think-tank for the government and an innovation and development platform for the industry.” The CAICT acts as an “enabler for innovation and development in an information society.” It is a public-private partnership that “plays an important role in strategy and policy” with respect to the digital transformation in China. Chinese state media recently reported China’s official launch of its plan to provide “processing resources across China,” to link City Brains and other smart-city elements together in a “mega computing project” that will create regional data hubs. From the reports, you would imagine that the CPC was leading the rollout. That impression is misleading. It was the CAICT that proposed the concept of the “National Integrated Computing Power and Network Scheduling Platform” that has given rise to the reportedly state-led mega computing project. The CAICT is also a UN partner with an agreement in place to implement the “digital transformation aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals” across Africa. African governments are not designing “Africa’s digital future” any more than China’s government is heading the “digital transformation” in China. The transformation is a global governance agenda, far beyond the influence of any electorate or population, and national governments’ role is merely to create the enabling environment (see Part 1) to establish the resultant global governance. The UN fully backs and promotes this worldwide digital transformation. In addition, the UN has already established global governance structures “in which the city predominates.” This unwavering transformation of the global polity and societal norms is precisely what the NRx technocrats want and are committed to achieving. The Orbital Authority that Curtis Yarvin deems necessary for “thousands of independent sovereign states and city-states” to “flourish” is being constructed by the UN and its multinational corporate “stakeholders.” The UN is predominantly an oligarch-led project. In 2014, professor of international history Ludovic Tournès, writing for The Journal of Modern European History, highlighted the significant influence of the Rockefellers in establishing the United Nations. In the late 1950s, the Rockefeller-funded Special Studies Project began publishing its findings, culminating in the 1961 publication of the full report titled “Prospect for America: The Rockefeller Panel Reports.” Seeking to strengthen UN global governance, The Rockefeller Study Project recommended dividing the world “into smaller units” that would “consist of regional institutions under an international body of growing authority [the UN]” (page 26). The researchers ultimately recommended: The most natural multination arrangements are frequently regional. [. . .] We believe that this regional approach has world-wide validity. [. . .] What is needed immediately is a determination to move in the direction they imply. Regional arrangements are no longer a matter of choice. They are imposed by the requirements of technology, science, and economics. Our course is to contribute to this process by constructive action [pages 188–190]. The idea of a global governance system, based upon a regional balance of power, had been pursued by a trans-Atlantic oligarch network—of which the Rockefellers are leading members—since the early 20th century. As part of the process of “constructive action” to establish this new world order, in 1965 the Rockefellers convened an international conference at their Villa Serbelloni mansion in Bellagio, Italy. Today called the Bellagio Center, the 1965 meeting at the Villa set up the Club of Rome policy think tank which solidified as “a core group of like-minded thinkers” in 1968. In September 1973, the Club of Rome proposed a global governance model that divided the world into ten regions. In their report, titled “Regionalized and Adaptive Model of the Global World System,” they described these global governance regions as “Kingdoms.” The same year, David Rockefeller co-founded the Trilateral Commission policy think tank with US political scientist and policy advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. Unsurprisingly, the Trilateral Commission claims the authority to “affect [. . .] foreign policy and national security strategies,” across three global regions it calls pillars: North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. The current model of regional Kingdoms—“pillars” or “poles”—is commonly referred to as multipolarity and the consequent Multipolar World Order (MWO) is said to be in prospect. The Munich Security Conference (MSC) is the premier international public-private security policy conference where predominantly, but not exclusively, Western “decision-makers” meet annually to network and form international defence and security policy. The MSC 2025 report informs us that there is a “changing global distribution of power,” adding that a “multipolar world holds significant promise.” However, it also notes that the new multipolar global governance bureaucracy must not impede “joint approaches to global crises and threats.” The MSC determined that “depolarization [. . .] could set multipolarity on a positive track,” where “depolarization” refers to the process of nations accepting their sociopolitical and perhaps cultural differences but aligning to their respective “poles” in order to address “global crises” through collective action. To explain its “depolarization” point, on behalf of the MSC “decision-makers” it represents, the MSC report referenced the 2023 comments of then German Chancellor Olaf Scholtz who said, in order to “keep multilateralism alive in a multipolar world,” it was essential to maintain “greater participation in, and integration into, the international order.” In other words, depolarization is multipolar decentralisation leading to greater centralisation within the global “order.” This is the same decentralization to recentralization trick (see Part 1) favoured by the NRx technocrats. Depolarization is not transforming global governance by chance. Influential oligarch-led policy think tanks, such as the UK-based Chatham House and its sister organisation, the US Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), have been trying to create the depolarized regional balance of power global governance system for more than a century. The Council on Foreign Relations is among the many Western oligarch-led think tanks to have consistently promoted multipolarity. In 2023, a team of CFR analysts expressed their opinion about what would constitute the perfect “pole” in a Multipolar World Order: The EU [European Union] is a networked union that allows its members to act together in some ways and apart in others. The EU [. . .] has far more power over its members, which remain sovereign states, than any other regional entity. It is one of a kind. [. . .] The EU has developed a template that other regional organizations are following and customizing in various ways. [. . .] Foreign policy practitioners should hope these blocs succeed. Powerful regional unions are the necessary intermediaries between international or global institutions and state and local governments. According to the CFR, the European Union (EU) presents us with the ideal “template” for a MWO pole. Speaking at the 2025 Munich Security Conference, H.E. Wang Yi, Director of the CPC’s Committee Foreign Affairs, stressed that “China has always seen in Europe an important pole in the multipolar world.” China is currently leading the push to create an Asian Union. The CPC and the CFR appear to be in agreement on the perfect “pole.” Though nation-states supposedly remain “sovereign,” the EU-pole exerts “power over its members”—constituent governments. This CFR argument is self-contradictory nonsense. The governments of nation-states cannot possibly be both “sovereign” and, at the same time, subservient to the leadership of their “pole.” It is unconscionable to imagine that the CFR analysts don’t appreciate this point. What they offer is MWO propaganda. The whole point of the regional “pole,” or “union,” is to act as a completely unnecessary “intermediar[y] between international or global institutions and [. . .] governments.” The CFR defines “international or global institutions” as the UN, its specialized agencies, and groups like the International Monetary Fund and the the G20 (Group of Twenty). We have just discussed the G20 Global smart-city Alliance. It embraces stakeholder capitalism, where governments and their private sector partners “make decisions jointly [to] repurpose city assets for the deployment of digital infrastructure.” Given the UN commitment to global governance where “the city predominates,” the discernable nature of the real “Orbital Authority” is materializing. Governments that are functional oligarchies (see Part 1) are being subsumed into regional poles within a Multipolar World Order that has been actively sought by generations of globalist oligarchs. The poles will empower public-private “international organisations”—dominated by private capital (oligarchs)—to set policy for the regional pole’s member state, thereby removing any meaningful expression of national sovereignty. Simultaneously, privately financed smart-city “zones” are being carved out of nation-states as global governance moves toward “collective city decision-making across national borders.” Curtis Yarvin’s “Orbital Authority” was a metaphor, but there is nothing metaphorical about the deliberate, oligarch-led transformation of our world. What they are constructing mirrors the “patchwork” of network states—gov-corp Technates—proposed by the NRx technocrats. The aim is the digital enslavement of humanity to the asserted authority of private capital. Far from resisting this emerging tyranny, governments are willingly hastening the process because they are functional oligarchies. Knowing the kind of feudalistic tyranny they portend, who would ever choose to live in a gov-corp Technate? Unfortunately, millions of the most vulnerable people on earth don’t have much choice regarding where they live and architects of the gov-corp Technates are targetting them to be among their first “customers.” In 2025, the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that refugee migration in 2024 was “driven by conflict, persecution, human rights violations, and instability.” Refugees fled man-made war zones, man-made economic destruction, and man-made persecution—overwhelmingly from countries in the co-called Global South—but there is no sign of people fleeing any climate crisis, anthropogenic or otherwise. Of course, people have to escape natural disasters such as floods and forest fires. But there is no evidence of any upward trend in either the frequency or severity of weather related natural disasters. Again, all too often, we find that the lethal scale of, for example, catastrophic flooding, though undoubtedly caused by extreme weather events, is exacerbated by very poor planning decisions. Nevertheless, as the UNHCR reports, climate change is not a driver of mass migration. Yet, the UN and its partners constantly refer to refugees as largely escaping the “climate crisis.” As there are no climate refugees, the core PR message to the contrary is designed to supposedly justify and facilitate the global governance agenda— the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). That there is no evidence of any climate crisis is irrelevant. Our collective belief in the propaganda is all that matters. Back in 2018, shortly before the UN adopted the Global Compact on Migration, at the annual UN convened Mayoral Forum on Human Mobility, Migration and Development, civic leaders from eighty cities formed the UN’s Mayors Migration Council (MMC). The MMC is a sponsored project of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors that aims to make “a tangible difference in the lives of urban migrants, displaced people, and receiving communities worldwide.” It further proclaims that it “accelerates ambitious global action on migration and displacement to create a world where urban migrants, displaced people, and receiving communities can thrive.” NRx technocrat accelerationism (see Part 1) is now enmeshed in all levels of global governance. Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors openly declares that its “mission is to accelerate philanthropy in pursuit of a just world by providing deep global expertise.” It is easy to imagine that the ubiquitous use of the term “accelerate,” or variations thereof, is just a reflection of in vogue terminology, but it is omnipresent and we would be naive to overlook its ideological significance. The UN outlines its purpose in its associated Global Compact: Our Ambition is to: Accelerate and scale the global collective impact of business by [. . .] delivering the SDGs through accountable companies and ecosystems that enable change. To this end, the UN adds: The United Nations Global Compact is leading Accelerators to embed SDG-aligned practices deep into business operations and across the value chain to accelerate progress and impact for the 2030 Agenda. Available to participating companies of the UN Global Compact, the Accelerators are run in close collaboration with Global Compact Country Networks and are designed with a view to generating behavior change across a large number of companies at the local level – achieving maximum impact and scale. The UN’s Global Compact is a supposedly “non-binding” policy agenda, first adopted by the United Nations in 2000. The Compact is not focused on intergovernmental cooperation and has virtually nothing to do with nation-states. The UN describes it as “the world’s largest corporate sustainability project.” Agenda 21 is also a non-binding “plan of action” that, in 1992, laid the foundations for the global sustainable development. The Agenda 21 global policy agenda has shaped the lives of nearly everyone on earth in subsequent years. The UN coordinates policy globally and calling its policy agendas “non-binding” is meaningless if the public sector and the private sector rigidly adhere to them. The UN is determined to create “global governance in which the city predominates.” Consequently, the MMC has been empowered by the UN to “influence policy decisions at the national and international level.” As NRx technocrat accelerationism pervades pretty much everything the UN does, the MMC says that it “accelerates global action on migration and displacement.” The MMC has established task forces with other city-state networks, C40 for example, to manage the migration caused by the climate crisis, irrespective of the fact that the UN concedes there are no climate refugees. In addition, as far as the MMC is concerned, international relations based on Westphalian sovereignty is a “broken system” and it has therefore created the financial pathway for investors to directly fund city-state plans for refugees. The MMC’s Global Cities Fund for Migrants and Refugees is set to transform the broken system by directly funding city-states. The Cities Fund offers international donors an investment “pipeline” to circumvent national governments and directly channel “international resources to city governments.” This is to enable “city governments and their local partners to implement projects of their own design.” The focus of the investment is to support “city governments” to manage “their migrant and displaced communities.” The investment pipeline will create a “a marketplace of city-led solutions” and the reason for all of this is to ensure the UN’s “Global Compacts for Migration” is implemented. The UN claims that its Global Compact on Migration (GCM) is grounded in the “values of state sovereignty.” As we have just discussed, there is scant evidence of that. Instead, the Global Compact seeks to apply a “common approach to international migration in all its dimensions.” Those dimensions are encapsulated in the twenty-three GCM Objectives. The first Objective is to harvest as much data as possible from refugees and economic migrants. The third is to develop systems for the sharing of that data with stakeholders. This accompanies Objective 4, which seeks to force “all migrants [to] have proof of legal identity,” by which the UN means digital ID. At the city or “municipal” level, the UN wants to use migrants to implement digital ID as a means of exclusion: Build upon existing practices at the local level that facilitate participation in community life, such as interaction with authorities and access to relevant services, through the issuance of registration cards to all persons living in a municipality, including migrants, that contain basic personal information. That is to say, everyone’s “participation in community life” and everyone’s access to services will be contingent on you having a UN-approved, compatible digital ID. As we have repeatedlydiscussed, the UN’s own research clearly shows that there is no climate crisis-related immigration. Objective 2 is focused upon “minimising the drivers” of migration flows but identifies virtually none but the alleged migration impacts of the so-called climate crisis. Of the twelve clauses to Objective 2, just one briefly mentions “conflict” but only to the extent of “taking into consideration relevant recommendations from State-led consultative processes, such as the Guidelines to Protect Migrants in Countries Experiencing Conflict.” Despite knowing full well that people have to flee from war, persecution, and poverty, not climate change, the UN’s GCM, supposedly designed to assist the dispossessed and the most vulnerable refugees, has practically nothing to say about tackling any of the actual underlying causes of their plight. Even objective 7, to “reduce vulnerabilities in migration,” says nothing about persecution, impoverishment, or conflict. Instead it insists upon providing refugees with “identification,” presumably because humanitarian assistance simply cannot be provided otherwise. Refugee children should be added to national identity systems and “stakeholders” should be fully engaged in the child’s identification process. The unmistakable purpose of the UN’s GCM “Objectives” is to exploit immigration to cement the UN’s global governance agenda. This is starkly highlighted by “Objective 19: Create conditions for migrants and diasporas to fully contribute to sustainable development in all countries.” The UN wants to “harness the benefits of migration as a source of sustainable development.” The main goal is to: Ensure the full and effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development [. . .] by fostering and facilitating the positive effects of migration for the realization of all Sustainable Development Goals The UN’s marked lack of any genuine concern for the predicament of refugees is bad enough but, when we then consider who it chooses as its “partners” to assist with its planned migration, the reality that dawns is stomach churning. Titus Gebel is the former Chairman of the Board of the Patri Friedman’s Seasteading Institute—a joint project between Peter Thiel and Friedman—and a partner at NeWay Capital. He is the founder of Tipolis Inc and a leading investor in and legal advisor to Próspera, having previously acted as a legal advisor for the Honduran government’s original ZEDE program (see Part 1). In 2018, Gebel published Free Private Cities: Making Governments Compete For You. His book outlines how private corporations—i.e. Yarvin’s sovcorps—can provide “government as a service.” He suggested that customers should sign a contract in return for the governance they receive from their sovcorp. Governance providers, in various city-states, would compete for customers (citizens) who would be free to leave, subject to contract, if they didn’t like the private government service on offer in their zone (gov-corp Technate). It seems Gebel essentially plagiarised the NRx technocrat’s ideas, first put forward by Curtis Yarvin and Nick Land about a decade before Gebel took credit for his supposedly “completely new” gov-corp Technate model. Clearly an NRx technocrat, Gebel established Tripolis Inc—in the tax haven of Singapore—in order to create new models of innovative governance. Via Tripolis Inc, Gebel, and his coterie of angel investor partners, hope to become the “owner[s] and operator[s]” of their own International Cities: International Cities are privately run communities, based on clear contracts, which provide, enable and facilitate opportunity and choice. International Cities will be established at multiple locations around the world. [. . .] International Cities build on the concept of Special Administrative Regions (SARs) and are the next evolution of Special Economic Zones (SEZs). [. . .] International Cities will be thriving hubs of business and innovation. Special Administrative Regions (SARs) were formulated by the Chinese government under Deng Xiaoping as part of its “one country, two systems” policy. Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan were legally designated SARs by the Chinese government in the early 1980s. The intention was to provide regulatory autonomy to hopefully reunified territories, though Taiwan has yet to commit to reunification. That Gebel considers the larger SARs as “the next evolution” of SEZs speaks to the territorial ambitions of those pursuing the city-state agenda. Gebel is also an advisor to the Swiss-based Andan Foundation led by its founder Dr Christian H. Kälin (or Kaelin). The Andan Foundations explains its purpose: Andan leads private sector initiatives to support families fleeing their homes due to war, internal conflict, and climate change. It identifies and develops innovative, sustainable solutions. [. . .] Andan prioritizes projects that expand economic, financial, and political opportunities for both refugee populations and the communities that welcome them. Andan facilitates and propels partnerships between the private sector and UN agencies, governments, NGOs, and academic institutions concerned with refugees and migrants. Andan proposes a business that capitalises on the “opportunities” presented by refugees, asylum seekers and economic migrants. The Foundation adds that its “main, long-term project is the Andan Free Global City project—or “International City” as Gebel would call it—which it says has the potential to “completely upend and reform how we deal with the growing global refugee and migration crisis”: Today, the world is spending billions of dollars each year in dead-end, protracted refugee management with camps and urban settings. [. . .] We aim at no less than completely turn around the way we look at refugees and migrants. [. . .] What we need is again a safe harbour, a new place where refugees and other migrants forced to leave their homes receive the opportunity to live. [. . .] We need free Global Cities – autonomous, self-governed subnational entities that provide a safe environment. [. . .] We are also actively engaged with several governments around the world, as well as with a few major investors who are prepared to finance the establishment of the first free Global City, which will also provide a decent return on capital from private investors. Kälin, an advisor to the Swiss government among others, suggests reading a 2022 article by Albert Steck to really get a feel for what he, Gebel and other international NRx technocrats are proposing: [Kälin] sees his Andan Global City not only as a humanitarian project, but also as a profitable business idea. [. . .] In Kälin’s city [refugees] would be motivated workers and founders of businesses. [. . .] [Kälin is] in talks with representatives of the U.N. and the World Economic Forum. [. . .] The biggest challenge is finding a country that will provide an uninhabited or sparsely populated territory for an autonomous city, he says. [. . .] Initially, several tens of thousands of people could live there – with the prospect that it might ultimately become a city of millions. Private financing is therefore crucial to the success of such a large project, says entrepreneur Titus Gebel. [. . .] Gebel, who was born in Germany, is also the founder of the Free Cities Foundation, which works to establish special economic zones in various countries, following the example of Shenzhen in China or the European free cities in the Middle Ages. Like all NRx technocrat fronts, the Andan Foundation staunchly advocates digital ID and suggests that blockchain “has the potential to create new solutions for refugee and identification systems” and that digital ID, stored on a unified ledger, should be “directly accessible to refugees and immigrants.” Once the refugee’s digital twin is operational, the refugees can serve as “motivated workers” in the Free Global City—gov-corp Technate. Presumably, should they be insufficiently motivated, their access to money and food “could be frozen” and they could be “locked out of all doors” to essential services until they rediscover the correct motivation. Christian Kälin is also the Chairman of Henley & Partners, a UK based consultancy that specialises in a lucrative venture which Kälin claims to have “pioneered.” Henley & Partners touts itself as “the world’s foremost experts in investment migration and citizenship-by-investment.” Serving a clientele of “internationally mobile entrepreneurs and investors,” Henley & Partners (H&P) says that it helps “high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth individuals” to obtain “bespoke residence and citizenship by investment.” Essentially, Kälin and H&P advises “ultra-high-net-worth individuals”—including oligarchs—where to invest in order to buy residency visas and citizenship and then manages the application process for them. The history of “citizenship-by-investment” (CBI) schemes is not very edifying. For example, Paolo Zampolli, President Trump’s global envoy for special partnerships, was evidently involved in a seemingly corrupt CBI scheme that sold Dominican Republic residency to Chinese billionaires, such as Ng Lap Seng, who were under investigation by the UN for bribing UN officials. John Ashe, the former president of the UN General Assembly, was also suspected of involvement but died in an extremely bizarre bar-bell “accident” shortly before he was due to testify in the case. Kälin has been dubbed the “Passport King” for his pioneering efforts in the CBI field. However, according to US-based Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), H&P has been involved in numerous corrupt CBI schemes. For instance, in the Caribbean nation of the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis between 2006 and 2013. The St. Kitts and Nevis Sugar Industry Diversification Foundation (SIDF) was “set up in 2006 to move the island economy away from dependence on sugar.” The SIDF turned agricultural land into development land. The purchase of territory was funded by the government and H&P’s “high-net-worth” clients seeking residency in St. Kitts and Nevis, many of whom had criminal ties or were wanted in various jurisdictions. Money from the SIDF fund was then directed to invest in companies that Kälin was closely associated with. H&P insisted there was no conflict of interest. The SIDF became inoperative around 2017 and, with important agricultural land lost and no sign of any return on the government’s SIDF investment, the OCCRP noted that the “ultimate losers were the people of St. Kitts and Nevis.” Kälin was seemingly the financier behind the Strategic Communications Laboratories Group’s (SCL’s) 2010 re-election campaign for then St. Kitts and Nevis Prime Minister Denzil Douglas. In 2018, an interim UK parliamentary investigatory report issued by the powerful Digital, Media, Culture and Sports Committee (DMCSC) noted: 211. We were told, behind much of SCL Elections’ campaigning work was the hidden hand of Christian Kalin, Chairman of Henley and Partners, who arranged for investors to supply the funding to pay for campaigns, and then organised SCL to write their manifesto and oversee the whole campaign process. In exchange [. . .] Henley and Partners would gain exclusive passport rights for that country, under a citizenship-by-investment (CBI) programme.[. . .] Christian Kalin [has] been described as having a ‘Faustian pact’. With the exclusive passport rights came a government that would be conducive to Mr. Kalin and his clients. The British defence contractor SCL is the parent company of the notorious Cambridge Analytica (CA)that was widely accused of manipulating the 2016 US presidential elections and the UK “BREXIT” referendum on leaving the European Union (EU). The CA operation also illegitimately acquired the data of millions of Facebook users. Hence, the UK parliamentary investigation. CA, and thus SCL, is evidently connected to Peter Thiel’s Palantir. As CA’s suspected election manipulation, and what was tantamount to data theft, came under international scrutiny, Palantir disavowed that connection. But, when the New York Times revealed that one of its employees—Palantir business manager Alfredas Chmieliauskas—had worked with CA to form “behavioural profiles” of voting social media users, Palantir changed its statement and said Mr Chmieliauskas was not acting on Palantir’s behalf at the time, though he was a Palantir employee throughout the period. H&P’s CBI schemes were not limited to the Caribbean. They have reportedly been found to be wholly corrupt in Cyprus, for instance. When, in 2017, Maltese investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia started to expose H&B’s involvement in Malta’s corrupt Individual Investor Programme (IIP)—Malta’s CBI scheme—subsequent inquiry hearings revealed emails indicating that H&P instigated a Strategic Lawsuits against Public Participation (SLAPP) against her. It seems H&P intended to file the lawsuit in the UK because they wanted a “sympathetic judge.” Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was also instrumental in reporting the Panama Papers, was assassinated in a car bombing in Malta in October 2017. More recently, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled the Maltese CBI scheme illegal. As an EU member state, a Maltese passport provided some questionable “ultra-high-income individuals” with EU citizenship. It is not without justification that the ECJ characterised CBI schemes, including those run by H&B, as making “the acquisition of nationality a mere commercial transaction.” Kälin, who conceded that some H&B clients were “problem[s]” who fell through H&B’s claimed “due diligence” checks, was undeterred by the ECJ ruling. He was enthused by the global expansion of CBI schemes and, in particular, the Trump administration’s plan to issue permanent residency visas to anyone who can afford the $5 million price tag. If he wants to move to the US, Kälin could certainly afford a US “gold card.” Fours years earlier, In 2021, numerous hedge funds faced potential ruin as a result of the GameStop short squeeze. When Reddit users noticed the mass shorting of stock in the the GameStop chain of high-street stores, they apparently spiked demand for the stock and pushed the price up by coordinating large-scale stock purchases. Thus leaving those with short positions—betting the stock price would fall—exposed to enormous losses. Through his company Arnova Capital, Christian Kälin consequently made a fortune on the GameStop stock his company held. He also accurately predicted, before any WHO announcement of a worldwide pandemic, that energy prices would soar during the pseudopandemic. Kälin’s 2000% ROI on his initial investment in Arnova Capital is truly remarkable. The Andan Foundation, founded by Kälin and advised by Gebel, that seeks to profit from refugee migration by establishing Free Global Cities, is a “long-standing” partner of the United Nations. The goal of the partnership is to “propel and facilitate the private sector’s involvement,” in managing international refugee migration with a view to create “public and private initiatives that create long-term solutions for refugees.” The appalling stench of neocolonialism exudes from every part of the UN’s global migration policy agenda. The oligarch-led UN public-private partnership is implementing a strategy that aims to exploit migrants and refugees to achieve UN objectives. There is no serious attempt to do anything to address the problems that cause mass migration. The migrant is simply a “human resource” to be identified, stamped and relocated into communities the world over in order to achieve UN policy targets. The UN wants to construct a global network smart-city gov-corp Technates because that too will better facilitate the rollout of its global governance; it has formed partnerships with NRx technocrats who want to use the displaced as a workforce and who view refugee “residency” in their gov-corp Technates as a “profitable business idea;” the UN is supporting and encouraging the national governments to hand over territory to oligarch investors in preparation for its New Urban Agenda, and the UN wants all lives, including those of refugees and economic migrants, to be controlled by digital technology linked to the digital ID of their digital twin. The networks, technological systems, and investment “pipelines” are in place to enable gov-corp Technate ultra-high-net-worth “founders” to buy citizenship, should they wish, and set up gov-corp Technates either by investing in SEZs or smart-city developments already underway. In 2024, the UNHCR estimated that there were 123.2 million displaced people seeking refuge. Clearly, NRx technocrats like Titus Gebel and Christian Kälin hope to provide said refuge for a profitable return. In 2023, on the US election campaign trail, calling it a “quantum leap,” Donald Trump proposed initially constructing ten “Freedom Cities” in the US. As reported by Bloomberg: The end game is audacious: High-tech company towns free from state law and most federal rules—including the Internal Revenue Code, major environmental laws like the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act; worker protections like the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Occupational Health and Safety Act; and the Affordable Care Act. There are currently around 300 SEZs in the US and the potential for expansion of the Freedom City concept in the US is already marked. The Freedom City idea, though it provides the same SEZ regulatory advantages to multinational corporations, stands apart somewhat from other SEZ initiatives. The Freedom Cities will be constructed on parcels of US territory sold-off directly to private investors. Initially, the Trump administration tried to sell-off US territory to oligarchs through public land sale provisions included in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill. Due to public and political opposition, the public land sale clauses were removed prior to the Bill passing. The NRx technocrats behind the Trump administration are, however, determined. They are now trying to use Trump’s proposed Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) for the same purpose. Inherent in the US SWF plan is the intention to liquidate—sell-off—US public land (territory) to raise capital. It remains to be seen if this line of attack will work where the Big Beautiful Bill assault failed. There is a powerful international network, led by US NRx technocrats, exploring every avenue to get the gov-corp Technates—Freedom Cities—built in the US. Peter Thiel protégé, and an NRx technocrat in his own right, Sam Altman, stood close to Oracle’s Larry Ellison, SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son and President Trump when Trump announced his administration’s Stargate Project. According to Altman’s OpenAI: The Stargate Project is a new company which intends to invest $500 billion over the next four years building new AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the United States. [. . .] The initial equity funders in Stargate are SoftBank, OpenAI, Oracle, and MGX. SoftBank and OpenAI are the lead partners for Stargate, with SoftBank having financial responsibility and OpenAI having operational responsibility. Masayoshi Son will be the chairman. Arm, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Oracle, and OpenAI are the key initial technology partners. [. . .] All of us look forward to continuing to build and develop AI—and in particular AGI [artificial generative intelligence]—for the benefit of all of humanity. We believe that this new step is critical on the path, and will enable creative people to figure out how to use AI to elevate humanity. “All of us” refers to the global NRx technocrat community of which Sam Altman, Larry Ellison, and Masayoshi Son (Masayoshi Yasumoto) are members. The intention to use AI to “elevate humanity” means to meld us with technology and turn is into programmable “technoplastic beings.” Masayoshi Son is the head of the technology investment holding company SoftBank Group (SBG) which has capitalised handsomely on its investments in Chinese technology firms such as Alibaba. This is largely due to its control of the Chinese social media firm TikTok, ByteDance, the largest social media company in the world by revenue, is currently valued at around $330 billion. This makes SoftBank’s 4% stake in ByteDance worth roughly $13.2 billion. It remains to be seen if Larry Ellison’s $14 billion deal to buy out ByteDance’ stake in TikTok’s US operation will help Masayoshi Son’s to increase his ByteDance holdings. Certainly, it should provide him with a healthy dividend. Trump has spoken about “four or five world-class investors” profiting from the deal, but both he and Ellison have been coy about officially naming them. Project Stargate was launched to much fanfare, in keeping with the rhetoric in the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, as the US was supposedly set on a course to outcompete China’s DeepSeek AI development program, which is key to the Hangzhou City-Brain project. Closer scrutiny of Stargate, however, brings the whole notion of competition into question. Prior to the Stargate launch, in September 2024, Blackrock, its owned subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), Microsoft, and MGX announced their Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership (GAIIP) to to fuel AI innovation. This was a worldwide venture but there was a focus on supporting AI innovation in the US. The GAIIP implementing partners included NVIDIA. As a founding member of GAIIP, UAE-based AI investor MGX is also a “lead partner” in Stargate. MGX is owned by the sovereign wealth fund (Mubadala) of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi ruled by former UAE president Sheik Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Shortly after the January 2025 launch of Stargate, in February, Sam Altman visited Abu Dhabi to discuss finance for Stargate with MGX. This resulted in an initial, accelerated $6.6 billion Stargate start-up investment round. BlackRock, and notably its GIP, receive billions of dollars of private equity investment from China’s state-run investment arms such as the State Administration of Foreign Assets and the China Investment Corporation (CIC). As Trump ramped up his allegedly tough competitive stance against China, by April 2025 the Chinese financiers were pulling back on their enormous US private equity commitments. Doubtless, this was much to the chagrin of Blackrock, MGX and other GAIIP partners. DeepSeek AI developers in China were reliant on the US-based multinational NVIDIA’s H20 processors which are manufactured under license in Taiwan. NVIDIA is a “key technology partner” of Stargate. Having initially “banned” H20 sales to China, reportedly following some meetings with Jensen Huang—co-founder and CEO of GAIIP partner NVIDIA—the Trump administration started lifting the H20 export ban, more or less as soon as it had been imposed, in April 2025. This later became the official position as, it seems, the initial ban was a mistake. In May 2025, Trump was dispatched to Abu Dhabi where he signed a deal to supply US AI-chips, including NVIDIA processors, to the Abu Dhabi AI digital transformation hub. An associated agreement was made for US tech firms to collaborate on AI development in the Emirate and the wider UAE. Trump called the deal the “U.S.-U.A.E. A.I. Acceleration Partnership.” In what was clearly a deal sweetener, just a couple of weeks prior to the Trump-UAE deal, Steve Witkoff, Trump’s Middle East envoy, met Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Sardinia. Sheik Tahnoon is the Abu Dhabi Emir’s brother, UAE National Security Advisor, and CEO of MGX (Mubadala). Sheik Tahnoon agreed to invest $2 billion in World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency venture owned by the Witkoff and Trump families. Though this looks like blatant corruption, the official fact-checkers have declared everything unimpeachable and have defined the truth for us. Any suggestions that this chain of events clearly evidences high level political corruption have all been officially labelled as “baseless rumours.” Fact-checking heavyweight Snopes reliably informed us: While the two deals happened within two weeks and there was an overlap of people who were involved in them, there was no evidence the first, between MGX and World Liberty Financial, was a direct bribe for the second deal, which involved the chips. So, thankfully, the approved fact-checkers have answered all of our questions for us and that’s an end to the matter. In the media-spun war of words, and that is evidently all it is, China has now reportedly banned the import of the NVIDIA RTX Pro 6000D—the successor to the H20. But China doesn’t need to import processors from the US because the UAE-China AI partnership, specifically the Abu Dhabi digital transformation hub, has a Trump administration agreement in place for the supply of the processors and it serves as a “crucial base for Chinese AI firms.” The purported Stargate “competition” with DeepSeek AI looks more like a “partnership.” So what else might be going on here? When Forbes reported the launch of Stargate on January 2025, its journalists said the “details of the venture are unclear at this early stage.” Why they made this claim is perplexing. The details were not unclear. In November 2024, Sam Altman’s OpenAI, the driving force behind Stargate, announced its “blueprint for U.S. AI infrastructure.” AI in America: OpenAI’s Economic Blueprint, is Stargate mapped out. This was published before the official White House Stargate announcement and there was no need for any journalist to be “unclear” about any aspect of it. The “Blueprint” talks about the need to merge “private-sector vision and innovation with public-sector enlightenment to unlock the new technology;” a plan for “building the infrastructure needed to produce enough energy;” investment to develop “the next generation of energy technology, including sustainable sources such as fission, fusion, and other promising technologies;” and it notes the need for “common-sense rules” to help “innovators thrive by encouraging investment [. . .] and greater freedom.” The NRx technocrat “Blueprint” also defines the alleged need for Freedom Cities: We need a foundational strategy to ensure that investment in infrastructure benefits the most people possible and maximizes access to AI. This includes policies and initiatives that encourage rather than stifle developers; support a thriving AI-ready workforce and ecosystems of labs, start-ups and larger companies; and secure America’s leadership on AI into the future, such as: AI Economic Zones, created by local, state and the federal government together with industry, that significantly speed up the permitting processes for building AI infrastructure like new solar arrays, wind farms and nuclear reactors. These will be what Bloomberg calls “towns free from state law and most federal rules.” Just as the plan for Freedom Cities in the US preceded Stargate, the UK’s deal with Blackrock to develop “freeports” in the UK (see Part 1) had preceded the rollout of the NRx technocrats’ UK Stargate project. It is the same NRx technocrat network imposing the same SEZ-based independent jurisdiction model wherever you look. Mark Lutter, for example, serves on the board of the Frontier Foundation that was set up to promote the Freedom City initiative in the US. As we discussed in Part 1, Lutter is also the founder and Executive Director of the Charter Cities Institute which states it is proud to support the development of Freedom Cities in the US.Titus Gebel, who wants to profit from migrants and refugees, works closely with Lutter. As previously noted, Lutter served as the head economist for NeWAY Capital and Gebel is a NeWay Capital Partner. Nick Allen, President of the Frontier Foundation and Lutter’s colleague, is very eager to make use of Trump’s SWF grift and toldWIREDthat federal land close to cities like Boise, Idaho; Grand Junction, Colorado; and Redmond, Oregon would be great places to build gov-corp Technates. Speaking on behalf of the Frontier Foundation, Allen added: If we’re able to get a legislative transfer of land from the US government to make a public-private partnership, or a trust, or even a private corporation, then it’s a lower cost of capital. [. . .] There’s so much capital and there’s so much political will, but yet there’s an inability to develop these [frontier] technologies. And the inability comes from lack of space and too many regulations. NeWay capital established the Freedom Cities Coalition (FCC) which promotes the idea of Freedom Cities as “Cities Without Limits.” This means towns and cities where there are no regulation and oligarchs are free to do what they please. In addition to NeWay Capital, the FCC is also backed by Pronomos Capital led by NRx Technocrats Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen, and Joe Lonsdale. The FCC claims that Freedom Cities or, in Stargate terminology, “AI Economic Zones,” represent “America’s boldest solution to unleash our nation’s full potential.” They will be constructed in “zones of regulatory clarity” which will be “specially designated areas” where “entrepreneurs” can “move at the speed of human ingenuity” without having to bother with any overbearing federal laws or regulations. The FCC adds: Freedom Cities are more than just economic zones. [. . .] Imagine communities where housing is abundant and affordable, [. . .] where breakthrough technologies move from lab to market at lightning speed because innovators are free to innovate. This is how we’ll overcome stagnation, outcompete China, and create a new American century. Freedom Cities give us the chance to prove once again what Americans can achieve when we’re unshackled from outdated systems and empowered to build the future. With regard to where the Freedom Cities will be built, the FCC notes: 28% Of US land is federally owned and ready for innovative development. If the Trump administration’s SWF plans proceed, this will open the door for NRx technocrats and other oligarchs to buy up US territory to build their gov-corp Technates. The political will certainly appears to be there. Trump’s long-time economic advisor Stephen Moore supports the city-state model. Moore is the former chief economist at the Heritage Foundation, which was behind Project 2025’s Promise to America. The Trump administration came to power promising to tackle the pernicious influence of “American elites” and was therefore eager to distance itself from the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 “Promise,” which was funded by the Koch and Bradley families, among other so-called American elites. Regardless, most of Trump’s Executive Orders, issued when he came to power for the second time, were practically written by the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025. The same group of American elites are also behind the State Policy Network (SPN) that proposed the “Compact For America” shortly before Trump’s first US election win in 2016. What Trump termed Freedom Cities in 2023, the Compact for America, whose National Spokesman was Stephen Moore, called Prosperity Districts in 2015. The terminology has changed, but the intention to create gov-corp Technates in the US has not. As we discussed in Part 1, just as the “authority” is formed to oversee the independent jurisdiction of a Special Economic Zone (SEZ), so the Prosperity District (PD) would be the authority that rules within the jurisdictional boundaries permitted by amenable “Prosperity States” within the US. Once approved, the PD would wield policing powers, it would control all “municipal services” through public-private partnerships, and set all regulations within its jurisdiction. Just as with the “authority” ruling an SEZ, the PD would expand by petitioning the willing State to expand itself: The formation or expansion of the PD replaces, within its boundaries, all state laws above the baseline of the state constitution, common law, criminal law and existing compacts. The PDs created within Prosperity States liberate residents, transforming states into strongholds of free markets, federalism and limited government once again. Safe to say, Trump did not come up with the notion of the Freedom City. It is simply the rebranding for the oligarchs’ Prosperity District idea. The gov-corp Technate has been the NRx technocrat’s favoured path to corporate “prosperity” and social control for more than a decade at this point. During its first term, the Trump administration tried to put Stephen Moore on the board of the Federal Reserve to ensure favourable monetary policy suited to the formation of Prosperity Districts. The Democratic wing of the Establishment reacted strongly against Moore’s possible appointment and the bid did not succeed. With their second Trump term underway, the NRx Technocrats—the Silicon Valley-based new breed of American elites—have joined forces with their more traditional oligarch partners for the same ends: to build Freedom Cities, Prosperity Districts, SEZs, gov-corp Technates, call them what you like. The US intelligence community is also onboard. This isn’t surprising given that NRx technocrat’s corporations, such as Peter Thiel’s Palantir and Larry Ellison’s Oracle, have deep ties with US intelligence. America’s Frontier Fund (AFF), is a supposedly a “nonprofit” venture capital operation with a nonprofit foundation, backed by Bilderbergers Eric Schmidt and Peter Thiel. The AFF is essentially an impact investment cut-out of the US intelligence and national security apparatus. It was founded and is currently led by Gilman Louie. He is the “former” CEO of the CIA’s investment arm In-Q-Tel (1999 – 2006) and thereafter acted as a defence, national security and intelligence advisor for the US government. Notably, Louie was at the helm of In-Q-Tel when it “accelerated” the startup called Palantir. The AFF’s aim is to harness the “promise of frontier technology.” This is the same “frontier technology” that the UN’s “New Urban Agenda” is based upon, with a view of constructing smart city-states the world over. It is not a coincidence that it is also precisely the same “frontier technology” that the NRx technocrats behind the AFF want to use to enslave humanity. It is, after all, part of the same, global gov-corp Technate plan. The global agenda, moving us toward digital slavery, is impregnable and is not something any of us can vote are way out of. Our only realistic option is not to comply with the adoption of the “smart” frontier technology people like Gilman Louie, and his intelligence linked network of NRx technocrats want us to adopt. This entire, global, gov-corp Technate project could not be more anti-democratic. The Dark Enlightenment and the Technocracy favoured by the NRx technocrats represent the zenith of totalitarian ideology. Their oligarch partners enthusiasm to adopt the same Patchwork of city-states is equally born from the desire to control everyone and everything. Schmidt, Thiel, and Louie were instrumental in setting up the AFF under the previous Biden administration. It would be a mistake to imagine the global agenda to entrap us in smart city-states is a partisan issue. The squabbles we see, such as Democrat opposition to the appointment of Moore to the Fed, are just that: petty squabbles among the ranks. In 2024, the Future Union, which seeks to “fuse private sector capitalism” with political authority, declared Gilman Louie the “top investor supporting democracy.” Louie narrowly pipped other egalitarian, democracy-loving NRx technocrat investors, like Peter Thiel, Eric Shmidt, and Marc Andreessen, to the top prize. Were the intention of their accelerationist investment strategies not so malevolent we could perhaps laugh at the irony.

Title: Intel Stock Faces a Crucial Earnings Test Today. Here’s What You Need To Know

Intel could face heightened expectations from investors when it reports third-quarter earnings after the bell, following a torrid rally in recent months on a flurry of high-profile deals. Though the stock was little changed in early trading Thursday, it's up over 80% for 2025, with most of the gains coming since August when the federal government took a 10% stake in the struggling chipmaker. A partnership with rival Nvidia (NVDA) followed last month, adding to optimism around the stock and fueling speculation more deals could be on the way. However, the stock's rapid rise has also stoked some worries it may have climbed too far, too fast, with pressure now on Intel (INTC) to defend its support with evidence it's making progress toward a turnaround. That could set the stage for heightened volatility in the stock, with recent options pricing suggesting traders expect it could swing up to 10% in either direction after the results. There are some concerns on Wall Street that the recent enthusiasm for Intel's stock could be premature. Investors will likely be looking for signs in Thursday's report that the chipmaker is making good on its newfound support. Wall Street analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha expect the chipmaker to swing to a slight profit of 2 cents per share, from a loss in the preceding and year-ago quarters. Its revenue is projected to come in at $13.17 billion, which would represent a less than 1% decline from a year earlier. However, most analysts aren't convinced Intel's stock is a "buy" yet, with those surveyed by Visible Alpha largely maintaining neutral ratings while waiting to see more customer commitments to Intel's manufacturing business. Reports last week suggested Intel may have secured a major new AI customer; Microsoft (MSFT) was floated as a likely name. Announcing a new client along with the earnings could help win over analysts.

A MAN HAS been found guilty of the murder of 47 year old man whose skeletal remains were found in a jute bag at a ravine in rural east Cork. The jury of ten men and two women spent just under five hours deliberating at the Central Criminal Court sitting in Cork before finding Niall Long (33) guilty of the murder of Kieran Quilligan, who remains were discovered in Whitewell, Rostellan, Co Cork on January 29th 2024. They will resume their deliberations in relation to his co accused Luke Taylor (27) tomorrow morning. The two accused went on trial earlier this month charged with the murder of Mr Quilligan who was last seen alive on 1 September, 2023. He had been missing for five months when his remains were detected by gardai who had brought a cadaver dog to scrubland in East Cork. In his closing speech to the jury Prosecution senior counsel, Donal O’Sullivan said that Kieran Quilligan was “lured” to his death. He stated that Taylor brought him to a laneway at St Finbarr’s Place in Cork city on 1 September 2023 where he and Long “ambushed” him. O’Sullivan said that the men then threw Kieran Quilligan in to the boot of a car. He said that the “instigating factor” in relation to what occurred involved Kieran Quilligan stealing drugs from Niall Long earlier that day. “Following a robbery by Kieran Quilligan on Niall Long Luke Taylor lures Kieran Quilligan to a lane. He is ambushed by the two of them. He is put in the boot of the car. `They go straight to Little Island (in Co Cork) to a laneway. Down the laneway to a farm. They go down to a nice quiet spot. They are heading home twenty minutes later. What is going on? When the skeletal remains are found there are 19 broken bones, some showing use of an implement like a hammer. Luke Taylor lured Kieran Quilligan to his death. They ambushed him. He was disposed of down that lane.” O’Sullivan said that the body was removed from Little Island three days later and dumped in East Cork. He added that but for the incredible investigative work by gardai the remains would never have been found. Advertisement The jury also heard evidence from Assistant State Pathologist, Dr Margaret Bolster, who carried out a postmortem on the remains of Quilligan at Cork University Hospital. Bolster indicated that an exact cause of death could not be established because decomposition had led to the loss of organs. However, she stated that what was not at doubt was that the injuries suffered by Quilligan were consistent with a “severe assault in a laneway.” Those injuries included fractures to his ribs, chest, leg and hand bones, jaw bones, neck and skull. Bolster said whilst the remains were skeletonised there was a small piece of skin remaining which consisted of a tattoo with the word “mother” and a date. An inscription was illegible. The skull was separate from the body and there was a large amount of silt and vegetation. Bolster also described her examination of the body at the scene. She described going down a ravine off a roadway where there was a jute bag. Underneath this was another jute bag with a “pelvic bone protruding.” The pathologist said she could see ribs and a skull with a “bag around it tied with a knot.” Bolster indicated that the cable tie around the left ankle and right shin and two knotted pieces of plastic around the neck were likely to have been used for the purposes of moving the body. The jury also heard evidence from Sgt Maurice O’Connor who was responsible for analysing mobile phones seized during the course of the investigation. O’Connor gave evidence to the effect that Niall Long had sent a text message to his mother Janice Long on 2 September, 2023. She has texted him saying that her jeep smelled of Dettol. The garda sergeant said that Long texted his mother. In his reply he stated that the boot of the car was cleaned because “the fella that robbed me got a hiding and was thrown in the boot after.” The jury heard evidence from forty seven witnesses. Prosecution counsel Donal O’Sullivan noted that the jury had watched a “staggering amount” of CCTV footage. Over the course of three days of the trial they watched 433 video clips. The charge facing both accused was the murder was carried out on a date unknown between 1 September, 2023 and 29 January, 2024, at an unknown location within the state of the District Court area of Cork city. Niall Long is formerly of St Michael’s Close in Mahon in Cork whilst Luke Taylor is previously of Cherry Lawn in Blackrock in Cork city.

Title: Vanguard Gets the VOO Proxy Vote Out
URL: https://www.thedailyupside.com/etf/industry-news-etf/vanguard-gets-the-voo-proxy-vote-out/
Time Published: 2025-10-23T14:53:45Z
Full Content:
Soon, ETF shareholders may opt for proxy policies that could support (or oppose) issues like the $1 trillion Tesla pay package for Elon Musk. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com Investors in the world’s biggest ETF will soon be able to say how they want their shares voted in proxies, such as one for the world’s largest pay package for the world’s richest person. Starting next year, Vanguard is extending its 500 Index Fund, including the VOO ETF, to its Investor Choice program, which gives fund investors a handful of proxy voting options. Those include a policy to follow corporate board recommendations, a third-party advisor’s policy aimed at maximizing wealth, one to mirror other shareholders’ votes, one directed by Vanguard and another following ESG recommendations. That latter is offered by Glass Lewis, which along with fellow proxy advisor ISS, recommended opposing a proposed 10-year total compensation package for Tesla CEO Elon Musk that could be worth nearly $1 trillion and increase his proportional ownership in the company. That’s almost as much as Vanguard’s 500 Index Fund, which sits at about $1.4 trillion. Vanguard, along with other massive firms like BlackRock and State Street, rolled out policy voting guidelines a few years ago. “This is also a way for Vanguard to address the issue of its size. Regulators (and critics) have raised concerns about Vanguard’s significant stake in corporate America and questioned how it uses that influence and voting power,” said Jeff DeMaso, editor of The Independent Vanguard Adviser. “This program lets Vanguard deflect those criticisms: Vanguard can say it’s not ‘controlling’ how all of its shares are voted, it’s letting individual investors direct its votes.” Regardless, it can be seen as a win for the company and for fund shareholders, DeMaso said. A look at Vanguard’s Investor Choice program, which is in its fourth year: One Voice, Many Votes: It would be overwhelming, if not nearly impossible, for individual fund investors to direct how their shares are voted for every issue at every company, hence the need for broad policies. “Central to Vanguard Investor Choice is the core belief that investors should have the option to express a preference for how their index fund holdings vote,” Global Head of Investment Stewardship John Galloway said in a statement, adding that the goal is adding it to all the company’s US equity index funds. Either one of these popular tax-advantaged strategies can help clients diversify and defer tax bills, but they can be complex as well as costly. Some of the largest S&P 500-based funds lost billions this year as institutional investors sought out cheaper alternatives. The rare earths industry is booming as the materials are used less in electric vehicles and more in AI data centers. Asset managers have repurposed sustainable funds amid a pullback from them in the US. This change is more substantial than most. Tokenized securities are moving closer to a reality as issuers make plans to bring more assets and funds on-chain. Even with the lights out at the SEC, it’s unlikely that ETF issuers seeking 3x and 5x funds will sail through the approval process. The new VanEck TruSector ETFs invest in stocks and other ETFs to maximize exposure to individual companies and reflect actual market caps. No one knows the future, but high inflation could make some investments virtually worthless. As regulators have warmed up to crypto and assets have poured into ETFs, advisors who ignore the trend risk losing clients, proponents said. Analysts from JPMorgan on Monday wrote that levered ETFs might worsen macro swings by increasing intraday volatility. The firm has waited until now to expand its US product line as sales trends are favoring ETFs over many mutual funds. As the iShares Bitcoin Trust nears the milestone, dozens of spot-price crypto ETFs are being prepped to come to market. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Trump to Set Price Floors to Prevent Prices from Falling Too Low

Bessent mentioned seven price floor areas in a CNBC interview but did not name them. Price Floors Across a Range of Industries The discussion of price floors is in relation to the US trade war with China, especially rare earth metals. However, it’s not just rare earths. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said “We’re going to set price floors and the forward buying to make sure that this doesn’t happen again. And we’re going to do it across a range of industries.” CNBC reports Trump administration will set price floors across range of industries to combat China, Bessent says “When you are facing a nonmarket economy like China, then you have to exercise industrial policy,” Bessent told Sara Eisen at CNBC’s Invest in America Forum in Washington, D.C. “So we’re going to set price floors and the forward buying to make sure that this doesn’t happen again and we’re going to do it across a range of industries,” the Treasury secretary said, without naming specific industries the administration was looking at beyond rare earths. China last week announced sweeping new restrictions on rare earth exports ahead of an expected meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump in South Korea later this month. Trump has threatened to slap China with additional 100% tariffs in response. The U.S. could take equity stakes in other companies in the wake of Beijing’s rare earth restrictions, Bessent told CNBC. The Trump administration will not take stakes in nonstrategic industries, Bessent said. “We do have to be very careful not to overreach,” he said. What’s Strategic? Please recall Trump labeled movies a national security threat. With Trump, even the absurd is strategic. “We have things that are more powerful than the rare earth export controls that the Chinese want to put on,” said Bessent. Uh… like what? And if so, why back down? U.S. to Take Control of More Companies to Counter China The New York Times reports U.S. to Take Control of More Companies to Counter China The Trump administration is seeking to counter new economic measures from China by exerting more control over American companies in key strategic sectors, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Wednesday. The approach marks a new era of industrial policy in the United States, a contrast to how policymakers have traditionally valued free markets and open investment. But as China’s dominance over the production of rare-earth minerals and battery technology grows, President Trump wants to take a page out of Beijing’s economic strategy. By taking more stakes in American companies that specialize in areas deemed critical to national security, the Trump administration aims to exert more control over what they produce. The goal is for the U.S. to become less reliant on China for sensitive technology that it has been using as leverage in trade negotiations. On Friday, Mr. Trump responded by threatening to put an additional 100 percent tariff on products from China on Nov. 1 and cancel an upcoming meeting with China’s leader, Xi Jinping. After the announcements caused the stock market to plummet, Mr. Trump quickly qualified his statements. He said he might meet Mr. Xi anyway and wrote on social media on Sunday, “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine!” The Treasury secretary pointed to China’s announcement last week of new export controls on rare-earth minerals as a reason the United States must exert more state control over corporations. “When we get an announcement like this week with China on the rare earths, you realize we have to be self-sufficient, or we have to be sufficient with our allies,” Mr. Bessent said. Mr. Bessent said that the Trump administration had identified seven industries that it considered of strategic importance where the United States could seek to exert more government control. He pointed specifically to the defense sector, where in some cases the U.S. government is the largest or only customer of certain companies, and said that the administration could insist that companies spend more money on research and less on stock buybacks. “I do think our defense companies are woefully behind in terms of deliveries,” Mr. Bessent said. The United States would use “price floors” and “forward buying” across a “range of industries,” he added, to ensure that China does not dominate other sectors the way it has with the processing and refining of rare earths. The push for greater government control over the private sector is a policy that he has criticized in the past. Last year, Mr. Bessent delivered a speech at the Manhattan Institute deriding the Biden administration’s subsidies of strategic sectors such as semiconductors as “central planning.” At a news conference at the Treasury Department on Wednesday, Mr. Bessent scolded China for deploying similar tactics. “They are a state economy,” Mr. Bessent said. “We are not going to let a group of bureaucrats in Beijing try to manage the global supply chains.” The countries have also clashed over a U.S. move to impose fees on Chinese-owned ships docking in American ports, a policy U.S. officials say is geared at revitalizing American shipbuilding. Non-Chinese shipping lines must also pay the fees when they send Chinese-built ships to American ports. Those went into effect on Tuesday. Agreement With Bessent “When we get an announcement like this week with China on the rare earths, you realize we have to be self-sufficient, or we have to be sufficient with our allies,” Mr. Bessent said. Q: I totally agree. But what is Trump’s approach?A: Terrorize allies with tariffs and threats, especially Canada and Mexico. I propose the US expand trade with allies. Specifically, the US should work out a deal for Canada to produce rare earths and Mexico to process them. Canada has vast areas of land to mine and Mexico has cheap labor. Instead, Trump has punished allies as much as China. “Our relationship will never again be what it was,” said Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. Irony of the Day “They are a state economy,” Bessent said. Note the the direction Trump is taking the US. Here is a list of US government involvement. Trump’s Takeover of US Businesses “We do have to be very careful not to overreach,” said Bessent. OK, what constitutes “overreach”? Movies Are Now a National Security Threat On May 4, 2025 I commented Movies Are Now a National Security Threat, 100 Percent Tariffs Announced Hooray for Hollywood! Just when you thought national security threats could not get any stupider, Trump says Hollywood ‘dying’; orders 100% tariff on non-US movies to save Hollywood. Subsidize Home Builders Please note Trump and Pulte Now Want Fannie Mae to Subsidize Home Builders Trump’s economic illiteracy and disrespect of moral hazards have no bounds. US and Canada Have a New Spat Over Auto Tariffs On October 12, 2025, I noted US and Canada Have a New Spat Over Auto Tariffs “He [Canadian Prime Minister Mak Carney] wants to make cars, we want to make cars, and we’re in competition,” Trump said in the Oval Office as he sat next to Carney. “And the advantage we have is, we have this massive market.” Trump’s Myopic View of Trade Trump views trade as having a winner and a loser. But other than coercion or force, both sides believe they benefit from a deal or there is no deal. The US could be and should be expanding our relationship with Canada and Mexico. Instead, Trump destroyed it. Meanwhile Bessent says “we have to be sufficient with our allies.” How about practicing that instead of punishing them?

Title: Some marketers are proudly touting anti-AI campaigns, but those promises could put them in a tricky spot down the road

Every time Dan publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. I'm closing my eyes and letting AI take the wheel. That's the proposed future for GM, where executives are touting a new "eyes-off" self-driving feature launching in 2028. Nothing like a little cat nap when you're hitting 80 mph on the highway. In today's big story, a portion of Corporate America is proud to tell you how it's avoiding AI. But executives' deep buy-in of the tech might make its arrival inevitable. What's on deck: Markets: Steve Cohen's Point72 shook up its top quant unit. Here's how it all went down. Tech: The great flattening just came for Google's ad division. Business: If you haven't secured a "KPop Demon Hunter" Halloween costume yet, you might be out of luck. (Please don't tell my three-year-old.) But first, all in on not going all-in. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. A human wrote the sentence you are currently reading. Is that a good enough reason for you to stick around? That's the strategy behind some big-name corporate brands. While a good chunk of businesses tout their use of AI, another cohort is proudly declaring they're against it. (Side note: If you'd actually prefer a robot wrote this newsletter, please don't share that opinion with my bosses.) Aerie, Heineken, and DC Comics are some of the brands shouting from the rooftops (or massive billboards) about their anti-AI stance, writes BI's Lara O'Reilly and Jordan Hart. For these companies, it's a bet that promoting human authenticity will resonate with people who are growing tired of AI infiltrating all aspects of life. Finding that human-AI balance was a key theme at Advertising Week New York, Lara previously reported. And even those on the cutting edge of AI seem to recognize the need to tap into the human element. Just look at this ad from OpenAI of a guy trying to do pull-ups. How very relatable and human! Of course, there's no guarantee people are buying it. "Would you like me to go ahead and do the workout for you?" reads one of the top comments on YouTube. The anti-AI companies are toeing a fine line. While most people have some level of AI fatigue — I'm sick of getting tricked by those fake, AI-generated post-game press conferences — it also seems foolish to disregard the technology altogether. The benefits of leveraging AI to some degree are undeniable, and dismissing that could be a grave mistake. Some might argue that a purely human approach in a world full of AI is a differentiator, like a restaurant sourcing all its ingredients from a local farm. But while that business model might work on a small scale, the bigger you are the harder it becomes. That's especially true if your rivals are willing to dive into the AI pool headfirst. Marketers could also be doing a bit of self-preservation. The more you proclaim the importance of marketing your company as human-first, the more job security you give yourself. However, one study hints at the inevitability of AI adoption. The survey found 87% of executives use AI on the job, writes BI's Sarah E. Needleman. That's compared to just 57% usage among managers and 27% of employees using it. The split shows how those at the top of orgs are the biggest proponents of the tech. But that doesn't make the adoption any easier, as Sarah covered in the deep divide taking place at video-game giant Electronic Arts. 1. Behind the shocking shakeup at Steve Cohen's top quant unit. The surprising ouster of Cubist president Denis Dancanet followed months of quiet maneuvering by Cohen and his top leader, people familiar with the matter said. Cubist is the roughly $7 billion quant division of Cohen's hedge fund Point72. Here's how it all unfolded. 2. Beyond Meat's meme-stock craze might be starting to spoil. Shares in the buzzy plant-based meat company finished down 1% on Wednesday and fell a further 20% in early trading on Thursday. Two options trading data points — and even the retail trader driving Beyond Meat's rally — suggest investors should be cautious. 3. Why gold's record-breaking rally has stalled out. After repeatedly hitting all-time highs over the course of a month, the precious metal has recently retreated. Market experts say gold's decline is likely driven by technical factors. 1. Google is stripping back management layers (again). In a memo sent to staff last month, the search giant said it was eliminating a middle-management layer in its US ads business. The move is part of Google's larger efforts to speed up decisions and cut bureaucracy, and it reflects a wider trend happening across Big Tech. 2. Meta's AI layoffs, in its own words. Chief AI officer Alexandr Wang said the cuts, which affect 600 Superintelligence Labs employees, will help the company make decisions more quickly. Read the full memo. 3. Amazon is taking the L in AI, but can it bounce back? Bernstein's Mark Shmulik — a top Wall Street tech analyst — said in a note that while AWS might be last in the AI race, it's not dead yet. Shmulik said AWS is showing early signs of progress, and its partnership with Anthropic is promising. 1. Tesla's record quarterly revenue wasn't enough for Wall Street. The EV giant's profit came in below analyst expectations, causing the stock to decline in after-hours trading. Elon Musk also railed against the major proxy firms opposing his proposed pay package, calling them "corporate terrorists." 2. Good luck finding a "KPop Demon Hunters" Halloween costume. Looks like Netflix really underestimated demand: The officially licensed costumes by Spirit Halloween are sold out online and in most stores. However, unlicensed dupes abound on sites like Etsy and Amazon. 3. It may be the toughest season ever for 'Shark Tank' contestants. Why? Because Tariffs are screwing up the show's usual playbook, BI's Katherine Li writes. For businesses that rely on global supply chains, the cost of production and projected profits may have collapsed between their on-camera pitch and the time their episode airs.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) has a historical pattern of vulnerability to sharp downturns. On two separate occasions in past years, the stock dropped by over 30% in less than two months, wiping out billions in market capitalization and quickly erasing significant investor gains. If this historical volatility is any indicator, AVGO stock remains susceptible to abrupt, steep declines. Several brewing risks could fuel future volatility in Broadcom's share price: That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like AVGO, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. It certainly helps alleviate risk when the fundamentals are positive. For more details on AVGO, read Buy or Sell AVGO Stock. Below are several important figures. *LTM: Last Twelve Months When assessing risk, it is beneficial to observe how AVGO performs during significant market pullbacks. In 2018, the stock experienced a decline of approximately 27% from peak to trough. The COVID-19 pandemic affected it more severely, resulting in a nearly 48% drop. During the inflation crisis, the decrease was around 35%. See – How Low Can Broadcom Stock Really Go – for more details. Even with solid fundamentals, AVGO remains vulnerable to sharp declines when the broader market drops. Strong quality can help soften the fall, but downturns are still painful. However, risks are not confined to significant market crashes. Stocks may decline even when markets are performing well – consider events like earnings reports, corporate announcements, and changes in outlook. Read AVGO Dip Buyer Analyses to learn how the stock has rebounded from significant declines in history. Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Amazon stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) has a history of delivering impressive, rapid returns, with the stock achieving over 30% gains in less than two months on 13 separate occasions, notably in 2010 and 2020. If these historical patterns persist, upcoming catalysts could propel AMZN stock to extraordinary new highs, offering significant benefits to shareholders. Several high-growth areas are poised to drive Amazon's stock higher: That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like AMZN, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that?

It undoubtedly helps if the financial fundamentals are solid. For insights on AMZN, visit Buy or Sell AMZN Stock. Below are some key metrics to note. *LTM: Last Twelve Months When considering risk, it’s useful to assess Amazon’s performance during challenging market conditions. It experienced a nearly 94% decline during the Dot-Com Bubble, which is substantial. The Global Financial Crisis affected it by approximately 65%, and the Inflation Shock of 2022 also had a severe impact, resulting in a decline of over 56%. Even less extreme events, such as the 2018 correction and the COVID-19 selloff, caused drops of around 34% and 23%, respectively. Look at – How Low Can Amazon Stock Really Go – for more details. Therefore, despite the favorable indicators, Amazon's past indicates that it can incur significant losses when the market declines. However, risk is not confined to major market downturns. Stocks can decline even amid favorable market conditions – consider situations such as earnings announcements, business updates, and outlook revisions. To observe how the stock has bounced back from sharp downturns historically, refer to the AMZN Dip Buyer Analyses. Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky.

Title: “Is It Really A Common Thing?”: 25 Popular American Myths Go Under The Microscope
URL: https://www.demilked.com/american-myths-debunked/
Time Published: 2025-10-23T13:06:47Z
Full Content:
No matter where you are in the world, you probably know a lot about what happens in America. Hollywood culture—and now American influencers—have made sure the rest of the world is familiar with life in the 50 states. Maybe you’ve seen TV shows that gave you an idea of American high school life, or footage of US portion sizes that made you wonder: are these depictions accurate, or just exaggerated myths? A curious Redditor’s online post sparked an interesting discussion, asking, “Non-Americans, what is something about the US that you’ve always wondered if it was real or just myth/hyperbole?” People worldwide responded with their questions, and Americans chimed in with their answers. We’ve collected some of the top favourites and shared them in the gallery below. Image source: RememberValentine, Jack Is it really a common thing that the police busts partys of high-schoolers? Do young people get arrested then because of underage drinking? ugh_this_world_sucks: I have ran and hid from the cops many times as a teenager. Almost always exclusively at parties Image source: lunchbockslarry, fajri nugroho I’ve always wondered if people really do have endless refills at restaurants or if it’s just a thing in movies. DonovanSarovir: Yeah that’s real, but generally only applies to fountain drinks like soda and cheap lemonade (NOT SPRITE), as well as black coffee. You’ll pay once and they keep you topped up, or sometimes you can refill it yourself. Expensive drinks like cocktails and stuff are one-offs like other places though. Soda is just so cheap because of corn subsidies that each glass costs them like five to ten cents. For those that are against universal healthcare because they don’t want to be paying for other people’s treatment, do they really not understand how medical insurance works ? AllRhythmNoBlues: Yes. They really do not understand. At all. ETA: I should clarify that the health care system in the U.S. is purposely convoluted. There are a multitude of reasons for this thought process. Some, for example, may think everyone should simply be responsible for themselves, even though that is impossible in a functioning society. Mostly, it’s corporate greed driven. Aside from the money structure which has been discussed in another answer, health insurance is tied to employment. It’s seen as something to be earned or deserved for working. If you don’t work, you supposedly don’t deserve to be healthy? Very broadly speaking, the American perspective is that things should be earned and for some reason, your health is included in that. It’s depressing on a whole new level because it’s self-inflicted. Image source: Frothingdogscock Image source: WhoregasmPerfection, RDNE Stock project Is it actually true you’re scared to call the ambulance or go to the hospital? Lily_Lupin: Called the ambulance in college once. Got a bill equal to several months’ rent afterwards. Haven’t called one since – uber or friends it is. Do your police systems/databases not talk to each other? Like you always hear “they crossed state lines we lost them” whereas in australia everyone is in the one database. You do something in one state? You’ll show up in the next. protomanEXE1995: We are remarkably divided among states and localities. The cultural demand for various levels of local sovereignty means that centralized control is heavily discouraged and rather uncommon. Image source: millycactus Are house numbers really as big as they are in movies. Every house is like 51234 something or other street. It’s a rare road here in Oz that cracks more than 200. Flame_MadeByHumans: The beginning number of a house in the US usually relates to the cross street. So all the houses between 42nd and 43rd street will be 4210, 4220, etc. It’s typically a codified system instead of houses 1-20 specific to a single street. Image source: cackmobile Do you just hang up the phone without saying goodbye, like in tv shows and the movies? keirmeister: No. That’s weird to us as well. I’m not sure where that concept in movies came from. Image source: nerdy_vanilla Is it true that prices of goods in shops is displayed without the tax and you have to work that bit out yourself? Surely not. ItsNotKenough: The sales tax also varies from state to state and can even vary from counties and cities within each individual state. Typically people don’t take the time to calculate the sales tax and just know it’ll be more than the price tag. Image source: walktheground Is it true that millions of sedentary obese American citizens drive huge pickup trucks and hate cyclists & vegans? AllieLoft: If the other comments haven’t answered your question- yes. All of those things: pickups, cycling, veganism, are tied to identity and politics at least loosely in this insane current political climate we have. At this point, a lot of us are programmed to make assumptions about people based on their car, eating habits, etc. Basically, we’re drowning in propaganda over here. Image source: summitcreature Image source: Marco-YES, Meruyert Gonullu Do you really throw garbage down the sink? Doesn’t it get clogged? Kent_Knifen: Some sinks are equipped with a garbage disposal. Think of it like a blender hidden just past the drain. It will chop up food particles small enough where they can go down the plumbing. You would NOT use this for all garbage, just discarded food. Image source: pseudo__gamer, Mathias Reding Are there really beer kegs in big parties? Where do you even buy kegs? GeorgeCabana: Yes. Many liquor stores offer kegs (you have to return the empty keg and taps). Image source: TheLesserWeeviI, Wynand van Poortvliet Do schools really have their own police/security? CuriousCuriousAlice: Yes, the bigger ones. In my city you will see them in their own police cars that say ‘[school name] campus police’ on the side. Honestly, most of their time is spent dealing with traffic before and after school. Image source: LenoreEvermore, Getty Images Do people really drive drunk as casually as they do in tv and movies? It seems like in tv shows even cops just get behind the wheel after slamming a few whiskeys, and regular people drive black out drunk. peternormal: Absolutely. It is not as common as it used to be, but like, for example… When I was a kid in the 80s it was legal to drink a beer while driving in Texas. Image source: No_Step9082, Carol Highsmith’s America Does your front door actually lead directly to the living room? that’s so wild to me. Like if I’m lounging on the sofa and my room mate comes home with maybe even another guest in tow, they’d be entering right into the living room and the door is opened to the outside? Ironhold: Depends on region, age of house, design of house, and lots of other things. Most of my apartments had some kind of entryway, at least. A few of my friends’ houses front door was straight to the living room/front room and the back door was straight to the kitchen. Image source: MisterBerry94, Gerald Schömbs Shark Week. Is it really just about sharks? vixiecat: Sure is! It’s great! All day and night, nothing on that channel but programs about sharks. Do school kids really sell wrapping paper and cookies to make money? budgie02: Sometimes, school fundraisers are common. At least when I was in school we got a magazine of home items like candles, blankets and such and would have to canvas the neighborhood and our family to sell it. The kid who sold the most would win an Xbox, or something like that. Image source: Thatkoshergirl Can you really pull yourself up by your bootstraps all on your own and achieve the American dream? Amenmeit: Unless you get extremely lucky or severely neglect your health, not anymore. Round about the mid to late nineties that fizzled out. Image source: KratosLegacy Image source: dexvoltage, Gustavo Fring That you have to “earn” your sick days at work. ATLDeepCreeker: Not earn, “accrue”. When you start a job that pays by the hour, you accrue a certain percentage of PAID sick time per week. The same holds true for vacation time. You can also take unpaid sick time. Some companies are flexible also, allowing you to use un-accrued sick time, before you actually earn it. If you are on salary, its a bit different. All of my sick and vacation time is available to me on January 1st. Haven’t really thought about it “always”, but become wondering some time ago if americans really can’t go anywhere without car. Do they really can’t come outside their homes and go by legs with friends to nearest park or some shopping mall to just chill there? Are they really imprisoned in their suburbs untill some parent drive them on their hammer 100 km to the nearest “fun place” or untill the same parents buy them a car? LakeExtreme7444: The more rural you are, the more dependent on a car you’ll be. Where I live, the closest gas station and grocery store are about 10-15 minutes away and I live 30 minutes from my work (this is all by car). We don’t have public transportation where I live, so if I didn’t have a car, I wouldn’t be able to work or buy things without a full day’s walk, at the very least. Timtronic125: My local park is about 1.4 miles away. That’s 4 minutes by car, 35 minutes to walk. I work in the next city over. 26 miles by interstate @ approximately 40 minutes commute time. Walking to work would take 9 hours. America is huge and really spread out. And I live in the suburbs. Couldn’t imagine living in the Midwest.

From watching (admittedly too much) reality shows – how common is lip-fillers/Botox in people in their 20s/30s? FluffyOwl30: In every day people? Probably not high. In people who make money off their appearance? Probably high. Image source: Iluvaic How you guys are able to punch a hole through a wall. Where I’m from, all our homes are brick and concrete so if you punched a wall you’d be pretty screwed for life. arrius01: Most residential walls in the US are sheetrock which is fairly easy to punch through between the studs which are generally 16 in apart. Before sheetrock, many walls were strips of wood covered in plaster. I think hitting one of those would not have gone well for the person. There are lots of homes here with brick as well, but that is not as common, particularly portions of the country that aren’t constructed pre-turn of the century Image source: Beneficial_Pay5720 How common are basements and attics in houses? Is it exclusive for middle and upper middle class and above or most houses have them? atomiku121: Depends on the area you’re in. In my area (Midwest) both are quite common for a couple reasons. Attics are common because we can get a LOT of snow, so sloped roofs are needed to handle the load. Depending on the slope, the space may not be usable for much outside of storage, hence the attic. My home has an attic that was large enough to convert into a large master bedroom. Basements are common here because the soil has a lot of clay and is generally soft enough to dig through without too much issue, and having a portion of your home below grade is very nice to have in the event a tornado comes through. Image source: WnDelPiano In The Sopranos, Tony quotes another character saying “Nowhere else in the world [do] people expect to be happy except here in this country and still we’re not.” Do most Americans actually have that expectation? jimb575: As an American, I can unequivocally say that this is 100% true. I never understood this drive that people have here that they need to be happy. Not content, but happy. We’re taught that if you’re not happy then there is something wrong. In my view, this causes all types of issues – hyper-materialism, self doubt, false competition, etc… And the worst part is that the people that expect to be happy usually expect someone else to make them happy… Image source: johnnyknack Is it true Americans have no job security and your boss can just fire you for no reason, like Trump in the Apprentice? tstackspaper: Yes this is true. It’s called “at-will employment” It is illegal for an employer to terminate an employee for reasons that violate federal or state laws, however you’d be burdened proving this in a court of law so typically people just move on instead of wasting time trying to sue over it.

Title: $1.8 trillion Wall Street giant files active multi-coin ETF to challenge BTC dominance

Full Content:
Forget Bitcoin-only exposure: T. Rowe wants a managed crypto basket with room for Solana and XRP. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. T. Rowe Price, one of the biggest old-school fund managers in the US with roots stretching back to 1937, is finally dipping its toes into crypto, but not just with another Bitcoin tracker. A Oct. 22 SEC filing reveals the $1.8 trillion firm wants to run a fund with a “diversified basket of crypto assets,” targeting between 5-15 coins weighted differently than the usual market cap approach. They aim to beat the FTSE Crypto US Listed Index (the top ten exchange-listed tokens) while keeping the freedom to zig when others zag. This puts T. Rowe in a small club of major players designing products around active management instead of simple exposure. It’s a departure from what BlackRock did with its spot Bitcoin ETF (now holding about $90 billion) and Fidelity’s $23 billion fund. Those are just passive Bitcoin conduits; T. Rowe’s approach is more like an equity fund, with managers trying to outperform by making smart allocation choices across multiple assets. The Baltimore firm has watched money flow out of its mutual funds for years, many of which couldn’t keep up with passive benchmarks. Since 2021, they’ve lost over $67 billion in assets under management despite the broader market rally. CEO Rob Sharps has been under pressure to modernize the 87-year-old firm’s approach, especially as younger investors increasingly bypass traditional funds altogether. Crypto gives them a fresh battleground where active management might actually still work. They’ve already built the trading infrastructure, with “end-to-end capabilities” for custody and execution. T. Rowe has historically been more conservative than peers like BlackRock, and they were noticeably absent from the first wave of spot Bitcoin ETFs. This makes their multi-coin approach even more surprising. The FTSE Crypto US Listed Index currently includes Bitcoin and Ethereum alongside alts like Solana and XRP, hinting at what the portfolio might look like. Their square-root weighting means smaller assets get proportionally bigger allocations than in typical market-cap models. For example, if Solana represents 5% of the crypto market cap, it might get closer to 15-20% allocation under this model. This matters because every major ETF so far has just reinforced Bitcoin’s dominance. A multi-asset approach could finally spread liquidity more evenly across the upper tier of crypto. This structure also shows how institutions are gradually accepting altcoins within regulatory boundaries. By sticking to “listed” assets, the index essentially limits the fund to tokens traded on US-compliant exchanges, providing legal cover while expanding options. For investors, that means getting exposure to assets like Solana, Cardano, or XRP without dealing with sketchy offshore products. The implications for crypto markets run deep. Current institutional flows primarily feed Bitcoin’s liquidity, with smaller trickles to Ethereum. If approved, T. Rowe’s fund could create more balanced institutional demand across multiple assets. With T. Rowe managing over $1.8 trillion, even a tiny allocation percentage could represent billions in potential inflows to altcoins. There’s a bigger strategy here: active, multi-asset ETFs might shape the next wave of crypto money flows. BlackRock and Fidelity built empires on Bitcoin’s simplicity; T. Rowe is betting people now want professional judgment over what comes next. The fund would test whether crypto can evolve from a single-asset play into a managed allocation, similar to how big institutions diversify across sectors. With Trump supporting digital assets and the CME preparing 24-hour crypto futures trading next year, traditional finance is making more room for digital assets. T. Rowe’s move fits right into this trend: crypto is shifting from fringe speculation to a legitimate asset class. For retail investors, T. Rowe’s entry offers something different: professional risk management in a notoriously volatile space. Rather than trying to time individual altcoins, they could potentially benefit from T. Rowe’s century of investment experience applied to the crypto market. The fund would essentially function as a “crypto portfolio in a box,” potentially attracting investors who find individual token selection overwhelming. Industry veterans might recognize this as part of a broader pattern. First came Bitcoin-only vehicles, then Ethereum. Multi-asset funds represent the third wave of institutional crypto adoption. The next logical steps would be sector-focused crypto ETFs (like “DeFi-only” or “Web3 Infrastructure”), followed eventually by thematic crypto funds mirroring how traditional ETFs evolved. Whether this kicks off an “altcoin ETF season” depends on how regulators handle multi-asset exposure. But the precedent is there. If T. Rowe gets approval, others will follow with their own mixes of liquidity, custody partners, and index rules. Franklin Templeton and Invesco are reportedly watching closely, with their own multi-asset frameworks nearly ready. What started as a Bitcoin ETF arms race could become a competition over who defines the broader investable universe of crypto, potentially reshaping how capital flows into digital assets for decades to come.

Title: Nvidia Stock Paid Out $80 Billion

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Over the past decade, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has returned an impressive $83 Bil to its investors in the form of cash through dividends and buybacks. The payouts are only likely to pick up, as Nvidia retains the pole position in the AI silicon race, generating over $75 billion in operating cash flows over the last 12 months. Let's examine some statistics and see how this capacity for payouts compares with the market's top capital-return generators. Interestingly, NVDA stock has provided the 25th largest total return to shareholders in history. Why should you be concerned? Because dividends and share repurchases are direct, tangible returns of capital to shareholders. They also indicate management's confidence in the company’s financial stability and its capacity to produce sustainable cash flows. There are additional stocks with similar characteristics. Here is a list of the top 10 companies ranked by the total capital returned to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. Investing in a single stock can be risky, but there is significant advantage to a broader diversified approach, as seen with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Should you invest in one stock you favor or create a portfolio intended to succeed across various market cycles? Our data indicates that High Quality Portfolio has transformed stock-picking uncertainty into consistent market-outperforming results. This portfolio is part of the asset allocation strategy employed by Empirical Asset Management – a wealth manager in the Boston area and Trefis partner – whose asset allocation framework achieved positive returns during the 2008-09 financial crisis when the S&P fell by more than 40%. Top 10 Stocks By Total Shareholder Return For the complete ranking, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking What stands out here? The aggregate capital returned to shareholders as a percentage of the current market capitalization seems inversely proportional to growth potential regarding reinvestments. Companies such as Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) display much faster growth, in a more predictable manner, than the others, but they have returned a significantly smaller share of their market value to shareholders. That's the counterpoint to high capital returns. While appealing, it prompts the question: Am I forgoing growth and robust fundamentals? With this in mind, let's analyze some figures for NVDA. (see Buy or Sell NVIDIA Stock for more information) NVIDIA Fundamentals That provides a good summary, but assessing a stock from an investment viewpoint entails much more. That is precisely what Trefis High Quality Portfolio offers. It is tailored to mitigate stock-specific risk while providing upside potential. NVDA Historical Risk However, Nvidia is not safeguarded against significant declines. It plunged 68% during the Dot-Com bubble and experienced an even steeper drop of 85% in the Global Financial Crisis. During the inflation surge, it fell roughly 66%, while the corrections in 2018 and the Covid pandemic caused declines of 56% and 38%, respectively. Despite solid fundamentals, Nvidia's history indicates it can experience substantial losses during market downturns. But the risk isn't confined to major market crashes. Stocks decline even in favorable market conditions – consider events like earnings reports, business updates, and changes in outlook. Read NVDA Dip Buyer Analyses to understand how the stock has rebounded from sharp declines in the past. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has a proven history of consistently outperforming its benchmark which includes all three – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Why is that? As a category, HQ Portfolio stocks have generated superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; providing a less volatile experience, as demonstrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Stock futures are down slightly this morning as investors assess a slew of corporate earnings reports and monitor developments in U.S.-China trade relations; Tesla (TSLA) shares are falling after the EV maker’s third-quarter profit came up short of Wall Street estimates despite higher-than-expected revenue; IBM (IBM) shares are lower after its quarterly software sales missed analysts' expectations; Intel (INTC) is set to release results after the closing bell, with traders pricing in a big move in the chipmaker's stock following the report; and oil prices are rising after the U.S. slapped sanctions on major Russian oil firms amid pressure to end the Ukraine war. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are moving lower Thursday as investors pour over a barrage of earnings reports from major companies and keep tabs on developments in U.S.-China trade relations. Major U.S. indexes lost ground yesterday, led by declines in tech stocks, one day after the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high. Dow futures were down 0.2% in recent trading, as were S&P 500 futures, while futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 0.3%. Gold futures, which have hit a series of record highs lately but stumbled this week, were up 1.5% at near $4,125 an ounce. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) was trading at $109,000, up from an overnight low of $106,700. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which can have an impact on mortgage rates and other consumer loans, ticked higher to 3.99% after it recently hit six-month lows. Tesla (TSLA) shares are down in premarket trading after the EV maker's quarterly profit came in short of analysts' estimates, even as it returned to revenue growth following two quarters of declines. Tesla posted earnings per share of 50 cents in the third quarter, below the 54 cents that analysts tracked by Visible Alpha had estimated. Revenue in the period rose 12% to $28.1 billion, beating estimates. Tesla’s revenue grew as customers rushed to take advantage of an expiring EV tax credit, though the company’s investments in restructuring and AI drove its costs higher. On the earnings conference call, CEO Elon Musk touted the company’s advancements in AI, self-driving cars and humanoid robotics, highlighting the technologies as the firm’s next stage of growth. Tesla shares, which through yesterday's close had gained 9% so far this year, were down 4% ahead of the bell. IBM (IBM) shares are sharply lower as a slowdown in software sales growth offset revenue and profit numbers that came in ahead of analysts' estimates. IBM said that third-quarter revenue rose 9% to $16.33 billion, while earnings per share were $2.65, well above the $2.44 that analysts had been expecting. However, the 10% increase in software sales to $7.2 billion came in slightly below estimates and raised concerns about the company's growth trajectory at a time when demand is booming for cloud services. Shares of IBM, a Dow component, were down 7% in recent premarket trading. Coming into today's session, the stock had gained 30% so far in 2025. Intel (INTC) is scheduled to release its third-quarter numbers after the closing bell, and traders anticipate volatility in its stock price following the report. Analysts tracked by Visible Alpha expect quarterly revenue for the embattled chipmaker to have declined slightly to around $13.16 billion, while its adjusted earnings are estimated at two cents a share, an improvement over its loss of 48 cents a share in the year-ago quarter. Intel shares have risen roughly 85% so far this year as investor sentiment has been boosted by a series of major investments in the company. The Trump administration in August took an approximately 10% stake in the company, and Intel has also received investments from Japan's SoftBank and AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA). Intel shares were down about 1% in recent trading. Oil futures are surging after the Trump administration put sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies amid pressure to end the war in the Ukraine. The Treasury Department said the sanctions on Russian oil firms Rosneft and Lukoil are designed to “degrade the Kremlin’s ability to raise revenue for its war machine.” West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, were up more than 5% at $61.50 per barrel. Brent crude futures, the global benchmark, were also up about 5%. “Now is the time to stop the killing and for an immediate ceasefire,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement.

Title: Trillion-Dollar Legacy Asset Manager Enters Crypto Space with ETF Covering XRP, Solana, Cardano, Shiba Inu

A $1.8 trillion mutual fund giant is seeking approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for its first crypto-based exchange-traded fund (ETF), marking a bold move into the digital assets industry. T. Rowe Price surprised onlookers after filing for an S-1 registration statement with the SEC on Wednesday to introduce the T. Rowe Price Active Crypto ETF. The application states that the fund is expected to hold five to 15 crypto assets that are eligible under the SEC’s generic listing standards, which include Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, XRP, Cardano, Avalanche, Litecoin, Polkadot, Dogecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Chainlink, Stellar Lumen, and Shiba Inu. These listing standards, recently approved by the SEC, significantly shorten the timeline for crypto ETFs to start trading. If approved, the fund would give investors active exposure to digital assets, a significant shift that would shake up its largely mutual fund-focused offerings. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted in a post on X that the filing was a “SEMI-SHOCK,” remarking that T. Rowe has focused mainly on mutual funds across its 87-year history. “Did not expect it but I get it,” Balchunas wrote. “There’s gonna be land rush for this space too.” However, T. Rowe Price has been signaling interest in crypto for a while now. During an ETF conference in Las Vegas earlier this year, Dominic Rizzo, who manages the company’s technology-focused ETF, suggested that now is a good time to consider Bitcoin exposure. He compared the crypto’s price to that of a commodity, saying it closely tracks the cost of mining it. Having long focused on mutual funds, T. Rowe Price’s foray into crypto ETFs comes after other legacy asset managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity had rushed to list such vehicles to overwhelming success. “Can’t overstate significance of T. Rowe Price filing for an actively managed crypto ETF out of left field,” President of NovaDius Wealth Management, Nate Geraci, posited. “A firm founded in 1937 is now building out the full infrastructure to handle crypto trading and manage a crypto ETF.” The T. Rowe Price Active Crypto ETF joins a growing list of over 155 crypto-related exchange-traded fund applications currently at the SEC’s desk. Most of these applications, including ones for Ripple’s XRP and Solana, are in limbo amid the US government shutdown, which is now in its 22nd day.

But what would a post-bubble nosedive look like? Given the weakness in almost every other sector of the US economy, it could well mean a recession. Economic slumps come in many flavours, though, and the worst tend to follow from financial crises. Yet most experts (with a few exceptions) have not warned of the AI bubble causing a financial crisis. Instead, the conventional wisdom seems to be that if there is a recession, it will look more like the one that followed the dot-com bubble in 2000 than the one following the 2008 global financial crisis. History does provide some support for this view. One well known paper on bubbles and financial crises concludes that “the post-WW2 era appears to have weathered numerous equity price bubbles that did not turn into financial crisis episodes.” But the authors also note that equity-price bubbles can precipitate financial crises if they are fuelled by borrowed money. After all, the Great Depression was preceded by a debt-fuelled “roaring 20s” equity bubble. This matters because, as economist Noah Smith points out, banks are funding “private credit” funds that in turn are lending money to fund the data-centre construction for an anticipated AI boom. Smith wonders whether we will see defaults on those construction loans when the AI bubble bursts, and whether private credit losses could cause a crisis for the banks that ultimately extended that credit. It is also worth pondering whether a bursting AI bubble could compromise the ability of other non-bank financial institutions to repay their loans. A recent JPMorgan analyst note on hedge-fund trading observes that concentration in the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks (companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Nvidia) remains near historic highs. Yet the prices of these stocks are highly dependent on the companies’ AI ambitions. If they fall short of their goals, and prices come crashing down, highly leveraged hedge funds may be forced into fire sales, unloading stocks to meet margin calls or repay bank loans. And if those fire sales don’t fetch enough cash, the funds will default on their repayment obligations, potentially undermining the financial condition of the broker-dealers, primary dealers, and banks that extended them credit. Moreover, the same dynamics will also drive down the prices of tech stocks further, potentially forcing other leveraged financial institutions to sell off their portfolios, and so on. Nor should we assume that financial institutions desperate for cash will restrict themselves to selling off tech stocks. On the contrary, they may need — or prefer — to dump other types of assets, transmitting problems to other asset markets. Such a scenario is not far-fetched. The Fed reports that hedge-fund leverage hit historically high levels in 2024, and in a September 2025 commentary, analyst Adam Josephson notes that “hedge fund borrowing/leverage [is] at a record high of $6.2 trillion, up more than 25% vs. a year ago at the end of March.” Specifically, outstanding margin loans from broker-dealers and repurchase agreements from primary dealers are at historically high levels. And bank lending (particularly lending by large banks) to non-bank financial institutions — including broker-dealers, primary dealers, and the hedge funds themselves — is also significantly elevated, with bank loans to NBFIs now accounting for “$1.7 trillion in bank loans, or 13% of loans outstanding.” Meanwhile, US financial regulators continue to permit this expansion of leverage, as well as green-lighting the integration of traditional financial markets with crypto markets (which are also rife with leverage). Despite narratives about Bitcoin and other crypto assets serving as a hedge against risks in other markets, their price movements are highly correlated with equities. Thus, we should expect to see crypto prices fall when the AI bubble bursts, and not just because of fire-sale dynamics. Both crypto and the AI bubble have been inflated by the same kinds of narratives about new technologies shattering old paradigms. If evidence of AI’s limitations starts to permeate the public consciousness during a market crash, more pessimistic sentiment on tech assets could well undermine crypto hype as well. This could then prompt a crash in Ponzi-like crypto assets such as Bitcoin, as well as runs on asset-backed stablecoins. If stablecoin issuers are forced to withdraw their cash reserves from banks, they could trigger a run on those institutions; and if they are forced to dump Treasuries from their reserves, another critically important financial market could be sucked into the maelstrom. Experts might not expect a stock-market crash to cause a financial crisis, but what if they are wrong? With leverage built up in so many parts of the system and asset-price movements so correlated, what if the financial system is a tinder box that could explode when the first spark lands on it? Of course, the financial system may well weather the bursting of the AI bubble, especially if the end arrives with a low hiss rather than a sudden bang. But we shouldn’t count on it.

Today’s top news: 🏛️ Crypto Goes to Washington - And Gets Caught In the Middle The fight over U.S. crypto market structure has gotten fierce between the Democrats and Republicans. And the crypto industry is stuck in the middle. Senate Democrats reportedly told crypto industry leaders behind closed doors that Republicans have been “using” them politically, while both sides continue to battle over who controls the rules for digital assets. Blockworks reported that Democrat Senator Ruben Gallego told a room full of crypto executives this week: “Don’t be an arm of the Republican Party — they used you and your megaphones to f*** us.” The comment came during a tense Democratic roundtable with leaders from Coinbase, Solana, Ripple, and Paradigm, among others. On the same day, those same companies walked straight into a Republican meeting pitched as the real path to crypto legislation. Both sides are still saying they want a market structure bill, but the split is widening, and neither camp trusts the other. Here’s what the two sides are fighting over: The political risk for crypto is now obvious: if this turns into Red Team vs Blue Team, we don’t get clarity, and gridlock is likely. And the more that the Dems feel slighted in any regulatory frameworks approved under the Trump administration, the more they’ll try to claw those back if/when the balance of power shifts. Near term, the risks are lower scale—basically just delays. Longer term, the risks grow in magnitude the more political that crypto becomes (and the more it becomes aligned directly with the Trump family). This remains one of the single most important issues to monitor for crypto in America.

Title: Forbes Daily: Beyond Meat Reaches Meme Stock Territory
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellechemtob/2025/10/23/forbes-daily-beyond-meat-reaches-meme-stock-territory/

ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. Beyond Meat may be plant-based, but investors are beefing up their holdings as the company’s stock becomes a so-called meme asset. Shares of the firm have surged over 1,000% since hitting a record intraday low last week, as the company announced its creditors had accepted a debt swap. Demand for Beyond Meat and other plant-based meat brands has softened despite initial popularity, with the company quickly becoming a penny stock after trading at around $230 during its 2019 peak. It’s the latest to be caught up in the meme stock frenzy, like Opendoor, and of course GameStop. Despite spending billions to ramp up its AI efforts, Meta said in an internal memo that it would lay off about 600 staffers at its Superintelligence Labs. Meta’s AI chief Alexandr Wang, cofounder of the firm Scale AI, characterized the layoffs as a restructuring move. Uber is incentivizing drivers in select states with a $4,000 rebate program to switch to electric vehicles for use in the company’s “Uber Electric” service. The move comes as the Trump Administration sunsetted federal tax credits for EVs, and could help spur EV demand in the final quarter. Tesla fell short of expectations in its third-quarter earnings report Wednesday, despite a historic rise in quarterly deliveries in the lead-up to the expiration of the EV tax credits. The automaker’s stock dropped more than 3% in pre-market trading this morning, though the firm actually reported revenues well above Wall Street’s predictions. MORE: Tesla chief Elon Musk called two shareholder advisory firms that are opposing his proposed $1 trillion pay package “corporate terrorists” during Wednesday's earnings call. Even amid tariff uncertainty, small business buying saw a boost in the third quarter—though there could be a downturn next quarter as the government shutdown has frozen approval of SBA-backed loans. Buyers are moving fast and prices are falling, suggesting sellers could be lowering expectations to move before conditions worsen. Palo Alto-based AI agent startup Genspark is in discussions to raise over $200 million in a new funding round that would more than double its valuation to over $1 billion. The company originally had a search product before killing it off, and intends to launch an enterprise-focused product soon. Global oil prices spiked early Thursday after the Trump Administration imposed a new set of sanctions targeting Russia’s two largest oil companies and threatened further action unless Moscow agreed to a ceasefire in its ongoing war with Ukraine. The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which announced the sanctions, blamed the move on “Russia’s lack of serious commitment to a peace process to end the war.” First Lady Melania Trump’s $MELANIA memecoin is now under legal scrutiny, as a court filing this week alleges the cryptocurrency is part of a broader fraudulent “pump-and-dump” scheme meant to enrich a small number of insiders. The lawsuit does not allege that the first lady played any role in the fraud. Women’s basketball is surging in popularity, so it makes sense that a number of the figures on Forbes’ 2025 list of America’s Most Powerful Women in Sports come from the sport. But all eyes are on the WNBA’s next contract negotiation, as its current collective bargaining agreement expires at the end of the month. As revenues hit record highs, WNBA players received just 9.3% of league income in 2022, according to Bloomberg—compared with roughly 50% for NBA players and 48% for the NFL. General Motors vehicles will soon feature a self-driving “eyes-off” system, the company said Wednesday, though it will be limited to highway driving upon release. Human intervention will only be needed for things like off-ramps, and the system will be able to handle emergencies and sudden incidents, according to TechCrunch. For the fourth year in a row, the NBA’s most valuable team is the Golden State Warriors, worth an estimated $11 billion. No other NBA team was within $300 million of the Warriors’ estimated $880 million in revenue last season, with the club far outpacing the rest of the league with its income from sponsorships and premium seating, and ranking in the top three in virtually every category tracked by Forbes. In fact, Golden State more than doubled the $417 million league average for total revenue, and compared with the other North American sports leagues, the Warriors generated more cash than every franchise except the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys. But even for the rest of the NBA, business these days is very, very good. According to Forbes estimates, league-wide revenue last season was up 10% year-over-year, to roughly $12.5 billion, including money from non-NBA events held at teams’ arenas but netting out arena debt service. And another significant jump is coming in 2025-26—the first season of the 11-year, $76 billion national media package the NBA signed last year with Disney, NBCUniversal and Amazon Prime Video. With all of that cash pouring in, Forbes estimates that the 30 NBA teams are worth $5.4 billion on average—or just over $160 billion collectively—representing an increase of 21% over last year and more than doubling the average of $2.5 billion from just four seasons ago. WHY IT MATTERS “The Celtics sold for a blended valuation of roughly $6.7 billion in August, and the Lakers are awaiting the NBA’s approval for a $10 billion transaction—figures that, given the franchises’ business performance in 2024-25, make them look more like fast-growing tech startups than sports teams in a nearly 80-year-old league,” says Forbes senior editor Brett Knight. “Forbes now values the 30 pro basketball teams at 12.9 times last season’s revenue on average, well ahead of the other major men’s leagues, which demonstrates just how desperate investors are to break into basketball. And no one is expecting that to change anytime soon.” MORE How Modern Sports Arenas Make Millions More By Building Fewer Luxury Suites The first half of the year was the costliest ever in terms of climate disasters in the wake of wildfires in Los Angeles, tornadoes in the Midwest and severe storms across the South.

The basic rule is that the IRS has three years after you file your return to audit you—but there are a number of exceptions, and the agency has no time limit on auditing you if you never file or file fraudulently. It’s critical to keep good records, report all your income and consider having a tax professional prepare your return.

Title: Looking Back on the Trump Stock Market Crash of 2025

Jason: As you requested, here’s my prewrite on the stock market crash and the start of the second Great Depression so we have something to post the moment it happens. That will probably be before Halloween, but the market might hang on until Thanksgiving. PLEASE REMEMBER not to post before the crash actually occurs! It’s an open secret that the collapse is imminent and that it will make the Great Recession of 2007–9 look like a day at the beach. But we’ll look stupid if we jump the gun, especially in the (admittedly very unlikely) event that the market continues its climb or we suffer only a minor correction. Cheers, Tim P.S. Again, DO NOT push the wrong button and post this when you finish editing! In retrospect, the only surprise about the Crash of 2025 was that anybody was surprised. “We will have a crash,” New York Times financial columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin told 60 Minutes just weeks before the collapse. “Beware these two months,” warned the veteran financial analyst Jon Wolferbarger’s newsletter BullandBearProfits.com, because “Most Major Crashes and Bear Markets” occur in October or November. Wolfbarger himself warned MarketWatch to expect the biggest bear market since 1929. The Motley Fool’s John Fieldsend noted that “the Warren Buffet indicator,” which is the market capitalization of all stocks divided by gross domestic product, stood at its highest point in history. For the sake of comparison, right before the dot-com crash, it had been 140 percent. On October 17, it was 218 percent. The Yale economist Robert Shiller’s cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings, or CAPE, ratio stood at its second-highest point in history; the highest point had been right before the dot-com bubble burst. And yet greedy fools kept shoveling cash into the stock market, boosting the S&P 500 25 percent between April and October. Most of these gains came from four tech stocks that were invested heavily in artificial intelligence: Nvidia, Meta, Microsoft, and Broadcom. The AI chipmaker Nvidia alone drove about one-quarter of the gains. This AI bubble was a haunting echo of the radio-stock bubble prior to the 1929 crash: promising technology, premature expectation of quick profits. RCA was the Nvidia of its day. An October 2025 Bank of America survey of global fund managers found that 54 percent of them thought tech stocks overpriced. Even Chat GPT acknowledged the AI bubble. Another obvious parallel to the Great Depression was President Donald Trump’s reckless tariffs. These brought trade protections to their highest level since Smoot-Hawley, the disastrous tariff Congress imposed eight months after the 1929 crash. The Yale Budget Lab reported that the tariffs cost the average household $2,400 in 2025 and lowered GDP by half a percentage point. But the greatest harm was the heightened level of uncertainty about when and where Trump would impose tariffs. The most visible result was that the number of jobs created each month fell by about 100,000. Yet another parallel with 1929 was the lack of transparency. The crash prompted President Franklin Roosevelt to create the Securities and Exchange Commission to (among other things) compel extensive disclosures about publicly traded stocks. But the rise of largely unregulated private credit and private equity, known collectively as “shadow banking,” made it much harder for the public to assess risk. The collapse of Tricolor Holdings, a subprime auto lender, and First Brands, an auto-parts supplier, both of whose financing was fairly opaque, prompted JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon to observe on October 14, “When you see one cockroach, there are probably more.” Sorkin sounded a similar theme in an October 13 New York Times Magazine piece that drew parallels between the hucksterism and outright fraud preceding the 1929 crash (the subject of Sorkin’s latest book) and the rapid entry of ordinary savers into the risky world of shadow banking. In both instances, financiers waxed eloquent about “democratizing” the market, but “when transformation comes this quickly,” Sorkin warned, it rarely benefits everyone unless it is paired with transparency, oversight and regulation.… The pattern is familiar, stretching back to 1929: Whenever access expands faster than safeguards, charlatans rush in and ordinary investors are often left holding the bag. I’d warned about the instability of private equity in September (“The Financial Sector Was Tottering Even Before Trump”), but Sorkin, who knew infinitely more about markets than me, was significantly more pessimistic than I was. I phoned my broker just in time. Postscript, 2085, by Greta Noah: To my late great-grandfather’s definitive and widely anthologized account of the Crash of 2025, The New Republic’s editors have asked me to add the following update. It would be America’s bad luck that the Crash of 2025 occurred when a Republican occupied the White House. Public misperceptions to the contrary, Republicans had always been much worse at managing the economy than Democrats. It was hardly coincidence that Herbert Hoover was president at the start of the Great Depression, Ronald Reagan at the start of the savings and loan crisis, and George W. Bush at the start of the 2008 financial crisis. It was even worse luck for America that the Republican who was president when the stock market crashed was the mentally unstable kleptocrat Donald Trump. Trump’s chaotic attempts to revive the economy with additional tax cuts, higher tariffs, and the illegal closure of the SEC drove unemployment so high that in the 2026 midterm he lost both houses of Congress to the Democrats. In April 2027, Trump was impeached for the third time, and the third time proved the charm. Trump was removed from office, with no fewer than 15 Senate Republicans giving Democrats the necessary two-thirds majority to convict. But the year and a half of Trump mismanaging the post-crash economy had taken its toll. Thousands of Baby Boom retirees descended on Washington to demand a bailout for catastrophic losses in their retirement plans. Modeling themselves on Coxey’s Army, the unemployed masses that flooded into Washington during the Panic of 1893 to demand federal jobs, the Boomers, with Trump in mind, called themselves Cocksu—on second thought, let’s set that colorful detail aside. Trump’s attempt to reduce 35 percent unemployment by quadrupling the staff of Immigration and Customs Enforcement shrank the workforce by deporting not just undocumented immigrants but also millions of U.S. citizens, including first lady Melania Trump, Elon Musk, Ana de Armas, John Oliver, and five dozen white Anglo-Saxon Protestants who traced their lineage back to the Mayflower. The deportations reduced competition for jobs, but not enough to offset the continuing shrinkage of job openings as Trump jacked up tariffs on the European Union to 10,000 percent. Treasury Secretary Howard Lutnick, who succeeded Scott Bessent after Bessent was arrested for beating Bill Pulte to death, encouraged Trump to jack up EU tariffs in retaliation against the euro displacing first the dollar and then the World Liberty Financial stablecoin USD1 as the global reserve currency. Twenty years would pass before the economy was back to normal, the workforce stabilized through passage of bipartisan immigration legislation, the Ivy League and other research universities reopened, cryptocurrency outlawed, the Trump Ballroom demolished, the Republican Party replaced by a revived Whig Party, and a greatly diminished financial sector brought back under a strict level of government supervision not seen since the 1960s. The only upside to the global depression that followed the Crash of 2025 was that it diminished carbon emissions to the point that only relatively modest regulatory measures were necessary to eliminate climate change entirely. Social media had been wiped out in 2028 by repeal of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, and mainstream newspapers and magazines were starting once again to find an audience. The American public had regained its sanity, but with every expectation that 100 years or so down the road all these lessons would be forgotten, and everything would go all to hell once again.

Title: Meta cuts 600 jobs in its AI division - but it says there is no need to worry

Hundreds of AI jobs cut at Meta When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Meta is cutting around 600 roles in its artificial intelligence division, a report from Axios has claimed. It’s believed Meta’s legacy AI research group and some product and infrastructure divisions may be affected, but employees in the new superintelligence labs should remain unaffected. The company, led by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, has already previously committed to reducing organizational inefficiencies, and this round of layoffs seems to align with those efforts rather than being a response to economic headwinds and ongoing labor market trends. The report claims Alexandr Wang from Meta’s superintelligence labs noted smaller teams can make faster decisions, resulting in more impact. Internally, Meta’s AI unit was also considered pretty large and inefficient. Despite the cuts, Meta isn’t necessarily saying goodbye to those workers – they can reapply for other roles within the organization if they choose not to accept the severance package, said to be worth 16 weeks of pay plus two weeks per completed year of service. Moreover, the company remains committed to building out its AI models and making other investments in AI infrastructure to compete with the likes of OpenAI, Amazon and Google. In 2025, Meta’s expenses could reach $114-118 billion, with AI driving even higher costs in 2026. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The company’s 29th data center, a campus with the potential to scale up to 1GW in El Paso, Texas, is already said to “support both the traditional servers of today and future generations of AI-enabled hardware,” reflecting Meta’s long-term commitment. Since warning employees of an “intense year” and laying off 3,600 workers in February 2025, Zuckerberg hasn’t cut as many workers as we might’ve expected – 100 in April and 600 this month, per layoffs.fyi.

Title: Revolut set to launch crypto services across Europe after securing MiCA licence

About us Copy link Revolut is set to roll out its crypto services across the EU after securing a licence under the trading bloc’s Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation. On Wednesday, the UK challenger bank announced it had obtained its MiCA licence from the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission. “It’s no secret that we have ambitious plans for the crypto sector in the future, and our MiCA license is fundamental to all of that,” Costas Michael, CEO of Revolut Digital Assets Europe, said in a statement shared with DL News. The licence lets companies offering crypto services, such as Revolut, to market them across 30 countries in the European Economic Area. It marks the $75 billion fintech firm’s latest foray into the crypto industry. Having begun to let users buy and sell digital assets in 2017, the neobank has made crypto a linchpin of its business. The top line at Revolut’s so-called wealth business, which includes crypto products and trading activity, jumped 298%, to $674 million, thanks to surging crypto activity in 2024. “Crypto is a big part of our belief in banking without borders, and securing our MiCA licence is a critical milestone,” Emil Urmanshin, director of crypto at Revolut, shared with DL News. Revolut faces fierce competition. A wave of traditional financial institutions and fintech firms is increasingly expanding their crypto offerings. Companies like payment giant PayPal, trading app Robinhood, fintech powerhouse Stripe, and investment behemoth BlackRock are among the organisations that have tapped into the sector. At the same time, they face pressure from crypto-native companies launching services that financial firms would traditionally provide. Crypto exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken have, for instance, launched several business lines that would traditionally be found amongst fintechs. Coinbase launched a debit card in collaboration with Visa in 2020, and has announced plans to become an “everything exchange,” as CEO Brian Armstrong called it in July. Kraken, for its part, has expanded its services to include custody and prime brokerage services as well as a blockchain-powered neobanking alternative called Krak. “That is going to be something that we’re building out in the UK and Europe over the course of the next six to 12 months,” Bivu Das, UK general manager at Kraken, told DL News on the sidelines of the Zebu Live conference in London this week. Revolut’s MiCA licence also precedes the upcoming launch of “Crypto 2.0.” The company said the newer offering will expand the number of cryptocurrencies available to users to more than 280, zero-fee staking services, and stablecoin conversions to the dollar with no spreads.

Title: Inside Steve Cohen's Cubist shake-up: How a quiet search and chance timing led to the surprising change at Point72

Every time Alex publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. To many inside Cubist Systematic Strategies — the roughly $7 billion quant division of Steve Cohen's hedge fund Point72 Asset Management — the ouster of president Denis Dancanet last month came as a shock. When Cohen's September 10 memo announcing the change landed, Dancanet had already begun preparing for year-end performance reviews, and scheduled meetings that day — including with job candidates — were abruptly canceled, according to people familiar with the matter. "People close to Denis were surprised," one of the people said. "Standard business was occurring." His big-name replacement, former WorldQuant Chief Investment Officer Geoffrey Lauprete, added to the curiosity. Lauprete had spent much of the past year laying the groundwork for an ambitious hedge fund launch of his own. Uncertainty loomed in the aftermath, with rumors of cuts and executive resignations swirling. The dust has started to clear in the six weeks since. In town halls and smaller meetings, Point72 leadership reaffirmed its commitment to its roster of 60 independent trading teams and the centralized investing unit that Dancanet built starting in 2020. "There are no plans to cut [portfolio managers] or investment teams — we remain focused on attracting great talent and growing Cubist," a Point72 spokesperson said in a statement to Business Insider. They declined to comment on Cubist's leadership changes. Dancanet also declined to comment. This week, Issam Bazzi, a key leader on the central team whose future has been the fixation of market chatter for weeks, signed a long-term contract extension after discussions with Cohen, Business Insider has learned. But what led to the surprising change at the top has remained murky. Cubist's performance had been strong during Dancanet's five-year run, and it remained positive in 2025 even after a short stint of summer losses that plagued the whole industry. If the shake-up felt sudden to some, that was by design. The announcement capped months of quiet maneuvering by Cohen and his top deputies, who'd started to question whether Dancanet was the right person to lead Cubist, people with knowledge of the matter said. Point72 started a hush-hush search in early summer, auditioning candidates in a closely guarded process to avoid leaks and disruptions to the business, one person with direct knowledge of the matter said. The result wasn't a fait accompli. A series of converging events and chance timing culminated in one of the industry's most unanticipated leadership swaps. This story is based on conversations with more than a dozen people close to Cubist and Libero Capital, including current and former employees, allocators, and service providers. They requested anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak on behalf of their companies or to protect client relationships. Fundamental stock picking is at the core of Cohen's Point72. But he's been involved in systematic trading for nearly as long as he's been running funds, hiring his first quant portfolio manager in 1994. After longtime Cubist head Ross Garon decamped for Izzy Englander's Millennium in 2020, Cohen brought in Dancanet, a veteran of the collaborative quant fund PDT — in large part to help realize a long-held desire to diversify from independent teams, or the so-called pod structure, and build a centralized systematic trading team in the mold of traditional powerhouse quant shops like PDT, Renaissance Technologies, or Two Sigma. "The difference compared to the pod model is that it's much more collaborative and there's open communication between the various teams across strategies," Dancanet explained in a 2023 blog post, which has since been scrubbed from the Point72 website. "The goal is to create a hybrid business structure combining the PM platform and the central team, which we feel would be unique for our industry." Dancanet was a cerebral, serene, and well-liked leader, according to those who've worked with him. He started on Wall Street in the mid-1990s after defecting from communist Romania in 1985. He joined Cubist after a four-year hiatus from quant trading, working on startups — one focused on flying cars and the other on applying data science to consumer lending. Dancanet immediately got to work building a centralized trading unit from scratch, an endeavor that, like any quant investment platform, would be expensive and take years to realize. Dancanet lured marquee hires, including former colleague Bazzi, from places like Citadel, Jump Trading, Squarepoint, and Tower Research. The road didn't lack bumps — the head of Cubist's high-frequency trading effort left after less than a year on the job — but the central group began trading and making money after a couple of years. It reached 100 people in 2025 and through mid-year had strong performance, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. The other key part of Dancanet's job was something he lacked experience in: hiring PMs to run the independent pods Cubist is known for. Unlike hiring discretionary stock pickers, who can be up and running in days or weeks, bets on systematic PMs can take years to bear fruit as they assemble the necessary data and infrastructure, research and backtest strategies, and execute trading models. While returns at Cubist, which has doubled head count over the past three years, remained robust in the years after Dancanet joined, a pain point emerged with Cohen: Many of the PMs Dancanet brought in weren't moving the needle, according to people familiar with the matter. Cubist money managers who predated Dancanet generated a disproportionate amount of the returns, according to people familiar. Whether his leadership contributed to or improved the legacy PMs' performance is unclear, but Cohen wanted to see improvement on the disparity. While many PMs dislike micromanaging executives, Dancanet's more laissez-faire leadership style may have given Cohen and top deputies pause, insiders said. Dancanet's contract was up for renewal before the end of the year, and Cohen's team started to quietly explore alternatives. For Point72, Lauprete was a uniquely attractive candidate. At WorldQuant, he oversaw a massive centralized investment process, though the fund also has independent pods. Moreover, Lauprete, who left WorldQuant after 17 years in early 2024, wasn't bound by one of the lengthy noncompete clauses that often sideline quants for years, meaning he could start immediately — minimizing disruption at Cubist. The catch: He had spent considerable time and money preparing the launch of his own fund, Libero Capital. Lauprete initially secured Paloma Partners, the storied hedge fund founded by Donald Sussman in the 1980s, as an anchor investor. The relationship soured, and by April, according to Hedge Fund Alert, Lauprete and Paloma parted ways. Lauprete continued pitching investors through the spring and summer, drawing interest from firms including Engineers Gate, BlackRock, and Blackstone, people familiar said. (Representatives for those firms declined to comment.) He also held an initial meeting with Cubist, including Dancanet, in early summer about having Libero manage a slug of capital. But unbeknownst to Dancanet, discussions continued separately with Point72 leaders and evolved in scope. In early summer, Cubist — like most quant funds — was having a strong year. Systematic long-short funds were up double digits heading into June, according to a Goldman Sachs research report. The central team was profitable, and Dancanet aimed to eventually dedicate half of Cubist's capital to it, people familiar with his plan said. But then the steady, mysterious losses across the quantitative trading industry started to pile up, turning into a two-month bloodbath. Cubist experienced a severe drawdown, suffering its worst stretch since the COVID pandemic in early 2020, but recovered some of those losses, and year-to-date performance remained positive. Unlike setups at some rivals, Cubist isn't a stand-alone fund investors can allocate to with separately reported returns; its performance flows into Point72's overall returns. Point72 recorded gains in July and August and is up 9.7% through September. Point72's under-the-radar search for a potential Cubist successor continued. But while Libero was generating intrigue, capital commitments sufficient for its ambition weren't materializing, sources with knowledge of the matter said. Some investors were wary of the scale and associated costs of a large-scale quant launch as well as the autonomy Lauprete wanted, the people said. Lauprete, who was funding Libero out of his own pocket, was simultaneously interviewing with Point72 executives about the Cubist job, a process kept closely guarded to avoid leaks, one insider said. Dancanet and Cohen discussed contract extensions over the summer without coming to a conclusion. Then, over the first weekend in September, Lauprete and Cohen agreed to terms that would install Lauprete as Cubist president and move Libero under the unit's umbrella, people close to the firm said. Days later, Cohen sent out the memo announcing the leadership change. Cohen convened a short-notice virtual meeting with Cubist PMs the next day, one company insider said, reassuring them that he remained committed to both sides — the pods and the central team — of his hybrid vision for Cubist. Some industry insiders called it an opportunistic fit for both sides: a more seasoned leader for Cubist, and for Lauprete, a chance to land one of Wall Street's most coveted quant jobs while keeping Libero alive, which will join Cubist as an independent pod, people familiar said. He started the role at the beginning of October. The months and years ahead will reveal whether Cohen's leadership shake-up pays off — and whether Lauprete can deliver on the challenge of fusing Cubist's independent pods and central team ambitions into a single machine that churns out industry-beating returns.

Title: Robots May Replace 600,000 Human Employees at Amazon
URL: https://www.cnet.com/tech/robots-may-replace-600000-human-employees-at-amazon/
Time Published: 2025-10-23T09:00:04Z

The retail giant plans to expand its non-human workforce, with the goal of automating 75% of its operations, according to The New York Times. Amazon may use robots to displace warehouse workers in big numbers. Robots have been a staple at Amazon warehouses for more than a decade, performing tasks formerly completed by humans, including picking, sorting and moving packages. Now, Amazon plans to make human labor less necessary in its facilities by replacing more than half a million jobs with robots, The New York Times reports. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. Internal Amazon documents suggest that the company is looking into building and using more robots to replace human workers. The publication doesn't specify if this will result in massive layoffs. However, the robots would allow Amazon to avoid hiring new workers to meet increasing demand, translating to 600,000 jobs replaced by 2033, according to the report. Amazon announced in June that it had hit a workforce milestone of deploying more than 1 million robots in its fulfillment and delivery network, making it about two-thirds the size of the company's human workforce. The Amazon documents show that the company's goal is to automate 75% of its operations, The Times reported. The shift to increase the role of robots in Amazon's warehouse could save the company billions of dollars each year. Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak estimated the annual savings to be as high as $4 billion by 2027, according to a CNBC report. The report also says the company wants to mitigate the fallout in communities that may lose jobs. Documents show the company has considered building an image as a "good corporate citizen" through greater participation in community events such as local parades and Toys for Tots. And the leaked documents discuss avoiding using terms like automation and AI, instead using terms such as "advanced technology," and replacing the word "robot" with "cobot" to suggest collaboration. "Leaked documents often paint an incomplete and misleading picture of our plans, and that's the case here," an Amazon spokesperson told CNET in an email. "In this instance, the materials appear to reflect the perspective of just one team and don't represent our overall hiring strategy across our various operations business lines -- now or moving forward." The spokesperson said "no company has created more jobs in America over the past decade than Amazon" and that the company is actively hiring at operations facilities, with plans to fill 250,000 positions for the holiday season. Amazon is the third biggest employer in the US, behind the federal government and Walmart. To date, the company employs an estimated 1.5 million employees, most of whom work in warehouses or as delivery drivers. Only a handful of companies in the US have more than 600,000 employees on the payroll. Delivery company FedEx has an estimated 550,000 employees. Reducing its size as reported by The Times would be akin to FedEx disappearing entirely. Studies have been done on the impact of robots on human wages. As of 2020, every robot added by a company per 1,000 workers reduces US wages by 0.42% and has cost humans an estimated 400,000 jobs. "Our investments will continue to create substantial employment, emphasizing higher-paying positions," Amazon said in an email. "In particular, and as mentioned in The New York Times story, efficiency gains in one area enable us to invest in other areas -- both existing and entirely new ones -- that create additional value for customers. While it's difficult to predict the future precisely, our track record demonstrates that we've consistently been a major job creator while simultaneously investing in upskilling our workforce for evolving roles."

October 23, 2025 04:44 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Oct. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Fixed Income Assets Management - Global Strategic Business Report" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The global market for Fixed Income Assets Management was valued at US$26.5 Trillion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$36.9 Trillion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 5.7% from 2024 to 2030. This comprehensive report provides an in-depth analysis of market trends, drivers, and forecasts, helping you make informed business decisions.Fixed income assets management plays a pivotal role in ensuring stability and income generation in investment portfolios, particularly during periods of market volatility. Fixed income instruments, such as government bonds, corporate bonds, and treasury securities, provide regular interest payments and principal protection, making them a reliable source of income for conservative investors. These assets are especially important in managing risk within diversified portfolios, as they typically perform inversely to equities during market downturns. Institutional investors, including pension funds, insurance companies, and wealth managers, heavily rely on fixed income management to meet their long-term financial obligations. In addition, the ability of fixed income strategies to generate consistent returns makes them appealing to retirees and income-focused investors.How Is the Fixed Income Market Segmented?Key asset types include government bonds, municipal bonds, corporate bonds, and mortgage-backed securities. Each type offers different risk profiles, returns, and tax benefits. Issuers vary from government entities and municipalities to corporations, with sovereign bonds generally considered the safest due to their government backing. Geographically, North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific lead in terms of market size, with emerging markets offering higher yields but carrying additional risks. Investment strategies are tailored to client needs, ranging from conservative income generation to more aggressive strategies that seek to capitalize on market opportunities in high-yield or emerging market debt.What Technological Advancements Are Impacting Fixed Income Assets Management?Technological innovations are transforming fixed income management by enhancing trade execution, portfolio management, and risk assessment. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms is enabling asset managers to analyze vast datasets, identify trends, and make more informed investment decisions. The adoption of electronic trading platforms has improved liquidity and transparency in bond markets, providing faster and more efficient trade execution. In addition, big data analytics are helping managers assess market risks more accurately, while fintech solutions are streamlining compliance and reporting processes. These technological advancements are helping asset managers optimize portfolio performance and adapt to a rapidly changing market environment.What Factors Are Driving Growth in the Fixed Income Assets Management Market?The growth in the fixed income assets management market is driven by several factors, including rising demand for income-generating investments, increasing institutional allocations to bonds, and the growing popularity of sustainable and ESG-linked fixed income products. The aging global population is driving demand for fixed income assets as retirees seek stable income streams to fund their retirement. Moreover, heightened geopolitical uncertainties and economic volatility are pushing investors toward safe-haven assets like government bonds. Technological advancements in AI and data analytics are also improving the precision and efficiency of fixed income strategies, while the growing focus on green bonds and ESG considerations is expanding the market for socially responsible investments.Report ScopeThe report analyzes the Fixed Income Assets Management market, presented in terms of market value (USD).

Title: NZ sharemarket lifts as Skellerup update builds confidence - Market close

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Skellerup's share price lifted on Thursday after reporting an earnings lift of 10% in the first quarter. Photo / Supplied The New Zealand sharemarket closed up on Thursday, driven by the exchange’s largest companies and positive market updates from Skellerup and Vista Group. The S&P/NZX 50 Index closed up 0.53% or 70.662 points to 13,377.10 after 43.6 million shares worth $146.8 million were traded. The S&P/NZX 20 index was up 0.43%, closing at 7673.63 points, while the S&P/NZX 10 index ended the day at 12,761.47 after rising 0.58%. There were 84 gainers on the main board and 61 decliners. Craigs Investment Partners investment director Mark Lister said the market was up after a “mixed bag” of lead-ins from overseas. “It does feel like markets have maybe just run into a few minor headwinds after a strong period,” Lister said. “We’re certainly outperforming other markets in the region. Aussies are up, but much less than us. The Nikkei in Japan is down a little over 1%, obviously the S&P500 was off slightly off a little bit overnight, while the UK was one of the few markets to be up. So most international markets are off a little bit.” Skellerup Holdings held its annual general meeting on Thursday, with the rubber manufacturer’s earnings lifting by 10% in the first quarter of 2026. The business said demand for its products was robust and called out dairy and infrastructure as notable contributors. “$55 million to $60 million midpoint is in line with where analysts were expecting. The stock is up because it’s a bit of confirmation that analysts weren’t off the mark.” “You could have expected their guidance to be a little soft because of the tariff impact, but they’re managing to absorb that tariff hit and still making decent results, which is great to see.” Skellerup’s share price lifted 1.36% or 7c to $5.20 after 144,980 shares changed hands on turnover worth $754,035.08. Elsewhere, Vista Group gave a third-quarter update, advising that despite the box office experiencing some softness, year-on-year revenue growth continued. Vista Group’s share price rallied 7.03%, up 18c to $2.74. Heartland Group lifted 3c to $1.09 after trading on high volume, with 1.7m shares changing hands on turnover worth $1.8m. Scales Corporation lifted 2.88% or 17c to $6.07, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare lifted 2.14% or 75c to $35.75, while Meridian Energy fell 0.84% or 5c to $5.93. Lister said analysts and investors were keeping a close eye on the next 10 days, which will feature the latest data on US inflation, as well as results from five of the “magnificent seven”: Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta. Gold prices sank further on Wednesday while major stock markets mostly fell following some disappointing corporate earnings amid lingering worries over trade tensions. Major US indices fell, with the Dow retreating from a record the prior day, as lacklustre results from Netflix added to angst that upcoming reports from other tech giants may also fall short. “Any time you’ve got stocks that are priced with high expectations, if you’re not meeting those expectations, then the market is going to struggle with that,” said Dave Grecsek, a partner at wealth management firm Aspirant. More broadly, the market is wondering if “we are overextended here in this artificial intelligence trade”, he added. Most European equity indices also fell following declines in leading Asian markets earlier. Tom Raynel is a multimedia business journalist for the Herald, covering small business, retail and tourism.

Title: Tesla stock price continues to show resilience despite sales ‘falling off a cliff’

A Tesla dealership. Photo: Getty In the stock market’s rarefied air where mega-cap technology behemoths reside, Tesla stands out – but for all the wrong reasons. Chief among them is its stunning lack of earnings growth while its stock price continues to soar. The Elon Musk-led electric vehicle-maker was expected to post a 25pc drop in third-quarter profits from a year ago when it reports earnings yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The decline is nothing new, as Tesla’s results have been in retreat for multiple years. What is notable, however, is the way Tesla shares have been impervious to the drop, more than doubling in the past 12 months. It’s a tribute to Mr Musk’s success in turning investors’ attention away from selling EVs and toward his vision of an artificial intelligence company focused on self-driving cars and humanoid robots. The stock was down 0.5pc in early trading yesterday. “The Tesla story is never really about the current quarter, but rather the broader expectations that it can keep innovating and pivoting to the future,” said Daniel Newman, chief executive officer of the technology research and advisory firm the Futurum Group. This hope for the future while discounting the present has taken Tesla’s market valuation to dizzying heights. The shares trade at a whopping 195 times expected earnings over the next 12 months as of Tuesday’s close, up from less then 80 times in April. It’s the fourth most-expensive stock in the S&P 500 Index, trailing only Warner Bros Discovery, Palantir Technologies and Boeing. The company’s valuation is head and shoulders above its peers in the Magnificent Seven: Alphabet, Amazon.com, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Nvidia. The Bloomberg Magnificent Seven Index trades roughly 33 times expected earnings as of Tuesday’s close. After Tesla, the next highest valuation in the group belongs to Apple at just over 32 times. Tesla’s problem is that right now it’s a company that manufactures cars, trucks, solar panels and energy storage systems. Its AI vision is years, if not decades, away from generating sales, much less profits. So EVs are the primary way the company can bring in the cash required for its AI investments. And that business is facing slowing demand as the Trump administration pulls federal incentives that had encouraged EV adoption, such as a $7,500 (€6,450) tax credit for buying EVs that expired in September. After Tesla’s plan to sell cheaper EVs was largely met with a shrug, analysts say Tesla’s sales may start to crater this month. Its fourth-quarter deliveries are expected to be around 425,000, according to Barclays analyst Dan Levy. “Fourth-quarter sales don’t look good,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Steve Man. “Falling off a cliff is probably a good way to characterise it.” Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: What we know about the donors funding the White House ballroom
URL: https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donors-funding-white-house-ballroom/story?id=126778550
Time Published: 2025-10-23T03:10:42Z
Full Content:
A White House dinner about the project included many tech and crypto companies. While the Trump administration has yet to release a full list of donors contributing to the planned construction of a White House ballroom, a picture of potential donors and companies funding the project is beginning to emerge. President Donald Trump again reiterated in the Oval Office on Wednesday afternoon that the ballroom is being "paid for 100% by me and some friends of mine," referencing donors. "The government is paying absolutely nothing." Trump also appeared to increase the cost estimate by $50-$100 million, telling reporters during his remarks on Wednesday the price tag for the new venue was "about $300 million" -- more than the $200-$250 million estimates previously given. Earlier this month, the Trump administration released a list of people and companies who were expected to attend a dinner at the White House about the construction project. While no full list of donors has been released, the names of some companies scheduled to attend the dinner released by the White House largely come from the tech and crypto industries, including Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta and Microsoft, along with Coinbase, Ripple and Tether. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, two tech and cryptocurrency investors, were also on the list. Some companies have already reaped lucrative contracts during Trump's second term, including Microsoft and Google which landed contracts for their AI and cloud tools, while Amazon Web Services received potentially up to $1 billion in cloud-credit incentives. The crypto industry at large has seen major benefits under Trump through policies and executive orders, with Trump's own family amassing billions through crypto ventures during his second term. Other companies, like Palantir and Lockheed Martin, have billions in contracts with the Trump administration, including the Defense Department. "We're also working with the military on it because they want to make sure everything is perfect," Trump said Wednesday evening of the ballroom construction project. "And the military is very much involved in this. They want to make sure everything is absolutely beautiful." While the White House has not been transparent about how exactly the project will be paid through donations, the money appears to be going to the project in different ways. For example, according to court documents, Google's parent Alphabet noted in a recent legal settlement reached with Trump after he was banned from YouTube following Jan. 6, 2021, that it would be contributing $22 million to help build the White House ballroom. The settlement noted that the $22 million will be contributed on Trump's behalf "to the Trust for the National Mall, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt entity dedicated to restoring, preserving, and elevating the National Mall, to support the construction of the White House State Ballroom." Paolo Tiramani, CEO of a construction company and a donor on the White House list, donated $10 million in stock to the Trust for the National Mall, his company confirmed in a statement. Donations for the ballroom are made to the Trust for the National Mall, a nonprofit that supports the National Park Service and is dedicated to the restoration of the National Mall and the White House and Presidents Park. The financial director of Trump's 2024 campaign, Meredith O'Rourke, is leading the donor effort for the ballroom, sources told ABC News. The Trust's role in the project is to manage donations while the National Park Service and the White House are leading the design and construction. The renovation project is more extensive than Trump had previously let on. A preservation group has asked the White House to pause the ballroom project, but the White House expects the entire East Wing to be demolished as soon as this weekend as part of the renovation. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

You might know Dollar Tree stores are small for a good reason — it helps the company keep operating costs down. The stores then pass those savings on to consumers in the form of lower prices in hopes of keeping their shoppers coming back. Although the quality of some dollar store products is questionable, you can find some legitimately good deals if you know what to look for. Considering Americans' spending on Christmas and the holidays is expected to exceed $890 per person in 2025, according to the National Retail Foundation, cutting corners where you can isn't a bad idea. Save some money now by doing a bit of early holiday shopping at your local Dollar Tree. We've put together a list of the best deals at Dollar Tree for the month of October, all of which cost $5 or less per item. You can also shop online at Dollar Tree's website, though you may have to purchase some of these items in bulk which could drive up the total price. But if you have a Dollar Tree nearby, keep reading for the best ways to save. After the excitement of Halloween ends, all the candy is consumed, and the weather starts to turn cooler, kids might need some quieter activities they can do indoors. The Crayola Children's Painting Kit features a character's outline on a sheet of paper. The child can then use the included containers of watercolor paint to color the drawing. Each kit costs $1.75 at Dollar Tree. If you order online, you'll have to buy 20 kits for $35, which could make them a solid party favor or stocking stuffer for all the young kids in your life. The characters featured in the kits are all well-known figures from Disney and Marvel, including Stitch, Minnie Mouse, Spider-Man, and Super Kitties, so there's a good chance the kids will be excited to see them. Each kit contains a brush and four small paint containers, and the colors included depend on the selected character. Minnie Mouse has light yellow, light green, light pink, and hot pink paints, while Stitch has blue, yellow, red, and white paint containers. The instructions also reveal how you can make even more colors by mixing paints. Each kit is recommended for children ages 4 and higher. Whether you like wearing low-cut socks for physical activities or as a simple finishing touch on a formal outfit, you might appreciate having them on hand in significant quantities. When you have low-cut socks in abundance, you don't have to worry as much about getting caught short if your only pair wears thin or ends up with holes. Dollar Tree can help you build out your collection with a pack of 20 Women's Black Athletic Low-Cut Socks (10 pairs) that cost $3 per pack (or 30 cents per pair). If you buy them online, you'll have to buy a quantity of 12 packs — or 120 pairs — which will set you up for quite a while. The socks are made for women with shoe sizes between 5 and 9. Each sock consists of 98% polyester and 2% spandex. "They're thin, breathable, [and] washable athletic socks," said one Dollar Tree reviewer who buys the socks for their own use and donates them to food banks. Some Dollar Tree kitchen items are so affordable, you might not believe the savings. Even better, you can actually buy some well-known household brand name kitchen products at Dollar Tree. One such item that is both inexpensive and features a brand name is the Rubbermaid TakeAlongs Storage Bowls With Lids, which cost $1.50 for a pack of two bowls and lids. If you buy them online, you'll have to purchase a minimum of 12 packs, getting you 24 bowls and lids total, for $18. Each container can hold about three cups of food, which is perfect for sharing cookies and other holiday goodies with neighbors and friends without overdoing it. The container uses transparent plastic with a red lid. Rubbermaid is well-known for having reusable glass and plastic food containers, some of which are made for dozens of uses. You can wash and reuse these TakeAlongs products, too, but they'll need replacing if they show signs of visible wear. According to Dollar Tree's website, they are BPA-free, and safe to put in the microwave and dishwasher. If you're tired of the various marks and scratches that show up in plastic cutting boards, you may want to consider switching to a more durable, sustainable material. Bamboo cutting boards deliver this benefit, serving as a renewable material with a slightly rustic look to class up your kitchen. Bamboo is considered a renewable resource because it is a woody grass that multiplies and grows quickly, unlike trees. Cooking Concepts Bamboo Cutting Boards cost $1.25 apiece at Dollar Tree. And while online shoppers will need to buy a minimum of 24 boards, that still comes out to just $30. Each board measures 6.7 by 9.8 inches, which is large enough to chop all kinds of food while small enough to fit easily in a drawer or cupboard. While they're not dishwasher safe, they are versatile: In addition to making a great chopping surface, they also make the perfect platform for serving hors d'oeuvres. One Dollar Tree customer even used a laser machine to cut words and graphics into the surface to give them as custom gifts. If you love the idea of giving homemade gifts at the holidays, Dollar Tree and other dollar stores can give you a bargain on the starting point for the materials for many different craft projects. For many people, creating DIY snow globes is a favorite crafty holiday tradition. In addition to using them as homemade, personalized gifts, you can use the snow globes for affordable decorations around your house. With winter fast approaching, why not start on these projects a couple of months before the holidays arrive? Although some people use mason jars with lids to create homemade snow globes, Dollar Tree has products available that give you the traditional globe shape and the base to hold the globe upright. Dollar Tree's DIY Customizable Holiday Snow Globe Decorations cost $1.50 each. If you're shopping online, you'll have to buy 24 of them for a total of $36, and each clear globe measures almost 4 inches in diameter. When the base is attached, the unit measures 4.25 inches in height. Then, all you need is glitter, glycerine, water, and some tiny figurines to create the snow globe of your dreams. "Great for what I need it for," says one Dollar Tree customer reviewer. "Just the right size and not cheaply made."

Title: DoorDash Finally Found a Way to Stop Paying Its Workers For Good

Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily. Throughout 2025, via political donations and not-so-subtle business moves, DoorDash has been showing the millions of gig workers who make its multibillion-dollar business viable that it’s willing to spend far more to undermine their rights than to compensate them fairly—and it may soon replace them entirely with driverless vehicles. Last week, the United States’ largest food-delivery platform announced it was kickstarting a partnership with the autonomous vehicle brand Waymo—a subsidiary of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, that’s come closer than any other Silicon Valley firm to realizing the longtime tech dream of the safe self-driving automobile. Phoenix, one of the five cities where Waymo actually operates, will be the urban laboratory for home deliveries of food, groceries, and other goods from participating retailers via driverless car. In Los Angeles and San Francisco, two of the other metropolises that have welcomed Waymo, subscribers to the $10-a-month DashPass can earn a $10 discount off one Waymo ride every month. L.A. shoppers can also get “last-10-feet” front-yard service thanks to DoorDash’s new alliance with Serve Robotics, best known as the startup behind all those boxy, four-wheeled delivery bots that have appeared on John Mulaney’s talk show, collided with disabled Californians, and been attacked by displeased hooligans for TikTok #content. Our riders trust @Waymo to travel safely. Partnering with @DoorDash expands that trust, offering another way for customers to make Waymo part of their daily routines. https://t.co/DjNT6MgPiH DoorDash is wasting no time bringing more of its customers up close to a self-propelled, tip-free delivery economy—and reconfiguring the system so more money ends up in their corporate coffers than in any human clients’ pockets. (It’s not for nothing that the Waymo-Phoenix experiment will initially service DoorDash’s own store, DashMart, and its self-branded network of inventory houses.) Earlier this month, OpenAI announced that ChatGPT will soon integrate DoorDash’s digital functions within the generative-text bot itself, allowing users to place orders without having to abandon their virtual partner for even a minute. Late last month, DoorDash rolled out its own delivery-robot model, Dot, in the streets of metro Phoenix as a test for a “hybrid” structure: Human “Dashers” cart orders over the long haul, then hand those wares to Dot so it can wheel up to your front porch, its heart-eyes aglow. That’s all on top of DoorDash’s springtime expansion of a sidewalk-robot delivery fleet manufactured by Coco Robotics, its summertime plans to invest further into A.I.-powered ad tech, and its barely year-old drone delivery program in the Dallas–Fort Worth region. The straightforward conclusion is that DoorDash and its investors are ready to automate every function of this newly profitable, still-independent tech juggernaut that’s grown large enough to swallow up international platforms like the British delivery outfit Deliveroo—even if the side effect is A.I.-generated food images. (The publicly traded company’s stock value has grown by nearly 60 percent throughout the year.) But to understand why the strategy is to get to wholesale human replacement instead of merely supplementing Dasher labor, look to the other realm where DoorDash has been speaking with its profits. There’s been no shortage of national chatter around New York City’s mayoral race. But even before the pro-labor, anti-gig-economy Zohran Mamdani leapt to broader fame, DoorDash had helped push election expenditures in the city’s primaries to record levels, in order to stop him and other like-minded politicos. First, in May, the company donated $1 million to Fix the City, a political action committee formed to support former Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s political return. Committing a $5 million chest to NYC’s Democratic Party primaries and forming its own super PAC (called Local Economies Forward), DoorDash also shoveled cash into various City Council races and tried to boost the council speaker’s laggard challenge to Cuomo and Mamdani. All the while, it’s deployed a beefed-up lobbying army to City Hall in opposition to the labor rights won on behalf of New York’s deliverers, rideshare drivers, and other gig workers—as well as the added protections and guarantees being considered for passage. (Right now, DoorDash and other tech-economy giants like Uber are yelping at the Council over a pending bill that demands a just-cause process before locking a worker out of their account; after Seattle passed a similar bill in July, DoorDash geofenced a “Seattle fee” surcharge that bled out into the surrounding towns.) The years since the pandemic fueled a major political shift in the perception of gig workers, especially those in large cities like New York. While tens of thousands delivery workers (many of them immigrants) kept working outside amid a public health shutdown and got hailed as essential workers, the NYC Council became more attuned to these deliverers’ concerns, whether they worked for DoorDash, Uber Eats, Instacart, or some other booming gig market. (Delivery robots also gained more attention around this time, though they were hardly up to the task.) Through a series of high-profile protests and rallies, deliverers informed customers that they were getting stiffed on pay, and they did not have durable insurance to cover accidents, robberies, injuries, and physical attacks. From 2021 onward, New York lawmakers began passing bills that required gig-delivery apps to stop hitting their drivers with surprise fees and make their tipping policies more transparent, while mandating third-party client restaurants to allow these workers bathroom access. In 2023, the City Council set a new, higher minimum wage for restaurant delivery workers, the first of its kind in the entire country; because the law left out grocery-delivery apps in a misstep that became known as the “Instacart loophole,” council members have now been working to extend that basic compensation to those left out of the first round. (It didn’t hurt the cause that Instacart executives were caught on tape explicitly bragging about hoarding profits by “squeezing” deliverers, usually by “batching” separate orders in bulk in order to tamp down compensation opportunities.) So, as these protections took effect in New York and spread to other areas like Seattle and Massachusetts, the likes of Uber, DoorDash, and Instacart attempted to strike back by forming and funding new lobbying groups and PACs, which produced ads that made it seem like not giving their workers basic rights would preserve their “flexibility,” benefiting them and their local economies. Having successfully denied deliverers employee-level benefits in California by promoting a 2020 “independent contractor” ballot initiative, these gig apps have been replicating the approach elsewhere, to much less success. (New York City Mayor Eric Adams vetoed a recent spate of gig-work legislation that was publicly opposed by DoorDash, but the council overrode him.) Most stinging of all for DoorDash is that, even outside of the laws, they’ve had to spend more on their New York workers. In February, it settled a tip-theft lawsuit from New York state Attorney General Letitia James (incidentally, the woman who investigated Cuomo out of the governor’s mansion) by compensating Dashers a cumulative $17 million. Last year, DoorDash had to settle another case from James that alleged discrimination against deliverer applicants with criminal histories, forcing the company to review bids from thousands of rejected wannabe-Dashers and to pay them a total of $75,000. These settlements were not very remunerative for the people affected by DoorDash’s practices; the 2024 agreement paid out just an average of $25 per rejected applicant. But the message from DoorDash’s spirited lobbying is that even these tiny sums are too costly as expenses for human capital. (Its partnership with the Swedish buy-now-pay-later platform Klarna makes for even worse optics, considering the latter’s CEO has frequently boasted about slashing thousands of positions thanks to A.I.) The platform doesn’t appear to be too concerned with how much its Dashers earn, and when. So when your lobbying efforts fail and you have to give your workers more thanks to new laws and court settlements, what do you try next? You tighten the squeeze, mostly by adding all sorts of extra fees for consumers, under the specious claim that it’s actually going to drivers. Despite the messaging that better pay for workers makes everything more expensive, fewer people are falling for the talking point. Members of Congress have probed DoorDash over alleged “junk fees” and price gouging, and disaffected customers have filed Federal Trade Commission complaints along with class-action suits. In Illinois, one state lawmaker has proposed a regionwide “tax” on DoorDash and Uber deliveries that would help fund a beleaguered public transit system. So it’s little wonder that DoorDash, at a moment when its anti-worker crusades have had little return, is looking to autonomous vehicles, whether those are slick self-driving cars or meme-ready boxy cartons, in order to ramp up the human squeeze. It’s just following in the vein of fellow tech giants like Amazon, which is hoping to discard all the union drives and complaints from warehouse staffers, gig drivers, and fulfillment-center franchisees by automating up to 75 percent of its operations, according to internal documents obtained by the New York Times. That may not go as well as DoorDash may think, however. Despite Waymo’s undeniable success, it’s also facing a Trump administration probe over the failure of its cars to safely and properly handle the presence of the school buses with which it shares the road; reluctance from other big cities to fully embrace Waymo and Serve Robotics just yet; and the so far persistent costliness of human-free Waymo vehicles compared with long-standing rideshare companies, which have also become more expensive in recent years. (There’s also the issue of what happens when a Waymo car collides with a Saymo bot in a city that’s taken in both.) DoorDash hopes that bots won’t ask for the rights and wages now afforded to many urban delivery workers, but it may not be able to beat the simple human urge for real-life connection, even if it’s mediated through an app. Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.

Title: Tesla Posts Return to Revenue Growth, Though Q3 Profits Miss Estimates

Full Content:
Tesla returned to revenue growth in the third quarter as buyers rushed to take advantage of expiring tax credits. The electric vehicle maker's revenue climbed 12% year-over-year to $28.1 billion, topping analysts' expectations, in the wake of President Donald Trump's signature "One Big Beautiful Bill." Tesla (TSLA) said its vehicle deliveries reached a record high globally, showing "growth across all regions." That followed two straight quarters of decline as a backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political activities weighed on sales. A strong run of EV deliveries, many in response to the expiration of U.S. tax credits, helped power better-than-expected revenue at Tesla in the latest quarter. Enthusiasm about next-generation businesses like robots and robotaxis have pulled the stock into the black for 2025, but wariness about the car business may partly explain why it's among the lower-performing Magnificent 7 stocks this year. However, Tesla's adjusted earnings per share of $0.50 missed the consensus estimate of $0.54 compiled by Visible Alpha. The company said it faced higher costs from restructuring and investments in AI. The company in a shareholder letter said its Cybercab, semi truck and Megapack 3 battery products were "on schedule" for production at volume next year, adding that it was also installing production lines for its Optimus robots. Shares of Tesla, the first Magnificent 7 company to report third-quarter results, were down more than 1% in extended trading following the late-Wednesday release. They were up roughly 9% for 2025 through today's close, after spending much of the year in negative territory. Tesla has underperformed every Magnificent 7 stock so far this year except Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN), the latter which is the only one in the red for 2025. It's also lagged the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) along with the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq. This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect share price movement and add new information and context.

October 22, 2025 16:30 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA LONG BEACH, Calif., Oct. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced the clearance of their Systems Integration Review (SIR) and completion of their Photon spacecraft for Eta Space and NASA’s LOXSAT mission. LOXSAT is an on-orbit technology demonstration of a cryogenic fluid management system, that will inform the design of Cryo-Dock, a full-scale cryogenic propellant depot in low Earth orbit to be operational in 2030. The SIR, completed in September, marked a key milestone for the program, allowing the team to proceed with payload integration. Rocket Lab will now move the mission into environmental testing – the next phase before its launch on Electron in early 2026. Rocket Lab was selected in 2020 by Eta Space to provide both the spacecraft and its Electron launch vehicle for the LOXSAT mission, joining a growing list of spacecraft-plus-launch mission solutions supported by the Company, including the CAPSTONE lunar mission for NASA and the upcoming VICTUS HAZE mission for the U.S. Space Force. Rocket Lab’s end-to-end capabilities simplify mission execution and minimize cost and schedule risks, providing customers with a single, responsive space solutions partner for a wide range of mission objectives. “We're proud to be both the spacecraft and launch provider for LOXSAT and for the opportunity to show Rocket Lab’s true end-to-end space systems capabilities,” said Brad Clevenger, Vice President of Space Systems. “With LOXSAT, we’re supporting a critical technology demonstration that will enable key steps toward making orbital propellant depots a reality. The ability to refuel in space is fundamental to unlocking reusable and sustainable exploration beyond Earth’s orbit. With the spacecraft build and payload integration complete, our team is focused on environmental testing ahead of its launch on Electron.” “We are excited to reach this milestone”, said Bill Notardonato, CEO of Eta Space. “We chose Rocket Lab as a launch provider based on their proven Electron rocket and the chance to have a dedicated launch to our exact orbit on our schedule. But their spacecraft experience and payload hosting services have proven to be just as valuable as launch services for our project success.” Despite being one of the most efficient and energetic propellants for spacecraft, cryogenic propellants can vaporize as temperature rises, causing critical loss on orbit. LOXSAT will test the ability to store liquid oxygen (LOX) in a zero-loss configuration, with the goal of creating a larger scale model in the future that could serve as a commercial cryogenic propellant depot in space. This would enable reuse and refueling of spacecraft on orbit. The basis of the spacecraft is the Company’s Photon platform, which gained flight heritage in 2022 with NASA’s CAPSTONE mission to the Moon. LOXSAT was designed and built using Rocket Lab’s vertically integrated components and systems, including star trackers, propulsion systems, reaction wheels, solar panels, flight software, radios, composite structures, tanks, separation systems, and more. The spacecraft was produced and will undergo environmental testing at the Company’s Spacecraft Production Complex and headquarters in Long Beach, California, and will ultimately be launched from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand. The LOXSAT mission is sponsored by NASA’s Tipping Point program that aims to advance technologies that could support human space exploration in the future.

Title: Google's mission to flatten its management structure has reached its ads division, an internal memo reveals

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Google is once again stripping back management layers, this time by flattening teams in its core US ad sales unit, Business Insider has learned. US employees in the Google Customer Solutions (GCS) division were informed last month that several changes to the leadership structure would take effect in January, in a memo sent by its vice president, John Nicoletti. This latest restructuring shows how even the most profitable corners of Big Tech are moving to run leaner and faster. Google's ad business, which still accounts for the bulk of its revenue, is flattening management layers to speed up decisions and reduce bureaucracy as growth slows and competition from AI-driven rivals intensifies. In an all-hands meeting in August, Google leaders told staff that the company had reduced the number of managers overseeing small teams by 35% over the previous year. The changes inside GCS, which serves midsize advertisers, reflect a wider trend across the tech industry: the end of cushy managerial hierarchies in a cost-conscious era. One change will be to remove the layer of "Managers of Managers," or MoMs, across several teams, Nicoletti said in the memo, which was reviewed by Business Insider. No layoffs were mentioned in the email, which said the affected employees would move into other roles. The exact number of manager roles being removed could not be learned "Unlocking our next stage of growth means building our team strategy and structure for the long term," Nicoletti wrote. A Google spokesperson confirmed the changes to Business Insider. "Our teams have continued to make changes to operate more efficiently, remove layers, and better serve our customers," the spokesperson said. Nicoletti said the changes in ad sales in January would "Empower our teams, with a focus on agility to accelerate decision-making, and keeping leadership close to the work by simplifying our organizational structure." Ad sales is a critical part of Google's business, and GCS — which focuses on midsize clients — is the central engine. In the September memo to staff, Nicoletti described GCS as "managing a portfolio the size of a Fortune 100 company." As part of the upcoming January changes for GCS, Nicoletti said all managers across select teams would become "Heads of business" and report directly to directors with no management layer in between. This would include removing a layer within its mid-market sales group — a role known as account strategy management — that previously stood between account executives and managers, and the heads of business. He also told staff that Google would reopen account executive roles "to continue investing in capacity for deep customer partnerships." "One of the reasons that we've been so successful is that we're outstanding at driving momentum through continuous change," Nicoletti wrote. "This will be no different." Google is not alone in reducing management layers. In recent years, tech giants such as Intel, Amazon, and Microsoft have also flattened their management structures in an effort to become more efficient. GCS was the only division mentioned in Nicoletti's memo, but it's not the only team in ad sales. It also has teams working on Large Customer Sales (LCS), which focus on the biggest and most complex customers. In January 2024, Google's chief business officer, Philipp Schindler, told staff that GCS would become the "core channel for scaling growth" as the company pared back teams on LCS.

Title: AWS Outage That Took Down Internet Came After Amazon Fired Tons of Workers in Favor of AI
URL: http://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/aws-outage-amazon-fired-workers-ai
Time Published: 2025-10-22T19:23:33Z

By Frank Landymore Published Oct 22, 2025 3:23 PM EDT When Amazon Web Services suffered an outage on Monday morning, it practically took down the internet with it. There went all of Amazon’s services, from its shopping hub to its Ring doorbell cameras. ChatGPT went quiet. “Smart” mattresses became unsleepable. Video games like Fortnite blinked out, as did platforms like Snapchat and banking apps. An even greater source of alarm was how long it took to fix the outage. Issues related to the crash were first reported at 3:11 AM EST. Three hours later, the AWS dashboard said the underlying issue had been “fully mitigated.” But it wouldn’t be until 6:53 PM that Amazon announced that all its services were returned to “normal operations.” Over half a day had passed, causing an estimated billions of dollars in lost productivity. The cause was blamed on a DNS resolution issue. DNS, or the Domain Name System, translates URLs like “Amazon.com” into IP addresses, acting as a sort of phonebook — using a common analogy — that lets everything connect online. But if the phone numbers are outdated or wrong, then you’re screwed, and you have a resolution issue on your hands. Amazon has suffered major AWS outages before. But the timing and impact of this one comes just months after an eyebrow-raising personnel decision by the e-commerce giant. In July, its cloud computing unit cut at least hundreds of jobs — and perhaps more — following a warning from CEO Andy Jassy that the adoption of generative AI would lead to layoffs. “As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,” Jassy said in a note to employees in June, per Reuters. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.” It remains unclear which roles were affected by the layoffs. But if Amazon is relying on AI to pick up the slack in the wake of the AWS layoffs, it could be a stunning example of how efforts to replace human employees with unreliable AI tools and AI agents have backfired. Technical jobs are some of the most targeted for AI replacement amid the rise of AI coding assistants. Even titans like Google and Microsoft, who can easily afford to pay exorbitant salaries to attract armies’ worth of top talent, are using the tech to get an edge. Twenty-five percent of Google’s new code is written with AI, according to CEO Sundar Pichai; Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella claims at his company this figure is nearly a third. While AI may speed up workflows — and the jury’s still out on that premise, with several studies, including ones focused on programming tasks, finding that it actually slows them down — one thing it most certainly does not bring to the table is experience. In a writeup for The Register, Corey Quinn, a cloud computing expert and author of the “Last Week in AWS” newsletter, blasted Amazon for what he saw as a clear dearth of veteran knowhow at AWS amid the outage, scrutinizing the layoffs at the company. “They legitimately did not know what was breaking for a patently absurd length of time,” wrote Quinn. “You can hire a bunch of very smart people who will explain how DNS works at a deep technical level,” Quinn continued, “but the one thing you can’t hire for is the person who remembers that when DNS starts getting wonky, check that seemingly unrelated system in the corner, because it has historically played a contributing role to some outages of yesteryear.” “When that tribal knowledge departs, you’re left having to reinvent an awful lot of in-house expertise,” Quinn wrote. “This doesn’t impact your service reliability — until one day it very much does, in spectacular fashion. I suspect that day is today.” More on Amazon: Oops!

Title: What Happens if Paramount Acquires Warner Bros. Discovery? HBO Max-Paramount+ Combination, Huge Layoffs and More

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Warner Bros. Discovery is officially on the block, disclosing that it has received interest from “multiple parties” to acquire all or part of the company and that its board is reviewing various options. WBD didn’t say so, but David Ellison’s freshly merged Paramount Skydance is one of the bidders making a serious play for the media conglomerate. Needless to say, such a deal would represent major consolidation in the industry. It would pool Warner Bros. and Paramount Pictures, two of Hollywood’s most storied studios, along with their large content libraries. On the TV side, it would bring Paramount’s CBS broadcast, MTV, Comedy Central and BET together with HBO, TNT, TBS, Discovery Channel, HGTV, Food Network and more from WBD — with CNN and CBS News likely under one umbrella. And a merged Paramount-Warner Bros. Discovery would be expected to fuse HBO Max and Paramount+ into a supercharged streaming service. Related Stories Music Industry Moves: Melanie C of the Spice Girls Partners With Virgin Music Group for New Releases Music Industry Moves: Kid Harpoon Named First Producer in Residence at Abbey Road Studios Of course, a Paramount-WBD merger would undoubtedly include a massive tranche of layoffs, as a union of the two conglomerates would reduce corporate overhead and would consolidate functions across studios, TV and streaming operations. Note that Ellison and his team are expected to begin mass layoffs at Paramount Skydance the week of Oct. 27, eliminating around 2,000 jobs in the U.S. with additional cuts internationally. As of the end of 2024, Warner Bros. Discovery had approximately 35,000 employees, including full- and part-time workers; Paramount Global had 18,600 at the end of last year but has made additional layoffs since then. Popular on Variety There’s no guarantee Ellison and his financial partners (which include his mega-billionaire dad, Larry Ellison) will clinch a deal for Warner Bros. Discovery. WBD has rejected three offers from the Paramount team, including the latest one for nearly $24/share that comprised 80% cash, CNBC reported Wednesday. WBD is in the midst of splitting itself into two companies: Warner Bros., housing its streaming and studios businesses, and Discovery Global, with most of WBD’s TV business, a deal projected to be completed by April 2026. Other companies rumored to be interested in Warner Bros. Discovery assets — most likely the Warner Bros. entity with HBO Max and without the rest of the TV networks — include Comcast (which itself is unloading the bulk of NBCUniversal’s TV biz into a new company, Versant), as well as Amazon and Netflix. On Netflix’s earnings interview Tuesday, co-CEO Ted Sarandos said the company has “no interest in owning legacy media networks,” indicating a Netflix bid for WBD in its entirety is off the table; he also said Netflix can be “choosy” with M&A and said it evaluates all potential deals “relative to the price, relative to the opportunity cost, and relative to other alternatives.” Among the options it is evaluating, Warner Bros. Discovery said it would consider a deal structure under which it would sell Warner Bros. (streaming and studios) alongside a spin-off of Discovery Global to shareholders. “It’s no surprise that the significant value of our portfolio is receiving increased recognition by others in the market,” David Zaslav, Warner Bros. Discovery’s CEO, said in a prepared statement Tuesday. “After receiving interest from multiple parties, we have initiated a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to identify the best path forward to unlock the full value of our assets.” It’s a bit of déjà vu: WBD’s Zaslav and Paramount Global’s then-CEO Bob Bakish had met to discuss the possibility of a merger in late 2023 (before the Skydance takeover). But those talks didn’t progress, and Skydance ended up closing on the deal for Paramount. The future of Warner Bros. Discovery is currently up in the air. But given that Ellison and his financial partners might be able to put together an offer WBD can’t refuse, here’s what a combined Paramount Skydance-WBD would look like. Warner Bros. is home to the DC Universe and Harry Potter film franchises, while Paramount’s portfolio includes Star Trek, Mission: Impossible and Top Gun. WBD’s Studios business includes the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group (comprising Warner Bros. Pictures, New Line Cinema and Warner Bros. Pictures Animation), DC Studios and DC Comics Publishing, Warner Bros. Television Group, as well as consumer products, themed entertainment and brand licensing, home entertainment and interactive gaming. Hits in 2025 for the studios biz, in a rebound from recent years, have included James Gunn’s “Superman,” “A Minecraft Movie,” Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan’s “Sinners,” “Final Destination Bloodlines,” Brad Pitt’s “F1: The Movie,” and “Weapons.” In 2024, the studios segment’s highlights were “Dune: Part Two,” “Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice” and “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire” on the film side, and “Abbott Elementary,” “Shrinking” and “The Voice” on the TV side. Paramount Pictures’ results for the second quarter of 2025 were lifted by Tom Cruise’s “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning,” which set a franchise record for the biggest global opening in theaters and grossed nearly $600 million at the global box office. The studio’s franchises include “The Godfather” trilogy, “Indiana Jones,” “Titanic,” “Forrest Gump,” “Top Gun,” “Iron Man,” “Love Story,” “Beverly Hills Cop” and “Saving Private Ryan.” In addition, the company’s filmed entertainment segment includes the Paramount Pictures Studio lot in L.A., spanning roughly 62 acres of land. Paramount Skydance also includes Skydance’s animation, film, TV, games and sports divisions. WBD’s streaming businesses include HBO Max, which just announced price increases of $1-$2 per month effective Oct. 21, as well as Discovery+ and sports streaming packages. As of the end of June, the services had 57.8 million domestic and 67.9 million international streaming subs, for 125.7 million total. HBO Max includes all current and classic HBO original series including “The Sopranos,” “Game of Thrones,” “Succession,” “The Pitt,” “The Penguin,” “The White Lotus,” “The Last of Us,” “Peacemaker,” “Hacks” and “Task” along with shows like “Friends,” “Abbott Elementary,” “Rick and Morty” and “The Big Bang Theory.” Paramount+ had 77.7 million subscribers as of the end of June. Paramount also operates the free, ad-supported Pluto TV service and the BET+ subscription service. Paramount+ features original series, shows and movies from brands and studios including BET, CBS, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, Paramount Pictures and the Smithsonian Channel. Paramount+ Premium is also home to Showtime content, including original scripted series and nonfiction projects and films. The premium plan includes live sports programming through local live CBS streams, and all Paramount+ subscribers have streaming access to CBS News Network and CBS Sports HQ. WBD’s linear networks in the U.S. include CNN, TNT, TBS, Turner Classic Movies, OWN, HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channel and Adult Swim. In 2024, the company launched CNN International in Europe on Max. Paramount’s TV business comprises CBS – which the company touts as “America’s most‑watched broadcast network” — CBS News, CBS Sports, Nickelodeon, MTV, BET, Comedy Central, Smithsonian Channel and TV Land. The potential combination of CBS News and CNN raises the prospect that Bari Weiss, who was appointed editor-in-chief of CBS News after Paramount Skydance’s $150 million acquisition of her outlet the Free Press, would have some part in the editorial operations of CNN.

Title: Are Crypto Income ETFs Really Profitable? Analyzing The Booming TradFi Trend

Written byandrew.packer Edited byMohammad Shahid The first wave of crypto ETFs allowed investors to onboard crypto assets into traditional brokerage accounts – and tax-advantaged retirement accounts. Given the long-term return potential of cryptocurrencies, that’s a win-win. But cryptos are still volatile. Last week’s $19 billion leveraged wipeout in bitcoin surpassed the wipeout at the Covid bottom in March 2020. And the FTX collapse in late 2022. Investors in traditional assets like the upside potential of crypto. But the downside volatility is a bit much to stomach. They want products that take some of the extreme swings out of it, even if it means a lower upside. Today, a new wave of ETFs are coming online. They boast higher fees, but more active management. There are currently 155 crypto ETF filings tracking 35 different digital assets. 👀 pic.twitter.com/nLgZccjplR Not content to simply buy and HODL, they’re employing different strategies to take advantage of the higher volatility in cryptocurrencies. For more cautious investors, crypto income ETFs may be attractive investment opportunities. But as with anything, buyer beware. A peek under the hood of some of the income ETFs show that – whether in a crypto-specific ETF or a basket of crypto stocks – there aren’t great total returns. On paper, crypto income ETFs offer investors most of the upside from cryptocurrencies, but with income along the way. But there’s a catch. Actually, quite a few. The most important is that these ETFs use crypto futures, rather than hold crypto itself. Being able to manage crypto futures allows for the ability to create income. By buying long-dated futures and then selling short-dated futures, income can be generated from price swings. Some of the income returns look good, at least during a bull market. For instance, the ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO) boasts a dividend yield of over 50% annualized. However, investors need to look at the total return. BITO shares are down nearly 20% year-to-date. With the underlying asset of Bitcoin up over 20%, BITO has generated only a modest gain on top of that. Anyone who has to sell shares of BITO will experience capital loss despite having to pay taxes on dividends received. And on top of that, investors are paying a 0.95% management fee. Using futures, ETFs effectively buy an asset with a time premium that decays. During a bull market, the impact is muted. But in sideways markets or a crypto winter, the losses can be brutal. Combine that with leverage, and the results can get pretty bad, pretty quickly. The Defiance Leveraged Long Income Ethereum ETF (ETHI) launched at the start of October. Designed to return 150-200% of the daily performance in Ethereum and using credit spreads to generate income, shares dropped 30% within their first few weeks of trading. October 10’s liquidation massacre is the immediate culprit. But the way this ETF is structured, it would likely bleed out over time. Currently, crypto income ETFs are set up to make investors only during a hot bull market – not a crypto winter, or even a sideway market. But the crypto space is now more than just cryptocurrencies themselves. There’s an ETF for everything after all, and it’s no surprise that crypto stock ETFs are making a debut. ETFs tracking crypto-related stocks have started to launch this year. In theory, these may be more attractive for investors compared to a single-crypto income ETF, since they offer some diversification. Let’s take a look at two of them: At the start of the year, the REX Crypto Equity Premium Income ETF (CEPI) launched. Boasting a monthly dividend payment, the ETF owns shares of several crypto-related companies, from mining companies, Bitcoin treasury company MicroStrategy, and even credit card giant Visa. Shares have been volatile since their launch, in a rising market for stocks – not good. But the dividends paid out have exceeded 20% year to date, for a positive total return. A second ETF that launched this year, the long-winded YieldMax Crypto Industry Portfolio Option Income ETF (LFGY), has a reported distribution of 19.9% annualized. Yet the ETF, which holds assets such as Coinbase, IBIT, MARA Holdings, and other runaway stock winners this year, is down nearly 25% since inception. With less than $200 million under management, it’s clear that this ETF is failing to attract investors. And with these returns in the first year of operation, it’s easy to see why. Despite the increasingly mainstream integration of cryptocurrencies, the October 10th massacre in altcoins serves as a painful reminder. Cryptocurrency is volatile. And while that volatility should decline as crypto assets gain traction and become integrated with traditional finance, it’s still subject to big swings. Investors looking to get into the cryptocurrency space don’t want to sit through a 30-50% decline – or more. They want the upside volatility, but may be willing to give up some gains if it means reducing the risk of having to sit through massive declines. But for now, crypto income ETFs are living up to their name by providing income – but they’re failing to hold their value. That’s a problem over time. Given the number of new crypto ETFs coming online, more competition in the space should drive ways to improve returns. For crypto enthusiasts, the ETFs are no reason to switch out of owning the real asset. For investors looking for crypto exposure, the spot ETFs that hold the underlying crypto still appear to be the best game in town.

ByRachel Wells, Contributor. When Amazon’s internal strategy documents suggest that robots, AI, and overall automation will replace an estimated 600,000 jobs that would otherwise hire humans (more than half a million) by 2033, take note. The second largest employer in the U.S. has spoken, and it’s a strong indication of where we’re heading in the future of work. That scale of disruption will leave few job categories at the big tech giant untouched, and many workers will need a plan B. This, if anything, is a stark reminder of how AI is disrupting the workforce at scale, and the need for upskilling and reskilling in other areas. For context, this is happening even as the tech giant plans to double its output through the next few years. Karen Weise, writing for The New York Times (who first reported this story), notes that “Amazon’s plans could have profound impact on blue-collar jobs throughout the country and serve as a model for other companies like Walmart, the nation’s largest private employer, and UPS. The company transformed the U.S. work force as it created a booming demand for warehousing and delivery jobs. But now, as it leads the way for automation, those roles could become more technical, higher paid and more scarce.” Whenever there is a wave of layoffs or the threat of roles being cut out from an organizational structure, the usual likely culprits tend to be roles that are repetitive or routine in nature. These roles also do not typically require strategy and strong decision-making and creative skills, which makes it easier for them to be at risk and liable to automation. Here are some examples of roles that would likely be targeted by Amazon as they ramp up AI implementation across their global operations: Throughout the supply chain, there are plenty of opportunities for automation because much of it consists of predictable workflows. As a result, Amazon will naturally anticipate high cost-savings from robots. And even though the entire Amazon workforce won’t disappear, the existing responsibilities of remaining jobs can be expected to change significantly. If you work in a blue-collar role liable to automation, or you’re concerned that your knowledge-based job is at risk of AI, here are some things you can do to future-proof your career and finances: Today is day one of your transition. Start now to upskill and prove your value in ways that robots and AI can never replicate.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 AI giants including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Oracle recently announced a $40 billion deal that will help them secure coveted computing capacity for artificial intelligence. The blockbuster data center deal is a big reason why Morgan Stanley estimates that Global AI infrastructure spending is projected to hit $400 billion this year. Some speculate that all of this AI dependency can be risky, however, because if AI stumbles, all major tech stocks could fall simultaneously. Previously, individual companies were affected by performance in their specific sectors, but now many will rise and fall together based on AI sentiment. It’s why so many have compared this moment to the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, where enthusiasm for a single technological trend drove valuations beyond reason. Douglas McIntyre: Lee, one of the things we’re seeing in the world of AI is these massive alliances, you know, where different companies form partnerships and everybody brings piece of their expertise to the thing and work together. It’s not always clear who gets what from whom and who put what in, but you’ve got one, you just, you got one that just came out. Lee Jackson: Boy, do I ever, I mean, when you get, okay, and I’m gonna have to, I’m gonna read these off to you, Doug. When you get BlackRock, who’s clearly has more dough than anybody in the world, Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI to all chip in $40 billion to buy aligned data centers. That shows you that the demand for cloud computing and data center storage, and, and retrieval and all of that has got to be, they see it to be exponentially much, much bigger than we can see it right now. Or why would they go in and spend $40 billion to buy this? And I think it’s, I think it’s pretty provocative because it’s, it’s like all four major partners in the industry who have been very happy to just do circular financing is now, we have now deemed it to be that they’re gonna combine to have this capacity for, for cloud computing and, and all the above. But $40 billion is a big chunk of dough even for those kind of major players. And it’s interesting. Will we see more of this? Will we see other data center providers? And there’s big ones, you know, there’s super big ones and, you know, Digital Realty people like that. Will somebody go in and make a big play for them? Or somebody you know of that size and scope. I think it’ll be interesting to see if this expands and there’s more data center purchases, you know, as we head down the road. McIntyre: If you called me up tomorrow and said to me that Microsoft bought Duke Energy there’s, or Constellation, it’s, this is crazy enough now, so that you could actually see a consolidation based on an based on ownership. If I’ve got, if I’ve got the technology and you’ve got the infrastructure, maybe I should just buy you. Jackson: Absolutely. And I don’t think, you know, and as we’ve discussed, you know, you’re not gonna build any small scale nuclear reactors anytime soon. And the approval process, you know, could take forever. Although I’m sure they could help speed it up ’cause we’re gonna need it for the national power grid ’cause we’re gonna need it. But yeah, I think, I think that’s true. And you know, there’s big players like Digital and Equinix and people like that, you know, that have been in the business forever, you know, from, you know, startup, you know. In that industry. And it’s interesting to focus on, well, will they continue to build more or will people continue to consolidate that industry? Because again, the question is, is it getting away from itself as well? Are we building too many data centers? I don’t think so because the demand is just never ending. But boy, it, there’s gonna be a point, I think when, and, and we’ve had this discussion where data center usage and power usage is gonna, there, there’s gonna be an issue here at some point, and that’s why most of these people are trying to desperately to find a way. That’s why they’re building data centers in North Dakota and South Dakota because of the, the big, you know, oil fields up there, and that’s why they’re building them in Texas. That’s why they’re building them out in the Permian and out there. And so it’s like, okay, if we can’t bring the electricity to us, we’ll go to where the gas, the natural gas is, and we’ll build our own. McIntyre: It’s funny, CNBC did a, an article today and it’s, it’s, it’s based on a, a see your own shadow premise. Apparently, the people looking for data centers are shopping around the utilities. So if I’m gonna build a data center, I may call 10 utilities try to. What’s happening is the utilities are now getting confused about how many data centers there might be. Because if, if you call me and it’s just, I’m the one utility and you’re the one person who wants a data center, that’s easy to count, right? One guy called me about one data center, but if I’m the utility and ten data centers around and you say to me, “Do a forecast. I want you to forecast for me how many data centers we’re gonna have to support. It’s like, well, ten guys called me, but if I don’t get any of them? Or what if I get all 10? So there’s a capacity calculation problem that has the chance of me being that you’ll have overbuilding it. It could be that people have phone calls that they think, well, I’ll, I’ll build because I’m gonna get five of the ten. The town over does the same thing. There is a situation, scenario, as they say, where you could have overbuilding based on shadow demand, is they asked me, so it must be that they’ve picked me. Jackson: And the thing that will be interesting to see, if we do overbuild, which typically you know, has happened in the United States for, you name it, what do you do with empty data centers, with racks and racks and racks of servers> McIntyre: When that happens, we’ll just pull out the racks and turn ’em into huge barnyards. Listen, at least we know they have to be close to water for cooling. We know that they’ll get some electricity, so we need to keep the lights on for the cattle. So there’ll be water for the cattle ’cause they’ll be located, they’ll have water and we’ll have some electricity and we can use it. We can use them basically as a huge farm. Jackson: Well, I think this deal is either the beginning of the end or the end of the beginning. You know, I don’t know what it is for the data center wave and, and, and data center building and data center construction, but we’ll find that out soon enough.

It indicates that people plan to spend briskly over the holidays. That, in turn, will help Amazon’s e-commerce top line. However, those people may not get jobs next year, and many full-time employees may find themselves out of work as well. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Amazon.com Inc.

Don’t waste another minute; learn more here.(Sponsor) Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) reportedly plans to spend billions to automate its warehouses. Thousands of employees will soon find themselves out of work. The New York Times got ahold of confidential Amazon documents that indicate the company plans to automate huge numbers of tasks that are done by people. Robots will take over their workload. Management also told its board that it expects a surge in orders, reaching twice the current level by 2033. “Robots” is another word for AI-based automation that can replace most of the people who work in its massive warehouses. These are central to Amazon’s ability to deliver items to customers in one or two days. By most estimates, Amazon has 350 warehouses worldwide and another 1,200 logistics facilities. The Times quoted Daron Acemoglu, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has a Nobel Prize in economics. He said, “Nobody else has the same incentive as Amazon to find a way to automate.” To accomplish this, the company’s e-commerce division will need nearly a million robots. Presumably, the plan will save hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Amazon indeed has a powerful incentive to set up a more automated system. Its North American e-commerce margins are thin.

Companies and Brands Sending You to Google News in 3 Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) hired over 200,000 part-time workers to help with holiday sales. That is good news for the overall economy. It indicates that people plan to spend briskly over the holidays. That, in turn, will help Amazon’s e-commerce top line. However, those people may not get jobs next year, and many full-time employees may find themselves out of work as well. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Amazon.com Inc.

Don’t waste another minute; learn more here.(Sponsor) Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) reportedly plans to spend billions to automate its warehouses. Thousands of employees will soon find themselves out of work. The New York Times got ahold of confidential Amazon documents that indicate the company plans to automate huge numbers of tasks that are done by people. Robots will take over their workload. Management also told its board that it expects a surge in orders, reaching twice the current level by 2033. “Robots” is another word for AI-based automation that can replace most of the people who work in its massive warehouses. These are central to Amazon’s ability to deliver items to customers in one or two days. By most estimates, Amazon has 350 warehouses worldwide and another 1,200 logistics facilities. The Times quoted Daron Acemoglu, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has a Nobel Prize in economics. He said, “Nobody else has the same incentive as Amazon to find a way to automate.” To accomplish this, the company’s e-commerce division will need nearly a million robots. Presumably, the plan will save hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Amazon indeed has a powerful incentive to set up a more automated system. Its North American e-commerce margins are thin. In the most recent quarter, revenue for the region was $100 billion and operating income was $7.5 billion. Amazon is uniquely positioned for the plan. It is among the early leaders in artificial intelligence. Up against Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, and OpenAI, it plans to invest $100 billion in the technology this year.

Title: Apple Stockholders Hit $850 Billion Jackpot
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/22/apple-stockholders-hit-850-billion-jackpot/
Time Published: 2025-10-22T14:14:54Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Over the past ten years, Apple (AAPL) stock has delivered a massive $847 billion back to its investors in tangible cash in the form of dividends and buybacks. In fact, AAPL stock has provided the highest returns to shareholders of any company in history. Continuing this trend in 2025, Apple raised its quarterly dividend to $0.26 per share, reflecting a 4% raise. Apple’s board has also authorized a new program to repurchase up to $100 billion of common stock. Let's examine some statistics and see how this payout ability compares to the market's largest return-of-capital entities. Why should you be concerned? Because dividends and share buybacks represent direct, tangible capital returns to shareholders. They also reflect management's confidence in the company’s financial stability and its capacity to generate sustainable cash flows. Moreover, there are other stocks exhibiting similar traits. Here is a list of the top 10 firms ranked by total capital returned to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. Investing in a single stock can be risky, but there’s significant value in the broader diversified approach we adopt with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. We extend beyond just equities. What about a portfolio comprising 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto alongside equities and bonds - is it likely to yield greater returns in the next 1-3 years and offer better protection if the markets fall by 20%? We have analyzed the figures. Top 10 Stocks By Total Shareholder Return For the complete ranking, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking What catches your attention here? The total capital returned to shareholders as a percentage of the current market cap seems inversely correlated to growth potential for reinvestments. Stocks like Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are expanding at a much quicker rate, in a more predictable manner, compared to the others, yet they have returned a significantly smaller portion of their market cap to shareholders. That represents the downside to high capital returns. Yes, they are appealing, but you must ponder: Am I compromising growth and robust fundamentals? With that consideration, let's review some data for AAPL. (refer to Buy or Sell Apple Stock for more information) Apple Basics That provides a good summary, but assessing a stock from an investment standpoint requires much more. This is precisely what Trefis High Quality Portfolio accomplishes. It aims to minimize stock-specific risks while providing potential upside. AAPL Historical Risk Nevertheless, Apple is not insulated from significant declines. It fell roughly 81% during the Dot-Com bubble and suffered a 61% drop in the Global Financial Crisis. The 2018 correction and the Covid sell-off also experienced reductions of around 31-39%. Even the recent inflation shock caused it to decline by approximately 31%. Strong firms can endure storms more effectively, yet sharp market downturns can still be severe. However, the risk is not confined to major market downturns. Stocks can decrease even in favorable market conditions - consider events such as earnings reports, business updates, and changes in outlook. Check AAPL Dip Buyer Analyses to understand how the stock has bounced back from sharp declines in the past. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has a history of consistently outperforming its benchmark that includes all three - the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. What accounts for that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother ride, as seen in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

October 22, 2025 09:46 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Oct. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Strategic Intelligence - Counter-Drone Technologies" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.Counter-Drone Technologies essential in the defense industry, as a successful drone attack can have severe strategic and financial consequences. To overcome drone attacks, companies, nations, and militaries are increasingly adopting a collaborative approach. This approach involves acquisitions, sharing information on threats with their allies, and reporting attempted breaches to improve counter-drone postures.This report explores emergent trends within the C-UAS market, examining use cases and the implementation of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and directed energy weapons, and what challenges must be considered in pursuing effective strategies for brand building in this market.C-UAS are essential defense assets The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has gathered pace in recent years, with most states having access to some form of UAV platform. As new technologies such as AI and drone swarms mature, UAVs have become increasingly important in the fields of defense and security. To counter this emerging threat, investment in cutting-edge Counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-UAS) capabilities is essential. The commercialization of drones is a key driver in the C-UAS market, with technological advances lowering the costs of acquiring drones, thereby increasing access. This has led to wider commercial and governmental proliferation, which itself necessitates the development and procurement of C-UAS in a variety of defense, commercial, and law enforcement roles. In an increasingly multi-polar world, investment in defensive C-UAS capabilities will only accelerate. Throughout Russia's invasion of Ukraine, both sides have deployed UAVs extensively, with amateur footage of drone deployment becoming a major symbol of the conflict in international media. The Ukrainian military's meticulously planned Operation Spiderweb assault in June 2025 was a series of successful covert drone attacks deep inside Russian territory, which, according to Ukrainian sources, damaged or destroyed at least 41 Russian military jets, including several Tupolev-95 strategic bombers. The raids served not only as a major propaganda victory but as an acute reminder that, given the focus on the development and advancement of drone technology, it is likely that the cultivation and procurement of robust C-UAS systems capable of countering a range of UAV threats (Groups 1-5) will be essential. Furthermore, the potential for the weaponization of commercially available small UAS (sUAS), such as the installation of grenades and mortars on recreational quadcopters as seen in Ukraine, will continue to drive capable C-UAS systems on all scales.Key Highlights Scope Reasons to Buy Key Topics Covered: List of Tables List of Figures Companies Featured For more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/qw5d8f About ResearchAndMarkets.comResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) possesses a strong historical precedent for delivering rapid, significant share price appreciation, including rallies of over 30% in under two months (as seen in 2010 and 2024), and an even rarer surge of more than 50% in 2025. This established momentum highlights the stock's potential for high-velocity gains, which investors can capitalize on when specific business catalysts align. The current market strength is anchored by recent performance across three core business segments, all detailed in the company's Q2 2025 results. The primary drivers for continued growth are: These quantifiable operational successes provide a strong fundamental basis for another powerful upswing in Alphabet's share price. Investing in a single stock can be risky, but there is a huge value to a broader diversified approach. If you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like GOOGL, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. It certainly helps if the fundamentals check out. For details on GOOGL, read Buy or Sell GOOGL Stock. Below are a few numbers that matter. *LTM: Last Twelve Months When thinking about risk for GOOGL, it helps to look at how much it fell during major market crises. The biggest hit was the Global Financial Crisis, with a drop of about 65%. The Inflation Shock in 2022 also pushed shares down by around 44%. The Covid pandemic brought a dip near 31%, and even the 2018 correction wasn’t mild, with a 23% decline. Look at – How Low Can GOOGL Stock Really Go – for more details. These numbers show that while GOOGL is strong on fundamentals, it’s not immune when markets turn sour. Drawdowns of this size are something to keep in mind, even for big names. Investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Samsung’s new XR headset is secretly a Pixel

Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. October 22, 2025 Last week, I got to spend some time with Samsung’s newest device, a mixed reality headset called the Galaxy XR. This is the “Project Moohan” product Samsung has been working on for ages to take on the Apple Vision Pro. It’s an important launch for the company, and it’s even priced to compete — well, sort of. At $1,799, it’s about half the price of Apple’s headset, which is certainly good news, but still a massive amount of money. I’ve already talked extensively about what the Galaxy XR is and what it’s like to use it. In this article, though, I want to talk about something I realized almost immediately after my demo with the headset: this isn’t really a Samsung device. I know, that sounds weird. It has the word “Galaxy” in its name, and the hardware is clearly the result of Samsung’s incredible manufacturing and engineering. But the soul of the machine, the actual experience of using it? That’s all Google. When I hear “Samsung Galaxy,” I have a very clear set of expectations. I expect to see things like One UI, Samsung’s heavy-handed-but-feature-packed Android skin. I expect to find Samsung-made apps, Galaxy AI features, and maybe even a stray Bixby command. Hell, I at least expect to see the words “Samsung” or “Galaxy” somewhere on the device itself. That is not what this is. What I used felt less like a Samsung product and more like the first-ever Google Pixel XR headset, one that Samsung just happened to build. During my demo session with the Galaxy XR, I was looking for traces of One UI. I was waiting for the familiar app icons, the Samsung settings menu, and yeah, even the bloatware. They never came. This got me thinking about the Galaxy XR keynote launch, and I realized there were no Samsung apps or features mentioned there, either. Instead, everything I saw was Google. It seemed as pure and untouched as the software on a Google Pixel phone. Honestly, this was bizarre. Using a $1,799 Samsung device without any real Samsung presence in the software felt almost wrong. To be clear, everything was perfectly functional, but just not what I expected. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority? In fact, the Google experiences are what literally define this product. If you compare the Galaxy XR ($1799.99 at Samsung) to the Meta Quest 3 ($499.99 at Best Buy) or the Apple Vision Pro ($3499 at Apple), you’ll see a lot of crossover, such as with the core design, hand-tracking controls, etc. What the Galaxy XR offers that the other two don’t come directly from Google: Gemini and Google Play. Let me start with the Play Store. Since Android lives at the core of Android XR (obviously — it’s in the name), pretty much every app and game available on the Play Store right now will work straight out of the box. There will be exceptions, of course, such as with anything that requires a phone-shaped device or a physical display. But 99% of the Play Store is already working on the Galaxy XR, giving it a huge leg up over something like the Meta Quest 3. And then there’s Gemini. When Google announced Android XR late last year, it said this was the first OS designed from the ground up for the “Gemini era.” It wasn’t kidding. Gemini isn’t just an app you launch when you want it; it’s woven into the OS. This makes the Galaxy XR the first (and, as far as I can tell, only) XR headset on the market that is built for AI. During my demo, I could access Gemini anytime by holding down the multi-function button on the top right of the headset. The familiar Gemini interface popped right up. I could talk directly with it about whatever, as usual, but the real trick is that Gemini could see everything that I saw. This was helpful during the software demos, such as when I was in Google Photos. I could ask about what was in the photo, when it was taken, or to identify anyone in it. Samsung also showed off a demo of Gemini helping a gamer by checking out what they were playing and giving them tips on how to succeed. And remember that the headset can also “see” the real world through a low-latency, full-color video stream. This enables you to not only ask Gemini about what it sees in VR but also what it sees around you in reality. You can even use Circle to Search in this mode. The rest of my demo was basically a greatest-hits tour of Google’s apps, remixed for mixed reality. All this was incredible, but at the end of the demo, I asked the Samsung rep helping me out, “So, where are all the Samsung apps? Where’s One UI?” I got a very polite, very corporate non-answer: “For today, we’re just focusing on these incredible Google-powered experiences.” So yeah, they’re not there. Maybe they’ll be added later, or maybe they’ll even be there when you take the Galaxy XR out of the box, but I doubt it. If that were true, why weren’t they shown to me? In the end, this device feels like it’s 80% Google, 15% Samsung, and 5% Qualcomm. That isn’t a criticism — I’m not saying the headset is bad. It’s just that my limited experience with it left me feeling like Samsung is just acting as the manufacturer for Google’s own flagship XR ambitions. And this all gives me a serious case of déjà vu. It reminds me of 2011. For those of you who weren’t obsessing over Android back then, Samsung and Google partnered on a legendary phone: the Galaxy Nexus. The Nexus branding was Google’s “stock” Android label that predated Pixel, which eventually replaced it. The phone had Samsung’s absolutely incredible hardware — it was one of the first phones with a big, beautiful HD AMOLED screen — but it ran pure, stock Android. There was no clunky TouchWiz skin, which was what Samsung’s software was called back in those days. It was the “Google Experience Phone,” but it was built by Samsung. That is exactly what the Galaxy XR is. In that sense, one could look at this as the spiritual successor to the Galaxy Nexus, like the Nexus of mixed reality. However, Google hasn’t used the Nexus branding in years, so all that’s left is to call this what I think it actually is: the Pixel XR. The only question left is whether anyone will buy it. The Apple Vision Pro has been a well-known bomb (by Apple standards, anyway). Apple couldn’t convince the world to buy a $3,500 face computer. Samsung and Google are betting that “half the price” is the magic number. But $1,799 is still an enormous amount of money for a device that, for now, seems like a very cool, very expensive toy for gaming and looking at 3D maps. I remain cautiously optimistic. I want this to succeed. But as it stands right now, the most interesting thing about Samsung’s new headset is how little Samsung is in it. Thank you for being part of our community.

Title: Watch These Key Netflix Price Levels as Stock Drops After Disappointing Earnings

Netflix (NFLX) shares tumbled in premarket trading Wednesday after the streaming giant 's third-quarter earnings came in short of Wall Street expectations. The company posted earnings per share of $5.87, compared with the $6.92 EPS that analysts tracked by Visible Alpha had anticipated. Executives said an unplanned charge tied to an "ongoing dispute with Brazilian tax authorities" weighed on profitability in the quarter. Revenue rose 17% from the year-earlier period to $11.51 billion, in line with analysts' estimates, and Netflix projected another 17% increase in the fourth quarter, driven by membership growth, pricing adjustments and increased ad revenue. Netflix shares were down more than 7% at around $1,150 in recent premarket trading. Through yesterday's close, the stock had risen 40% since the start of the year, far outpacing the 15% gain of the benchmark S&P 500 index over the period. Below, we take a closer look at the Netflix chart and use technical analysis to identify key price levels that investors will likely be watching. After hitting their record high in late June, Netflix shares have consolidated within a descending triangle, a bearish chart pattern that signals a potential move lower. Indeed, the stock looks set to tumble toward the pattern’s lower trendline following the streamer’s weaker-than-expected earnings report, reinforcing a downward bias. Let’s point out two key support levels to watch on the Netflix chart amid the possibility for further weakness and also identify overhead areas worth monitoring during future recovery efforts. A decisive volume-backed breakdown below the descending triangle could see the shares initially test a key support level around $1,065. This area on the chart may attract buying interest near the stock’s prominent February swing high. Further downside could see a more-significant drop to the $942 level. Investors may seek buying opportunities in this location near last December’s peak, which also closely aligns with a series of corresponding price action on the chart between January and April. It’s worth noting this area also sits in the same neighborhood as a bearish measured move target that calculates the width of the descending triangle near its widest section in points and deducts that amount from the pattern’s lower trendline. Recovery efforts in the stock back toward the descending triangle’s upper trendline could see the shares test the $1,265 area. The price may run into overhead resistance at this level near a trendline that connects peaks on the chart in June and September. Finally, buying above this area could propel a bullish move to around $1,341. Investors who have bought Netflix shares during its consolidation period in recent months may decide to lock in profits around the stock’s all-time high.

For years, the Oracle of Omaha has had a rock-star-like presence in the investing world, and his annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting draws thousands of loyal investor fans. Buffett remains one of the world’s most prominent investors, known for his long buy-and-hold strategies and massive portfolio of public and private holdings. Long-time investors and Buffett mavens are familiar with this quote, “His favorite holding for an S&P 500 stock is forever.” So it is not surprising to report that for all of the success and stature Berkshire Hathaway has in the investment world, three top companies make up over 50% of the fund’s total holdings.

Title: Investors Pause To Wait For Magnificent 7 Earnings
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/catherinebrock/2025/10/22/investors-pause-to-wait-for-magnificent-7-earnings/
Time Published: 2025-10-22T12:23:01Z
Full Content:
ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. U.S. stocks were mixed Tuesday as investors await earnings results from the Magnificent Seven stocks, starting with Tesla (TSLA) after the market closes on Wednesday. The large-cap S&P 500 index and the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite were nearly flat, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5%. Tesla is expected to report EPS of $0.56 per share after missing the consensus estimate for three consecutive quarters. The EV maker reported $0.72 per share earnings in last year’s third quarter. Meanwhile, Netflix (NFLX) stock declined in pre-market trading after the streaming company fell short of expectations on revenue and profit. Netflix’s miss may be a less-common outcome in this earnings season, however. Bloomberg reports that among S&P 500 firms that have already reported earnings, 85% have beat profit expectations. If the trend continues, the third quarter of 2025 may end up being the best earnings quarter since 2021. Stock futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones are mixed ahead of the market open on Wednesday. Contracts tied to the S&P 500 rose almost 0.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.3%. Dow Jones futures declined 0.1%. What is a bubble in investing? In investing, a bubble is a period of rapidly increasing asset prices, usually driven by investor enthusiasm more so than underlying value. Bubbles end when prices reset or “burst.” The run-up in prices and the correction that follows tend to be overreactions to market conditions. To oversimplify, an optimistic trading environment can fuel aggressive buying and a general increase in risk appetite. Investors may stretch outside their normal parameters in terms of valuations and business fundamentals. The immediate outcome is positive—stock prices keep rising, which encourages more buying. At some point, investors begin to take profits from the run-up. This can be prompted by a change in economic conditions, disappointing earnings, or something else. The profit-taking can be as contagious as the aggressive buying. It can quickly shift into loss-aversion and panic if the selloff continues. Long-term investors can protect themselves from bubble-related volatility by sticking to their investment plan. Resisting the urge to follow the masses during the rally is key. A diversified portfolio of quality assets should be resilient enough to withstand the correction or crash that can follow a bubble. Also, the price reset that follows a bubble can be a good time to snap up under-priced shares.

Title: The 3 Bitcoin Treasury Company Models According to Michael Saylor
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/the-3-bitcoin-treasury-company-models-according-to-michael-saylor/
Time Published: 2025-10-22T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
A deep dive into the three strategic models emerging in corporate Bitcoin treasury companies, from pure-play credit issuers to hybrid operators, based on Michael Saylor’s latest thinking. But not all Bitcoin treasury companies are the same. In fact, Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), recently outlined a clear taxonomy for understanding the landscape: a three-tiered hierarchy that separates dabblers from dominators. Each tier comes with distinct incentives, risks, and expected outcomes. For investors, analysts, and executives, understanding this framework is essential for evaluating capital strategy in the age of Bitcoin. This is the highest-conviction model—a company that is entirely focused on accumulating and optimizing Bitcoin as its core strategic asset. Bitcoin is not just a reserve asset; it is the business. Pure plays are engineered for one thing: capital transformation through Bitcoin. They raise equity and issue Bitcoin-backed credit, using the proceeds to accumulate even more Bitcoin. Their growth isn’t tethered to traditional business models or fiat performance metrics. It flows directly from superior monetary architecture. Defining Characteristics: Strategic Advantage: Examples: Saylor’s View: “These are the next Mag-7 stocks. They can go from a billion to a hundred billion, even a trillion.” Pure plays are the apex predators of Bitcoin capital markets. They can achieve 100x or 1,000x returns because they own their category and multiply Bitcoin-denominated value through disciplined issuance and strategic clarity. This tier reflects a hybrid approach—companies with real Bitcoin exposure and strategic intent, but not full alignment. Strong Bitcoin operators maintain an existing business model while also accumulating BTC and potentially issuing Bitcoin-backed instruments. Their conviction is meaningful, but their operational complexity or regulatory constraints prevent full conversion. Defining Characteristics: Strategic Advantage: Expected Outcome: These companies are capable of winning in the Bitcoin era, but their upside is constrained by competing priorities. They are often stuck between traditional shareholder expectations and Bitcoin-native capital innovation. At the base of the hierarchy are companies that hold Bitcoin on the balance sheet as a passive hedge. They aren’t actively building around it, issuing Bitcoin-backed debt, or educating the market. They simply hold it. This model is increasingly common among firms that want long-term exposure without significant operational changes. Over time, as Bitcoin appreciates, it becomes a ballast for market cap—supporting equity value even when the core business underperforms. Defining Characteristics: Strategic Role: Expected Outcome: This model doesn’t transform capital markets. But it does offer a superior hedge versus holding fiat or underperforming fixed income. This hierarchy isn’t just semantic. It determines who thrives in the Bitcoin era. The delta between tiers is massive. A hedger might preserve value. A strong operator might outperform. But only a pure play rewrites the game. Saylor doesn’t see this as a corporate trend. He sees it as a full-spectrum transformation of credit, equity, and capital markets. “Bitcoin treasury companies are the engines, the drivers, the dynamos powering up that network.” In his view, a new financial system is emerging where: The companies that embrace the pure play model today will anchor this future. They will become the new financial institutions—issuing digital credit, shaping capital flows, and compounding Bitcoin-denominated value faster than traditional models allow. George Mekhail, Managing Director of Bitcoin For Corporations sits down with Michael Saylor to discuss Bitcoin disrupting capital, redefining balance sheets, and shaping 21st-century economics.

Title: How Beyond Meat became the market's latest meme-stock darling

Discovery is trying to gin up a bidding war, and stock investors seem to think a sale is a great idea. Maybe they want "Westworld" back on HBO Max. Rundown But first, a blast from the past. Love Business Insider? Log into Google and make us a preferred source. Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up now. Market musings It's 2019. You get out of an "Avengers: Endgame" screening and pop your earbuds in. You like this up-and-coming artist, Billie Eilish, who seems pretty promising. You fire up a new app called TikTok. You can't figure out how it's different from Vine, but everyone seems to be into it. You pop into a local eatery and order one of those new plant-based Beyond Meat burgers that everyone's talking about. The company is valued at $14 billion. It doesn't taste great, but you're told it's the future of food. Fast-forward to the present day. Beyond Meat is worth less than $1 billion, and was a penny stock until very recently. Sales are a fraction of what they were. No, this is not some dystopian reality. The fact is, the competition stacked up against Beyond, and demand for meat alternatives waned. But something has shifted in the stock this week. Shares surged 128% (to $1.47) on Monday, on trading that was roughly 70 times the average. It followed that up on Tuesday with a 146% increase (to $3.62) on even more volume. Then it soared another 65% on Wednesday, bringing the three-day move to more than 800%. What gives? Well, it turns out that a retail investor named Dimitri Semenikhin (screen name: Capybara Stocks) has been buying up all the Beyond shares he can find. He says he now owns about 4% of the company's outstanding stock, and he posted about it on Reddit. Given the fact that Beyond already carried the natural characteristics of a meme stock — a nostalgic brand heavily shorted by institutions — the post was like catnip to Semenikhin's fellow retail traders. Business Insider's Sam O'Brient tracked down Semenikhin — who is based in Dubai — on Monday, while Beyond stock was ripping. He wanted to find out what was motivating him. Why take such a big position in a downtrodden penny stock down more than 80% year to date? Semenikhin provided some fundamental reasons. Key among them was the completion of a convertible note exchange, which he says lessens its previously high risk of bankruptcy and greatly strengthens its balance sheet. He said this was incorrectly viewed by some as a negative. "At the current price that I bought in, the pricing was just way too low for what was happening," he told BI. In a separate interview on Tuesday, he said that he sees the stock soaring another 66% from current levels, to around $6 per share. Semenikhin's undervaluation thesis may very well be true. After all, Beyond on Tuesday announced a collaboration with Walmart that — when combined with the lingering retail rocket fuel, and the stock's addition to a meme-stock ETF — sent shares surging more than 100% for a second straight day. But there's also no denying that Semenikhin is trying to emulate the playbook of Roaring Kitty, the GameStop-obsessed retail investor who was eventually immortalized in his very own movie. It's also clear he's having a similar effect, with Monday's price surge in Beyond defying fundamental logic. There's the regular YouTube posting. There's the Reddit activity (although his original post is now deleted). And there's the unrepentant desire to drive a short squeeze. Will Semenikhin go full Roaring Kitty and start wearing a signature headband? That remains to be seen. But the similarities run deep, and BI will continue to check in with him for updates. Look at that V-shaped bounce! Thanks a lot, Dimitri Semenikhin (and Walmart). Beyond Meat stock is now down just 4% in 2025, compared to the 86% loss through last Thursday's close. The rally has coincided with unprecedented options-trading volume for the stock, and as daily shares traded broke the 1 billion threshold for two straight sessions. The title of this chart from BlackRock Investment Institute says it all: earnings expectations for companies in the S&P 500 are reaccelerating. This is reflected by the upward slope of the orange line, which shows the 12-month change in profit forecasts. This aligns with the guidance we've gotten so far from industry bellwethers during the third-quarter reporting season. On Tuesday alone, General Motors, GE, Lockheed Martin, and RTX raised future earnings forecasts.

But they're not only popular with the uber-rich. Sales associates at multiple Zegna locations in Manhattan said that they have a wide age range of financial industry clients. Are they really worth the hype? Eager to see for myself, I went to the brand's global store on 57th Street in NYC to try on a pair. My review, in short? They're absolutely worth the money. If you're the type of person who is OK with dropping a rent payment on some sneakers, at least. I didn't love their plain look initially, but how they feel on your feet completely changes your perception of them. I'm usually a size 11.5, but the folks at the store said they recommend going a half-size up. They come in 30 different color options — I went with a black and white scheme. They were easily the most comfortable pair of shoes I'd ever worn. After being made a convert, I decided to head out and try to spot a pair of them in the wild. Given that it was rainy, I was doubtful I'd find anyone. But within minutes, as I approached Park Avenue, there was a pair walking right at me. A visitor from Charleston, South Carolina, said he had his custom-made last year and picked up three pairs. "I love them," he said, before asking: "Are you gonna buy a pair?" I'll have to save up first, I told him. Do you own a pair of Zegnas or another quiet luxury item you love?

Title: Inside Superstar Investor Cathie Wood's AI Stock-Fueled Comeback
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/hanktucker/2025/10/22/inside-superstar-investor-cathie-woods-ai-stock-fueled-comeback/
Time Published: 2025-10-22T10:30:00Z
Full Content:
ByHank Tucker, Forbes Staff. Among all the growth-minded investors who have seen their portfolios soar through this year’s AI craze, one familiar name has outperformed the rest. Cathie Wood’s Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) is up 87.1% in the last year, outperforming every other ETF and mutual fund tracked by the American Association of Individual Investors as of the end of September aside from single-stock funds. Its gains have been largely fueled by AI-related stocks like Palantir Technologies, Advanced Micro Devices, Tempus AI, and its longtime largest holding, Tesla, which Wood tells Forbes is the “largest AI project on earth,” marveling at its work developing robotaxis. The last time Wood was riding this high following her flagship fund’s 157% return in 2020, her idealism and stubborn conviction soon backfired, leading to a 14% loss in 2021 and a dreadful 67% crash in 2022. Even after it has tripled since then, it remains 42% below its February 2021 peak. The flagship fund has $8.3 billion in assets under management, down from $17 billion at the end of 2020, signaling that most investors abandoned her fund during its slide. Wood dismisses any notion that she is being swept up in another bubble like the Covid-19 stock surge. “The companies investing in AI are some of the most profitable companies in the world,” says Wood. “The reasoning models are astounding people in terms of how much more they can do if you give these models time. I think there were a lot of people expecting at some point the performance would level out. It's not leveling out at all.” Almost every AI stock has performed well this year, but Wood, Ark’s 69-year-old founder, CEO and chief investment officer, has had a nose for the biggest winners even relative to their peers. Ark owns more AMD than larger competitor Nvidia, two semiconductor stocks that make up 4.0% and 1.1% of ARKK’s portfolio, respectively, a prescient choice with AMD doubling in value this year compared to Nvidia’s more modest 36% gain. Wood says AMD’s lower valuation at less than $400 billion, while Nvidia’s market cap is $4.4 trillion, makes its growth prospects more appealing, and its superiority in chips with more expansive memory is becoming more of a differentiator. Palantir has done far better, gaining 337% since last November. Its data analytics technology helps government agencies and commercial customers blend and find patterns in massive datasets, and its 12-month sales have grown 39% year over year to $3.4 billion, with $763 in net profit. But Palantir is the poster child for the AI stock bubble, according to most value oriented investors. Its $430 billion market cap is a jaw-dropping 126 times its sales. Though Wood has taken profits in Palantir, selling 70% of Ark’s stake since August 2024, it still makes up 4.2% of its flagship fund as its ninth-largest holding. “If Palantir were not at its current valuation, given its position in the platform-as-a-service space, and we think they effectively own that space, it would be right up there with Tesla [in our portfolio],” says Wood, referencing her firm’s 11.9% holding in the electric vehicle giant. “There’s nothing like it out there.” That’s high praise from Wood, who has loved and owned Tesla for almost a decade. It was a key contributor to her 2020 performance with its 731% gain that year, then it mirrored her fund’s crash in 2022, losing 68%. Last year, Ark raised its price target for the stock to $2,600 per share by 2029, implying a market value of around $9 trillion. Tesla shares currently trade for $443 and has a market capitalization of $1.4 trillion. Ark estimates that by 2029 86% of Tesla’s earnings will be attributable to its robotaxi business, which it just launched in Austin, Texas this June. “EVs are one and done—you sell a car and hope the customer comes back in five years, and they're very low margin,” says Wood. “When analysts look at what robotaxis are, they have to use a different model. It's more of a subscription or recurring revenue model, and it's very high margin.” With $1 billion in ARKK invested in Tesla, the holding is twice the weight of its second largest position, Coinbase, but aside from that investment, Wood generally doesn’t invest very much in $1 trillion market-cap tech giants. Amazon, Meta and Nvidia are all in her portfolio, but not in the top 15. Avoiding mega tech stocks but doubling down on the smaller-cap stocks turned out to be a grave mistake for Wood in 2022. Virtual health business Teladoc Health lost 88% in 2021 and 2022. Game development firm Unity Software fell 80% in 2022. Bets on biotech and life sciences firms like Ginkgo Bioworks, Exact Sciences, Beam Therapeutics and Intellia Therapeutics all floundered. “We had no idea that we were going to run into a buzzsaw. Many people think it was interest rates, and sure, all long duration assets got killed,” Wood reflects. “But our bigger problem was the supply chain shocks that lingered for so long. Because what drives our models is unit growth. The more unit growth, the faster costs can decline with new technologies.” In hindsight, Wood concedes the “correct thing to do” would have been to find shelter in larger-cap innovators that were more resilient to supply chain issues and rising interest rates, but she thinks today’s policy environment is far more favorable to her strategy. A longtime Donald Trump supporter, she applauds his move in January to rescind parts of a Joe Biden executive order that aimed to set some standards for AI regulation. New depreciation schedules in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act have also eased corporate tax burdens. “The amount of deregulation that is taking place in this administration is astonishing,” she gushes. “I don't like tariffs, but I would take tariffs if you also gave me what this administration has given with deregulation and much lower tax rates.” What investors think of Wood depends largely on when they invested. ARKK’s 31.8% three-year annualized return as of September 30 is better than the S&P 500 Index’s 24.9% figure, but its -0.8% five-year number looks terrible compared to the market’s 16.5% annual gains. But rewinding further, a 15.3% annual return since inception in 2014 is back to outperforming the market by two percentage points. It trails the Nasdaq 100 Index’s 16.9% annualized returns in that span, but it’s narrowing that gap. It’s hard for any investor to come back from an 80% loss from peak to trough, but the Nasdaq similarly lost close to 80% during the dotcom bust, and has gained about 2,000% in the quarter century since. Wood is hopeful that decades from now, its 2022 collapse will similarly look like a blip on ARRK’s long-term stock chart.

Title: Is the Magnificent Seven's Earnings Edge Fading?

The Magnificent Seven have been the stars of the S&P 500 for the past several years, but the group’s period of exceptional earnings growth may be nearing an end. Only one of the Magnificent Seven—AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA)—is expected to be among the top five contributors to S&P 500 earnings growth in the third quarter, according to John Butters, Vice President and Senior Earnings Analyst at FactSet Research. This time last year, two of the Mag 7—Nvidia and Alphabet (GOOG)—were expected to be in the top five, and two more—Amazon (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META)—were expected to make the top 10. This year, the four other companies expected to contribute the most to index-level profit growth are Eli Lilly (LLY), Intel (INTC), Boeing (BA), and Micron (MU). Eli Lilly, Intel, and Boeing are all benefiting from easy comparisons against last year. Nvidia and Micron, on the other hand, were top contributors to growth last year and are expected to report earnings growth of 53% and 157%, respectively, underscoring how significant artificial intelligence demand has become to S&P 500 companies. Their exceptionally strong earnings growth was one of the main reasons that Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Tesla were dubbed the "Magnificent Seven" in 2023. Their growth fueled much of the stock market's gains over the past few years. As their growth slows, the profitability of other S&P 500 companies counts for more when investors forecast the index's future value. Artificial intelligence will also be the focus when the Magnificent Seven report earnings, starting with Tesla (TSLA) after markets close on Wednesday. Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet and Meta Platforms will report exactly a week later, followed by Apple (AAPL) and Amazon next Thursday. According to analysts surveyed by FactSet, the Mag 7’s earnings grew an estimated 14.9% last quarter, more than twice as fast as the so-called “Other 493” (6.7%). That gap would be larger without Tesla, which is expected to report its fourth straight quarter of contraction as it contends with inflation and high borrowing costs that have put a new car out of reach for many consumers. The only other company that is expected to report earnings declined since last year is Amazon, where profit likely fell by less than 1%, according to analyst estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. The rest of the Mag 7 companies with earnings in the next two weeks are expected to say their profits grew between 1% (Alphabet) and 10% (Microsoft) last quarter. The “Other 493” are expected to continue to close the earnings gap over the next year. The Mag 7’s earnings growth is expected to hold steady around 15% through the first quarter of 2026, while the rest of the index’s growth rate is forecast to accelerate to 11% in the first quarter of 2026 and eventually reach 14.6% in the third quarter of next year, according to FactSet Research. That said, the Mag 7 could outperform expectations as they did in the second quarter when earnings grew nearly 27%, easily outpacing Wall Street’s forecast for 14%.

Title: Samsung Galaxy XR hands-on: Just the opening act

Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. October 21, 2025 For nearly a year, Samsung has been hyping up a new XR headset, previously known as Project Moohan. Now, finally, we know everything there is to know about the device, which is officially called the Samsung Galaxy XR. It’s the product of a massive collaboration between Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm, and it’s packed with impressive tech. I got to spend some time with the device at Samsung’s New York City launch event last week, and I want to say something a little unexpected, something I noticed after testing it. While Samsung clearly wants to sell as many of these as possible — it is a business chasing profit, after all — it was also made clear to me at the keynote that the well-known Apple Vision Pro sales failure is hanging heavy over this launch. In fact, this is one of the few launches I’ve ever been to in which the presenters actively told us that this product is “just the beginning” and that better things are on the way. So that leads us to the big question, which is whether or not you will actually buy this $1,799 headset. And let me tell you a secret: I think Samsung isn’t expecting you to. After my hands-on demo, it was clear that this headset is likely a foundational product designed to pave the way for the real revolution: future smart glasses powered by Android XR. Before I get into all that, though, let me tell you about the headset. If you’ve ever used a VR headset before, there are no real surprises here. The Galaxy XR hasn’t changed all that much from when it was first shown off as a prototype way back in December 2024. It has a glass front that protects multiple cameras and sensors. There are thick straps that connect the main headset to the back padding, which has a big dial on it for tightening or loosening the straps. There are three buttons on the headset: a multi-function button on the top right, and then a volume rocker on the top left. It was comfortable to wear, and it comes with removable light blockers that can help you be more immersed in your content by blocking off your peripheral vision. Conversely, you can remove them to keep yourself grounded in the real world (and hopefully offset any VR dizziness). Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority? Like Apple’s Vision Pro, the battery is not built into the headset. Instead, it’s a self-contained pack (see below) that connects to the device using a proprietary pin system. You can keep the battery in your pocket or rest it on the couch next to you while you are immersed in the VR world. The reason the Galaxy XR is designed this way is to keep that hefty battery weight off your head, which should make it more comfortable to use it for extended periods. According to Samsung, you should be able to get about two hours of use based on one battery pack charge. There’s been no word on whether or not you’ll be able to buy additional battery packs. Inside the headset are two displays (3,552 x 3,840 at 60Hz, 72Hz, or 90Hz) that automatically adjust themselves based on your face. This is made possible thanks to multiple sensors and cameras inside that perform eye-tracking functions. This means you don’t need to fiddle with knobs or move the lenses around to get the right focus — the headset does all the adjustments for you. For audio, there are small speakers above your ears that blast the sound out. This allows you to avoid wearing headphones and also lets you still hear the real world around you. Of course, if you’d prefer to use Bluetooth headphones, that’s totally fine, as the headset supports Bluetooth connections of all kinds, including earbuds, gaming controllers, mice and keyboards, and more. Unfortunately, the Galaxy XR doesn’t come with any of that stuff. When you buy it, you just get the headset and the battery pack. Samsung has made VR-style controllers specifically for the Galaxy XR, but they are an additional purchase. The fact that the headset doesn’t come with controllers is not such a big deal, though, as Google and Samsung want you to use your hands and your voice for controls all the time. So how do you use it without controllers? This is where the magic of the device really becomes apparent. Outside the headset, multiple cameras and sensors track everything your hands do in real-time. There are lots of downward-facing cameras on the front that capture your hand motions. Using these, you can control the operating system with hand gestures. A pinch acts as a left mouse click, and a pinch and hold acts as holding down the left mouse button, so you can drag windows around. You can use two hands to pinch to zoom in and out. Turning your hand around and pinching opens menus. Meanwhile, the eye-tracking cameras inside are monitoring your eyes at all times. This allows you to simply look at something and the headset understands what you’re looking at, which makes controlling things faster and easier. With this combination of hand- and eye-tracking, you can manipulate things in your VR environment without needing to hold a controller or have any sort of apparatus on your hands or wrists. The headset also offers opportunities for augmented reality experiences. The real world can be projected into the headset in full color with very low latency. Using Circle to Search, you could circle pretty much anything in the real world and do a search for it. Of course, you probably wouldn’t be caught dead wearing this around town, but it is fully wireless, so you could if you wanted to. The Galaxy XR hardware is all Samsung, but the software — known as Android XR — is all Google. As its name suggests, this is based on Android, so it works very similarly to what you’ve been using on your phones and tablets for nearly two decades. I expected it to come with something like One UI on board with a distinctly Samsung-ified look and feel, but instead, all I saw everywhere was Google apps in their usual stock style. There was nothing in the software that said Samsung at all, at least nothing that was shown in the keynote or demoed for me during my session. Every single thing was Google this and Google that. Where’s Galaxy AI? Where’s One UI? Where are the Samsung apps? Where’s Bixby? Regardless, because Android XR is based on Android, nearly every app and game on the Play Store will automatically work with the headset. It will present the app in its native format in a 2D window, and you can use it as normal. However, we do have a lot of unanswered questions about the OS. Will it be available to any company that wants to make a headset, just like Android is available to any company that wants to make a phone? How much will companies be able to customize it? How often will devices get updates? I asked a Google rep about all this, and they said that the company would announce all that in due time. So what is it actually like using this thing? At its core, the Galaxy XR is simply a VR headset with multiple opportunities for entertainment. The two most significant differentiators from the competition are its gaming prowess and the deep integration of Google’s Gemini. If you’re a gamer, you should know that this headset is going to be much better for gaming than the Apple Vision Pro and maybe even the Meta Quest 3. It will support Steam VR games when connected to a VR-ready PC and will also support 2D games through existing apps like Steam Link and Moonlight. It will also support pretty much every game on the Google Play Store. Connecting a standard controller to the headset via Bluetooth is dead simple. As mentioned earlier, you’ll be able to get VR-style controllers from Samsung as an additional purchase, opening the doors to all sorts of existing VR games. Apple made a big mistake by not working hard to support these kinds of experiences with the Vision Pro, so it’s great to see Google and Samsung aren’t making the same mistake. Even more significant than gaming, though, is Gemini. When Google announced Android XR at the end of 2024, it specifically called out that it was the first operating system designed from the ground up for what it calls the Gemini era. In other words, Android XR was built with Gemini already in mind. As such, it permeates everywhere throughout the operating system. You can activate Gemini at any time by holding down the multi-function button. This allows you to not only speak to Gemini but also easily show it your display, allowing you to ask questions about what you’re doing. For example, you could be playing a game and pull up Gemini to help you out with it. You wouldn’t need to explain anything to it, because it would be able to see the game, what level you’re on, your character’s health, and all that. If you have a bunch of windows open within your virtual environment, you can just ask Gemini to organize them for you. The really cool thing is that you can do this conversationally using Gemini Live; you don’t need to say “Hey Gemini” all the time. The demos I tried really hammered home how central Gemini is to the experience. The first thing I saw was Google Photos. The app looks and works just like it does on your phone, but the software can make any photo stereoscopic, which means it appears to have depth. You can easily turn this on or off with any photo in your library, and the depth effect is created on-device on the fly. Gemini works here for helping you find specific photos without needing to scroll through. Just say, “Show me my photos from our trip to France, Gemini.” After Google Photos, we jumped into Google Maps. You start out with an aerial view of the Earth, as if you were floating in space. You can then tell Gemini to take you anywhere you like, and you’ll zoom into that area, floating above it like a bird. You can then zoom in even further to explore places in street view, so it feels like you’re walking around the destination. Here, you can have a chat with Gemini as you’re exploring. Let’s say you spot a landmark; you can simply look at it and ask Gemini about it, and the AI will tell you whatever you want to know. The really cool thing, though, is you can actually walk inside select buildings. Google does this by using AI to stitch together existing photos and videos available on Google Maps, creating a realistic 3D environment. There are already over 1,000 locations in New York that work for this, such as the restaurant in the video below. Finally, we tried YouTube. I viewed an immersive 360-degree video shot specifically for headsets like the Galaxy XR, as well as an interactive 3D film where I could reach out and “touch” objects. I also watched one of my own videos that was automatically converted to be stereoscopic, which was pretty cool. However, that specific feature will not work when you take the Galaxy XR out of the box. Eventually, it will work on most YouTube videos, but it will be a while before it’s active. The Samsung Galaxy XR starts at $1,799, which is literally half the price of the Apple Vision Pro. While this definitely makes the device more affordable, $1,800 is still very, very expensive. This isn’t a tech product you just decide to buy one day. The Vision Pro has also been a well-established bomb for Apple, with sales figures estimated to be less than one million units. Samsung might be undercutting Apple on price by a wide margin, but that doesn’t change the fact that it’s launching into a market that even Apple, the master of busting up existing markets, couldn’t crack. This is why I think the Galaxy XR is just an opening act. The real revolution will be smart glasses that do most of the things the Galaxy XR can do, but do it in the real world. We know this is coming, too, because Samsung and Google are already hyping them up with partnerships with Warby Parker and Gentle Monster. If Samsung and its partners can make smart glasses that allow you to bring Android XR with you wherever you go and include an AI companion that can jump in and help you whenever needed, it could have a revolution on its hands. The Galaxy XR seems like a terrific product, but it’s still, at its core, just another VR headset. Most people who buy this will use it to play games and watch movies in their homes, by themselves. That doesn’t add up to a device that changes your life — that adds up to a TV screen you attach to your face. The idea that you can already do that with existing devices— and have been able to for a decade — makes this feel less like a revolutionary new product and more like a way-too-late entry into a plateaued market. So, will you buy the Galaxy XR? Or will you wait for the real revolution, which will be future smart glasses with Android XR on board? Based on what I saw, this is a very impressive tech demo that serves as a foundation for something much greater. It’s a device that feels designed to get developers and early adopters hooked on the Android XR ecosystem. But, in the end, all it’s doing is preparing them for the main event that’s still to come.

Title: MindsEye employees renew allegations that GTA ex-producer Leslie Benzies’ Build a Rocket Boy was chaotic, mismanaged

The MindsEye fallout saga continues as new allegations have surfaced from former employees, detailing years of chaos behind the game's development, which was released in June to poor reviews and criticism that ranged from disappointed users to those that called it 'one of the worst games' they had ever played. Once eagerly watched in part due to Benzies’ role in elevating the Grand Theft Auto series into a cultural icon, Build A Rocket Boy secured over $300 million by 2024 and expanded to 448 employees across offices in Edinburgh, Budapest, and Montpellier. While it was initially focused on the ambitious multiplayer RPG Everywhere, which promised user-generated content in a futuristic open world, the studio shifted gears to MindsEye, which was originally perceived as a tie-in experience within Everywhere. Former employees have painted a grim picture of internal dysfunction, with one staff member, Jamie, who left BARB in 2022, telling the BBC that “Leslie never decided what game he wanted to make,” leading to “no coherent direction” that “plagued the project from the start.” Former lead data analyst, Ben Newbon, spoke about constant “knee-jerk” decisions from upper management, where critical feedback was consistently “ignored and never actioned.” At the same time, Benzies’ micromanagement manifested into what the team started to call “Leslie tickets” or “Leslie bugs.” All direct instructions from Leslie Benzies took precedence over the development team's ongoing work, disrupting teams' ability to manage their own workflows. Margherita “Marg” Peloso, a former associate producer, also chimed in and stated that any attempts to raise concern were “laughed at in meetings with the bosses.” This resulted in a culture where staff members felt “commanded to give a lot to the company without too much in return.” A former audio programmer, Isaac Hudd, mentioned how the rapid feature additions requested at the behest of Benzies at “breakneck speed” were too hasty for proper implementation, resulting in regressions where one team’s additions undid another team’s fixes. Hudd further stated, “And it does mess with you. You really do start to see the morale go down, and the little arguments start to happen. People burning the candle at both ends and starting to think: ‘What's the point?’” Earlier this month, between 250 and 300 BARB staff were laid off, most of whom were based in the Edinburgh studio. The IWGB union’s Game Workers Branch, on behalf of the staff members, announced that it would be taking legal action. For its part, Build A Rocket Boy claims in a statement that it would handle the redundancy process with “care and transparency” before mentioning that it was “committed to learning and growing.” In the statement, the studio further detailed, “Leslie and the entire senior management team take full responsibility for MindsEye’s initial launch. The version of the game that was released did not reflect the experience our community deserved.” Despite shipping hotfixes and Update 4 to address bugs and improve gameplay, former staff like Newbon call the whole situation a “wasted” opportunity for Scotland's gaming scene amid industry-wide layoffs, which have exceeded tens of thousands in recent years. The whole MindsEye fiasco has caused the lead actor to fear for future employment, and IO Interactive is taking a break from its third-party publishing ventures.Buy MindsEye on Amazon BBC

Title: CNN In Flux as Warner Bros. Discovery Mulls Sale: ‘People Want This Phase to Be Over’

Pro Available to WrapPRO members With prospective suitors from Comcast to Paramount eyeing CNN’s parent company, network staffers grapple with more uncertainty and hope for a responsible steward rather than a “scavenger” Just days after David Zaslav took the reins of a newly merged Warner Bros. Discovery in April 2022, the chief executive shuttered CNN+, a $300 million streaming subscription service that barely got off the ground. Now, as the network prepares for next week’s launch of its streaming successor, “All Access,” Zaslav dropped more big news on staffers: WBD is for sale. Launching yet another streaming service amid another possible deal marks the latest twist in the CNN ownership saga, as the network has shuffled between corporate parents over the past decade, from Time Warner to the AT&T-owned WarnerMedia, in 2018, to the eventual Warner Bros. Discovery, in 2022. With the prospect of more changes coming, the mood inside CNN on Tuesday, one staffer told TheWrap, “is less concern about who buys us and more about the uncertainty of it all,” adding: “I think people just want to know they’ll have a job.” Such anxiety reflects the shifting stewardship and editorial strategies in recent years at CNN as the groundbreaking linear cable network charts its course in the digital world. Another staffer was more blunt: “People want this phase to be over.” Chatter about WBD selling off CNN alone has only ratcheted up amid the company’s decision to open itself for sale either as a whole or in parts, with Zaslav saying in a memo on Tuesday that “multiple parties” expressed interest in the company. This is separate from its prior plan to split into Warner Bros. (HBO Max, its film and television studios) and networks-and-sports-focused Discovery Global (cable networks including TNT and CNN, among others), and potentially accelerates the chaos to come. It’s just the latest bout of turbulence for CNN, which has seen a string of different CEOs since 2021, from Jeff Zucker to Chris Licht and now Mark Thompson, a former New York Times chief executive whose two-year CNN tenure has been focused on carrying the network into the digital age and who faces his greatest test next week with the “All Access” launch. CNN laid off 200 staffers earlier this year as part of a digital-and-streaming pivot and is banking on cord-cutters’ willingness to pay $6.99 a month for a selection of live and on-demand programming. The second staffer told TheWrap that, while their colleagues have sought some level of stability, they’re more eager to see a buyer who wants to let CNN fulfill its digital ambitions and capitalize on its expertise in international reporting. “I don’t think that the folks that have been in charge — beyond Mark Thompson, the folks that write Mark’s checks — have really had a full vision of what CNN can be and what its mission should be going into the future,” the staffer said. “My aspiration is that whoever comes in and buys us has a set of values that they not only communicate to us, but also to the world, and that they foster an independent journalism that we can be proud of.” A CNN spokesperson referred TheWrap to the WBD memo. Now, the network’s future could hinge on another owner, perhaps a company with a major stake in the news business, such as NBCUniversal parent Comcast, or a streamer like Netflix, both of which are reportedly among the interested parties. WBD’s announcement came after it rejected Paramount’s latest bid to purchase the company wholesale this week, according to the Wall Street Journal. Clearly, Paramount has already demonstrated a willingness to shake up a storied news brand, with newly minted CEO David Ellison quickly installing a conservative think tank veteran as a network watchdog and completing his $150 million purchase of The Free Press, opinion journalist Bari Weiss’ contrarian news outlet. Ellison installed Weiss as CBS News’ editor-in-chief, where she immediately leaned into coverage of the Israel-Gaza war, a subject close to her and Ellison. Expanding his reach into a 24/7 cable news operation like CNN would allow Ellison to tap into its expansive newsgathering operation and synergies (CNN primetime staple Anderson Cooper remains a “60 Minutes” correspondent, and “CBS Mornings” host Gayle King led a short-lived talk show with Charles Barkley between 2023 and 2024) while his own Paramount undergoes layoffs, staving off a potential total brain drain of talent. Should Comcast make a play for the combined Warner Bros. Discovery, they would once again gain a cable news network alongside its own broadcast news operation. Comcast is in the process of spinning off its cable networks, stripping NBC News of its cable counterpart MSNBC and forcing the two networks to move forward as distinct brands and without shared correspondents. Given this, Comcast may only be interested in the Warner Bros. studio assets and its valuable IP, so there’s reason to be skeptical CNN would be included in any deal. A potential Netflix acquisition of the whole company would bring the streamer fully into the news business, something its competitors have only toyed with. The company has said previously it would not enter the breaking news business, but as its scale has grown and its stances on other sectors — sports, ad-supported tiers — have changed, its ability to manage a large-scale news organization could prove more successful than Amazon’s subdued election night program with Brian Williams last year or the streaming components launched by ABC, NBC and CBS for their news programs. It would also give Netflix a new avenue to compete with Amazon, which was reportedly considering other ways to break into news, though Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said during the company’s earnings call Tuesday the company still has “no interest in owning legacy media networks,” so it could be more interested in Warner Bros.’ studio and streaming business on its own. Netflix did not respond to an immediate request for comment. While there’s surely uncertainty about CNN’s future, Fox Business senior correspondent Charles Gasparino pointed out Sunday that “for all the talk about declining ratings,” the network is “immensely profitable.” “Now I fully understand the concept of cord cutting etc., but the place has a deep news infrastructure, a global presence and it’s in the middle of a restructuring to [adapt] to changes in the way people view news,” Gasparino said. “Moreover it’s still very relevant. People talk about it all the time. It’s in almost every airport and hotel lobby. I speak to bankers all the time, and they tell me this thing has massive potential, probably more so than the Free Press. Zas knows this.” CNN is currently valued at around $5 billion, Bloomberg Intelligence estimates, based on approximately $750 million in EBITDA, per the company’s earnings reports, and $1.75 billion in revenue at a 6.5 times multiple. For now, the network soldiers on as Warner Bros. Discovery continues its plan to split its streaming and studios businesses from its networks. But it’s that infrastructure and presence the second CNN staffer wants to see maintained should a sale go forward, one that doesn’t include the yearslong series of questions about what its corporate owners want to do with the 45-year-old news organization. “I hate to evoke Jeff Zucker, because that’s in the past, but when we had a different sort of corporate structure and we had Jeff Zucker in charge, we never heard anything about Time Warner or AT&T,” they said. “That stuff was so beyond anything that impacted us day to day, where now we’ve had, over the last few years, a consistent drumbeat of speculation and analysis about how our corporate ownership looks at us, what they want out of us, how they’re building a strategy around us. From the day that we were purchased, there was a conversation about whether we would be merged down the road, and questions about strategy more broadly, and I don’t think that that helps the process.” The staffer said a new suitor should want to honor CNN’s legacy of reporting, and appreciate its “enormous value if they let us do good work.” “My fear is that, given the landscape, there’s a good chance that a scavenger comes along and rides the wave of cable disintegration and irrelevance and either dismantles us for parts or merges us with something that already has a lot of redundancies and that we see CNN dwindle into irrelevance,” the staffer said.

Title: Amazon Plans to Replace 600,000 Human Workers With Robots, Report Says
URL: https://www.cnet.com/tech/amazon-plans-to-replace-600000-human-workers-with-robots-report-says/
Time Published: 2025-10-22T00:01:43Z

The retail giant plans to expand its non-human workforce, with the goal of automating 75% of its operations, according to The New York Times. Amazon may use robots to displace warehouse workers in big numbers. Robots have been a staple at Amazon warehouses for more than a decade, performing tasks formerly completed by humans, including picking, sorting and moving packages. Now, Amazon plans to make human labor less necessary in its facilities by replacing more than half a million jobs with robots, The New York Times reports. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. Internal Amazon documents suggest that the company is looking into building and using more robots to replace human workers. The publication doesn't specify if this will result in massive layoffs. However, the robots would allow Amazon to avoid hiring new workers to meet increasing demand, translating to 600,000 jobs replaced by 2033, according to the report. Amazon announced in June that it had hit a workforce milestone of deploying more than 1 million robots in its fulfillment and delivery network, making it about two-thirds the size of the company's human workforce. The Amazon documents show that the company's goal is to automate 75% of its operations, The Times reported. The shift to increase the role of robots in Amazon's warehouse could save the company billions of dollars each year. Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak estimated the annual savings to be as high as $4 billion by 2027, according to a CNBC report. The report also says the company wants to mitigate the fallout in communities that may lose jobs. Documents show the company has considered building an image as a "good corporate citizen" through greater participation in community events such as local parades and Toys for Tots. And the leaked documents discuss avoiding using terms like automation and AI, instead using terms such as "advanced technology," and replacing the word "robot" with "cobot" to suggest collaboration. "Leaked documents often paint an incomplete and misleading picture of our plans, and that's the case here," an Amazon spokesperson told CNET in an email. "In this instance, the materials appear to reflect the perspective of just one team and don't represent our overall hiring strategy across our various operations business lines -- now or moving forward." The spokesperson said "no company has created more jobs in America over the past decade than Amazon" and that the company is actively hiring at operations facilities, with plans to fill 250,000 positions for the holiday season. Amazon is the third biggest employer in the US, behind the federal government and Walmart. To date, the company employs an estimated 1.5 million employees, most of whom work in warehouses or as delivery drivers. Only a handful of companies in the US have more than 600,000 employees on the payroll. Delivery company FedEx has an estimated 550,000 employees. Reducing its size as reported by The Times would be akin to FedEx disappearing entirely. Studies have been done on the impact of robots on human wages. As of 2020, every robot added by a company per 1,000 workers reduces US wages by 0.42% and has cost humans an estimated 400,000 jobs. "Our investments will continue to create substantial employment, emphasizing higher-paying positions," Amazon said in an email.

Title: The 3 Best Growth Stocks To Buy For November 2025

Time Published: 2025-10-21T21:30:02Z
Full Content:
ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Applied Digital is a rapidly expanding AI data center operator, securing large contracts and building new capacity to meet soaring demand.Broadcom is a strong contender in AI infrastructure, providing innovative, cost-effective custom AI chips that outperform competitors.Eli Lilly dominates the booming diabetes- and obesity-drug markets with blockbuster products and has a robust pipeline of new treatments. It's tough to say for sure which growth stocks will be winners without a crystal ball. But investors may wish to consider investing in AI data center operator Applied Digital, AI semiconductor provider Broadcom and the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly. These three companies have solid prospects for gains in addition to some better-known companies, such as Nvidia and Palantir. Applied Digital, Broadcom and Lilly have the potential to rise in the short and long term. If they beat earnings targets and raise guidance, their share prices will keep rising. If they tap their strong competitive positions to win more market share, they'll see lasting success. These stocks were selected based on their rapid growth, good chance of exceeding expectations, and strong products and management. If a company is growing rapidly now and has a track record of beating expectations, its stock is likely to rise. However, to sustain those increases over time, a company must innovate. If the company has great products and excellent management, better-than-expected growth is more likely to last. The three best growth stocks are ranked below in descending order of their stock price change in 2025 as of Oct. 21. More generally, the three stocks are ranked from the highest to lowest return and risk. Read on to learn why. Although it is not profitable, Applied Digital has grown rapidly. In the company's first quarter of fiscal 2026, revenue increased 84% to $64.2 million, exceeding analyst expectations by $14.2 million, CNBC reported. Applied Digital is benefiting from soaring demand for AI data centers. An estimated $350 billion will be spent in 2025 by large cloud services providers called hyperscalers. CoreWeave – a leading AI cloud services provider – recently leased 150 megawatts of Applied Digital’s Polaris Forge 1 campus, bringing Applied Digital’s total anticipated contracted lease revenue to about $11 billion over 15 years, CNBC also reported. Strong demand for Applied Digital’s services looks likely to continue at least through 2026. That's one reason, the company is building a 200 megawatt Polaris Forge 2 campus and is in “advanced discussions with hyperscalers,” according to CRN, with management projecting leased capacity for both Applied Digital campuses as high as 600 MW. Broadcom is benefiting from demand for AI infrastructure. In the company’s third quarter of fiscal year 2025, AI semiconductor revenue grew 53% to $5.2 billion. The company is also gaining from a shift in AI chip architecture through Broadcom’s 65% revenue share of application-specific integrated circuits for hyperscalers, according to Ainvest. Broadcom provides hyperscalers with AI chips that deliver faster performance at lower prices than Nvidia’s products. The chip provider’s clients include Google, Meta, ByteDance and reportedly OpenAI, “representing a strategic alternative to purchasing Nvidia's GPUs," CNBC said. More specifically, Broadcom’s custom AI accelerators deliver three to five times better performance-per-watt than Nvidia GPUs at a roughly $20,000 to $15,000 lower per unit cost, Datagravity estimated. Such innovation has enabled Broadcom to exceed Wall Street expectations for eight consecutive quarters, typically resulting in 10% to 20% stock increases on earnings-announcement days, Ainvest reported. Broadcom’s stock price could rise in November. A September announcement of a $10 billion order for the Titan AI inference chip from a fourth hyperscale customer— believed to be OpenAI —demonstrates Broadcom is winning new hyperscale customers. Though this program is scheduled to begin in the third quarter of fiscal year 2026, pre-production revenue and additional design wins could emerge in fourth-quarter 2025 results, Tom's Hardware predicted. Eli Lilly is an American pharmaceutical company combining strong profitability and rapid growth with its market-leading diabetes and obesity treatments. Lilly’s latest financial results, in the second quarter of 2025 showed that revenue rose 38% to $15.56 billion, with net income increasing 91% to nearly $6.7 billion, according to a company release. Lilly dominates the market for diabetes and weight loss drugs. More specifically, Lilly controls about 57% of the U.S. market for incretins – enjoying a competitive advantage over rival Novo Nordisk, Reuters reported. Lilly has experienced rapid growth in demand for two drugs: Mounjaro, which helps manage blood-sugar levels in adults with diabetes, and Zepbound, for treating obesity and weight-related conditions. In Q2, sales of these products grew 68% to $5.2 billion for Mounjaro and 172% to nearly $3.4 billion for Zepbound. The company communicated its optimism about future growth, raising its full-year 2025 guidance above Wall Street expectations. It's projecting $60 billion to $62 billion in revenue and EPS between $21.75 and $23.00 amid strong demand. A new obesity treatment called retatrutide, which is expected to report positive trial results late in 2025, provides another reason for optimism, Pharmaceutical-Journal noted. Moreover, An Alzheimer’s therapy called donanemab, sold under the brand name Kisunla, was approved in 2025 and could help Lilly exceed investor’s revenue expectations. Investors looking for stocks with upside potential may consider betting on shares of Applied Digital, Broadcom and Eli Lilly. While Applied Digital is losing money and investing to build capacity, its rapid revenue growth and feverish demand from hyperscalers makes it a compelling short-term investment. Broadcom is a much larger, profitable beneficiary of AI chip demand while Lilly’s commanding lead in the booming markets for treatment of diabetes and obesity is propelling rapid growth, which could be even faster if the company shares positive results from new drug trials.

Hyman is an economist and financial analyst specializing in the energy sector. He headed utility equity research at a major brokerage house and… More Info Here is a funny thing about valuation “bubbles” involving financial instruments. In every individual case, you unavoidably end up asking: "What were they thinking?” Or stated differently, what causes a significant part of the supposedly rational investing public to collectively lose their minds for a relatively brief period? A few tulip bulbs, for example, were valued more highly than a modest Amsterdam house in 1637, until they weren’t. Leveraged speculation in frontier commodity markets of Asia and America led to the South Sea Bubble and the Mississippi Bubble in Europe in the 1720s. The seventeenth and eighteenth-century bubbles were commodity bubbles: tulips, spices, or beaver pelts. But the Railway Mania in the UK in the mid-1840s focused on an amazing new technology, railroads, marketed to the public as risk-free investments. That the British railroad companies' shares ultimately soared and then lost more than two-thirds of their value, immiserating a large portion of the investing public, is almost besides the point. Bubbles always end badly by definition. But the UK’s railway mania is instructive because it was the first truly modern bubble which had all three components of more recent financial bubbles: 1) a new technology, railroads for moving goods and people, the long term economic impacts of which are unclear; 2) financial innovation usually involving leverage or speculation and 3) a government that either participates in the scheme or has little inclination to intervene in financial markets (until it’s too late). Related: Tanker Explosion Off Yemen Deepens Red Sea Security Fears for LPG Trade Using this as a framework, it seems fair to ask if today’s AI stocks, which have substantially outperformed broad market indices, are in a financial bubble? But we’re utility analysts asking this question for a simple reason. The demands for new electric power-generating facilities supposedly required by AI are simply staggering both in amount and expense. For example, the highly respected Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) expects new AI-related electricity demand to reach 50 gigawatts (GW) by 2030. A Deloitte study showed AI electric demand increasing from 4GW now to 123 GW by 2035. And Sam Altman’s Open AI Consortium (including Softbank and Oracle) stated it would need roughly 250 GW by 2033, which at today’s prices would cost over half a trillion bucks to build. (To put these numbers in context, total generating capacity in the USA, presently, is 1,300 GW, growing about 30 GW per year.) All we can say is that with respect to power costs, the AI industry is behaving as if they are either irrelevant or simply a modest expense item, neither of which is true. Utility assets and AI data centers resemble each other in that both are highly capital-intensive, but with one big difference. The heart of a utility is a power plant that lasts forty years (an annual depreciation rate of 2.5%). The primary cost component of a data center is the vast array of computer chips, which have a relatively short life, maybe 2-3 years. A capital asset with a two-year life has a 50% depreciation rate, creating a very large expense item on the income statement, which has to be covered by revenues from the business or by increased corporate borrowing. That still doesn’t make the AI/data center boom a bubble, but it does suggest our next concern. Capital expenditures for AI and data centers seem high. Not just to us. In fact, economists have noted that in the first half of 2025, AI-related capital expenditures contributed more to US domestic growth than consumer spending. This marks a dramatic reversal of prior trends, where consumer spending has been responsible for the bulk of economic activity. All we can conclude here is that this highlights the biggest financial risk for AI investors: will all these new facilities earn a competitive return on all this new, invested capital? Will there be enough revenues to support these new assets? We know the level of planned capex and that there are exciting uses for this technology. We do not know how much people will pay for these services, and therein lies a huge risk. This boom (bubble?) reminds us of the power-generating bubble that burst in the early days of the century. When the power generating market was opened to competition, a host of legacy electricity firms, bankers, entrepreneurs, pipelines, European utilities, and crooks piled in to build a multitude of power plants, encouraged by favorable forward price curves and plenty of low-cost borrowed money. They knew that all the construction (if completed) would produce a power glut, but they all believed that the other guy would back down and not build, thereby preventing an oversupply. Well, the other guys did not back down, demand for power was weak, and carnage followed. There are other related risks here, such as the role of vendor financing. The biggest players in this area (Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Nvidia) are financially robust. But they support an ecosystem of smaller vendors and suppliers who rely exclusively for their infrastructure and software on the aforementioned giants. This creates a circular financing scheme where one group sells products to another wholly captive or financially dependent group while purchasing their services. In a bubble, this is all financed with common stock issuances at ever higher valuations. Which works until it doesn’t. Then the house of cards falls down, as it did in the housing and dot-com bubbles earlier this century. The AI boom assumes that the tech bros in California, choosing an AI strategy, picked the right horse. The Chinese seem to think otherwise, offering less expensive AI solutions to less expensive problems, more or less. Chinese industry has shown, with government help, a remarkable ability to take ideas from abroad and commercialize them into a lower-cost product. AI is in their targets. That may put these huge American AI investments at risk. So don’t start to count the profits. Let’s conclude with these observations about financial bubbles. First, there is a kind of conflation in the term between genuinely nonsensical ideas and those viable corporations whose shares were simply grossly misvalued. When the dot-com bubble burst around the year 2000, the shares of Amazon declined by over 90%. But it is still around, bigger than ever. Pet food supplier Pets.com, on the other hand, which lost money on every sale, is not. If we go back to our original example of the British railway mania of the 1840s, we can observe something similar. Those railroads, which provided an enormous economic boost to a rapidly industrializing British economy, also caused grievous financial injury to a generation of investors because of the wild misvaluation of the fledgling industry employing a radically new technology, the steam engine. But the legacy of that technology bubble was a fully functioning national railway system that still exists. So, after this AI and data center investor euphoria passes, the investors lose their money and the smoke lifts, what remains, just ashes or many valuable, profitable, important businesses?

Amazon layoffs just took a futuristic turn. Leaked internal documents suggest the company could replace 600,000 U.S. jobs with robots by 2027 — part of a $12.6 billion automation drive. By 2027, around 160,000 warehouse roles may vanish as machines take over picking and packing. Amazon says it’s not a mass firing — just “efficiency.” But the data paints a different story: fewer human hands, more robots, and a rapidly changing future of work. 5 Stories 7 Stories 9 Stories 9 Stories 8 Stories 6 Stories (Catch all the Technology News News, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Title: Millionaire tax that inspired Mamdani fuels $5.7 billion haul in Massachusetts
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/10/21/zohran-mamdani-millionaire-tax-massachusetts-5-7-billion/
Time Published: 2025-10-21T17:43:25Z
Full Content:
A millionaire levy in Massachusetts that New York City mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani holds up as a model for taxing the rich has generated $3 billion more in revenue than expected without forcing significant high-profile departures from the state. In the two years since the state started charging a 4% surtax on incomes over $1 million, the effort has created a $5.7 billion windfall, with the surplus being used to fund bridge repairs, bolster literacy programs and address the transportation system’s budget deficit. While other states have progressive tax brackets, the Massachusetts law stands out structurally in its targeting of incomes that exceed seven figures. That has infuriated business leaders who complain it makes the state less competitive and drives away the wealthy. Several are even backing ballot proposals to lower the state income levy and limit how much tax revenue can be collected in any given year as a way to diffuse the millionaire’s fee. Some high-profile names have moved away, including Robert Reynolds, the former chief executive officer of Putnam Investments. But other anecdotes of bold-faced names or companies ditching Massachusetts are harder to come by, in contrast to tales of departures from New York, Chicago and San Francisco. That may change as more Internal Revenue Service data is released in the coming months, potentially bolstering the case for the tax or providing evidence of how it can undermine a state’s appeal to the wealthy. Boston Mayor Michelle Wu — whom Mamdani has called a role model — recently chastised executives for complaining about the tax. She contends that the region’s talent pool and livability are more important to its economic competitiveness. Many high-income taxpayers are staying in the Boston area despite the tax hike. “At the end of the day, I happen to believe it’s a phenomenal place to live,” said Sam Slater, a real estate developer who lives in the Boston suburb of Weston and pays the millionaire’s tax. Slater, 41, could live anywhere: His real estate firm has holdings nationwide. He travels frequently for his side job producing films starring big names like Mark Wahlberg. His holdings including a piece of the National Hockey League’s Seattle Kraken. He even spent part of his childhood in West Palm Beach, Florida, a favorite refuge for wealthy executives looking to flee high taxes and winters. But he’s staying put. His family has roots in the region, and they also like Boston’s culture, sports teams and seasons, Slater said. Josh Isner, president of taser manufacturer Axon Enterprise Inc., said the millionaire’s tax makes it harder to recruit talent — particularly well-paid artificial intelligence specialists — to the Northeast hub the company opened in Boston last year. But the office is based in the city because “Boston breeds super-talented people,” he said earlier this year. He lives in Massachusetts, rather than near the company’s headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona, where income taxes are significantly lower. That’s largely because Massachusetts schools are so renowned, he said. Massachusetts voters approved the surtax in 2022, with the levy applying to income that exceeds the $1 million threshold. Mamdani, who has maintained a large lead in polls ahead of New York’s Nov. 4 mayoral election, cited the Massachusetts policy as a success story when he floated his own millionaire’s tax proposal. New York may prove different than Massachusetts. The Empire State already ranks dead last in the Tax Foundation’s competitiveness index with rates that are among the highest in the country. And while Mamdani has used billionaires as a foil in his campaign — he wants to raise levies on individuals and corporations to pay for his progressive agenda — Governor Kathy Hochul has ruled out approving increases. In Massachusetts, with a buoyant stock market helping to swell wealthy residents’ taxable wealth, the millionaire’s tax generated an estimated $3 billion in the fiscal year that ended June 30, more than double what state lawmakers had budgeted, according to the Massachusetts Department of Revenue. Collections a year earlier similarly exceeded expectations. The surtax has generated $5.7 billion in total. The extra cash has helped Governor Maura Healey ease the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s budget gap at a time when other states are slashing train and bus service. Healey’s now seeking to use $200 million of the money to address President Donald Trump’s cuts to research funding at Massachusetts institutions, one of the biggest threats to the state’s economy. The law that created the tax requires the funds to go toward education and transportation initiatives. “People who thought this tax would backfire will have to concede now that it generates a substantial amount of additional revenue,” said Evan Horowitz, executive director of Tufts University’s Center for State Policy Analysis. Still, he estimates that for every dollar the millionaire’s tax brings in, the state is likely to lose 20 to 50 cents in income taxes from those who leave or adopt tax-avoidance strategies. Those indirect losses are hard to pinpoint, he said. Individuals with incomes over $1 million were responsible for 35% of total payments in Massachusetts in 2022, the year before the millionaire’s tax took effect and the most recent period for which IRS data is available. Some high-profile executives have indeed decamped for lower-tax states because of the surcharge. Reynolds, the former Putnam Investments CEO, cited the combination of the millionaire’s tax and the Massachusetts estate tax. He moved to Florida last year, shortly after Franklin Templeton acquired Boston-based Putnam. The surtax “pushes you to make an earlier decision,” Reynolds said. The 73-year-old finance executive has been a fixture in Boston business circles for decades, having built Fidelity Investments’ 401(k) business before joining Putnam in 2008. He remains on the board of the Massachusetts Competitive Partnership, a collection of the state’s most powerful executives. Business leaders continue to warn that even if wealthy residents didn’t abandon the state in droves in the tax’s first years, the departures will add up over time — and ultimately hurt Massachusetts more than it helps. They point out that $1 million incomes don’t go as far as they used to, particularly in a high-cost state like Massachusetts. The median home price in the greater Boston area surpassed $1 million in June before falling back under that threshold again. “I haven’t been to one meeting in Boston since this passed where there haven’t been a number of people saying that they’re moving out of the state,” Reynolds said. Other high-profile Massachusetts residents who have moved are reluctant to blame the tax. Steve Pagliuca, a longtime Bain Capital executive and Boston Celtics co-owner, has said his recent move to Florida was due to family reasons and his retirement from day-to-day work at Bain, not the tax. He recently offered to acquire the Connecticut Sun women’s professional basketball team and relocate it to Boston. In the absence of clear data, supporters and critics of the millionaire’s tax alike have touted studies that support their arguments — even if they don’t tell the full story. A study by a progressive research organization found that the number of millionaires in Massachusetts jumped by 39% from 2022 to 2024, with the authors concluding the surtax is an effective policy tool. The report’s data measured wealth, however, not the income figures that determine who is subject to the tax. A separate survey conducted by a business advocacy group this year found that tax policy was the most-cited reason for residents’ moves elsewhere. Few of those surveyed are subject to the millionaire’s tax, though. The outflow of residents to other states also predates the surtax and reflects other factors such as high housing costs. Slater, the real estate developer, has friends who left Massachusetts for places like Florida and Texas — both because of the millionaire’s tax and for other reasons. While he has no plans to follow them, he’s concerned Massachusetts could increase the surcharge or add other taxes in the future. New increases have been on the table this year. Raise Up Massachusetts, the labor-backed group that proposed the millionaire’s tax, is now pushing to increase state duties on corporate foreign income. Healey also proposed new taxes on candy, prescription drugs and synthetic nicotine products — levies that the state legislature ultimately rejected. Should Massachusetts tax wealthy individuals further, Slater said he can’t say with certainty he’d stick around. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Earnings Preview: From Disney’s Kimmel Fallout to Paramount-WBD Drama, Our 5 Biggest Questions

Pro Available to WrapPRO members Expect fresh insight into linear and streaming as several big industry shifts are poised to play out over the coming quarters The final round of quarterly earnings updates for 2025 kick off with Netflix earnings on Tuesday afternoon, followed by Comcast next week and Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount and Disney in November. The financials will paint the latest picture on where these companies stand as they look to grow streaming profitability amid linear TV’s continued decline. Executives will also have the opportunity to address several major shifts set to take place across the media landscape in the coming quarters, including increased competition from YouTube, the copyright implications from OpenAI’s Sora 2, Comcast’s spin off of its cable network portfolio into Versant and David Ellison’s new vision for Paramount as the company pursues a potential acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery, which said on Tuesday its fielding interest from “multiple parties” for all or part of its business. “We were finally beginning to settle into a position where Netflix has won the streaming wars. It just feels like things are being thrown into flux again,” Third Bridge analyst John Conca told TheWrap. “We’re in a time of disruption.” Disney, Comcast and Paramount declined to comment on this story. Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery did not immediately return TheWrap’s request for comment. Here are five questions we hope to get more answers to as earnings season kicks off. After ending its quarterly disclosures at the end of 2024, Wall Street will be paying close attention to Netflix’s guidance around engagement, which has become the streamer’s new metric of success as it looks to scale its ad tier. Wedbush Securities analyst Alicia Reese told TheWrap that Netflix is finally at a turning point where the company’s ad tier is poised to become a primary revenue driver in 2026. She noted that Wedbush’s quarterly consumer survey indicates “pretty strong stability” in Netflix subscriber growth. “The retention is largely due to their ad supported tier,” she said. “They have the lowest ad delivery rates of anyone in streaming and I think their ads are becoming more and more relevant as they get better at targeting. That will only get better over time.” UBS analyst John Hodulik expects a 17% increase in revenue and 25% increase in operating income as a result of subscriber growth, higher pricing and increased ad revenues. He believes the return of shows like “Squid Game” and “Wednesday,” as well as new hits like “KPop Demon Hunters” and “Untamed,” will provide a boost to engagement and monetization. He expects that trend to continue with its fourth-quarter slate, which includes “The Witcher,” “Stranger Things” and the NFL Christmas Day games. Netflix will also add video podcasts to its platform in 2026 as part of a new partnership with Spotify, so expect to hear some commentary around that. Though Netflix itself has also been floated as a potential WBD suitor, J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth emphasized its “certainly not an acquisitive company” and added that a large, complex deal would “likely bog the company down for an extended period of time and potentially invite regulatory scrutiny.” Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters also shaded big media mergers earlier this month, noting they “don’t have an amazing track record.” Disney will report its first earnings results since its temporary suspension of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on ABC and affiliates owned by Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair Broadcasting. The move, which came in response to the late night host’s comments about Charlie Kirk’s alleged assassin, triggered calls to cancel Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ subscriptions. Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich expects Kimmel to have “little impact” on streaming churn in the quarter given the timing of billing cycles, though she predicted there could be a “modest” impact in Disney’s first fiscal quarter of 2026. On the advertising side, Seaport Research’s David Joyce estimated the Kimmel situation could have resulted in a $4.25 million hit, assuming a $30 average cost-per-thousand impressions (CPM) and 1.77 million average viewers, but acknowledged that could be easily recouped. Antenna revealed on Monday that the monthly churn rate for Disney+ and Hulu doubled in September to 5% and 10%, respectively, though it’s unclear how much of that was related directly to Kimmel. An insider told TheWrap that Antenna’s percentages are higher than what Disney is seeing internally. “Disney ultimately, and effectively we believe, resolved its controversies over the past couple of weeks, but the immediate follow-on with planned streaming price increases might compound the cancellations and put the +10 [million] net adds guidance at risk — but not likely by a wide margin,” Joyce said. Notably, ESPN+ will no longer report its subscriber and average revenue per user metrics starting this quarter, with Disney+ and Hulu set to follow suit in the company’s first quarter of 2026. An Antenna spokesperson told TheWrap that the estimated cancellation volumes for Disney+ and Hulu totaled 3 million and 4.1 million, compared to the averages of 1.2 million and 1.9 million, respectively, in the last three months. Disney+ had around 2.18 million sign-ups during the month, while Hulu had just over 2.1 million sign-ups, per Antenna. In addition to Kimmel, Wall Street will be paying close attention to any additional financial guidance for 2026, as well as commentary around Disney CEO succession updates, its new ESPN streamer and its impact on cord-cutting, the efforts to combine Disney+ and Hulu into a standalone app in 2026, the financial impact of its NBA rights renewal and loss of F1 rights, the outlook for their linear business, recent price hikes at their U.S. theme parks and the impact from competition with Universal’s Epic Universe. Ellison will finally take questions from Wall Street after the closing of Skydance Media’s $8 billion merger as he and president Jeff Shell outline their vision and provide updates on the company’s efforts to achieve $2 billion in cost savings. Those efforts include thousands of upcoming layoffs which are expected to kick off as soon as next week, a review of its real estate portfolio and finding efficiencies in other areas such as procurement and workflow. Leadership also said they would look to transform Paramount into a technological leader in entertainment, with plans to use tools like virtual production and AI, as well as leverage Skydance’s existing relationship with Larry Ellison’s Oracle and move Paramount+, Pluto TV and BET+ to a unified tech stack next year. Additionally the company has been investing more in content, setting new media rights deals with the UFC and Zuffa Boxing, new series such as Jeremy Strong’s “9/12” and Nicole Kidman and Elle Fanning’s “Discretion,” and striking deals with“South Park” creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, The Duffer Brothers and James Mangold. “It will probably be a few quarters before we really have a good idea of what this vision truly is,” Conca said. “It’s exciting and invigorating that we have seen them make the moves that they’ve made so far, but we don’t know where this might all end up going.” Analysts will also have an opportunity to ask Paramount about its pursuit of all of Warner Bros. Discovery and larger M&A strategy on the heels of its $150 million purchase of Bari Weiss’ The Free Press. When asked during Bloomberg’s Screentime conference, Ellison dodged talk about the WBD bid, but said he sees “a lot” of “actionable” M&A possibilities in the near-term. “We would approach that through the lens of wanting to make more, not less,” Ellison said. Conca says he’ll also be looking for specifics around Paramount’s content spend, how a WBD acquisition may or may not change the plans for holding onto its linear networks and the timeline for ramping up its content production on the film side. Speaking of Warner Bros. Discovery, the company revealed on Tuesday that it has launched a review of strategic alternatives after “unsolicited interest” from “multiple parties” for both the entire company and Warner Bros., its streaming and studios business that will separate from its linear networks business Discovery Global in April. The review comes as WBD reportedly rejected a $20 per share takeover bid from Paramount for being too low. Lightshed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield noted that, assuming the lowest price the WBD board is willing to entertain is $25 per share, the Ellisons could pay around $63 billion with $50 billion in cash, though he doesn’t believe they’d be interested in that option. They could also write a $30 billion check for WBD and raise $20 billion in new debt, along with issuing $12 billion to $13 billion of new Paramount stock to WBD shareholders. Additionally, analysts will be looking for any further guidance around HBO Max’s efforts to grow revenue, profitability and subscribers through its ongoing international expansion and looming password sharing crackdown, as well as the impact of WBD’s loss of its NBA rights to Amazon, NBCUniversal and Disney. Though it wasn’t included in the larger group, Warner notably reached a settlement with the league that will give TNT Sports and its portfolio of brands a global license to create, produce and distribute new and existing NBA content across its platforms, as well as international rights in Northern Europe and Latin America, excluding Mexico and Brazil. Morningstar Research analyst Matthew Dolgin told TheWrap it’s too soon to tell what the overall impact of the NBA loss will be, but that it’s an area he’ll be keeping an eye on. “Their recent pay TV renewals should keep the subscription line steady for now, but the extent of ad revenue declines and cash savings over the next couple of quarters will be important,” Dolgin said. Though many analysts have viewed Comcast as an ideal merger partner for WBD for years, the company faces difficulty in getting a deal done given its upcoming spin off of Versant, as well as the required financing for a competing bid against the world’s second richest man and potential regulatory hurdles from the Trump administration. “I would be very surprised if they were to get involved at this point. It seems like Paramount has the appetite to absorb both and then maybe deal with it later. I don’t see Comcast wanting to do that, at least as of now,” Conca said. “If we’re sitting here a year from now and there’s a full Warner Bros. Discovery unwinding and they’re spun off, I could see Comcast maybe getting involved for the studio piece and Versant getting involved for the cable networks, but I don’t see that now as they’re going through their own organizational reshuffle.” On the flip side, Wolfe Research analyst Peter Supino believes that Comcast should “try hard to buy it,” arguing it would have “much to gain” and that it could “fix NBCU’s ~$30B undervaluation.” Supino said Comcast could get around the political and financing challenges by issuing new stock to WBD, eliminating its “super voting” share structure and appointing a new chairman and CEO given Trump’s repeated criticism of Brian Roberts. (Comcast recently announced it would elevate Comcast president Mike Cavanagh to co-CEO alongside Roberts, though the latter said the pair would work together for “years to come.”) He added that NBCU could sweeten its bid with a position for WBD CEO David Zaslav in the combined company. Outside of the WBD bid conversation, analysts will keep an eye out for any positive momentum for Comcast’s broadband business, which has suffered declines in recent quarters due to increased competition, and any further guidance that can be shared about Versant’s outlook. In a first glimpse at its financials ahead of the spin off, Comcast disclosed that Versant’s profits fell 16% to $670 million and revenue fell 6% to $3.42 billion in the first half of 2025. They’ll also be paying close attention to Peacock’s growth and how its recent price increase and NBCUniversal’s new 11-year media rights deal with the NBA may impact its profitability efforts. “With the NBA contract beginning in this year’s fourth quarter, I don’t think third quarter sales, subscribers or profits can be expected to be a trend,” Dolgin said. “We’ll need to wait until next year to see if the NBA is bearing fruit and allowing for a better outlook for Peacock, which we’ve seen as the laggard.”

Title: RKLB Stock To $48?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Rocket Lab stock (NASDAQ: RKLB) has seen a rapid appreciation, jumping 41% over the past month to a current trading price of $67. This surge is likely fueled by several positive developments: improved analyst ratings, higher price targets, and new or expanded launch contracts with Japanese clients. A significant factor is the growing consensus among analysts who now see Rocket Lab as a serious, publicly traded competitor to SpaceX. Despite these strong operational tailwinds and the company’s solid long-term prospects, our machine-driven multi-factor assessment suggests reducing exposure to RKLB stock may be prudent. Our primary concern stems from the stock’s Very High valuation. While Rocket Lab boasts a Strong overall operating performance and financial condition, the recent rapid run-up appears to have factored in most of the near-term positive news. Consequently, the stock is currently deemed Relatively Expensive. Below is our assessment: RKLB stock has jumped meaningfully recently, and we currently find it relatively expensive. While this may feel like an opportunity, there is a significant risk in relying on a single stock. Consider the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Let's get into details of each of the assessed factors but before that, for quick background: With $35 Bil in market cap, Rocket Lab provides launch services and space systems solutions, designing and manufacturing small orbital launch vehicles and satellite platforms for commercial, aerospace, and government customers. This table highlights how RKLB is valued vs the broader market. For more details, see: RKLB Valuation Ratios This table highlights how RKLB is growing vs the broader market. For more details, see: RKLB Revenue Comparison This table highlights how RKLB profitability vs the broader market. For more details, see: RKLB Operating Income Comparison RKLB saw an impact slightly better than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We assess this based on both (a) how much the stock fell and, (b) how quickly it recovered. But the risk is not limited to major market crashes. Stocks fall even when markets are good - think events like earnings, business updates, outlook changes. Read RKLB Dip Buyer Analyses to see how the stock has recovered from sharp dips in the past. Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Adobe Stock Pricing Powerhouse Now 38% Cheaper, Buy?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/21/adobe-stock-pricing-powerhouse-now-38-cheaper-buy/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Adobe (ADBE) stock merits your attention. Why? Because it offers monopoly-like high margins at a discounted price. Here are some details. While revenue growth is beneficial, this is not solely a growth viewpoint. Pricing power and high margins yield consistent, predictable profits and cash flows, decreasing risk and facilitating reinvestment of capital. The market typically rewards this. To provide some context, Adobe delivers diversified software solutions globally, including Creative Cloud subscriptions, serving enterprise clients within the Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing & Advertising sectors. *LTM: Last Twelve Months But do these figures provide the complete picture? Read Buy or Sell ADBE Stock to determine whether Adobe still possesses an advantage that remains robust. Investing in a single stock can be risky, yet there is considerable merit in a more diversified approach. If you're aiming for potential gains with reduced volatility compared to holding a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio (HQ) – HQ has exceeded its benchmark, which is a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap indices, achieving returns greater than 105% since inception. Effective risk management is essential; consider what the long-term performance of your portfolio might be if you combined 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto with HQ’s performance metrics. Here is our criterion for selection: We evaluate stocks valued at over $10 Billion in market cap, filtering out those with high CFO (cash flow from operations) margins or operating margins. We also only consider stocks that have significantly decreased in valuation over the past year. Below are statistics for stocks with this selection methodology applied since 12/31/2016. That being said, Adobe has experienced some significant declines in challenging periods. It fell approximately 72.5% during the Dot-Com bubble and 67% during the Global Financial Crisis. In the 2022 inflation shock, the drop was around 60%. Even during less severe downturns, such as in 2018 and the Covid pandemic, it still saw roughly a 25% decrease in value. Therefore, despite everything working in its favor, Adobe is not immune when market conditions worsen. However, the risk is not confined to major market downturns. Stocks can decline even when the markets are performing well – consider events like earnings reports, business updates, or changes in outlook. Read ADBE Dip Buyer Analyses to review how the stock has bounced back from notable dips in the past. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three indices – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000. Why is this the case? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks generate superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; it’s a smoother ride, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Hedge-Fund Favorites Rose 23% In The Past Year

Time Published: 2025-10-20T13:30:00Z

ByJohn Dorfman, Contributor. A bright young intern just left my firm to work for a New York hedge fund. That was bad news for me, but not unusual in the financial world. Hedge funds are magnets for talent, partly because in good years they can pay handsome bonus checks. Gurufocus.com maintains a screen of stocks popular with hedge funds. A year ago, I selected five of these stocks to recommend. They have risen 23.6%, leaving the Standard & Poor’s 500 Total Return Index in the dust at 15.3%. Frankly 15.3% is a fine year. But 23.6% is better, so let’s play this game again. Here are five hedge fund favorites that appeal to me now. Every major semiconductor company that I know of, with the exception of Intel Corp. (INTC), uses Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) to make its chips. TSM has expertise, precision and economies of scale. It also has a net profit margin of 42%, astoundingly high. Yet because Taiwan lives under a sword of Damocles – the threat of Chinese invasion – the stock is not horribly expensive. It sells for 30 times recent earnings, and 26 times the earnings analysts expect in 2026. Al Gore, U.S. vice president under President Clinton, is one of many investment managers who own it. He is the co-founder of Generation Investment Management, based in London. Warren Buffett, the legendary CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B), one described hedge funds as a compensation scheme disguised as an asset class. That hasn’t stopped hedge funds from investing in Berkshire. Buffett will step down as chief executive at the end of this year. But I think highly of the team that will succeed him, beginning with Greg Abel as the next CEO. Berkshire’s debt-to-equity ratio is a nice low 19%. If the U.S. economy happens to get into trouble, Berkshire could rescue other companies on favorable terms, as it did in the past with Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and General Electric. I’m on record as having predicted that the U.S. will be in recession by May 2026. Could I be wrong? Sure. But I see auto loan defaults rising, along with credit-card delinquencies. I see hiring petering out. And I think that tariffs and deportations are counterproductive for the economy. One firm that usually holds up well during economic downturns is Walmart Inc. (WMT). It is famous for its low prices. During recessions it can hold onto most of its previous customers, and get new ones who are trading down. Regrettably, at $107 a share, the stock’s valuation ratios are high. I would nibble if it falls below $100 and buy with enthusiasm at $90. JP Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) chairman Jamie Dimon remarked this month that soured bank loans are like “cockroaches.” You rarely see just one. JPMorgan Chase has been pretty successful in avoiding bad loans, although it did suffer some notoriety from its relationship with sex offender Jeffey Epstein. One thing I look for in a bank stock is a return on assets of 1.00% or more. JPMorgan Chase has done that in six of the past seven years, and seems certain to do so again this year. If the Federal Reserve cuts short-term interest rates, but rates on longer-term loans such as mortgages stay close to where they are now, it would be a Goldilocks scenario for JPMorgan. Caterpillar Inc. (CAT), which makes bulldozers and other construction equipment, is looking at good news and bad news. The good news is that the dollar is weak, which helps the company export. More than half its sales usually come from outside the U.S. The bad news is that the Trump administration is slapping a lot of tariffs on imports, inviting retaliation. My guess is that the dollar effects will outweigh the tariff effects. The good performance of the hedge-fund favorites I recommended a year ago was sparked by H&E Equipment Services Inc., which sold itself to Herc Holdings Inc. (HRI) in June at a 68% gain. Customers Bancorp. Inc. (CUBI) also did well, returning 29%. On the flip side, D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI) stumbled to a 14% loss as homebuilding languished. In between those extremes, Loews Corp. (L) achieved a 22% return, and Toyota Motor Corp. (TM) notched 13%. Figures are total returns including dividends, from October 28, 2024 through October 16, 2025. Note that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn’t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn’t predict the future. Disclosure: Personally, and for most of my clients, I own Taiwan Semiconductor, Berkshire Hathaway, and JPMorgan Chase.

Title: Stocks Poised For More Gains As Shutdown Continues

ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. U.S. stocks rose Friday and notched gains last week as the government shutdown continues. The shutdown is now the third-longest in U.S. history. The record is 35 days from Donald Trump’s first presidential term. There was also a 21-day shutdown under President Bill Clinton. Last week, the large-cap S&P 500 index rose 1.7%, the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite gained 3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the blue-chip index, was up 1.6%. Health care subsidies are central to the standoff between Republicans and Democrats. Democrats want Affordable Care Act subsidies to continue, and Republicans have refused to negotiate. Meanwhile, federal workers are set to miss their first full paycheck this week, which was originally scheduled for electronic deposit on Oct. 24. Key government data releases, including the monthly jobs report, are also delayed due to the shutdown. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will publish the September 2025 Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on Oct. 24, but no other reports will be produced until the government reopens. The inflation report will be instrumental to the Federal Reserve’s next meeting on Oct. 28 and 29. The Fed last met on Sept. 16 and 17, when the committee reduced the federal funds rate by a quarter-point and acknowledged the dual risks of inflation and unemployment. If the September CPI shows higher-than-expected prices, the Fed’s job of stimulating jobs gets more complicated. Lower interest rates can support higher employment but can also fuel price increases. CME FedWatch currently shows a 96.7% probability that rates will decline again in October, down from 98.7% on Friday. Stock futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones are up ahead of the market open on Monday. Contracts tied to the S&P 500 are up 0.3%, Nasdaq 100 futures are up 0.4%, and Dow Jones futures have gained 0.2%. Netflix (NFLX), Coca-Cola (KO) and General Motors (GM) will report third quarter earnings on Tuesday. Tesla (TSLA) and IBM (IBM) are on the calendar for Wednesday, and Intel (INTC) and Ford (F) report Thursday.

October 20, 2025 08:30 ET | Source: HUHUTECH International Group Inc. HUHUTECH International Group Inc. Wuxi, China, Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HUHUTECH International Group Inc. (Nasdaq: HUHU) (the “Company” or “HUHUTECH”), a professional provider of factory facility management and monitoring systems, today announced that on August 6, 2025, it established a wholly owned subsidiary, HUHU TECHNOLOGY SINGAPORE PTE. LTD. (“HUHU Singapore”), in Singapore. The establishment of the subsidiary represents another significant move in the Company’s global expansion strategy, strengthening its presence in Asia. HUHU Singapore aims to drive market development for the Company’s system integration solutions in the Singaporean market, with a focus on delivering high-purity gas supply systems to local pan-semiconductor industry customers. It plans to provide comprehensive, localized services ranging from system design to maintenance and after-sales support, catering to the rising demand for industrial automation in Singapore’s growing semiconductor manufacturing cluster. HUHU Singapore is expected to commence operations later in 2025. Singapore plays a pivotal role in the global semiconductor supply chain, supported by strong government initiatives. According to an article by the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) in August 2024, Singapore accounts for 10% of all chips produced worldwide and approximately 20% of global semiconductor manufacturing equipment production. The country houses a diverse semiconductor ecosystem with research and development (R&D) and manufacturing activities. According to Singapore’s budget for 2025, it will spend S$1 billion to build a new national semiconductor research and development fabrication facility, which will provide cleanroom infrastructure and industry-grade tools for researchers and industry partners to test new semiconductor innovations. Serving as the Company’s strategic foothold in Singapore, HUHU Singapore is expected to enhance HUHUTECH’s ability to capture the growth opportunities emerging in the region’s semiconductor sector. Mr. Yujun Xiao, Chief Executive Officer of HUHUTECH, commented, “The establishment of HUHU Singapore marks another important milestone in our global expansion strategy. With existing subsidiaries in China and Japan, this new addition further strengthens our presence in Asia, one of the world’s most dynamic semiconductor hubs. Singapore has attracted strategic investments from industry leaders including United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), Applied Materials, Inc., Micron Technology, Inc., and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC)’s affiliate Vanguard International Semiconductor. Singapore’s thriving semiconductor ecosystem and its pivotal role in the regional supply chain make it a strategic market for HUHUTECH. By building a strong local presence, we will be able to deliver comprehensive, one-stop solutions tailored to the needs of our Singaporean clients. Looking ahead, we are confident that HUHU Singapore will enhance our ability to capture new opportunities, reinforce our global network, and create long-term value for our shareholders while contributing to the sustainable growth of the semiconductor industry in Asia and beyond.” About HUHUTECH International Group Inc.

Stock futures are rising this morning as investors await a slew of earnings reports, key inflation data and updates on trade negotiations in the coming days; Amazon Web Services experienced disruptions that created service issues for several major websites; Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone 17 model outsold the prior model in the U.S. and China during its first ten days on the market; proxy firm Institutional Shareholder Services advised Tesla (TSLA) shareholders to reject a proposed pay package for CEO Elon Musk; and Cooper Companies (COO) stock is rising on news activist investor Jana had built a stake in the medical device maker. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are gaining ground at the start of of a busy week for corporate earnings, after major indexes rose last week despite a volatile stretch of trading fueled by banking sector worries and trade-related tensions. Investors are awaiting further developments on the trade front and awaiting the scheduled release on Wednesday of inflation data that will factor into the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on interest rates. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.2% recently, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-focussed Nasdaq added 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively. Gold futures were up nearly 2% at $4,295 an ounce, rebounding from a downturn on Friday that followed a string of record highs. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) was trading near $111,000, after dropping below $104,000 on Friday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on an array of consumer loans, held steady at 4.01%. Several major websites went down after cloud platform Amazon Web Services experienced major outages early Monday. The outage affected several Amazon (AMZN) services, including Alexa, while also reportedly creating disruptions for Disney+, Lyft, the New York Times, Reddit, Ring, Snapchat, Reddit, Ring, Robinhood, T-Mobile, United Airlines, Venmo, Verizon, gaming site Fortnite, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Epic Games Store, AI model Perplexity and the McDonalds app. Shares of Amazon were little-changed in premarket trading. The shares have lost 3% since the start of the year, making Amazon the only member of the Magnificent 7 group of major technology stocks to be in negative territory in 2025. Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone 17 model outsold the iPhone 16 by 14% during the first ten days of sales in the U.S. and China, the two markets that make up the bulk of the company’s phone sales, according to Counterpoint Research. The report said that improvements to the iPhone 17 provided value that helped draw in more buyers. “A better chip, improved display, higher base storage, selfie camera upgrade – all for the same price as last year’s iPhone 16,” said senior analyst Mengmeng Zhang. The report found that the base model iPhone 17 performed well in China, while the premium iPhone 17 Max saw strong demand in the U.S., with discounts provided by phone carriers helping to spur sales. Apple shares were up 1.5% in recent premarket trading. Proxy voting service Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) is advising Tesla (TSLA) shareholders to vote against a proposed $1 trillion pay package for CEO Elon Musk. The proxy firm wrote that it was concerned about the magnitude and structure of the pay package, which features several lofty benchmarks that include pushing the company’s value to more than $8.5 trillion, well above its current market capitalization of roughly $1.5 trillion. ISS also advised shareholders to reject a proposal for Tesla to invest in Musk’s xAI, the AI company that merged with Musk’s X social media platform earlier this month. Tesla shares, which have gained 33% over the past three months, were up about 1% ahead of the opening bell. The company is scheduled to report earnings on Wednesday. Shares of Cooper Companies (COO) surged more than 5% in premarket trading after activist investor Jana Partners reportedly built a stake in the medical device maker. The Wall Street Journal said Jana is looking for strategic alternatives for the company, including a potential deal to combine the company’s contact lens unit with rival Bausch + Lomb (BLCO). Shares of Bausch + Lomb were down nearly 2% in premarket trading.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) went down on October 20, 2025, hitting its US-EAST-1 region hard. Millions of users lost access to platforms like Snapchat, Robinhood, Fortnite, Roblox, and Amazon.com services. Downdetector logged over 20,000 outage reports in hours. Despite the massive disruption, Amazon stock closed at $213.04, down just 0.68%, with pre-market trading at $212.27. Analysts say the outage underscores risks in cloud dependency but doesn’t immediately threaten Amazon’s stock. Investors remain cautiously optimistic ahead of the earnings report.
