Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Palantir Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) are among the artificial intelligence stocks that have seen strong gains since early to mid-September. While the former is perched at a record high, the latter, despite its recent strong run, is yet to reclaim its Jan. 2021 peak. Here’s a look at the relative performance of these two stocks and what the near-term holds for them: Meta Vs. Palantir: Meta has gained over 68% for the year-to-date period, while Palantir is up a steeper 133%. The data analytics company co-founded by Peter Thiel is the fourth best-performing S&P 500 company this year, while Meta, co-founded by Mark Zuckerberg, holds the 11th spot on the list.

Read them carefully before investing. Interest rates are falling but you can still make high yields in real estate. Find out how. Both stocks have outperformed the broader market, as represented by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) – an exchange-traded fund that tracks the S&P 500 Index. Valuations of both stocks have become expensive following the recent spike. The forward price-earnings ratio for Palantir is currently at a hefty 95.2 but Meta is trading at a more modest forward P/E valuation of 24.75. The social media giant’s P/E ratio is fairly in line with 21.3 which is applicable to the communications services sector. The Palantir Rally: Palantir has been on an uptrend since it gap-opened higher on Sept. 9, the first session after the S&P Dow Jones Indices said the company would be added to the S&P 500 Index, effective prior to the start of trading on Sept. 23. Commenting on the feat, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said, “The profitability profile of this story has significantly been bolstered with this another validation moment for the Palantir story.” Although there was a ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ moment after the inclusion, the stock has been grinding solidly higher since the start of October. Meta Connects With Investors: After the early August broader market swoon set in motion by yen carry-trade unwinding, Meta’s stock found its feet shortly after and climbed higher until mid-August. The stock experienced a mild pullback that lasted through mid-September. The two-day Meta Connect conference held on Sept. 25-26 saw the company announcing a slew of products and other offerings. These include AI-driven chatbots, an updated Llama large-language model, the latest Ray-Ban smart glasses with improved camera functionality, voice controls, and deeper integration with AI, Meta Quest 4, the next-generation virtual reality headset, and the Orion augmented reality glasses. The stock has been on a steady climb since then. Trending: Your biggest returns may not come from the stock market. Invest the way colleges, pension funds, and the 1% do. Get started investing in commercial real estate today. Further Upside? The average analysts’ price targets, compiled by TipRanks, suggest modest upside potential for Meta but downside for Palantir. Current Price 1-Year Average Analysts’ Price Target Upside/Downside Potential Meta $595.94 $608.20 +2.06% Palantir $40.01 $27.67 (-30.84%) The next big catalyst for Meta is likely to be the company’s third-quarter results due on Oct. 30, with the consensus modeling over 30% earnings per share growth and nearly 20% revenue growth. Meta’s fortunes to a large extent is tied to ad spending, which in turn hinges on macroeconomic conditions. With the Fed showing a proclivity to take rates down in the coming months, credit conditions could ease, potentially benefiting Meta. Palantir is a favorite among retail investors. Continuing deal flow, and strong third-quarter results and positive fourth-quarter guidance could keep the upward momentum intact. More importantly, the market has entered a seasonally strong quarter when a confluence of factors typically lifts the market. The stretched valuations, therefore, may not preclude further gains. That said, investors may remain wary of geopolitical and macroeconomic headwinds, with two wars ongoing and a hard-landing scenario still not off the table.

Title: Spotify’s HR chief says remote staff aren’t ‘children’ as company reaffirms work-from-anywhere policy

Amid a raft of return-to-office mandates from tech giants, including Amazon and iPhone challenger Nothing, Spotify sees no need to treat its staff like “children” and end its popular work-from-home policy. Spotify went through an overhaul last year, laying off 17% of its staff in December in a move CEO Daniel Ek acknowledged had a larger impact on operations than the company had anticipated. The decision has helped almost double Spotify’s market value this year, as the group notched record quarterly revenues while cutting costs. However, inside Spotify, the layoffs have shaken morale. For those who survived the cull, there isn’t likely to be a further morale-sapping plan to break with Spotify’s popular “work from anywhere” policy. “You can’t spend a lot of time hiring grownups and then treat them like children,” Spotify’s chief human resources officer Katarina Berg told Raconteur, explaining the group’s continued flexible work location policy. “We are a business that’s been digital from birth, so why shouldn’t we give our people flexibility and freedom? “Work is not a place you come to, it’s something you do.” In February 2021, Spotify joined several other tech groups in allowing its employees to “work from anywhere.” This enabled employees to choose where and how they worked, provided the company had an office in that jurisdiction. Unlike other companies that have trickled employees back in on a hybrid basis, like Meta, or gone all-out and demanded a full return to the office, like Amazon, Spotify hasn’t chosen to renege on this policy. A big reason is likely the effect it has had on retention. Spotify said attrition rates were 15% lower in the second quarter of 2022 compared with the same period of 2019. The company also said it had improved the diversity of its talent. While Spotify doesn’t intend to scrap its remote-working policy anytime soon, Berg acknowledged it wasn’t an ideal setup. “It is harder and we all struggle to collaborate in a virtual environment,” Berg said. “But does that mean that we will start forcing people to come into the office as soon as there is a trend for it? No.” The company is still using innovative ways to encourage its music-loving staff to come into the office, including hosting “listening lounge” sessions featuring pop stars including Olivia Dean and Rag ‘n’ Bone Man. Staff are also strongly encouraged to come into the office during Spotify’s “core week” to reconnect and discuss strategy. Spotify’s biggest-ever round of layoffs last December, when it said goodbye to 1,500 staff, came as CEO Ek said the company was doing too much “work around the work.” The impact of those layoffs on operations was bigger than Ek expected, with Berg explaining to Raconteur that remaining staffers were left in a “state of shock” by the cull. “Spotify had been in hypergrowth, and this was the only thing people knew,” she said. “A lot of people at Spotify had never seen a recession, and it was a lot to absorb and digest.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: How Kamala Harris Is Creating a New Majoritarian Center
URL: https://newrepublic.com/article/186863/kamala-harris-economic-policy-new-majoritarian-center
Time Published: 2024-10-08T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Almost from the moment Joe Biden stepped aside in favor of Kamala Harris, the concern trolling commenced. “Harris’s biggest political liability is that she may be seen as too politically extreme,” fretted very serious journalist Josh Barro before advising the new Democratic nominee to “run to the center.” Former Bill Clinton adviser Douglas Schoen concurred, confidently telling CNBC that “the key for her campaign is moving to the center.” To satisfy New York magazine political columnist Jonathan Chait, a mere “pivot” to the center would not be enough. Rather, he provocatively suggested, “Harris needs to adopt positions that will upset progressive activists.” Apparently, Harris’s nomination didn’t just unite the Democratic base. It also united a parade of pundits, politicos, and conventional wisdom–mongers of all stripes in urging her to unceremoniously betray the base by swerving to the center—especially on the economy—if she’s to have a fighting chance of defeating Donald Trump at the polls. Given the divisive state of American politics, that might not sound like such an unreasonable take. But glaringly absent from this allegedly centrist consensus is a working definition of what or where the political and economic “center” actually is. And spoiler alert: On most issues, the center is arguably somewhere in the vicinity of Kamala Harris. Especially on the economy. To understand why, we need to think a little bit about what would comprise a truly “centrist economics.” But before we do that, we need to define our terms. The whole left-right dichotomy dates back to the early days of the French Revolution, when members of the National Assembly who favored a more revolutionary path (that is, a republic) took to sitting to the left, while those defending the ancien régime (the monarchists) gathered together on the right. Today, we universally put conservatives on the right and progressives on the left. Policies that favor the rich go on the right, policies that favor working people go on the left. An economic ideology that advocates unfettered free market capitalism definitely goes on the right, while a Marxist dictatorship of the proletariat is the sine qua non of far left. Most people still have a shared intuition about what the political labels “left” and “right” mean, particularly in regard to how competing policy proposals relate to one another. But the “center”? Not so much. For example, most people would instantly agree that a proposal to more than double the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour would fall on the left or even far-left side of the spectrum. After all, it’s more than double! Yet ask people to pick an ideologically “centrist” minimum wage rate and this remarkable consensus instantly falls apart. Self-described centrists often pride themselves on reaching across the aisle to negotiate bipartisan compromise. But ideological centrism can’t be as simple as just splitting the difference—in fact, on many noneconomic issues, difference-splitting would be facially absurd. For example, how do we split the difference on marriage equality, or on the peaceful transfer of power? How would we split the difference on Trump’s plan for the “bloody” deportation of 20 million people? Would a centrist alternative be just 10 million deportations, and with precisely half as much blood? And even on economic issues that can be easily quantified in dollars, difference-splitting can make little sense. Splitting the difference between $15 and $0—that’s the essence of the Project 2025 proposal, which would allow states to opt out of enforcing a minimum wage at all—would set the federal minimum wage at just 25 cents more than the current $7.25-an-hour rate that has been relentlessly eroded away by inflation for the 15 years that have passed since the last increase in the federal minimum wage. That’s not centrism. That’s defending the status quo, a quintessentially conservative instinct that has long been associated with the political right. The truth is, there is no inherently centrist ideology. According to an analysis by 538, the large plurality of voters who self-identify as moderate are in fact “all over the ideological map.” That’s why if you ask the average person to describe an ideologically centrist policy position, they usually default to the position they already hold. And in fact, that’s exactly what Barro and Schoen and Chait and others have done in assuming that Harris’s positions are “too politically extreme.” The center to them is where they currently stand—smack dab in the middle of the old neoliberal consensus that had long dominated both parties before Biden abandoned it in favor of an agenda that grows the economy “from the middle out.” And it’s that neoliberal center they want Harris to reclaim. Neoliberalism argues that markets are inherently efficient, rational, and meritocratic, and that the fastest path toward achieving the greatest good for the greatest number of people is to simply get out of the market’s way. Over the nearly half-century during which neoliberalism held sway, the ideologically centrist agenda was dominated by tax cuts for the rich, deregulation of the powerful, and wage suppression for everyone else. The result was decades of rising and radical inequality that have undermined faith in both democracy and markets. And if this sort of centrism is your measuring stick, then yes, the Harris agenda might look a little extreme. But there are in fact two kinds of political centers: There’s the ideological center—the one that neoliberals have long occupied. And there’s the majoritarian center—the one where most of the people are. Harris’s critics are half correct. If Democrats hope to be a majority party, they need to embrace the center. But it’s the majoritarian center, not the ideological one, that matters most in November. As I argued in Politico Magazine back in 2018, to understand the difference between these two strains of economic centrism, it’s important to understand exactly what the center is measuring. Imagine lining up every person in America on a yardstick, with the poorest person standing to the far-left edge of the stick (zero inches) and the wealthiest person standing to the far right (36 inches). Assuming that people are equally spaced, and that there is no correlation between wealth and weight—if you could balance that yardstick on the tip of your finger—the fulcrum would fall on the 18-inch mark, the exact center of the yardstick, with exactly half of all Americans standing to the left, and the other half standing to the right. Clustered on and near that 18-inch mark are the median American families—the middle-middle class: the majoritarian center of the American electorate, at least from an economic perspective. Now imagine that very same yardstick with every American standing in their very same spots—only this time, rather than balancing people, we are balancing their personal wealth, stacked up in $100 bills. But because 2 percent of Americans (of which I am one) own 50 percent of the nation’s wealth, to balance this yardstick you’d now have to slide your finger nearly all the way over, beyond the 35-inch mark, just inside the far-right edge. This fulcrum balances the interests of capital versus the interests of working people. And unfortunately, this is the yardstick that represents the reality of political and economic power distribution in the United States. It’s the yardstick of the neoliberal center—a centrism informed by the bad economic theories that guided the policies of both parties for more than 40 years. This precarious balancing act helps explain why policies that would clearly benefit the majoritarian center are so often rejected as ideologically “far left”; for an ideological centrism that seeks to balance the interests of capital is a centrism that seeks to protect the interests of the very wealthiest Americans against those of everybody else. By contrast, a majoritarian centrism focuses its policies more on outcomes than on ideology. For example, consider again the $15 minimum wage, a policy our intuition suggests leans ideologically to the left. At $7.25 an hour, the current federal minimum wage provides a floor under only 1.1 percent of all wage and salary workers—a cohort one might fairly characterize as occupying the far left of our economic yardstick. By comparison, a hike to $15 an hour would directly or indirectly benefit 29.2 percent of workers. And with half of all American jobs paying less than $23.11 an hour, a $20 minimum wage (almost exactly what the minimum wage would be today had it been raised to $15 and indexed to inflation back when that idea was first proposed in 2012) would directly cover a large plurality of workers, while indirectly pushing wages higher for many millions more as employers raise wages further up the pay scale in order to maintain differentiation relative to the minimum. From a majoritarian perspective—a perspective that asks, “Who benefits?”—the higher you raise the minimum wage, the more centrist the policy becomes! (For those neoliberals still insisting the minimum wage would hurt workers by destroying jobs, a recent meta-analysis of 88 minimum wage studies concluded that estimates published since 2010 found near zero offset from earnings due to lost jobs.) Further bolstering its centrist credentials, raising the minimum wage turns out to be extraordinarily popular across all partisan identifications. Eighty-five percent of likely voters would support a $9 minimum wage, 83 percent a $12 minimum wage, and 64 percent a $17 minimum wage. Even Republicans are largely on board. It’s hard to find another economic issue with greater majoritarian support. And the minimum wage is just one of many intuitively left- (and sometimes right-) leaning proposals that pass the following two-part majoritarian centrist test: 1. Is the policy broadly beneficial? A policy that directly benefits a majority of Americans clearly passes this part of the test, but so might a policy that benefits a large plurality, especially if the beneficiaries are clustered around the middle. 2. Is the policy broadly popular? Obviously, policies that enjoy majority support are clearly popular, and most of the elements of the Biden-Harris economic agenda pass this test. Even Harris’s pledge to go after price gouging, widely derided by economists, is popular. But in addition, given a deeply divided electorate, a policy should not necessarily require an absolute majority in order to pass this test. For example, a policy that receives just 40 percent support but with only 20 percent opposed may in fact be more majoritarian and certainly less divisive than a policy that enjoys a slim 50.1 percent majority support to 49.9 percent opposed. A policy that is both broadly beneficial and broadly popular is properly located within the majoritarian center. And by this measure, the bulk of Harris’s economic agenda is inarguably centrist regardless of how ideologically left or right we might at first intuit it to be. In fact, if you step through Harris’s 82-page economic plan and evaluate it from the left, right, and center (I’m looking at you, Josh Barro), I challenge you to conclude that any of her proposals are “politically extreme” either by ideological or majoritarian standards. Among Harris’s signature proposals is to cut taxes on more than 100 million working- and middle-class families through restoring and enhancing the Child Tax Credit, or CTC, and the Earned Income Tax Credit, or EITC, with the costs paid for by increasing the tax on stock buybacks, enacting a billionaire’s tax, and raising the capital gains tax rate for those earning more than a million dollars a year. All of these proposals score as both broadly popular and (unless you’re a recalcitrant trickle-downer) broadly beneficial, so they are majoritarian centrist to their core. But instructively, they also highlight how useless our ideological intuitions can sometimes be. The EITC, for example, has long been an essential thread in our social safety net, lifting millions of families out of poverty by supplementing low-wage pay. So it sure feels like it leans to the left. And yet … first proposed by Richard Nixon and signed into law by Gerald Ford, the EITC is essentially a variation on Milton Friedman’s negative income tax—about as economically right a pedigree as a policy could have. Furthermore, in practice, this tax credit is as much a subsidy to low-wage employers as it is to low-wage workers, helping to perpetuate an exploitive business model that increases profits at the expense of the working poor. And this isn’t the only Harris proposal that challenges standard categories. On housing, Harris proposes working with public, private, and not-for-profit developers to build an additional three million affordable housing units over the course of her first term, while “cut[ting] red tape” (i.e., deregulation) and imposing new regulations on corporate property owners who drive up prices by hoarding supply or by colluding on rents. In addition, she proposes to help first-time homebuyers with up to $25,000 toward a down payment. Because this ideologically nuanced fusion of regulation, deregulation, public investment, and market incentives would benefit millions, it clearly serves the interests of the majoritarian center. And while neoliberal critics might dismiss any role for government in directing the housing industry as too far left, there remains “strong bipartisan support for federal action” on housing affordability. The same is true of Harris’s pledge to “build” on the progress made through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, and the American Rescue Plan, as well as to continue the Biden administration’s practices in favor of organized labor and against unfair trade. This embrace of industrial policy—of (gasp) state planning—might reasonably be intuited as ideologically left. Yet many of the policies required to implement it (for example, hundreds of billions of dollars of grants and loans to giant corporations) arguably lean to the right. So which is it? Republican Senator Marco Rubio makes a compelling case that industrial policy, properly done, is inherently neither left nor right, and I totally agree. That said, the policy objectives are all broadly progressive, broadly popular, and if properly done, broadly beneficial. The rest of Harris’s agenda is easier on our ideological intuition. Her proposal to increase the startup expense tax deduction for new businesses from $5,000 to $50,000 arguably leans right, while nearly everything else is at least moderately progressive. But they are all majoritarian. Protecting Social Security and Medicare, providing quality affordable childcare, long term care, and education, tackling the climate crisis and lowering energy costs by investing in clean energy, lowering drug prices by taking on Big Pharma, and “expanding and strengthening the Affordable Care Act” (as opposed to Trump’s “concepts of a plan” to repeal and replace it)—they all pass the test. Quibble with the details of my analysis all you want, but there is arguably nothing in Harris’s economic plan that is ideologically “extreme,” and while taken as a whole her agenda is clearly progressive, it is also more fiscally conservative than what her opponent has proposed. Don’t take my word for it: The Penn Wharton Budget Model—a paragon of neoliberal orthodoxy—finds that Harris’s tax and spending proposals would increase primary deficits by $1.2 trillion over the next ten years. By comparison, the Trump proposals? $5.8 trillion! From a budget hawk perspective, it’s the Trump economic agenda that is extreme. Of course, the obvious question, the one that is always hurled at Democrats who propose good things, is “How are you going to pay for it?” And the answer is that policies that grow the middle class pay for themselves. Not in the first year, maybe not over 10 years, but certainly in the long run, because, as Harris recently explained in a speech to the Economic Club of Pittsburgh, the middle class is “the growth engine of our economy.” This is the “middle-out economics” that clearly infuses Harris’s economic agenda—an economics informed by decades of empirical research and the latest advances in the fields of complex systems theory, evolutionary theory, physics, behavioral psychology, and other disciplines. And while middle-out still has far to go before achieving the same ideological devotion as neoliberalism, it has already proven far more capable at connecting cause with effect. For example, the Democratic policy agenda has always been more middle-out than the Republicans’, even during the neoliberal era, which helps explain why, by every standard economic metric—including gross domestic product growth, job growth, wage growth, investment growth, the S&P 500, and yes, even inflation—on average, the economy has performed better under Democratic administrations than under Republicans. It’s doubtful that most Democratic elected officials understood that their more inclusive agenda was also more pro-growth, but if they did, they lacked the confidence to run on such an unorthodox claim. The emerging new middle-out consensus finally offers an empirical and theoretical foundation to back it up. What we are seeing in the policies of Biden and Harris and in their rejection of neoliberal orthodoxy is the coalescing of a truly centrist economics that, in Harris’s words, is not “constrained by ideology.” If many of these policies appear to lean to the ideological left, it is merely out of “pragmatic” consideration for how modern market economies work best, and for the indispensable role of government in assuring that they work for everybody. “What makes an economic policy distinctively centrist,” wrote the political scientist Damon Linker in 2019, “is its capacity to speak to the concerns of the broadest possible slice of the electorate—while remaining at all times keenly aware of the main points of fracture in contemporary public opinion.” The key, wrote Linker, “is to follow public opinion wherever it leads,” even when it diverges from that of the neoliberal elites of both parties. “If this centrist agenda sounds like something many progressives would applaud or at least view as a good start, that’s because the new center takes its economic cues from the left side of the traditional spectrum.” When members of the old guard pitch Biden’s exit as an “opportunity” for Democrats to reclaim the center, what they’re really pitching is an opportunity for the neoliberal ancien régime to reclaim the Democratic Party for themselves. But Harris can’t move to the center, because she’s already there. It’s just a different center than the one we’ve been taught to think about. It’s her neoliberal critics who are extreme.

Shares in mainland China soared at the opening, as markets reopened after the Golden Week holidays. But they slid back as the stimulus plans provided by China’s economic planning agency seemed to underwhelm investors. China: Shanghai gives back huge early gains, and Hong Kong plunges Shanghai’s market opened up almost 10% but faded to close with a 4.59% gain, while Hong Kong shares gave up 9.41% after a period of torrid gains during the mainland China holidays. Beijing’s midmorning explanation of its stimulus plans—which offered few details and no new big measures—appeared to fall flat with investors. Japan: Nikkei slips with household spending data The Nikkei 225 slipped 1% as the yen gained slightly and household spending fell by 1.9%—the fastest rate since January, although less than expected by economists. Europe: Shares hit by Middle East worries and fading China optimism European stocks fell almost across the board Tuesday, as worries about Mideast tensions and fading China optimism took hold. Luxury goods took a special hit, with LVMH down almost 5%, Hermès off 3% and Gucci-owner Kering down more than 7%. The STOXX Europe 600 fell 0.85%, and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 was down 1.27% in early trading. U.S. premarket flat after down day on Mideast and rate cut worries The three U.S. indexes were flat in premarket trading Tuesday, a day after all three fell as Treasury yields hit their highest levels since the summer and oil prices continued to climb amid Middle East tensions. Friday’s blockbuster jobs report had many investors questioning how slow the Federal Reserve will go with further rate cuts this year—or if it may even pause. And earnings season is here: PepsiCo kicks it off with its report today, followed by Delta Air Lines on Thursday, and JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and BlackRock on Friday. CPI data for September will also be released before the bell on Thursday. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Fidelity and BlackRock anchor substantial Bitcoin ETF inflows as Ethereum activity plateaus. On Oct. 4, Bitcoin ETFs recorded modest net inflows of $25.6 million. Fidelity’s FBTC ETF saw an inflow of $13.6 million, while Bitwise’s BITB ETF added $15.3 million. Ark’s ARKB ETF brought in $5.3 million, as did VanEck’s HODL ETF. However, these gains were partially offset by Grayscale’s GBTC, which saw outflows of $13.9 million. Other ETFs remained flat, including those from BlackRock, Invesco, Franklin, Valkyrie, and WisdomTree. By Oct.7, Bitcoin ETFs experienced a substantial influx of $235.2 million, marking a sharp rise in institutional activity. Fidelity’s FBTC ETF posted $103.7 million in inflows, while BlackRock’s IBIT ETF followed with $97.9 million. Bitwise’s BITB ETF and Ark’s ARKB ETF recorded inflows of $13.1 million and $12.6 million, respectively. Invesco’s BTCO ETF added $2.5 million, and VanEck’s HODL saw an additional $5.4 million. No outflows were reported across any of the major ETFs on this date. For Ethereum ETFs, Oct. 4 saw a total net inflow of $7.4 million. BlackRock’s ETHA ETF led with $14.7 million, while Grayscale’s ETHE experienced outflows of $8.2 million. Minor inflows of $0.9 million were recorded for Bitwise’s ETHW ETF, while other ETFs saw no significant activity. On Oct. 7, Ethereum ETFs saw no major inflows or outflows, and all products reported flat flows. Substantial inflows into Bitcoin ETFs on Oct. 7 indicate renewed confidence in the market, especially following a quieter session on Oct. 4. Ethereum ETFs, while positive on Oct. 4 due to BlackRock’s inflows, saw no further movement on Oct. 7, signaling a temporary pause in institutional interest in Ethereum.

Netflix (NFLX) reports third-quarter earnings next Thursday, Oct. 17, and analysts expect the streaming giant to post year-over-year revenue, profit, and subscriber growth ahead of the final quarter of 2024. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha project that Netflix will report net income of $2.23 billion on revenue of $9.77 billion, up 33% and 14%, respectively, from a year earlier. Shares have gained nearly 45% since the start of the year, but they dipped following the company's quarterly reports in April and July. Analysts expect Netflix to report just under 286 million active subscribers at the end of the quarter, up about 4 million from last quarter and over 30 million more than last year, according to Visible Alpha. Netflix has said it will stop reporting subscriber data starting in 2025, and focus instead on financial metrics. Analysts have said Netflix's crackdown on password sharing has been successful in driving new subscribers. Barclays analysts, however, recently cited the "trade-offs" suggested by its pathways to future growth in downgrading the stock to "underweight" from "equal weight"—making them the only analysts tracked by Visible Alpha with a "sell"-equivalent rating—while leaving unchanged a price target of $550. Netflix has an important fourth quarter, with KeyBanc analysts recently noting that the streamer's first NFL games, which will be broadcast on Christmas Day, could be a catalyst for subscriber growth. The analysts, who raised their price target to $760 from $735, said nearly a quarter of people they surveyed who aren't Netflix subscribers said the games would make them consider signing up. The Christmas games are the latest bet on live sports from Netflix and other streamers as a way to draw new subscribers. Netflix is also set to become the official broadcaster of TKO Group's (TKO) WWE professional wrestling events starting next year.

Title: Nvidia: What are investors are asking?

Investing.com -- Analysts at Citi have been on the road marketing in Boston and Europe, where they discussed with investors key topics regarding the Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock. According to the Wall Street firm, the company's AI adoption “remains in 3rd/4th innings as enterprise AI demand takes off next with AI agents.” Analysts expect Nvidia stock to remain range-bound through the CES event in early 2025 before new product launches, such as Blackwell GPUs, drive a sales and margin inflection. Citi notes that a recurring investor concern is Nvidia's gross margin trajectory. The bank predicts that gross margins will bottom out at around 72% in the January quarter, stabilizing in the mid-70s once the Blackwell series ramps up. Another focal point for investors is the competition between Nvidia’s GPUs and custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). While ASICs can be advantageous for fixed-function applications, Nvidia GPUs offer versatility. As AI models expand, Nvidia's GPUs, which are capable of handling various applications, will likely see continued demand, analysts said. Moreover, enterprises favor multi-cloud strategies, and GPUs allow applications to run across different cloud platforms without rewriting. Citi also highlights that data center operators prioritize the total cost of ownership (TCO) and return on investment (ROI), areas where Nvidia continues to lead due to its ability to run diverse applications, including AI. “As NVDA runs various applications including AI, the data center operators rely on NVDA to have the hardware to run multiple applications rather than buying accelerators that are limited in their use cases,” analysts said in a Monday note. At the same time, investors are also keeping a close eye on Nvidia’s vertical integration strategy, which has progressed from chips to entire systems, a response to the slowdown of Moore’s Law. As for the Blackwell sales mix, the shift towards the GB200 format from the B100’s 8-GPU format is also expected to optimize TCO and ROI, Citi’s note states. Looking ahead, investors are optimistic about the long-term ROI, particularly with Nvidia’s emphasis on AI across large markets like social media and e-commerce. However, patience will be required as generative AI matures into disruptive business models. “We expect to see positive ROI data points next year led by GPU-as-a-service providers,” analysts said. With a Buy rating and a price target of $150, Citi remains bullish on Nvidia, with potential risks stemming from competition in gaming and possible market volatility in the auto and data center segments.

Title: Wells Fargo stock upgraded by Wolfe Research on undervaluation and earnings potential

Full Content:
Tuesday, Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) stock received an upgrade from Wolfe Research, moving from a Peer Perform to an Outperform rating. The firm also set a new price target for the bank's shares at $65.00. The adjustment arrives amid expectations of challenges in the rate-sensitive financial sector, yet Wells Fargo's current valuation is seen as incorporating these risks adequately. Wells Fargo's stock is currently trading at less than 10 times Wolfe Research's estimated earnings per share (EPS) for 2026, which is more than a one-time turn discount compared to the target price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. This discount is considered the most significant among the bank and broker stocks covered by Wolfe Research, excluding LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) Holdings Inc. The firm sees the potential for Wells Fargo's earnings to increase if the asset cap imposed by regulators is lifted, which could lead to approximately an 8% boost in EPS power. Recent developments suggest that Wells Fargo is progressing towards meeting regulatory requirements, as indicated by the submission of a third-party review to the Federal Reserve. Despite the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's (OCC) enforcement actions raising concerns over delays in lifting the asset cap, Wolfe Research does not expect the cap to be removed until at least 2025. However, the firm believes that the potential benefits of the cap being lifted are not yet factored into consensus estimates or the bank's share price. Wells Fargo's journey toward regulatory compliance and the anticipated removal of the asset cap are seen as positive steps that could result in an increase in the bank's normalized EPS to over $6. The projection is based on the premise that the asset cap's removal will provide Wells Fargo with an opportunity to expand its assets and grow earnings accordingly. Wolfe Research's upgraded rating reflects a belief that the market has not fully appreciated this potential upside in the bank's stock valuation. In other recent news, investors are eagerly anticipating the upcoming corporate earnings season, with high expectations that the results will support the current high valuations of U.S. stocks. UBS equity strategists predict that S&P 500 earnings have risen by 4.7% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. Major financial firms like JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo, and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) are scheduled to report earnings soon, providing crucial insights into the economy's health. In parallel, OpenAI has secured a $4 billion credit facility backed by a consortium of banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Citi, and Wells Fargo. This significant financial resource will support the AI startup's continued growth and innovation in the artificial intelligence sector. Wells Fargo has maintained its Buy rating from BofA Securities, following reports that regulators may be nearing the end of their review regarding the potential lifting of the bank's six-year-old asset cap. Evercore ISI also maintained an Outperform rating on Wells Fargo shares, citing the bank's submission of a third-party review of its risk and control processes to the Federal Reserve as a positive step toward the potential lifting of the bank's asset cap. In the banking sector, U.S. bank stocks have shown an uptick following the Federal Reserve's decision to slash interest rates by 50 basis points. This rate cut is anticipated to lower deposit costs for banks and ease the financial burden on borrowers, potentially reducing the risk of loan defaults. These are the recent developments shaping the current state of the market and specific companies. Recent InvestingPro data aligns with Wolfe Research's optimistic outlook on Wells Fargo. The bank's P/E ratio of 11.62 and adjusted P/E ratio of 10.15 for the last twelve months support the notion that WFC is trading at an attractive valuation. This is further emphasized by a low PEG ratio of 0.57, suggesting the stock may be undervalued relative to its earnings growth potential. InvestingPro Tips highlight that management has been aggressively buying back shares, which could be seen as a vote of confidence in the company's future prospects. Additionally, Wells Fargo has maintained dividend payments for 54 consecutive years, demonstrating a strong commitment to shareholder returns. This is reflected in the current dividend yield of 2.8% and an impressive dividend growth of 33.33% over the last twelve months. The bank's financial health appears robust, with a revenue of $78.23 billion over the last twelve months and an operating income margin of 30.4%. These figures, coupled with the fact that analysts predict the company will be profitable this year, reinforce Wolfe Research's positive stance on Wells Fargo's earnings potential. For investors seeking more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers additional tips and insights. Currently, there are 8 more InvestingPro Tips available for Wells Fargo, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial position and market outlook.

Labour is racing to finalise the appointment of an investment minister ahead of Monday’s flagship conference in London, Sky News learns. City editor @MarkKleinmanSky Tuesday 8 October 2024 10:38, UK Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, will this week hold further talks with bank bosses amid industry anxiety that she will raise the tax burden on it at this month's budget. Sky News has learnt that Ms Reeves will meet the chief executives of Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, NatWest Group and Santander UK on Wednesday. It will be the latest in a series of discussions she has held with the sector since being named chancellor in the wake of Labour's election victory in July. Coming five days before the International Investment Summit and a fortnight before Ms Reeves's inaugural budget, the meeting will give bank bosses an opportunity to press their case for further investment in the economy and to challenge policies that they believe could jeopardise the government's growth agenda. Government insiders said they now anticipated that an investment minister would be appointed ahead of next Monday's summit in London, which will be attended by prominent global financiers including the BlackRock chief Larry Fink and Bruce Flatt, CEO of Brookfield. Three of the banks attending the talks with the chancellor – Barclays, HSBC and Lloyds – have also agreed to pay £175,000 to sponsor the summit.

Title: The Green Requiem, the triangular meetings, the Psychiko PASOK and the vote from Paris, the Americans and ELVO, and the big names at Spetsathlon

Time Published: 2024-10-08T06:25:07Z
Full Content:
Greetings! So, yesterday, the “day after” PASOK’s first ballot, the atmosphere inside felt like Verdi’s “Requiem“. The general disappointment from the outcome isn’t just limited to Pavlos and Anna’s camps, but also to their 130,000 voters. While that’s significantly more than Androulakis’ 90,000 or Doukas’ 65,000, unfortunately, they ended up “split” in two and failed. And so, despite sharing a roughly common goal—the Geroulanos and Diamantopoulou voters’ vision of a serious PASOK that could stand up to the “spoiled government” playing alone, as they used to say—they ultimately canceled each other out. Who’s Voting for Whom?Now, as you can imagine, everyone will be talking to everyone for support, agreements, and generally political deals, because these people are politicians, and unfortunately, this is their main job (let’s not forget that). So, in the next few days, you’ll hear a lot about staff negotiations, backroom talks, promises for positions, vice presidencies, etc. But I seriously doubt that anything that will get agreed upon—if anything is agreed upon—will make much sense, because the four main players who competed in Sunday’s election each have a completely different mindset and political direction. As for their voters, especially those of the two who are out of the race (i.e., Geroulanos and Diamantopoulou), they’re more likely to vote for Mitsotakis than for Androulakis or Doukas. I’m told that today or tomorrow Geroulanos will meet with both Androulakis and Doukas, but he’ll make it clear that there’s no official directive. As for Anna, they say that Nikos promised her a vice-presidency or a role in drafting PASOK’s program (can you imagine the fun?), but, as I repeat, “you can’t take from someone who doesn’t have anything to give.” PASOK in Psychiko…I have a very illustrative example. At the PASOK polling station in Palaio Psychiko (A’ Square), a former PASOK minister (from the Andreas era) is patiently waiting in line to vote. The 65-year-old lady, thin, with short auburn hair, a member of PASOK’s electoral committee (looked like a supporter of Nikos, or maybe Haris), recognizes the former minister, approaches him, and starts ranting: “Look at what’s happening here, my minister. All the right-wingers came to vote and mess up our party, to get their own people elected (I assume she meant Anna). We should go to the next ND elections and get our own people elected too…”, the lady said, but of course, the minister looked at her a bit puzzled and politely avoided responding. Now, I’d have loved to tell her (if I were there), “my dear, if serious PASOK folks were relying on you, you’d have gotten Evangelos Meimarakis elected in 2016, and along with Pavlopoulos and Karamnlis, Tsipras would still be governing,” but, alas, I wasn’t there. Moral of the Story…So, don’t overthink it. The PASOK crowd is leaning towards Nikos A., who has a strong, organized party mechanism with an equally disciplined audience of 80,000-90,000 people who have firmly entrenched their position, and…Nikolas will keep winning. Lately, a new segment of PASOK-SYRIZA folks has also been drawn in, attracted by the scent of power, in this case, the Athens municipality. Androulakis has PASOK’s stamp of approval; he’s the president, and Doukas is the mayor trying to grab both seals. That’s why I think out of the 300,000 who showed up last time, almost half won’t return. At most, 200,000 will vote. M.M.Now that the champagne has run out at M.M. from the PASOK election results celebrations (so to speak), some are having second thoughts. “When you’ve got nothing to your left, it’s natural to look at what’s happening on your right,” says my source, adding, “Androulakis’ questions in Parliament will be a single column, while ours will make the front page because it’s a ‘sexier’ story.” And they’re right… Paris-KatrinisLet me wrap up with a hilarious tweet someone sent me from a troll named Koiniav, who posted the PASOK Paris election results. In the relevant chart, Katrinis is shown to have received exactly one vote. So, the troll says, “I want to meet the person living in Paris who went to the polling station on Sunday just to vote for Katrinis.” Me too! Will it Rain…National Bank Today?National Bank shares were credited to Greek investors yesterday, and today they can proceed with sales if they want. Usually, people sign up for more shares than they actually want, expecting that only a part of their demand will be met. In the case of the National Bank’s placement, Greek private investors received 76.8% of the shares they requested, so today’s session is expected to see some selling. However, reports indicate that some top foreign institutional investors, such as Wellington, Capital, RWC, Columbia Threadneedle, Blackrock, GIC, Robeco, Norges, Fidelity, and others, also took positions in the National Bank through this placement. Discussions with American Funds about ELVO – It’s been roughly three and a half years since February 12, 2021, when the ownership of the then-state-owned ELVO was transferred to the Israelis of PLASAN and SK Group, and minority shareholder A. Glynis for €3 million. That summer, the Hellenic Vehicle Industry (ELVO) got its second chance when it was passed to Thessaloniki businessman Ath. Kouimtzi. After acquiring ELVO, the Kouimtzi Group aims to showcase the potential of the Greek defense industry, and reports indicate that it plans to collaborate with an American fund to transform ELVO into a regional hub for factory maintenance and repair of U.S. Army vehicles in the Balkans and Southeast Europe. Next steps include restructuring facilities and modernizing production so that ELVO’s products can be internationally competitive. V. Lazarakou at FCA Today – Today, in London, the English supervisory authority FCA is holding its conference on international markets. The president of the Hellenic Capital Market Commission, V. Lazarakou, has been invited to participate in a discussion on the priorities of supervisory authorities alongside ESMA Chair V. Ross, FCA Executive Director S. Pritchard, CEO of Hong Kong’s regulatory authority J. Leung, and senior BIS executive G. Gelos. On the sidelines of the conference, V. Lazarakou will hold meetings on capital market issues. Entrepreneurs Who Stood Out at Spetsathlon – Despite some absences (with a few choosing to be involved in the PASOK race), last weekend’s Spetsathlon was a great success with high business participation. The one who impressed was Deputy Minister M. Themistocleous, who achieved an excellent time running 25 km and swimming 3 km. An “Iron Man” proved to be B. Haratsis of Beta Securities, who swam 1.5 km, ran 5 km, and took first place in the 60-64 age category. Deloitte’s CEO D. Koutsopoulos also stood out, running 25 km and finishing 11th in the 50-59 category. Alexandros Kikizas of Melissa ran 5 km, while L’Oreal’s CEO, Alessandra Delfini, proved to be a true dolphin, easily swimming the 3 km from Costa to Spetses beach. Aegean was represented by D. Gerogiannis, who ran 10 km. The “Spy” Auctions – Businessman Nikos Bogonikolos may have narrowly escaped the “clutches” of the FBI and U.S. intelligence agencies, as his case involving conspiracy charges against the U.S. and in favor of Russia ended well. However, it appears extremely difficult for him to evade the “clutches” of auctions here in Greece. The head of Aratos Technologies, who was arrested in May 2023 in Paris and later sent to the U.S., lost two of his company’s offices in Patras over the summer. On July 10, 2024, Cepal auctioned off two offices, 23 sq.m. and 55 sq.m., located on the 2nd and 3rd floors of the Kola Commercial Center, next to Georgiou Square in downtown Patras. The starting prices were €32,000 and €77,000, but the smaller office sold for €60,000 and the larger for €106,000. And there’s more to come… Cepal has scheduled another auction on April 23, 2025, for a second-floor apartment of N. Bogonikolos in Patras. The 87.11 sq.m. apartment, located on Maizonos Street, features three bedrooms, a kitchen, a bathroom, a living-dining room, and balconies facing the eastern, northern, and southern uncovered areas. The starting bid is set at €129,000, but the property is burdened with liens, mortgages, and several seizures in favor of banks and the state. The moral of the story? You might escape a James Bond-style thriller, but your debts…never. Eurobank and the “Athenian Melathron” – Quietly last summer, Eurobank acquired one of the capital’s most historic buildings, the well-known “Athenian Melathron” at the intersection of Stadiou and Kolokotroni streets, for €52 million. The building belonged to the company ADEXA S.A., founded in 1937, which passed to the control of the Bamoutzali family from Saudi Arabia in the 1980s. After the sale, Philippos Karamanolis, General Manager of Central Operations and Functions of the Eurobank Group, took over as chairman and CEO of ADEXA. Eurobank is now absorbing ADEXA, and the merger plan has already been posted to the relevant authorities. All of ADEXA’s assets, including the iconic “Athenian Melathron” (formerly known as the Afentoulis Mansion), will be transferred to Eurobank, which plans to house a large portion of its administrative services there once the building’s renovation is complete. The location is clearly more prominent and spacious than the current Eurobank headquarters, which is somewhat “cramped.” Cenergy’s Capital Increase Begins Today – Cenergy kicks off its €200 million capital increase today, aiming to cover the order book by Thursday, as the process for Attica Bank’s capital increase begins on Friday. The new shares will be listed for trading on October 15. With this move, Cenergy not only strengthens its capital base but also increases the free float of its shares to 27.9%. Those who held shares until yesterday are eligible to participate in the capital increase. The 265 Shares of Karelia – The Karelia Tobacco Company is currently valued at just under €1 billion. It is a publicly traded company with healthy fundamentals, happy employees, good prospects, and a very strong cash reserve (hundreds of millions of euros). What it lacks, however, is free float (shares in open circulation) and agreement among its main shareholders on future strategic choices. On one side, you have Andreas (22%) and Stathis Karelias (21.2%), Victoria Karelia (7.149%), and the Karelia Foundation (7.149%). On the other side, there’s Ioanna Karelia (31.964%) and Asimina Spiropoulou (13.422%). Together, they control well over 90% of the company’s capital. As none of them are willing to reduce their stake, the stock barely moves on the exchange with minimal trading. Recently, however, there has been a slight increase in activity. Yesterday, for instance, 265 shares (!) changed hands at €350 per share, an unusually large(?) volume of trades. Sources indicate that both sides have engaged a specialized advisor to find a solution to improve the stock’s liquidity (as required by the new stock exchange regulations) without altering the existing shareholding balance. Yesterday’s activity seems to be tied to this effort… Markets Gone Mad – For the first time since August, the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury exceeded 4%. Brent oil futures are flirting with $80 (the biggest weekly gain since January 2023). Stock markets are anticipating – have already priced in – the upcoming U.S. rate cut, but fear the ongoing military operations in the Middle East. The dollar is strengthening internationally as a “safe currency” despite massive public debt. Fifteen years ago, in 2009, the market capitalization of the U.S. stock market accounted for 30% of global stock market capitalization. Today, it’s close to 50%. The S&P 500 is recording the highest annual return since 1997. Tech stocks represent 32% of the S&P 500’s capitalization, just one percentage point below the Dot-Com bubble. If we include Communication Services stocks, the value of tech stocks accounts for 43% of the market, which is TWICE as much as the financial stocks bubble in 2007, just before the Lehman Brothers crisis erupted. How Rich Is the Top 1% of Americans? – As the U.S. heads into another election season, the debate over the notorious top 1% of Americans getting richer by the day, versus the 99% who – with varying income levels and subcategories – struggle to make ends meet in the wealthiest country on the planet, is heating up. The Federal Reserve (FED) has added some numbers to this discussion. According to the FED, the total net worth of the top 1% (those with wealth exceeding $11 million) increased by nearly $2 trillion, reaching a record high of $46.2 trillion in the first quarter of 2024. Obviously, not everyone else is poor. There’s a large middle class, and some people even own $10 million…which isn’t exactly peanuts. The conclusion, however, is that the wealth gap has widened significantly.

Title: Cryptoverse: Bored bitcoin seeks direction after big bang

Time Published: 2024-10-08T05:15:29Z

By Medha Singh and Lisa Pauline Mattackal Bitcoin has been distinctly listless in the past three months after starting the year with a bang. The crypto leader has largely shuttled between $56,000 and $63,000 so far in the second half of the year - a contrast to the first six months when it jumped 45%, propelled by the launch of U.S. exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking its spot price. Market players are now eyeing possible new crypto catalysts heading into year-end and early 2025, beyond broader market-moving events such as shifts in U.S. interest rates and the American presidential election. Jake Ostrovskis, trader at UK-based crypto firm Wintermute, is anticipating the upcoming launch of options on BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s spot bitcoin ETF, a new product he believes could attract more U.S. retail money after its approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission last month. Because regulators view bitcoin as a commodity, though, such options may also need the green light from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees commodity derivatives, said Youwei Yang, chief economist at BIT Mining. "If successful ... (ETF options) could increase bitcoin's market sophistication and volatility, driving greater institutional and retail engagement," Yang added. It's been quite a run for crypto as the anticipation and approval of U.S. ETFs helped drive bitcoin activity globally. The total size of the cryptocurrency market has ballooned to $2.2 trillion as of Oct. 1 this year, from $8.3 billion at the start of 2023, according to CoinGecko data. "We've observed a significant increase in institutional on-boarding and trading activity," this year said Ostrovskis, adding there was a strong demand for platforms and services for digital assets that resemble traditional financial structures. Notoriously wild bitcoin's 90-day volatility has fallen to 42% this year from 67% in mid-2020, according to Deutsche Bank data. Market watchers cautioned that bitcoin still showed a strong correlation to other cryptocurrencies and was likely to be among the first assets dumped by investors retreating from uncertainty and risk; bitcoin slumped 5% on a new spike in hostilities in the Middle East last week, for example. BIGGEST CRYPTO COUNTRIES? Chainalysis' Global Adoption index, which tracks crypto use in 151 countries with measures including trading and payments, surpassed the 2021 crypto bull market between the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. Crypto adoption is particularly strong in lower-income countries which often have less developed and accessible mainstream financial systems, the report showed. India took top spot, followed by Nigeria in Chainalysis' rankings, while seven of the other top 20 countries were Asian emerging markets including Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines. Crypto fans often point to uses in countries with high inflation and rapid currency depreciation - such as Turkey and Argentina - as evidence of digital money's real world use. Chainalysis also noted a significant increase in decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoin activity in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and Eastern Europe. "The value proposition for bitcoin and stablecoins in Latin America are intact," said Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of crypto loan provider Ledn. "Most of the emerging world wants to bank in dollars, but they don't necessarily trust their banks." The United States ranked fourth overall on the adoption ranking, while South Korea and China were 19th and 20th, respectively. In terms of crypto transaction volumes, the U.S. is the world's biggest market followed by India, according to Deutsche Bank.

Title: Analysis-US-based China ETFs get bumper influx, some investors optimistic tide is turning

By Suzanne McGee (Reuters) - Investors flooded U.S.-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that target Chinese markets with $5.2 billion in new assets in the past week when mainland China's financial markets were shut for a national holiday, and some asset managers are hopeful the optimism will be enduring. The influx came after an initial package of stimulus measures from Beijing that included interest rate cuts and changes to bank liquidity requirements was announced in late September, which culminated on Sept. 30 in the largest one-day rally that Chinese stocks have seen since 2008. Tuesday is the first working day in China after a run of holidays over the past week, and senior officials from China's top economic planning agency are expected to give information on steps to implement policies to promote economic growth. China's measures have driven some optimism that the support will sustain and extend the dramatic turnaround in investor sentiment. The $5.2 billion inflow for the week ended Oct. 4 compares to an average weekly outflow of $83 million to date in 2024, and an average weekly outflow of $27 million last year, according to data from Morningstar. "The market has been waiting for a credible commitment from China to get its economy going again," said Michael Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede Trust, a Philadelphia-based boutique wealth management firm. "Now we need to see follow-through." Authorities also have announced plans to boost their investment in domestic ETFs. China's Securities Regulatory Commission announced plans in late September to rapidly approve new ETFs that would track China's "Star Market," a segment of the Shanghai Stock Exchange dedicated to technology companies, and direct more capital to ETFs based in mainland China, according to the Financial Times. "The China markets have been so oversold," said Jonathan Krane, founder and CEO of KraneShares. His firm's flagship ETF, KraneShares CSI China Internet, pulled in $1.39 billion in new assets last week alone, putting year-to-date flows back in the black, according to Morningstar. The $8.3 billion KraneShares ETF is just one of more than two dozen China-focused funds that posted double-digit one-week returns, gaining between 10% and 28% and outperforming the more than 3,000 other ETFs traded in the U.S. market last week, according to Paris-based data analytics firm TrackInsight. Krane believes the surge in share prices is just the start, as investors have low exposure to Chinese stocks after February's outsize nosedive by the benchmark CSI 300 Index, itself a reaction to growing fears about everything from a real estate slump, lackluster economic data, deflation and geopolitical events. "This is just a very small percentage of the world getting back in or saying I need to rethink China," Krane added. "This was just the early money." The vast majority of money in the past week has flowed into the biggest ETFs that offer broad exposure to a range of large-cap Chinese stocks. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s $7.99 billion iShares China Large-Cap ETF saw inflows of $2.7 billion last week, according to Morningstar. "When you see moves that are so vast and violent, you see money flow into these (index-linked) products first," said Michael Barrer, head of ETF capital markets for asset management firm Matthews Asia. Still, assets in the $44.8 million Matthews China Active ETF have soared in the wake of net inflows of $11.7 million last week. For Chinese-focused ETFs to hang on to the new assets, Beijing will need to announce a package of detailed and high-impact reforms, said Jason Hsu, founder and CEO of Rayliant Global Advisors, an asset management firm. "The next bazooka that Beijing fires has to come in the shape of formalizing new stimulus proposals and adding a timeline," he said. Roundhill Investments CEO Dave Mazza said he saw the tide turning in investor sentiment. Roundhill launched Roundhill China Dragons ETF last week, focusing on nine of what Roundhill deems the largest, most innovative Chinese technology firms. It attracted net inflows of $35 million in its first two trading days, Mazza said. "We figured that at some point soon, the tide would turn and China once again would be investable," Mazza said.

Title: BlackRock Declares Bitcoin The New ‘Gold Alternative’ – Here’s Why

Time Published: 2024-10-08T02:00:49Z

BlackRock’s stance on cryptocurrencies—especially Bitcoin and Ethereum—has lately made headlines. While Ethereum is considered as a “technology bet,” the investment behemoth sees Bitcoin as a “gold alternative.” This point of view captures a major change in the way conventional finance is starting to welcome digital assets. The company’s findings show that people are becoming more and more sure that Bitcoin can protect against inflation, just like gold has in the past. BlackRock’s Chief Investment Officer, Rick Rieder, recently said that Bitcoin is appealing to investors who want to protect their wealth in uncertain economic times because there is a limited quantity. Many investors who are growingly concerned about market volatility and inflation will find resonance in this mindset. For those looking for stability in the realm of finance, gold has traditionally been the preferred asset. BlackRock contends, though, that Bitcoin is filling in this function. As the company points out, Bitcoin’s limited supply and spread-out nature could make it a more interesting purchase than gold. Central banks around the world are printing money at rates that have never been seen before. This makes Bitcoin an even better way to save money. “More institutional investors entering the market will only speed up the acceptance of Bitcoin at an incredible rate,” says Rieder. With this new money coming in, demand will grow even faster, making Bitcoin even more of a digital gold standard. Additionally, BlackRock believes that with increased realization of worth and scarcity, the price of the blockchain will keep moving upwards. BlackRock considers Bitcoin a “risk-off” asset like gold. At a recent conference, BlackRock’s Robbie Mitchnick argued that Bitcoin might hedge against fiat currencies and government trust. Mitchnick said Bitcoin is a safe shelter for investors, especially during economic turmoil. As inflation, monetary devaluation, and banking crises develop, Bitcoin’s potential as a worldwide monetary alternative makes it important for financial security. Although Ethereum is seen via another perspective, Bitcoin attracts attention as a store of value. BlackRock sees Ethereum as a platform for innovation as much as a cryptocurrency. With its smart contract capability, developers may create decentralized apps (dApps), therefore transforming many sectors, including gaming and banking. Ethereum has great future potential. Ethereum demand may explode as more companies investigate blockchain technology. The analysts of BlackRock are positive about Ethereum’s future and indicate that its core technology might cause rapid increase in the coming years. With BlackRock continuing to invest in these types of cryptocurrencies, that spells massive influence for the financial market. The general financial market is responding in such a trend, with old-time investors now becoming conscious of the potential attached to such digital assets.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Global Crypto Fund Outflows Hit $147M—Here’s What’s Driving Investors Away
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/global-crypto-fund-outflows-hit-147m-heres/
Time Published: 2024-10-08T01:00:24Z

The latest report from CoinShares, a crypto asset manager, has revealed that digital asset investment products experienced a notable shift last week as $147 million in net outflows were recorded globally, ending a three-week streak of inflows. CoinShares revealed that this ended inflow streak isn’t ordinary, as it results from a notable trend in the macroeconomic space. According to CoinShares, the sudden outflow seen last week impacted major asset managers, including BlackRock, Bitwise, Fidelity, Grayscale, ProShares, and 21Shares, following nearly $2 billion in net inflows over the prior three weeks. The outflows were largely led by Bitcoin-based funds, which accounted for $159 million in net outflows. In contrast, short-Bitcoin investment products attracted $2.8 million in net inflows, indicating that some investors are betting on a further downward price movement for the asset. Ethereum-based products, on the other hand, which had just ended five weeks of outflows the previous week, resumed their negative trend, recording net outflows of $28.9 million. James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, explained this was due to a “lackluster” investor interest in the asset. This indicates that while Ethereum had briefly stabilized in the eyes of investors, confidence in its performance has not been fully restored, resulting in continued outflows. Meanwhile, multi-asset investment products, which provide diversified exposure across a range of cryptocurrencies, went against the overall trend by attracting net inflows of $29.4 million. This marked the 16th consecutive week of positive flows for these products, with $431 million flowing into multi-asset funds since June. Butterfill noted that these products have gained popularity among investors who favor a diversified approach, representing roughly 10% of assets under management (AUM) at global crypto fund managers. Furthermore, regarding region, the largest negative flows were concentrated in funds based in the US, Germany, and Hong Kong, which lost $209 million, $8.3 million, and $7.3 million, respectively. However, these losses were partly offset by net inflows into products based in Canada and Switzerland, which saw inflows of $43 million and $34.9 million. Notably, the change in market sentiment, which resulted in millions of outflows, has been linked to stronger-than-expected economic data. James Butterfill, attributing the market reversal to this unexpected economic data, wrote in the report: Higher than expected economic data last week, reducing the probabilities for significant rate cuts are the likely reason for the weaker sentiment amongst investors. Butterfill added alongside these broader economic developments, noting: Trading volumes were up marginally by 15% to US$10 for the week in ETP investment products, while we have seen lower volumes in broader crypto markets.

Title: Hurricane Helene: A Case of State-Sponsored Murder

by Rhoda Wilson | Oct 7, 2024 | Headline News | 0 comments This article was originally published by Rhoda Wilson at The Daily Exposé. Hurricane Helene which hit North Carolina on 25 September and was the second worst hurricane since Katrina, dumped 40 trillion gallons of water in a short amount of time, causing unprecedented flooding and mudslides, with the water having nowhere to go. The flooding has caused widespread devastation, with whole towns being washed away and over a million people still without power in North Carolina and South Carolina. Corporate media has been reporting a relatively low number of affected people, but the reality on the ground is much more severe. As one independent media report described it, the situation is “unprecedented” and “apocalyptic,” with many people experiencing flooding and devastation on a scale never seen before. Was Hurricane Helene caused by weather manipulation so the Government could grab the land from citizens? If so, why? As Dr. Peter and Ginger Breggin wrote: “Untold potential for riches are there for the taking in the mountains of Appalachia. The Americans living in the mountains are the only barrier. Murder always happens for a reason.” On Saturday, Truthstream Media published a report about Hurricane Helene. Thousands of people are missing in the flood-ridden areas of Western North Carolina and Eastern Tennessee, and it may take a while to determine the actual number of people alive or dead. Many people in the affected areas are currently without power, clean water, food, fuel, medicine, and other essential supplies. Many bridges are out, and people are stranded, with some areas only having one way in and one way out, making evacuation difficult. The situation is described as “apocalyptic,” with bodies floating down the river and people having witnessed neighbors dying, leaving many in shock and traumatized. There have been reports of children being found alone in the woods, with their parents nowhere to be found, suggesting that something may have happened to them. Many people are still trapped, and there is no coordinated central location for information on missing people, with citizens taking to social media to share pictures and information about their loved ones. Rescue missions are underway, but there have been reports of people being turned away from donating or volunteering, with some organizations only accepting approved donations. A civilian helicopter pilot was helping to rescue people stranded by the disaster but was threatened with arrest by authorities after landing to pick up an older couple who were waving for help. Many people in North Carolina have lost trust in relief organisations, believing they have been taken over by grifters and liars. Citizens are instead trying to help each other directly, only to be turned away or threatened with arrest by authorities. The federal response to the disaster has been appalling, with President Joe Biden and Kamala Harris not making any public statements for four days and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”) not being present on the ground. And the Government’s response to the crisis has been slow. President Biden only approved a thousand soldiers on 2 October, days after the emergency declarations were made, even though the affected area is the size of Massachusetts. The initial emergency declarations only covered 11 counties, despite widespread devastation in up to 90 counties. Governor DeSantis of Florida is sending extra aid to North Carolina, while some people feel that their own governor is not doing enough. Today the Independent reported that Florida has been warned that a “once in a lifetime” storm is on its way and Floridians have been asked to brace for what could be the largest evacuation since Hurricane Irma in 2017. Naturally, questions are being asked as to what’s really happening. The United States government has been able to manipulate the weather since World War II, with the ability to control and even weaponize the weather since the 1960s to prove that the Government had the capability, in the 1970s, the US Congress introduced a bill to regulate weather manipulators, requiring registration and licensing for weather manipulation tools. And suspicions that the Government is attacking its own people for gain using weather warfare is not unfounded. After Hurricane Katrina destroyed New Orleans and the Gulf Coast in 2005, many people became rich as a result of the destruction, with 80% of the land in New Orleans being destroyed and purchased by property developers. Black residents of New Orleans were forced to leave their homes and land, which were then bought by casinos and property developers, with areas like Point Cadet in East Biloxi, Mississippi, being transformed into tourist destinations. Similar scenarios have played out in other areas, such as Maui Lahaina, where massive wildfires cleared the way for new resorts and tourist developments. Now residents of North Carolina are wondering if the US government had anything to do with the massive hurricane that just destroyed their state. In the video below, the hosts of Redacted, Clayton Morris and Natali Morris, discuss the history of weather manipulation in the United States, weather manipulation and land acquisition, weather warfare during the Cold War, and the recent Hurricane Helene and suspicions of it being the result of weather manipulation. Some believe that the government may be using this technology to control the weather and that the destruction caused by Hurricane Helene may be used as an excuse for the government to seize land and resources through eminent domain, the legal power of the Government to take private property for public use. One of the areas affected by Hurricane Helene is the world’s largest lithium deposit, which is set to be mined by a company that has entered into an agreement with the Department of Defence. By coincidence, BlackRock and Vanguard own the most shares in the lithium mine. The agreement is worth US$99 million and aims to have the mine up and running by 2030, but the area has been devastated by the hurricane, which may allow the government to use eminent domain to seize the land. If the video above is removed from YouTube, you can watch it on Rumble HERE. Appalachia: Murder Always Happens For A Reason “Something evil is going on in the North Carolina mountains” By Dr. Peter and Ginger Breggin (primary author Ginger Breggin) It is no less than mass murder. Reports of a complete absence of state or federal assistance in the devastated areas hit by Hurricane Helene are now crowding the social media airwaves. Bodies floating down the rivers. Bodies hanging in trees. Tangled in piles of debris. Utility company linemen are the first into most of the demolished areas. They report finding children as young as three wandering naked in the mud, crying for their parents, some with ropes dangling from where their parents lashed them in desperation to timber. The smell of death is everywhere. About 1 million souls lived in these Western North Carolina counties, with additional souls dying in the mountains of Eastern Tennessee. State and federal authorities have not been on site for the first week or so after the storm dropped like a bomb. There is no update on the number of dead and/or missing, and rescue of those who have survived other than local accounts. A report out of Asheville, the largest flooded-out community in North Carolina, says some FEMA workers have just arrived with porta potties for the local inundated hospital which is still without any electricity or any water. Volunteers, community members, and now some aid workers beginning to trickle in are bringing the dead to the privately owned Mission hospital in Asheville, which is now designated the place to bring bodies into the region. FEMA is quoted as saying they are too tied up at the border and won’t be sending refrigerator trucks for body storage. FEMA also was overheard saying “add a couple zeros” to whatever the body count is right now … One local report on X cites reports of over 900 bodies already at the hospital that haven’t been identified. A report out of Chimney Rock, NC said a “government official” has told residents at a town meeting that the federal government is seizing land, and the entire area will be bulldozed – bodies, still-standing buildings, and all. One local pastor was going door to door with water and found there were so many bodies that they changed their delivery request to body bags. “They are not picking up the bodies. They don’t wanna identify the bodies and they’re just leaving them to rot in the streets.” And “Something evil is going on in the NC mountains.” The disaster region needs pilots with planes, helicopters, people with big equipment, and trucks. The 82nd airborne is still not ordered to participate in the rescue, their Apache helicopters are on the ground waiting for Title 10, the emergency order that is required to activate the 82nd airborne. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”) is AWOL (absent without leave). The few FEMA representatives trickling in a week after disaster struck are actively disrupting volunteer efforts. Emergency supplies are being taken from volunteers and locked up, FEMA directs survivors to use non-existent internet or telephones, and some state and federal officials are threatening volunteers and survivors with arrest. Federal relief is reported to be loans – and the contracts required to state if funds are not paid back on time all property may be seized. Unverified reports state North Carolina police have now issued a statement that they will start arresting any federal employees trying to stop or hinder rescue operations, have been debunked. Survivors of the hurricane and the floods are still without power more than a week after the storm and the rains – there is no date for restoration in sight. Food and water are running out or gone and small communities are still cut off. Dehydrated and starving people with no cell phones or other means of communication have been abandoned. A Brannon Howse media interview with the non-profit Aerial Recovery organization confirmed the federal government’s absence and further confirmed that they were told not to conduct search, rescue, and recovery work in both Lake Lure and Chimney Rock when they arrived with former special forces volunteers, equipment, chain saws. The volunteer rescue crew was stopped and ordered to leave by the local police. Elon Musk posted a video of the devastation filmed by some of his Space X engineers flying into North Carolina to deliver Starlink terminals and supplies. Musk said “My blood is boiling” because FEMA would not let the Musk company helicopter land to deliver the critical supplies. Columnist Leo Hohmann reminds us that this region of the US is Trump country: If your house is destroyed and you are literally trying to survive in an atmosphere with little or no food, water and shelter, and your cell service is out, will you be thinking about voting? What if you are fine but you haven’t heard from a family member since the storm hit? You are searching for them, wondering if you will find them dead or alive. Will you be thinking about voting? I don’t think so. So, we have to wonder if this is not only a humanitarian tragedy being left unattended by the federal government but whether it may also be a concentrated voter suppression effort. Most recently the Biden-Harris administration has announced the release of $750 per person in FEMA funds for hurricane victims. Colonel Douglas Macgregor exposed to Tucker Carlson that illegal immigrants coming over the border are being given $2,200 per month. FEMA has been transformed into emergency aid for illegal immigrants, paid for by US taxpayers. Infrastructure is another critical survival matter that is suddenly in short supply. In our last column, we documented the ILA (International Longshoremen’s Association) strike that started over the weekend. Docks across the Eastern Seaboard and the Gulf are closed. Steel, heavy equipment, building supplies, and replacement parts for everything from rescue equipment to heavy electrical transformers come in by boat. There is a massive shortage of transformers in the US, with wait times for replacements of up to five years. So those heavy transformers knocked out by the hurricane are not going to be replaced any time soon. North Carolina has over 360 substations out of commission in its Western region. As of 4 October, the striking ILA port workers are returning to work until mid-January after negotiations settled on a wages agreement. But the high voltage transformer shortage will not be remedied anytime soon. In January of 2024, the federal government transferred two high-voltage power transformers to Ukraine to “enhance the reliability of Ukraine’s Integrated Power System and ensure its maintenance during this and following winters.” This was done despite the shortage of that equipment to ensure US electrical grid reliability. Now we are without the backup supply of transformers needed to repair the grid in the damaged part of Western North Carolina. North Carolina lawmaker Rep. Chuck Edwards (R-N.C.) reported: The flooding provides a unique challenge not previously faced by substations in Western North Carolina …There is a high likelihood that the substations are not repairable, and replacement of the substation equipment will be necessary. Latitude Media, covering energy news, reported: Many substations [in Western NC] are reportedly completely flooded, leaving Duke Energy, the investor-owned utility that serves the region, unable to accurately assess the damage until the waters recede and the bulky equipment can be dried. Replacement, however, is a tall order. The disaster is coming in the midst of a shortage of electrical equipment, and especially of the transformers that substations use to switch power voltage from direct current to alternating current, or vice versa. As electricity demand across the US increases, so does demand for the equipment that renewable projects, electric vehicle chargers, and countless other things depend upon. And manufacturers are already at capacity – and expanding it further is made challenging by a tight labour market. Transformer prices have risen over 60% since 2020. The idea that some of the lightly populated regions of the heavily forested mountain region of North Carolina might not be rebuilt begins to make a diabolical kind of sense. The United States used to know how to do rescue. I wrote about traditional American rescue activities and contrasted them with the lack of assistance during the Maui/Lahaina “wildfire.” That signaled a blatant, unhidden disregard for the fundamental decency, traditions, and values of Western civilization: Americans Know What to Do When Disaster Strikes Americans know what to do when disasters hit. We have been doing rescue, survival, and restoration for as long as we have had communities, from the first small outposts dotting the East Coast to the spread and growth of towns and cities across this amazing land. We know how to “do” rescue. Many of us learned in our youth, during Scouts or other volunteer organisations. Many of us have served in the armed forces, as EMTs or police, or as a member of volunteer fire departments, or we have had training in CPR and first aid. My father was a member of the ski patrol in its infancy, in New York State. Now, most communities and certainly most regions have established Red Cross offices. Rescue begins when an alarm goes up. There is a fire, a tornado, a hurricane, a flood or some other disaster. People gather to help stem the damage, set up a central meeting place, start keeping a list of survivors (and those lost), gather supplies to sustain everyone, comfort the stricken and start the clean-up and the restoration. Temporary housing is arranged, care for children is established and the beginnings of a return to normalcy occur amidst the comforting of those who have been through the traumatic experience and loss of family, friends, community and home. This is not your Granddaddy’s rescue anymore. The burning question is why? “Never let a serious crisis go to waste” was known as Rahm’s rule. Rahm Emanual was chief of staff to President-elect Barack Obama when he issued that famous declaration. So, we ask what can be done with this massive disaster. We have touched upon the first action – condemn the lightly populated portions of North Carolina including the damaged electrical infrastructure meant to service the area. Suddenly the need for transformers is lessened. However, eliminating the need to replace key electrical grid infrastructure is only the beginning. There is so much more benefit to be gained by emptying these mountains of the American citizens who have lived and worked there. Some of the richest lithium sources in the world are located in Western North Carolina. Two lithium mines already exist in the mountainous region of Western North Carolina. Albemarle Kings Mountain is one mining operation and is touted as one of the world’s most advanced lithium material sites. They describe their mining as a lithium ecosystem: The Kings Mountain, North Carolina, site represents Albemarle’s mine-to-market strategy, encompassing all elements of the lithium ecosystem needed to power everything from consumer electronics and electric vehicles to life-saving medical devices … The Kings Mountain site has one of the world’s richest lithium depositions, representing an essential part of the global clean energy transformation. Albemarle Corporation has been working hard to resume open pit mining at the Kings Mountain site which has been idled since the early 1990s. The Department of Defence (“DoD”), entered into a $90 million agreement in September 2023. The funds are earmarked to help support “Albemarle’s planned re-opening of their Kings Mountain, N.C. lithium mine to increase domestic production of lithium for the nation’s battery supply chain.” BlackRock Inc. wants a bigger piece of the mine, too. The largest investment firm in the world, BlackRock, increased its ownership in Albermarle Corp by buying over 2 million shares on 31 August 2024, less than a month before Hurricane Helene hit the mountains. The coincidences just keep piling up. Piedmont Lithium’s North Carolina operation is located 30 miles west of Charlotte in Gaston County. Piedmont Lithium has interests in Tennessee, North Carolina, Ghana, and Canada but “industry headwinds are causing major changes at the startup company.” The term headwinds means in layperson, making company growth more difficult. The company had much higher and active value until mid-2023 when it ran into local opposition and was having trouble with expansion plans in Tennessee. But in August 2024, they scrapped their proposed processing facility in Etowah, Tennessee, and they will now be “incorporated into the company’s proposed Carolina Lithium project, covering a 1,548-acre tract in Gaston County.” The company declared “Carolina Lithium is one of only two significant projects in the US Based on published technical studies, we expect Carolina Lithium to be a low-cost producer … and a key contributor to US energy security.” Their mining permit was just finalized in May of 2024 after the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality’s Division of Energy, Mineral and Land Resources approved the permit application in April 2024. Hurricane Helene has arrived just in time to clear out the property owners local to the mining interests in Western North Carolina. Piedmont Lithium was heavily opposed in Gaston County by local residents and commissioners. But now it appears the opposition has been eliminated. Two quartz mines in Spruce Pine, NC produce “the world’s purest quartz, which formed in the area some 380 million years ago. The material is a key component in the global supply chain for semiconductor chips, which power everything from smartphones and cars to medical devices and solar panels.” According to the two companies, Siblelco and The Quartz Corp, that separately manage the two mines, they are making strides in getting their mines up and running again. The largest delay may be the specialized workers most of whom have been displaced by the storm and floods. Semiconductor manufacturers may run into extended delays until these two mines are up and running once again. CNN Business reports: “You’re building these incredibly complicated chips that have, in some cases, 100 billion transistors, 100 billion tiny little machines, on a chip that is the size of your thumbnail … One atom being out of place could mean a defect that breaks the chip,” said Gregory Allen, director of the Wadhwani Centre for AI and Advanced Technologies at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. And while quartz is abundant around the world, the kind of ultra-high-purity quartz mined in Spruce Pine is not. The Spruce Pine mines provide an estimated 80% to 90% of the world’s high-purity quartz – experts say the exact amount is proprietary and unknown – supplying semiconductor manufacturers like chipmaking giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Other quartz sources in the US and around the world require purification processes that are time-consuming and far inferior to the special quartz found, so far, at these two mines in North Carolina. The mines are considered a national strategic asset. I have discovered another company in the same affected region – Land & Mineral Company – Gusher Knob which is currently developing joint venture and extraction partners to begin mining the Gusher Knob land tract containing another ultra-high purity quartz deposit. I expect their business will pick up rapidly now in the wake of property damage from Hurricane Helene. Asheville, NC is the largest town in the damaged reason and it has suffered grave damage too, as we’ve reported above. There have been plans going back over eight years to convert Asheville into a Smart City. Because of the damage including lack of electricity and water, the opportunity now presents itself to implement the smart city plans for Asheville. Because of its size, Asheville may survive and become the regional hub for the future plans of Western North Carolina. The Federal government can seize land. The power of eminent domain, explained as the seizure of private property for public use, has been exercised for a variety of reasons over the decades. Expanding rail and roadways, creating parks and many other reasons have been used to seize land. There is a legal requirement that the landowner be compensated “fairly.” The technique of condemnation cases was acknowledged by the Supreme Court and has been used to appropriate property for public uses from the establishment of a post office to the building of a railroad. The ‘History of the Federal Use of Eminent Domain’ describes the legal issues and development of this federal law. Rock Creek Park, running through Washington DC and into Maryland, was developed using eminent domain. I have touched on the growing demand and national security significance for globally scarce lithium and precious quartz, both of which have traditionally been mined in this region. But there is an even greater value, at least to the federal government over time, in this great swath of the Appalachians to those who wish to embrace globalist values enshrined in the United Nations 2030 and 2050 Goals. I do not embrace globalism, as it has demonstrated an utter disregard for individual sovereignty, freedoms, Constitutional values and basic American rights. But the Biden/Harris US administration has completely embraced globalism, doing all that it can to increase the US globalist transformation. The UN has established a Global Biodiversity Framework that calls for a 2050 goal of all ecosystem integrity being advanced, with “an increase of at least 15% in the area, connectivity and integrity of natural ecosystems, supporting healthy and resilient populations of all species …” In layman’s language, this means people are no more important than “all” species and non-humans, i.e. natural ecosystems need to be expanded. In other words, remove the human influence on the region. The International Institute for Sustainability (“IIS”) is “a Brazilian private non-profit organization whose mission is to develop transformative solutions for a sustainable world, based on Science [sic] and other forms of knowledge.” The IIS partners with the UN and other international biodiversity organizations and has organized the Nature Map Explorer that identifies and maps a huge quantity of information about terrestrial habitats, human impact, species richness, biomass carbon density, and more, along with the areas of global significance for conservation. One of the richest areas of “global significance for conservation” in the US is the exact region of Western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee that has been devastated by Hurricane Helene. It appears from rumors coming out of Chimney Rock and surrounding areas that a condemnation seizure is ongoing. Brutal, illegal, immoral and downright evil in the abandonment of the local citizens – but I have also seen this in Lahaina on Maui before and there is a long history of eminent domain. The lands in Western North Carolina already have several state and federal parks and forest lands, and if many of the communities are now abandoned or condemned, nature could be encouraged to regenerate in the region, just as is hypothesized in government and academic papers. If the mountain area is returned to the wild and becomes unpopulated by humans, the future owners of the land – federal or state governments and their agents – will have reclaimed a natural forest wilderness that becomes a powerful carbon sink, which absorbs more carbon than it produces. Owners of carbon sinks can become part of the formal carbon exchange which allows companies that produce a lot of carbon (say in their manufacturing business or their operation) to buy credits offsetting their excess carbon. The forest terrain itself becomes a kind of commodity exchangeable for money. For example, a reforestation project that involves planting trees to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere can produce carbon credits based on the amount of carbon that the trees sequester over time. Once a third party verifies these projects, the resulting carbon credits can then be sold to individuals or companies seeking to offset their emissions. I expect a few specialized, high-value mines will be able to co-exist in such an environment. The State of North Carolina, the US federal government, the mining industries, the future carbon credit investors, academics, and environmental non-profits will be able to profit from the damage done by the historic hurricane Helene. In a forthcoming column, I will be examining the weather conditions and control that steered this massive, once-in-a-thousand-year storm directly to the Appalachians. For the rest of us, the citizens, the regular folks. There are just too many of us, and depopulation is underway. But we refuse to give up on the plans of the global predators. We urge citizens everywhere to work with their local counties, their municipalities, their counties, and their states to preserve individual liberties, freedoms, and property rights. Work with your federal Congressmen and Senators also but focus especially on all your local representatives. May God protect us all against the diabolical carelessness and cruelty of our captured governments.

Nvidia's (NVDA) market capitalization overtook Microsoft's (MSFT) on Monday, making it the second-largest company in the world behind Apple (AAPL). Nvidia shares climbed just over 2% Monday, lifting the chipmaker's market cap to $3.13 trillion, ahead of Microsoft's $3.04 trillion. Super Micro Computer (SMCI), a partner of Nvidia, reported strong shipments of its GPUs driven by artificial intelligence (AI) demand, helping send shares of both companies higher. Nvidia and Microsoft have been jockeying with Apple for the top spot by market cap in recent months. In June, Nvidia briefly took the crown when it surpassed Microsoft, but Microsoft later reclaimed the title, and Apple has since pulled ahead. Nvidia's stock price has more than doubled in value since the start of the year, as demand for its AI chips surged. Analysts suggested Nvidia shares could still climb higher, given the strength of AI spending trends and seasonal tailwinds. Semiconductor companies typically perform better in the fourth quarter than they do in the third quarter, with Nvidia “still set to lead," Melius Research analysts said Monday, adding "the setup here is still pretty darn good." Melius holds a price target of $165 for Nvidia, a 29% premium on Monday's closing price of $127.72. That compares to an average price target of $152.52, according to Visible Alpha.

Title: One Of The Most Important Substances In The World Comes From An Area Of North Carolina Devastated By Hurricane Helene

The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? Did you know that a little town in the mountains of North Carolina is the primary worldwide producer of a substance that makes our modern high tech way of life possible? Without the ultra-pure natural quartz that comes from Spruce Pine, North Carolina we would not have the ultra-sophisticated electronic gadgets that we enjoy so much and the global economy would collapse. So is it just a coincidence that Spruce Pine was absolutely devastated by Hurricane Helene? The two facilities that produce this ultra-pure natural quartz in Spruce Pine are both shut down at this point… Two North Carolina facilities that manufacture the high-purity quartz used for making semiconductors, solar panels and fiber-optic cables have been shut down by Hurricane Helene with no reopening date in sight. Sibelco and The Quartz Corp both shut down operations in the Appalachian town of Spruce Pine on Thursday ahead of the storm that swept away whole communities in the western part of the state and across the border in East Tennessee. The town is home to mines that produce some of the world’s highest quality quartz. Hopefully these facilities will be able to open again before the end of the year, because they are absolutely critical to the global economy. According to ABC News, it is estimated that somewhere between 70 percent and 90 percent of all crucibles that are used to make silicon chips worldwide are made out of natural quartz from Spruce Pine… “To make silicon chips, you need to first melt down a highly-purified material called polysilicon. That can only be done in crucibles that are themselves made of a material so pure it will not react chemically with the polysilicon and is also able to withstand enormous heat,” he said. “The best material for those crucibles is ultra-pure quartz. Spruce Pine is the source of the purest natural quartz ever found on Earth.” An estimated 70-90% of the crucibles used worldwide are made from Spruce Pine quartz, he said. Without this natural quartz from Spruce Pine, our way of life would change dramatically. The following comes from a Wired article entitled “The Ultra-Pure, Super-Secret Sand That Makes Your Phone Possible”… The wooded mountains surrounding it, though, are rich in all kinds of desirable rocks, some valued for their industrial uses, some for their pure prettiness. But it’s the mineral in Glover’s bag—snowy white grains, soft as powdered sugar—that is by far the most important these days. It’s quartz, but not just any quartz. Spruce Pine, it turns out, is the source of the purest natural quartz—a species of pristine sand—ever found on Earth. This ultra‑elite deposit of silicon dioxide particles plays a key role in manufacturing the silicon used to make computer chips. In fact, there’s an excellent chance the chip that makes your laptop or cell phone work was made using sand from this obscure Appalachian backwater. “It’s a billion‑dollar industry here,” Glover says with a hooting laugh. “Can’t tell by driving through here. You’d never know it.” This is a really big deal. If the facilities in Spruce Pine are offline for an extended period of time, the entire globe will feel it. Just consider what happened when a fire caused a quartz mine in Spruce Pine to shut down for a brief period of time in 2008… In 2008, a fire in Spruce Pine forced a local quartz mine to halt production, which “all but shut off the supply of high-purity quartz to the world market, sending shivers through the industry.” That fire impacted only one plant—the Unimin Corporation Quartz/Feldspar Plant, which has since been acquired by Sibelco—and its impacts were still felt industry wide. Today, demand for semiconductors is much higher than what it was in 2008 as they’re used to power newer technologies like artificial intelligence and 5G connectivity. Needless to say, what we are facing is far worse than the brief interruption that occurred in 2008. The mountains of North Carolina are also very important to the lithium industry. According to CBNC, a mining operation at Kings Mountain “could produce enough material to manufacture 1.2 million electric vehicles annually”… Kings Mountain could produce enough material to manufacture 1.2 million electric vehicles annually. The mine sits on one of the world’s richest deposits of spodumene ore, a source of lithium. There is currently only one operational lithium mine in the U.S. in Silver Peak, Nevada, which is owned by Albemarle. Albemarle does not have a precise date for when Kings Mountain will become operational, Norris said. The company is preparing to start the permitting process, which will take two years to complete. Construction will be a multiyear undertaking before the mine is operational, according to the company. Despite local opposition, Albemarle has been aggressively pushing forward with this project. And it turns out that Albemarle was recently given a 90 million dollar grant by the Biden administration… The Biden administration has made setting up a battery supply chain, supported by domestic lithium production and processing, a top priority to end dependence on China, which dominates the global market. Albemarle was awarded a $90 million grant from the Defense Department to support domestic mining, which the company is using to help reopen Kings Mountain. 90 million dollars is a lot of money. So there is a lot riding on the success of this project. Interestingly, BlackRock purchased more than 2 million shares of Albemarle less than 2 months ago… On August 31, 2024, BlackRock Inc., a prominent investment management firm, expanded its investment portfolio by acquiring an additional 2,220,059 shares of Albemarle Corp (NYSE:ALB). This transaction increased BlackRock’s total holdings in the company to 12,183,614 shares, reflecting a significant commitment to Albemarle, a key player in the lithium and chemicals industry. The shares were purchased at a price of $90.25 each, marking a strategic addition to BlackRock’s diverse investment portfolio. If you want to understand what is really going on out there, just follow the money. Meanwhile, vast numbers of deeply suffering local residents in the mountains of western North Carolina are still without clean water… Perhaps the greatest irony of Helene is the dire lack of potable water after the floods. The storm completely destroyed Asheville’s water supply system. Water mains and underground pipes were swept away as the ground itself was removed by the torrent. Not a single building in town can access running water, and citizens survive by the thousands of gallons of water being shipped in every day. “We need portable water … nobody can flush their toilets, nobody can take a shower, nobody can do laundry. We have no water and the infrastructure for that water is totally destroyed,” Dr. Carly Brown, a primary care physician in Asheville’s River Arts District, told The Epoch Times. “I haven’t had a shower since last Wednesday. I’m hearing horrible things about [others],” Wendy Feinberg, a 77-year-old retired schoolteacher in Asheville, told The Epoch Times. Many of the communities that have been destroyed by Hurricane Helene will never be rebuilt. We have never seen anything like this, and the federal response to this disaster has been extremely poor. But of course there seems to be plenty of money to send overseas. Just two days ago, Kamala Harris posted the following… The people of Lebanon are facing an increasingly dire humanitarian situation. I am concerned about the security and well-being of civilians suffering in Lebanon and will continue working to help meet the needs of all civilians there. To that end, the United States will provide nearly $157 million in additional assistance to the people of Lebanon for essential needs such as food, shelter, water, protection, and sanitation to help those who have been displaced by the recent conflict. This additional support brings total U.S. assistance to Lebanon over the last year to over $385 million. How tone deaf can she possibly be? Enormous numbers of victims in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Tennessee are not getting the help that they need, but she wants to send 157 million dollars to Lebanon? Is she serious? Sadly, this is just the beginning of the chaos that is coming. More historic natural disasters are on the way, global war will intensify, and the upcoming election will cause a tremendous amount of turmoil. So I would encourage everyone to get prepared while they still can, because you never know when the next major crisis will strike.

Title: Bitcoin News: Fewer And Fewer People Willing To Sell BTC

Bitcoin is a deflationary asset with a fixed supply, unlike Ethereum, whose supply increases or decreases yearly depending on network use. There will be only 21 million BTC in circulation, and a decent portion, exceeding 4 million, is irrecoverable. Now, recent data shows that fewer and fewer people are willing to part with their BTC. According to on-chain data from the Bitcoin long—and short-term holder supply cycles, less than 10% of holders were eager to sell as of October 2024. This percentage is much lower than the 26% of around mid-2021 and the 64% in 2013. Interestingly, this trend shows that long-term holders, those who bought their coins over six months ago, and short-term holders, or those who bought their BTC in less than 155 days, are willing to let go of their coins. This position is even though Bitcoin, like any other crypto asset, is volatile, posting sharp price gains or dumps over time. To put this position in perspective, Bitcoin is down 15% from its all-time high of March 2024. However, it is also up nearly 150% year-to-date after rising from around $27,000 in October 2023. 2022 Bitcoin prices plunged to below $16,000 after soaring to nearly $70,000 in November 2021. The cyclic nature of Bitcoin isn’t, looking at hard data, dissuading traders who sell whenever prices dump, for example. This shift in trend over the years shows that more holders are positive about the coin’s long-term potential and even as a store of value. There could be multiple factors behind this trend, but among the top is the engagement from institutions, especially after approving the first spot of Bitcoin ETFs in the United States early this year. According to Soso Value, spot Bitcoin ETF issuers in the United States manage over $57 billion of BTC. BlackRock controls more than $21.5 billion of user assets, while Grayscale, which is unwinding its GBTC, has seen over $20 billion in outflows since the launch of the derivative product in January. Meanwhile, Adam Buck, the CEO of Blockstream, observes that there are no options–both call and put–that are longer than a year. The CEO adds that this is because most options traders are unwilling to sell their calls since, if they do, most of them will be bought in a flash. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Full Content:
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) will hold its "Advancing AI" event this week, with analysts expecting new product announcements that could drive the stock higher and lift sales. AMD shares are more than 15% above where they started the year, though off the record levels set in March. Thirteen analysts tracked by Visible Alpha have a "buy" or equivalent rating on AMD stock, while three have a "hold" rating. AMD stock has an average target price of $190.56, meaning analysts broadly expect AMD shares will rise a further 11%. AMD closed Monday at just under $171 after changing only slightly tostart the week. The company's shares rose nearly 20% in the days following a similar event last December. Analysts have said they expect AMD to announce new products at the Thursday event, which could pave the way for it to gain market share in the artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator space as it faces off against Nvidia (NVDA), the industry leader. Analysts said the "AI ecosystems partners, customers and developers" that AMD mentioned in the event's announcement could include new customers—evidence of AMD's growing market share.

Title: Citi: NVIDIA To Remain Range-Bound Through The CES In January 2025, Margins To Bottom Out In Q1’25

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Citi has penned an important investment note on NVIDIA today, touching on the stock's immediate prospects and the likely trajectory of the GPU manufacturer's margins as the Blackwell production ramp-up gets underway. Off the bat, Citi has asserted that NVIDIA's under-pressure gross margins will bottom out in the low-70s percents in Q1 2025, with the Wall Street titan continuing to view the ~72 percent level as the likely trough. After Q1, Citi expects NVIDIA's gross margins to stabilize in "the mid-70s%" as the Blackwell architecture ramps up. The bank notes: "While we are bullish on another strong +40% Y/Y cloud data center capex growth next year, we expect the stock to likely remain range bound through CES Jan before Blackwell driven Y/Y sales and gross margin inflection in the Apr-Q." On the topic of the GPU competition that is rapidly heating up, Citi perceives no immediate threat as NVIDIA's products currently lead the market on multiple metrics, including the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and the Return on Investment (ROI). The bank believes data centers prefer NVIDIA's GPUs for the flexibility that they offer: "As NVDA runs various applications including AI, the data center operators rely on NVDA to have the hardware to run multiple applications rather than buying accelerators that are limited in their use cases." According to the bank, an enterprise operating across multiple cloud-based platforms has to re-write its applications specific to every cloud operator, which poses a huge pain point. In contrast, "with NVDA GPUs, enterprises write their applications once as it will be transferable across clouds." What's more, NVIDIA's large installed base already constitutes a strong pull for developers, who desire "the largest possible adoption of their applications." On the topic of the Blackwell sales mix, Citi asserts that the GB200 chip will attract a greater proportion of orders from customers instead of the "B100’s 8-GPU format," owing to the former's favorable TCO and ROI metrics. In light of its positive - if a bit dampened - view on NVIDIA, Citi has maintained its Buy rating on the stock with a target of $150 per share.

Title: A Blockbuster Jobs Report Shifts The Narrative Amid Labor Disputes, Hurricane Destruction And A Close Election

This week’s Future of Work Summit examines the fallout from Amazon’a RTO push, the challenges of leading through disaster and a conversation about AI and work with Handshake’s Valerie Capers Workman. This is the published version of Forbes' Future of Work newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief human resources officers and other talent managers on disruptive technologies, managing the workforce and trends in the remote work debate. Click here to get it delivered to your inbox every Monday! Biltmore Village in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene on September 29, 2024 in Asheville, North Carolina. (Photo by Sean Rayford/Getty Images) October is here, and the sprint to the end of the year is fraught with distractions, disasters and disengagement that will be challenging for anyone managing workplaces and teams. A tight, polarizing election has workers unsettled and anxious—and could drive more conflict in the office. An escalating crisis in the Middle East brings increasing tensions over geopolitical issues, uncertainty about planning ahead and more concerns for employees with family in the region. Add the devastation of a massive hurricane across the Southeast, and it’s been an unparalleled season of disruption for many leaders and workplaces. Hurricane Helene has disrupted operations at a quartz mine in western North Carolina, washing out roads and cutting power to an area critical to semiconductor manufacturing. Some employers across the region are working hard to help workers struggling without power, water or even homes—while others in Tennessee face inquiries from the state Bureau of Investigation over allegations that they ignored warnings about Helene and required employees to report to work, leading to deaths and missing workers. Asheville, which had prospered with an influx of remote workers, entrepreneurs and new business owners, now faces an unprecedented challenge to rebuild. Amid all the chaos is the human cost—and a humanitarian crisis. Disaster relief is inherently hard to execute well, and the people leading it will need support. If you want to help, my colleague Kelly Phillips Erb has a rundown over what you need to know about tax deductible donations and where to donate. Read on for more in today’s newsletter about how Amazon’s RTO push remains in the headlines, Friday’s blockbuster jobs report and an interview with Handshake’s chief talent engagement officer about AI and jobs. September job growth shattered economists’ predictions, as U.S. employers added 254,000 jobs last month, according to nonfarm payrolls data released Friday by the Labor Department. It was the biggest month for jobs growth since March, sprinting past average economist estimates of 150,000 and prompting the unemployment rate to dip to 4.1%, compared to projections of 4.2%, where it stood in August. Investors cheered the news with big stock gains Friday. Striking dockworkers and port employers reached a tentative agreement Thursday, ending a strike that began earlier in the week and lifting concerns over the potential impact to the U.S. economy. The tentative agreement includes a 62% wage increase over six years, according to the Wall Street Journal, and will temporarily relieve Democrats fearful of the strike’s impact on the November election. The big issue still up for negotiation? Automation, as workers remain concerned about the potential for layoffs and fewer jobs for humans in the future. The fallout over Amazon’s decision to require full-time office work has remained in the headlines even several weeks after the tech giant made the announcement. Dell has since mandated that salespeople come back to the office five days a week, while McKinsey is also reportedly asking staff to be onsite more often. Will the trend continue? Contributor Ann Kowal Smith sees Amazon’s move as the “canary in the coal mine for a dangerous problem,” noting “the relationship between employers and employees has become one based on power, not mutual respect and collaboration.” Meanwhile, contributor Ryan Anderson suggests the continued disappointment leaders feel in one-size-fits-all hybrid policies could mean a different approach would be better for workplace flexibility. The most sweeping attempt so far to regulate artificial intelligence, a California bill that could have set a precedent for other laws, was vetoed by Governor Gavin Newsom last week. “I do not believe this is the best approach to protecting the public,” Newsom said, according to the New York Times. If the California bill had been signed into law, writes Forbes contributor Owen Tedford, it would have predominantly focused on improving AI safety, with businesses that create large AI models required to perform safety tests and publicly disclose how they’d prevent the models from being manipulated. Tedford examines what could come next, suggesting the bill could be changed and reintroduced in future sessions. Handshake Chief Talent and Engagement Officer Valerie Capers Workman. Forbes caught up with Valerie Capers Workman, chief talent engagement officer at student careers platform Handshake, about how AI is shifting jobs as we know them, a recent book she published and addressing the gender divide in AI. Excerpts from our conversation have been edited for length and clarity. How is AI changing jobs? I'm going to use my son as an example. He entered school in 2018-2019, he was going to be a data scientist. Data science was the career: You’re going to get a job the second you hit junior year, you're going to be flooded with internships and you're going to be employed. Enter A.I. The ability of A.I. to take on so much of the preliminary data science work [means] you need to be a masters or PhD in data science to skip over what A.I. can do. [He realized] 'I need to go back to school.' He is now applying to universities for artificial intelligence master's degrees. He loves having the skill set, but A.I. enables more companies to do what he was doing. What message did you want to share in your book? The most important concept that I was raising is that the requirement to be superhuman; the requirements of EQ are more important in the age of AI than all the pundits are saying. My point is, yes, you can get an entry level job, but you're not moving up without the EQ, without the combination of AI plus liberal arts skills, the critical thinking skills, you’re going to stay right there. The ability to move and progress in your career? You're going to have to do both. [“AI skills”] are the ability to ask great questions and understand whether or not you've got a great answer and then utilize that answer to do the work you’re doing. The ability to ask great questions? That requires critical thinking skills, language skills, reading comprehension skills, historical context, ethical understanding and understanding of biases. Generative AI is what is going to differentiate the general workforce from the executive workforce track, if you will. I think it was a COO from BlackRock who said [they want] to hire finance or tech employees who have liberal arts or history majors? That’s what I’m talking about. If you're hiring, how do you assess that AI skill? If I'm interviewing someone on my team, I'd ask them: ‘I have this issue. Give me an AI prompt that will help me. Give me a prompt that you would use to help me finish this project for me in five days.’ Are you pulling on the right threads to understand what types of questions you need to ask? If I find someone who knows how to frame a question, I can train you how to do that better. I can’t train you how to think. Do companies have a responsibility to retrain their people who work in fields where jobs will be replaced, such as customer service? That's a great societal question. What is the responsibility of the employer to reskill its current workforce if a set of roles can now be done by AI? I like to put it this way: The companies that understand how to repurpose their workforce for the higher order skills that need to be done by humans—that can't be done by A.I.—are the companies that are going to win. We’re hearing more about how women are not developing the AI skills at the same pace and could get left behind. What can be done to help with this? In higher education, they need to have required courses, period. Just required. It cannot be optional because women are not taking the AI courses at the same rate as their male counterparts. It can't be optional. … The societal issues that caused them to run away from a phrase like prompt engineering go all the way back to when they were in third grade. So, required courses. Same thing with employers. Training should not be optional. … You're going to leave people behind who don't think that certain courses apply to them. AI courses apply to everyone. They should be mandatory. You can solve a lot of societal anomalies and inequities just by making the playing field even for everyone without having people required to opt in. Last week’s jobs report was a big one, prompting a stock market rally and causing the odds of another interest rate cut in the coming months to fall. 176,000: How many more jobs than expected the U.S. nonfarm labor force grew by from July to September, according to the Labor Department. September’s 254,000 nonfarm payroll additions, the highest total in six months, were 104,000 more than economist forecasts, while the government upwardly revised July and August’s payroll growth by 55,000 and 17,000, respectively. 83.8%: Prime-age labor force participation, or people working or looking for work, is near multi-decade highs “The labor market isn’t on the brink of collapse and still has the potential to deliver surprises, however its ability to sustain momentum without further support from the Federal Reserve is not guaranteed.”—​​Cory Stahle, economist for Indeed Hiring Lab, in a statement Here’s how to respond if your employee accuses you of discrimination. Why a lack of female leaders at the top can mirror biases across the organization. Want to establish psychological safety at work?

Title: Humana Stock Is at Multiyear Lows as Investors Digest Its Medicare Rating
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/humana-stock-is-at-multiyear-lows-as-investors-digest-its-medicare-rating-8724352
Time Published: 2024-10-07T19:22:52Z
Full Content:
Humana (HUM) shares slid after Jefferies downgraded the insurer's stock, pointing to the negative impacts of the company's latest ratings for its Medicare offerings. Humana stock plunged last week after the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) said the quality rating of one of its plans, which accounts for nearly half of its Medicare Advantage (MA) memberships, fell to 3.5 stars down from 4.5 stars last year. Higher star ratings generate bonus payments for the insurers that offer plans that earn them. Today the shares, down nearly 2%, are trading at lows not seen since the early days of the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak. Jefferies, meanwhile, cut its rating on Humana to “hold” from “buy,” and slashed its price target from $419 to $253, well off Wall Street's consensus around $327 according to Visible Alpha data. The analysts said that although Humana is suing the CMS, calling its star ratings process flawed—and noting that United Health Group (UNH) and Elevance Health (ELV) both filed successful appeals last year—they are continuing to move forward as if Humana would not win its appeal against CMS. Shares of Humana have sunk since the CMS rating came out last week, adding to a slump that began in January when the company first warned that higher medical costs and government regulations would hurt profits.

Title: Nvidia Eclipses Microsoft As World’s Second-Largest Company As Stock Climbs To 6-Week High

Nvidia stock rallied Monday despite a broader down day on Wall Street for its big technology peers, boosting the artificial intelligence heavyweight to reclaim its spot as the second-largest company in the world amid the AI boom. Nvidia's centibillionaire CEO Jensen Huang speaks last month at a Washington, D.C., conference. Nvidia notched its highest intraday share price since Aug. 26 at $130.64, with shares up about 4.2% by mid-afternoon. The Silicon Valley firm accordingly registered its highest market capitalization since August, and its $3.19 trillion market value sent it past Microsoft ($3.07 trillion) as the world’s second-largest company for the first time in six weeks; Nvidia now only trails Apple’s $3.4 trillion valuation. Nvidia stock’s strong start to the week came despite broader losses, as the S&P 500 slipped 0.6% as higher bond yields and oil prices ate into the equity boost from shifting U.S. monetary policy. Shares of all five trillion-dollar tech companies other than Nvidia fell Monday, with Apple down 1.3%, Microsoft 0.7%, Google parent Alphabet 1.4%, Amazon 2.8% and Facebook parent Meta 0.9%. Nvidia, which designs a full suite of custom AI technology intended for high-end applications like large-language models, benefitted Monday from fellow AI tech maker Super Micro Computer’s announcement that sales for its liquid cooling products deployed alongside Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) was strong this quarter. Another bullish analyst note also boosted shares, as Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes wrote to clients the “setup here is still pretty darn good” for Nvidia stock even as it enjoys an extended bounce. “Strong AI spending” from the likes of Microsoft, Alphabet and ChatGPT parent OpenAI should “catalyze consumption” of Nvidia’s core (GPUs), according to Reitzes. The demand optimism follows continued comments from Nvidia’s centibillionaire CEO Jensen Huang insisting demand for its AI products is “so great” and “insane.” Monday is a continuation of a month-long period of outsized returns for Nvidia, as its 26% return since Sept. 6 trounces the S&P’s 6% gain during the period and its five trillion-dollar peers’ 7% average gain. Nvidia was briefly the world’s largest company in June, when its share price peaked at a still-record $140.76. Previously a fairly low-profile company known for its video game business, Nvidia became a Wall Street darling as its profits skyrocketed amid the generative AI boom. Nvidia’s valuation has increased tenfold over the past two years. $21.9 billion. That’s how much in adjusted profits Nvidia is expected to report in its fiscal quarter ending this month, according to average analyst forecasts tracked by FactSet. That’s a more than 80% year-over-year increase in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and a more than 1,000% jump from 2022’s comparable period. One Community.

Title: Bitcoin: 3 key narratives that could influence BTC prices this week

Rising volumes and price gains suggest traders could be buying into several narratives that could drive prices. Bitcoin [BTC] has traded rangebound between $60,000 and $64,500 in the last seven days. The choppy price movements with no clear trend show a state of market uncertainty. However, BTC could be headed for a volatile week ahead as trading volumes had jumped by 55% at press time per CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin has also gained by 2.5% in 24 hours to trade at $63,435. The rising volumes and price gains suggest that traders could be buying into several narratives that could drive prices this week. The US Federal Reserve is set to release its minutes for the September monetary policy meeting on 9th October. Last month, the Federal Reserve trimmed interest rates for the first time since 2020. The September minutes could shed light on possible rate cuts during the November and December meetings. September’s 50-basis point reduction played a role in driving BTC prices last month. Data from the CME FedWatch Tool shows that 97% of investors anticipate that the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points in November. Source: CME FedWatch Tool A further reduction in interest rates will stir interest in risk assets like Bitcoin. Therefore, if the Fed minutes show a more dovish stance, it could spur BTC gains. The US inflation data for September is set for release on 10th October. Markets anticipate that the annual inflation rate will come in at 2.3%, a drop from 2.5% reported in August. Additionally, the Core Inflation Rate year-on-year is expected to cool down to 3.1%, a drop from the 3.2% reported in August. The Producer Price Index (PPI), which is also used to predict inflation will be released on 11th October. Economists forecast that the year-on-year PPI data will drop from 1.7% to 1.3%. If the inflation data comes in as expected or falls below expectations, it could drive gains for Bitcoin. On the other hand, if this data comes in hotter than expected, it could lead to Bitcoin’s volatility and cause a drop in prices. $10 trillion asset manager BlackRock, which is one of the issuers of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), will release its quarterly results this week. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) holds 367,000 BTC valued at $22 billion. Therefore, the strength of its Q3 earnings could influence prices. JPMorgan will also release its Q3 results later this week, after which it will make 13-F filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealing its exposure to Bitcoin ETFs. In Q2, JPMorgan’s 13-F filing revealed it held $760,000 worth of Bitcoin ETF shares. Given that it is the largest US bank, a change in its Bitcoin ETF holdings could drive volatility. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025 These three narratives are already driving activity in the Bitcoin futures market. BTC’s open interest has increased to the second-highest level this month to $34 million at press time per Coinglass. This increase shows there are more traders opening positions and participating in the market.

Title: Kildare councillor told to pay compensation over criminal damage to Dublin house two years ago

If you've seen value in our reporting, please contribute what you can, so we can continue to produce accurate and meaningful journalism. For everyone who needs it. AN ELECTED REPRESENTATIVE of Kildare County Council who was convicted of criminal damage to a property in south Dublin two years ago in a dispute over payment for work has told a court he was a victim of “gross fraud.” Tom McDonnell (62), a self-employed builder and father of five from Lakeside Park, Newbridge, Co Kildare, had been remanded on bail to appear before a sitting of Dún Laoghaire District Court today to address the issue of compensation. However, McDonnell was ordered by Judge Anne Watkin to return again next year with an additional sum of €1,250 to the €1,000 in cash that he had brought to court. The accused, who was elected as an independent member of Kildare County Council in the local elections in June, had been convicted at an earlier court hearing of causing damage to windows at the rear of a house in Rockville Crescent, Blackrock, Co Dublin on 6 September 2022, contrary to Section 2 (1) of the Criminal Damage Act 1991. Counsel for the defendant, John McCoy BL, told Judge Watkin today that the question of compensation was complicated by a related “civil matter.” McCoy pointed out that a claim for damages had been settled by an insurance company for €16,900. However, Judge Watkin pointed out that the injured party had lost a no claims bonus which the court heard had cost him €2,250 this year and an uncertain amount in the future. In response to McCoy’s repeated insistence that his client was unsure what to do because of the uncertainty about the estimate of future losses and the civil matter, the judge retorted: “I don’t think you understand what you are doing here.” She added: “I’m not concerned about the civil matter.” The court heard McDonnell believed that the injured party had already been compensated with a sum that exceeded the damage that was done. Following a brief consultation with his client, McCoy said the defendant was prepared to increase his offer of compensation of €1,000 to the amount of the value of the no claims bonus that had been lost. Judge Watkin pointed out to the barrister that the whole situation had arisen from the position the injured party had been left in by McDonnell. Advertisement Asked to confirm his willingness to pay compensation of €2,250, the defendant said he would but claimed it was “gross fraud.” “I’m owed €23,000. This is fraud,” McDonnell added. The judge observed that McDonnell was accusing his victim of fraud “after what you did to him.” Asked what he was going to do to show remorse, McDonnell said he would require two months to pay the additional amount of compensation. The case was adjourned, with the defendant ordered to appear before a sitting of the same court in January. McDonnell was elected as an independent councillor for the Newbridge local electoral area of Kildare County Council this summer. He received 548 first preference votes which equated to 4.7% of the total valid poll. McDonnell was elected on the 11th and final count to the last of six seats without reaching the quota. The Kildare man is a co-founder of Éire Saor – an unregistered umbrella group of independent candidates who contested the local elections in Kildare on an anti-immigration platform and to oppose planning permission being granted for centres to house international protection applicants. Following his election, McDonnell generated widespread controversy over comments he made in which he claimed Irish people were in danger of dying out because Irish women were not breeding enough. He subsequently expressed regret for his choice of words but explained they were due to his farming background. McDonnell added that he supported tax incentives being given to working women to have more children. In a newspaper interview, he stated his belief that a secret cabal of “Khazarian Jews” are running the world and trying to flood Europe with immigrants as part of a plot to replace Irish people. McDonnell, who is planning to contest the upcoming general election, has denied that he is a far-right politician or anti-immigration but stressed that he was against mass uncontrolled immigration.

Those hoping the mass layoffs among Big Tech companies were finally ending are in for a disappointment, with a new report predicting Amazon is on the verge of cutting nearly 14,000 manager roles. According to Morgan Stanley, via TechCrunch’s Manish Singh, Morgan Stanley says Amazon will reduce its manager headcount by 13,834 by the end of the Q1 2025.

More recently, the company has rolled out a controversial five-day-a-week RTO mandate, which some believe to be an effort to thin the company’s ranks and trim unneeded roles. Some employees have already voiced their opposition to the RTO mandate, with some saying they have no intention of complying, often because they were hired during the pandemic, assured remote work would continue, and live outside commuting range of any corporate office. It’s unclear at this time if Amazon will primarily target these individuals, or if the layoffs will have a wider scope.

Title: EM Currencies Fall for Fifth Day as Traders Temper Fed Bets

(Bloomberg) -- Emerging-market currencies declined for a fifth consecutive session on Monday as traders scaled back bets on another big interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve amid signs of a resilient US economy. The MSCI Inc. gauge for developing-nation currencies was down 0.3% as of 12:10 p.m. in New York, posting its longest streak of losses since July. The Malaysian ringgit and the Indonesian rupiah were among the worst performers in a basket of currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Oil prices rose as investors remain nervous about increased tensions in the Middle East. Traders have been rethinking the path for the Fed’s policy easing since the release of stronger-than-expected US jobs data on Friday. US Treasury 10-year yields rose to hover the 4% level as traders pared wagers on another half-point cut by the US central bank. “The repricing of the US easing cycle is likely to keep EMFX under pressure in the short term,” said Luis Estrada, a strategist at RBC Capital Markets. Bearish bets on the US dollar are being dismantled, while some investors are also buying dollars to hedge their constructive wagers on EM rates, he said. JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists cut their recommendation on EM local-currency debt last week, citing the “big upside surprise” in payrolls and risks stemming from the US presidential election in about a month. That comes after EM local bonds posted their biggest quarterly advance since 2020. The benchmark for emerging-market equities rose for a second day, mostly driven by gains in shares of Asian semiconductor companies. A subindex for Latin America stocks retreated. Optimism about stimulus measures has sparked a massive rally in Chinese stocks. Exchange-traded funds that buy the nation’s equities have seen billions of dollars in inflows. China’s top economic planner will hold a press briefing on Tuesday to discuss a package of policies aimed at boosting economic growth. Details on potential fiscal policy stimulus will be key in determining whether the momentum of the current rally can continue or whether the relief might be only temporary, according to Nenad Dinic, an equity strategist at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich. “In the short term, EM ex-China stocks may continue to underperform China due to rotational shifts in capital flows,” Dinic said. In credit markets, El Salvador’s notes jumped after the government launched a tender offer for several debt instruments. Bonds maturing in 2050 rose as much as 2.8 cents on the dollar, according to indicative pricing collected by Bloomberg. Ghana bonds also rose after the nation received “overwhelming” backing of bondholders to restructure $13 billion of eurobonds. --With assistance from Srinivasan Sivabalan.

Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares soared Monday as the server maker reported strong shipments of its graphics processing units (GPUs), driven by artificial intelligence (AI) demand.

MILAN (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs has derivative positions in UniCredit equivalent to a 6.7% stake in the Italian bank as of Sept. 30, mostly swap and future contracts as well as call options, a regulatory filing showed on Monday. The position, held through Goldman Sachs International and another nine subsidiaries, if exercised would make the U.S. bank a top investor in UniCredit whose single biggest shareholder is fund manager BlackRock with 7.02%. Filings with Italian market regulator Consob also showed that Barclays holds shares and derivatives as of Sept. 30 in Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena, which if combined and exercised would give it a 5.3% stake in the lender. The positions are held through Barclays Capital Securities Limited, Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Capital Inc. They comprise a voting stake of just 0.92% while another 4.2% is long positions to be settled in shares. (Reporting by Valentina Za; Editing by Susan Fenton) Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Wall Street's hacks and habits to stay on top of their game

Time Published: 2024-10-07T15:44:25Z
Full Content:
Call it superstitious, but Mark Zhu, a 34-year-old managing director at Blackstone, likes to start every day the same way. He has two Trader Joe's yogurt cups, one banana-flavored and one blueberry-flavored, eaten in the same order, followed by his supplements, which also have their specific sequence. "Those are just examples of how I bring a level of consistency and sequencing to my life," he said. "Because you know the moment after 9 o'clock, the days can get chaotic." Similarly, the 90 minutes between 5:30 a.m. to 7 a.m. are precious to Craig Kolwicz. The Moelis investment banker uses that time to put himself in control for the rest of the day, whether by going to the gym, meditating, or reading a book. "You're not getting pulled in all different directions with your deals, your transactions, or just things in life," said the 35-year-old managing director. "It's sacred time to me — anything before 7 a.m. is my time." It's no secret that working on Wall Street is demanding. Finance giants from Blackstone to Goldman Sachs attract some of the brightest and most driven people, and to climb the ranks is no easy feat. When we asked top up-and-comers on Wall Street about the habits or routines they followed to keep themselves mentally sharp, no one mentioned cold plunges, 10-step facial rituals, or biohacking trends that tout themselves as life hacks that instantly make you more attractive, healthier, smarter, and more balanced. Most of these high performers featured on Business Insider's 2024 list of rising stars of Wall Street are spending time with their families, keeping physically and mentally healthy with reasonable workout and sleep routines, and finding opportunities to recharge. Here's what we learned about the hacks, habits, and routines that help top talent on Wall Street stay on their game. Chicago-based Bank of America investment banker Corey White is another early riser. He relies on his Apple watch to wake him up gently, with a little vibration at 5 a.m. The 35-year-old works out. He's partial to weight lifting but recently took up running thanks to his twin brother, who works in private equity. He sends his kids off to school and listens to a podcast on an hour-long commute into the office. "My mornings are super important to me to have a nice, kind of slow start to the day. And I found it's regulating," he told BI. The routine helps him stay present with his home life as well as work, he added. Nina Gnedin, a San Francisco-based portfolio manager from Man Group, starts her day at 4:30 a.m. because she works East Coast market hours. "I wake up. I do my face. I do my skincare. I brush my teeth. I drink my double shot of espresso. I do all my morning work rituals, where I check the trades. I check on the portfolios around 7, 7:30. I get coffee again." Her "very regimented" workday ends at 3 p.m., which allows her to get outside and enjoy the outdoors. "There's no day of the year where the sun's down when I'm done with work," she said. Bridgewater Associates deputy chief investment officer Blake Cecil likes to push himself (and his team) to meet deadlines that might be arbitrary on paper but give him a mental goal to chase. The 32-year-old overpromises on projects intentionally to " trick" himself into working more efficiently and diligently. One example is he will ask his team and himself this hypothetical: "Let's imagine we had to deliver this in 24 hours — how would we do that?" Often, this leads to creative and innovative work, he told BI. BlackRock's Chi Chen, 34, winds down her weekends with a Sunday evening reading ritual that helps her "distill my brain." It's a two-hour affair, starting with one hour of the books she's reading. The fixed-income portfolio manager is a fan of non-fiction and just read "Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst" by Robert Sapolsky. After that, she turns back to the markets. She reads external and internal research and prepares for the week. Since starting at Bank of America, Justin Elliott has had a daily regimen designed to take up his 20-minute commute to work. "It's really around my faith — I do a devotion. Read a Bible scripture, pray. Come into the office and listen to a gospel song," the 29-year-old vice president on the institutional rates sales desk at Bank of America told BI. "That's my every morning routine for getting me centered for the day. It's about reminding me why I'm here and what it's all about." He also goes to the gym two to three times a week and has recently been doing sound baths and meditation with his wife. Listening to music on her drive to her Boston office helps Fidelity Investments' Palmer Osteen, 31, take her mind off what's about to come and what's ahead so she can start her workday with a clear head. It also works for her way home. Music "helps me reset and decompress and not go to bed with a hamster wheel in my brain," she said. KKR's Alissa Song, who grew up in Silicon Valley but now lives in New York, uses the time to touch base with family and friends. "It just keeps me connected to the people I care about," the 31-year-old industrials investor told BI. "I've been doing this since my college internships." "Part of it is just that we came to the US when I was really young, and so here it's just the four of us here, my two parents and my brother. And so we're really close," she added. "That's been a way that I've kept in touch." Similarly, making time for quality time with friends and family keeps Daniela Cardona, 29, grounded. "I work a ton," the RBC investment banking vice president said, but "most important is I've never lost sight of my friends, my support system." Bank of America's White has a family day every Saturday with his wife and two young sons. "We go to the museums, go to the zoo, go to the water park, wherever it is, we just fully, deeply focus on our family," he said. "And I think being able to give 100% to whatever you're focused on is really important for just productivity, but also for the mental side of I'm here right now in the moment with my family and being fully immersed in that." Ben Carper, who finished his Padi open water certification a couple of years ago, tries to take a trip or two a year with his wife that focuses on diving. Along with a chance to see exotic locations, it's a chance to completely unplug. "It's a change of scenery, and it's kind of hard to think about work when there's a 25-foot manta ray swimming nearby," Carper, a 34-year-old managing director on Jefferies' Private Capital Advisory team, added. His last dive was in the Maldives, and he's eyeing Thailand next. Matthew Eid-Holm, a principal at Ares Management, skis or scuba dives at least every 6 months. "A few hours of these activities that require 100% focus on the present are very effective at resetting," the 32-year-old told BI. Also, on the ocean theme, Moelis' Kolwicz is a pretty avid surfer. "Being out on the ocean, getting that physical activity — it's easy to zone out." There are ways to decompress and relax on land, too. Melissa Ding, an infrastructure investor at BlackRock, likes to engage in meditative activities like cooking, pottery, or tending to her terrace garden to give the 33-year-old a "little bit of mental reset." "When I need a little bit of rest time, there are just things that I do that where I can kind of zone out." Her garden consists of flowers, including dahlias, and a recently planted fig tree. Wells Fargo's Annie Cheslin, 34, recently learned how to play the centuries-old strategy game mahjong, which she's become "obsessed with." The managing director in high-grade municipal trading joined a club that meets twice a month to play. Physical challenges are a way to distract yourself from the day-to-day and counterbalance the time you spend in front of computer screens or client dinners. Margaret Williams, a 31-year-old executive director at Morgan Stanley, said she exercises in some form or fashion every day. Williams will do anything, from a run in Central Park to weightlifting to laps at a hotel pool on the road to late-night walks with the dog. "It's a part of staying balanced, physically and mentally," she said. Being disciplined about daily workouts is also how Apollo's Austin Anton, 32, clears his head. "I find that when I go for a run, I have my most creative ideas, and I love to run, and I tend to do that every other day," he said. "So I find that very helpful in terms of clearing my head and allowing me to think through something." Erica Wilson's workout of choice is weightlifting, which "has become a real stress reliever over the last couple of years," she told BI. The 31-year-old vice president at Blue Owl's daily habit has evolved into a competitive hobby. She participated in a power-lifting competition last year through Tone House — she deadlifted nearly twice her body weight — as well as Hyrox, a fitness race featuring eight separate physical exercises, such as sled pulls or burpee broad jumps, with a 1-kilometer run in between each. For Harrison DiGia, morning is the best time to get a workout in. "I try to wake up and move my body. I do some sort of workout every morning, whether it's strength training, playing tennis, or even stretching or yoga," the 31-year-old General Atlantic vice president said. "I'm a huge tennis player. I like using that time in the morning to clear my mind. It helps me reset and gets me ready for the new day ahead." Patrick Lenihan, a portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management, has a strict bedtime. "There's some nights where you need to get things done, but I try to have a hard cutoff. Let's just say 9:30— that's lights out." That gives him 30 or 45 minutes to wind down and ensure he gets his sleep, not just for physical health, but mental, too. He also makes a point to stay active. He played hockey his whole life, but after a few surgeries, he now does lower-impact exercises like pilates and barre at least three or four times a week. "Now that I'm on paternity leave, I've been lucky enough to do it, get in a little bit more. But I think those two things help me to at least stay recharged and stay ready each day," he said. Luckily, his infant son is a great sleeper and has not disturbed Patrick's rest so far. "I definitely think getting sleep is important," Elizabeth Stone Redding, a principal at TPG, told BI. "It's certainly something I have realized as I've matured in my career, that you really need to use your brain, and you need to get a decent amount of sleep for that." The 33-year-old also habitually sets priorities to stay on track and not get overwhelmed. "It's very easy to obviously be overwhelmed with a large list of things, but narrowing it down and saying, 'Okay, these are the two or three things I really want to do today,' helps me a lot," Stone Redding said. "I try to have — even if it's just in my head — a list of two or three things I want to accomplish in a given day." Matt Gilbert, a 35-year-old managing director at Thoma Bravo, started working with an executive coach a few years ago. He was surprised when the coach pushed him to pull back at work. "I would say, in general, workaholic or 'Type A' people tend to try to grasp more and more responsibility," he said. "And I actually think ultimately that was the case for me." Gilbert now spends more time with his family. He has made a habit of watching TV with his wife every night and dropping his oldest daughter at school. "I think I fill up my cup in terms of personal fulfillment so that my time that I'm at work, I can really, really focus and dedicate to that and kind of maximize the time that I have here." Gidan Dan's key ritual at work is consistently staying in touch with his clients, but at home, the Citadel Securities senior vice president takes the chance to relax. "A lot of my colleagues are really good runners and they work out and everything. I'm completely different," he said. "I think I work long enough hours, so I don't want to exhaust myself too much. So I would just go home, and taking care of my kids is enjoyable but exhausting stuff," Dan said of his two daughters, aged 1 and 4. Feroz Khosla, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, isn't just looking for work-life balance, but "work-life harmony — which just means, when you look back at your career, you feel as if there was harmony between work and life," he told BI. "Sometimes, you do need to have the power to say no, but do it gracefully," he said. "Maybe the answer is sure, but not right now—and being able to do that without disappointing people is super helpful." Jump to

Title: Rabbit CEO Jesse Lyu isn’t thinking too far ahead

By Nilay Patel, editor-in-chief of The Verge, host of the Decoder podcast, and co-host of The Vergecast. Today, I’m talking with Jesse Lyu, the founder and CEO of Rabbit. The startup company makes the adorable r1 AI gadget — a little handheld designed by superstar design firm Teenage Engineering. It’s meant to be how you talk to an AI agent, which then goes off onto the internet and does things for you, from playing music on Spotify and ordering an Uber to even buying things on Amazon. Rabbit launched with a lot of hype at CES and a big party in New York, but early reviews of the device were universally bad. Our own David Pierce gave it a 3 out of 10 in May, saying that most of the features don’t work or don’t even exist. And the core feature that didn’t seem to exist was the most important of all: Rabbit’s large action model, or LAM, which is meant to allow the system to open a web browser in the cloud and browse for you. The LAM is supposed to intelligently understand what it’s looking at on a website and literally click around to accomplish tasks on your behalf. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! There have been a lot of questions about just how real Rabbit’s LAM was, but the company finally launched what it calls the LAM Playground, which lets people use a bare-bones version of the system. It does indeed appear to be clicking around on the web, although it is very slow. So, I wanted to know how Jesse planned to invest in the LAM and compete with other AI agents that promise to do things for you. For example, Microsoft just announced a new agent-y version of Copilot, and Apple’s vision for the next generation of Siri is an AI agent — and it’ll run on your phone and have direct access to those apps and your data inside them. It’s the same with Google and Gemini and Amazon’s rumored next generation of Alexa. This is major competition for a startup, and Jesse talked about wanting to get out ahead of it. But really, I wanted to know how Rabbit’s system works and whether it’s durable — not just technically, which is challenging, but also from a business and legal perspective. After all, if Rabbit’s idea works and the LAM really does go and browse websites for you… what’s stopping companies like Spotify and DoorDash from blocking it? You might have a strong point of view here — Jesse certainly does — but at some point, there’s going to be a fight about this, and it’s not clear what’s going to happen. To put this in historical context, about a decade ago, a handful of startups tried to stream broadcast television without licenses by putting a bunch of antennas in a single location and building apps that let people access them. This felt technically legal — what’s the difference between all those people having their own antennas and putting all those antennas in a single place and those accessing them over the internet? Some of these companies were seriously innovative — the most famous was a company called Aereo, which spent a ton of money designing specialized TV antennas the size of a nickel so it could pack as many of them into a data center as possible. I wrote about Aereo back then — visited the antenna floor, interviewed the CEO, the whole thing. Aereo then got sued by the TV networks, the case went to the Supreme Court in 2014, and you will note that Aereo no longer exists. I don’t know if Rabbit is another Aereo, and I don’t know how all these companies will react to having robots browse their websites instead of people. And I certainly don’t know how legal systems around the world will handle the inevitable lawsuits to come. I asked Jesse about all of this, and you’ll hear his answer: he thinks Rabbit will be so successful that these companies will want to show up and make deals. I have to say, I don’t know about that, either. I do know that this is a pretty intense and occasionally contentious interview. Jesse didn’t back down, and that means we got pretty deep into it. Let me know what you think. Okay, Jesse Lyu, founder and CEO of Rabbit. Here we go. The following transcript was edited for clarity. Jesse Lyu, you’re the founder and CEO of Rabbit. Welcome to Decoder. Thank you, Nilay. Glad to be here. I’m very excited to talk to you. Rabbit is a fascinating company. The idea for the r1 product is fascinating. I think a lot of people think that something that looks like the r1 is the next evolution of smartphones or products or something. And then there’s the company itself, which is really interesting, and you’ve got a connection to Teenage Engineering, which is one of our favorite companies here at The Verge. So, just a lot to talk about. And you’ve got some news to share about opening up Rabbit’s Large Action Model so people can play with it, and it’s kind of an early version. I really want to talk about that. But let’s start with Rabbit itself. The company has not been around that long. The r1 just started shipping six months ago. What is Rabbit? How’d the company start? Long story short, it’s a very young company. So here’s a little bit of history of it. I actually started a AI company back in 2013, which was called Raven Tech, and we were at YC Winter ‘15 batch. And it’s basically my personal dream to chase this grand vision that, I guess, me being this generation, growing up, we watched so many sci-fi movies, there’s AI stuff here and there. And I guess every geek wants to build their own Jarvis at some point. So I think that’s exactly how I started Raven Tech 11, 12 years ago. And back then, we had this idea, we had this direction, but the technology back then — obviously, there wasn’t like GPU training, there weren’t transformers and stuff. So we worked really hard on the early days of voice dictation and NLP and NLU, which is natural language processing and natural language understanding. So the technology wasn’t there, but we tried our best. We actually built and entire cloud system and the hardware, which is similar to what we have in Rabbit today. But the form factor was more of a smart speaker — as we all know back 10 years ago, everyone was chasing that form factor. Ultimately, the company got acquired, so it’s not a new idea for myself, but it’s definitely a new opportunity that when I saw the progress on the research side, the transformer, obviously, [when] I got a chance to try ChatGPT, or GPT’s API. We were really impressed because we felt the timing is right. Because being able to do something like r1 or more sci-fi, Jarvis stuff, you really need to figure out two parts from the back end. One is that you want to make sure that by talking to the device, the computer or device actually understand what you’re talking about, which is the transformer, the large language model part. But we believe at around 2020, 2021, we believe that the transformer is absolutely the right path that opening, other companies are heading to. We believe that portion has been solved, will be solved. So our focus immediately shifted to: after this device can understand you, can it actually help you do things? And the company that I started 10, 11 years ago, Raven Tech, we were actually one of the first company that designed a cloud API structure. After the [voice] recognition, after the understanding, the query got sent into different APIs. The system has a detector to understand, “Oh, maybe you are looking for a restaurant on Yelp. Maybe you want to play a song from this streaming software.” But I guess 10 years ago, there’s a great opportunity of APIs. There are a lot of company working on APIs. And if you remember 10 years ago in Silicon Valley, everyone was talking about maybe in the future the entire operating system will be just HTML5. Right? But that didn’t live quite long. I think now when we’re looking after 2020, the API business is not really major business for most of the popular services. So we also want to take an evaluation of whether we can build a generic piece of agent technology, which is really hard. Because I believe the current AI is all generic. Obviously, there’s a lot of people doing vertical stuff. Right? You can build an agent for Excel. You can build an agent for legal documentation process. But I think the biggest dream, what’s really make us excited is the generic part of it. It’s like, can we build something that without pre-training, without knowing people want to do what, and they just talk whatever they want, and we’ll be able to smart enough to handle all the tasks. So that’s why we felt the opportunity was right, and we started Rabbit right after COVID. The idea that agents are going to be a big part of our life, and in particular general purpose agents that go take actions for us on the internet — I’ve heard this idea from all kinds of folks, from startup founders like yourself to the CEOs of the biggest companies in the world. I want to come back to that. That’s a big idea, but I just want to stay focused on Rabbit for a second. How many people work at Rabbit today? I believe at the current moment, we’re roughly around 50 people, 50 to 60 people if we plus the interns. But when we started, the company was seven, and by the time we launched as CES it was 17. So just by growing the team within four or five months, it was quite a challenging job for me. So CES was the big launch. We were there, David Pierce was at the party. The Rabbit was introduced. You gave demos in a hotel room, I think. And then you had the launch party here at the TWA Hotel at JFK, which is very cool. The thing’s been out, but you’ve been growing. You said you started at 17 people in January at CES, and you have 50 now. What are you adding all those people to do? Most of it’s just engineers. We have a very small group of design, hardware design or ID that we started from day one, and most of the new folks are working on AI and infrastructure perspective, like cloud basically. We not only ship the hardware. We build the entire Rabbit OS for it. So I think the major work is always going to be in the software part. How is the whole company structured? As you go from seven to 17 to 50, you obviously have to decide how to structure Rabbit. How is that structured now? How has it changed? We are primarily located in Santa Monica. We have a device team of really great folks in the Bay Area, and we have a couple of research engineers here and there. So it’s kind of mostly in person, but a somewhat hybrid system. And the way that we find our people is mostly by internal referring. So we’re not spending money chasing for agents, agencies to do the hiring. Most of the good folks, we basically do internal recommendation. But your 50 people that you have now, how is that organized inside the company? It’s really flat in a sense. We have different departments, obviously. The hardware ODM/OEM part is in Asia. We have our ID team in collaboration with folks in Stockholm.,Teenage Engineering in this case. And we do our own graphics and marketing, all of that in house. And then for the software part, we have the device team that they need to work with the ODM/OEM. And we have the cloud team, we have the AI team. That’s basically how much team we have. And each team, there’s obviously crossovers, and we basically work project-based. So there is no crazy hierarchy going on. I mean, the biggest company I ever led was back in the Raven days. I believe by the time we got acquired, we were 250 people. So this is still within my comfort zone, to manage 50-ish people. Teenage Engineering is a big part of the Rabbit story. They obviously designed the r1 hardware, and then their founder, Jesper Kouthoofd, is your chief design officer. How much more hardware are you designing right now? Are there iterations to come? Do you have a roadmap of new products? The way we work together — obviously this is not the first time we’ve collaborated. We did a collaboration back in Raven days. First of all, Teenage Engineering is my hero company. It’s basically a fanboy dream come true story for me, and I really appreciate their help over the years. The way that we work together is very intuitive. There are obviously many ways that coudl be considered to be the proper way of designing a project like this, but I think we’re out of the ordinary way of doing this — I can give you an example. Back in the Raven days, all we did is that we had probably two meetings in person, a couple of phone calls, no email, no text messages. We set up a secret Instagram account that we just used to share sketches, and we just hit like on our Instagram accounts, and that’s how we designed the previous Raven project. This time, it was even quicker. I think I shared this publicly. I think we spent probably 10 minutes on deciding how the r1’s going to look like, and we had quick sketches here and there. Ultimately, I pushed Jesper for using the current color, which is the orange. We do have maybe two or three projects in our minds, but I think by the end of this year, our current focus is to really get this LAM pushed to the next level. So yeah, stay tuned. I think one thing people will realize is that this team does hardware really quick. Because when we start sketching the r1, it was like last year back in November, and we introduced that by January, and we start shipping by April. So if we want to launch the next project, it’s going to be roughly, I don’t know, six to eight months timeframe. Certainly not like a year or two. But that being said, I think... I was having my own community voice chat yesterday. I was talking to people about the current r1 because I really don’t like the current consumer electronics. Like, one year per generation by default, regardless. We’ve seen that from the smartphone companies doing annual release for all this stuff with minor changes. When we started designing the r1, the entire Rabbit OS runs out of cloud. That means that this piece of hardware, even though it’s $199 and not the latest chips, it’s really capable of offloading the future features to this device. So I don’t think r1 is like a one-year lifespan device. Our community does, though. They think they can tweak so many things about it. So in that sense, we’re not in a rush to drop another version of it, but we do have different form factors in our mind at the moment. And is Jesper actively working on those designs, or as chief design officer, is he working on something else? He was literally in our office three days ago. Yeah, we are actively working together. Correct. How much money have you raised so far? That’s a good question. I want to be accurate, but it’s somewhere around $50 million total in the whole lifespan. Last part was $35 million led by Sound Venture and also Khosla Venture, and Amazon Alexa, Foundation Synergist. So last round was $35M, and if you consider all the money together, I think it’s around $50M. When I look at the amount of money that other AI companies are going out to raise, right as we are speaking, OpenAI just raised the biggest round ever in history to go build, obviously, a foundation model, digital god, whatever Sam Altman thinks he’s doing. Do you think you can compete at $35 million a round? No, but I think talking about competition — money is one part of it. I think I’ve considered myself a veteran because I’ve done startups before. I know how it works. Certainly, money is very important, probably most important in the early couple of years. But I think when we talk about competition, we ultimately want to ship products to consumers. Because the way I look at it is that people are not buying electricity. Electricity is basically controlled by — here in California, it’s Southern California Edison, right? You have an address, you have to pay for it regardless of how much electricity you’re using. But I think people are ultimately buying microwaves, cars, motorcycles, televisions. People are buying products powered by electricity. So research-wise, I can say very clearly, we have at this moment of Rabbit, there’s no way that we can compete over OpenAI, Anthropic, and DeepMind and Google, but how can we play the game? We become partners with everyone. Right? So r1 is hosting every single model, the latest models from these guys. Their capabilities combined with our product innovation on the Rabbit OS and all the features offered to our user. So there’s no way we can compete over on a research perspective, but we ship product fast. You saw OpenAI just released the Instant API, as they call it. I was actually invited to the meeting, but I was launching the LAM Playground yesterday, so I couldn’t be there in person. But they’re offering an API for people to build an agent for it. But yesterday, we dropped a LAM Playground, which you can go to any website and just [browse] it by voice. So I think competition is a different magnitude. I think money is definitely important. We hope that we can raise more money, of course. But I think right now, if you talk about competition, we have to play smart. They are good on the research. We are good on converting all the latest research into a piece of product that users can use today. Let’s talk about what that product is today. So right now you have the r1. You can buy it. It’s a beautiful piece of hardware. It is orange. It is very striking. It has a screen, it has a scroll dial, and then it has a connection to your service in the cloud, which goes and does stuff for you. Yep. That costs $199. Are you making money on the sale of each individual r1 unit right now? Correct. What’s the margin? What’s your profit on r1? I have my r1 right here. It’s a very good margin, even though I cannot tell you the details, but it’s over 40 percent. Do you make over 40 percent on the hardware margin of the r1? On hardware margin, which we did the math, we run the calculations. We might have to redo the math because yesterday, literally after dropping the LAN Playground, the server crashed multiple times. So we might need to redo the calculation. But again, first of all, in the beginning we’re making money. Now we have these more powerful features moving forward. I think I haven’t heard a company that went bankrupt because they got a popular service that is so popular that they couldn’t afford cloud bills. I think if you build a good product, there will be — Well, hold on, I can draw that line for you. So it’s $199. You’re making over 40 percent per unit, so that’s between $80 and $90, right? It’s not 50 percent, which would be $100, so it’s a little less. So between $80 and $90 in margin. That margin — you do have to pay your cloud bills, right? Yeah. So is that margin all being fed into your cloud bills? Obviously, we have this dedicated instance with all these cloud competitors. Right? I mean, don’t get me wrong. The Amazon AWS, they’re hosting on AWS, and there’s AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure. On the LLM partnerships, we have Anthropic, OpenAI and Gemini. So don’t get me wrong, it — That’s a lot of companies that like to make a lot of money. I just want to be... They’re not cheap to partner with, all those companies. They’re not cheap, but what I’m trying to point out is that they are competing so fiercely in a way that they have a lot of good benefits for the early startups. I have to shout out for all these companies. So they really want to figure out a way to help you on board and maybe making your money in the long run, but I think at this current scale, we can totally handle it, yes. So we get great deals from them. So if I buy an r1 from you, you take $90 of margin, or $80 of margin. At what point, how much do I have to use my r1 to turn that negative for you? Because everything I do with an AI, that’s a token. That token costs money. It costs multiple servers. Your bandwidth cost money. It all costs money. How much does a single r1 user have to use their r1 to take up $90 of margin, or $80 of margin from you? So I think of a moderate user using it in a non-robotic way or a non-malicious way, it’s going to be really hard to break down. But — Is that two years worth of usage? One year? Six months? I think it’s definitely over a year and a half. I’m not sure about two years because there’s new features we’re going to implement into this, including LAM Playground and teach mode. But yeah, so I want to share my understanding of this is that yes, we did the mathematics. We are making money. No problem. We wish we can sell more, which we’re hoping that we can sell more. That’s going to definitely help. But I think the target of this whole launch strategy is not set for making X amount of money on first six months. I think there’s other companies that really greedy about how they want to launch their product. I’m not going to even mention a name, so that won’t work. That won’t work. So I think if you look at any new generation of product, if the founder and the company and the board decide to set up a strategy that’s, “Let’s squeeze every single penny out of the user,” it’s not going to work. Because we know AI is very early, and we know that there’s going to be a lot of things that go wrong. In fact, I believe that every company, regardless of if you’re big or small, if you work on the latest AI stuff, the first two weeks, it’s going to be disaster because you’re going to find a lot of the misbehavior about the AI. You’re going to find a lot of the edge cases by the model. So I think the whole thing is too new. There’s no way that we want to charge for subscription. That’s even worse. I don’t like that strategy in general. So even though this sounds very concerning, that, okay, you can easily twist my story or someone might twist my story, be like, “Oh, Rabbit is doing everything great except they’re going bankrupt no matter what” right? I think there’s a very stupid way to think in that sense, because a great innovation, you have to focus on the innovative part first. Then you figure out the money part. If we start figuring out the money part now, none of this is making sense. Really. None of this is making sense. I think there’s other people in the industry that they have a great understanding of everything, and then they decided to release a wallpaper app, charge $4.50 per month. Right? Hopefully that works, I guess. You can go talk to that guy and you say, “Hey, there’s no way you’re going to bankrupt because your money checks, all this equation checks. If you charge for this, you’re going to be making money.” But that’s based on the perspective that the whole logic needs to stand up, right? So I think I’m not really wasting a lot of my time at this point on trying to basically fine tune a little about mathematical equations to make this more like, 20 percent, 50 percent. Obviously, as a startup, we need to survive, even though we have a roller coaster ride since launch. But we’re growing, and we’re surviving, and we’re still pushing the features that none of the other devices, including iPhone can do, which is a very, very good sign. So one, I don’t think anybody has ever linked criticism of Humane to criticism of Marques’ wallpaper app on our show before. Well done. I think Marques has a very different view of where his expertise is and what went wrong with that app and maybe one day we’ll talk to him about it. But my question for you, when you talk about growth and you talk about the unit economics of the Rabbit is that on some curve, the hardware becomes unprofitable for you. Just me having a Rabbit for longer than 18 months becomes unprofitable for you. That’s the moment that you would charge a subscription. You would say “to continue using this thing, it can’t be negative for our company.” And that’s the thing that I’m pushing on here. I think there are multiple solutions to that question. One is that obviously — let’s use R1 for every user for more than 18 months. There’s a couple of solutions. One is that we are going to launch the next generation device, and maybe multiple devices, that are still profitable from the hardware. Two, I think we have this prepared for since day one. From last week we’ve rolled out the alpha of Teach Mode to a very selected group of testers. I would love to give you the access, so please reach out to us later on. We’ll see if we can help you set it up. But we rolled out a very small group of our testers, roughly around 20, 25 people to be honest. And then over the last 72 hours I saw more than probably 200, more than 200 lessons or agents has been created through Teach mode. And if you look at the current Apple ecosystem or Android ecosystem, I think the hardware is not going to be the number one money contributor. It’s really hard to make on top of the margin of the hardware anyway. So at some point you want to convert that into services and software. That doesn’t mean that you’re going to charge a subscription for the device. What I think is very promising is that we are going to slowly roll out the teach mode to beta testers and hopefully by the end of this year we can grand open the teach mode as we promised on day one. So all these lessons created or Rabbits or agents created by each independent users or developers, they can be considered as a new generation of an app store. On that, we can make big money. Using the app store economics of taking 30 percent. I don’t want to invent any — exactly. I think I’m not trying to invent any new business model. I think as a startup it’s very risky to invent your own business model, but there is a very great business model out there which is App Store and that’s contributing like what, 70 percent for the annual income, right? I’m just curious, just as I’ve played with R1s and looked at the device, I’ve always wondered how on earth are you making money at $199? So that makes sense to me. When you think about what the Rabbit is actually doing, I ask it a query, it shows me a beautiful animation on the screen, which is adorable, and it goes off into the web and uses a bunch of APIs. And now the new large action model, which is the news, right? Yesterday you announced the large action model playground. People can watch it work. I’ve seen the LAM click around on The Verge’s website just to read headlines, which is neat. Is that the back end of this, I ask the Rabbit to do something and in the cloud it goes and clicks around on the web for me? So we have to separate two different systems here, maybe three different systems here. Let’s talk before yesterday, because yesterday is really a great milestone. Before yesterday, what happens is that you talk to the R1. We have an intention triage system, which basically we convert this audio to a text, we send that text to our LLM providers, and then we have an intention triage system. From there, after the LLM understand the intention we send to different APIs or different features. There are a lot of feature which is on device, right? Like set a smart timer or something like that. Or there’s a simple question, but we think that there’s other services or model probably answers better than the default LLM. So sometimes we send a particular query to Perplexity. Sometimes we send a particular query to Wolfram Alpha. So you can understand as intention triage system is dispensing on this to different destinations and then the relative features will trigger. But after yesterday, we have this playground and that’s a first stepping stone towards what we really want to create, which is a generic cross-platform agent system. It has to be generic, which on this case it is a generic. It is not cross-platform yet because it handles only a website. It will be cross-platform very soon. But with this generic website agent system, essentially you can just talk to Rabbit, be like, “Hey, go to ABC website or go somewhere and then help me do this.” So that’s exactly how we wish to design a product, and I think everyone in the industry is heading towards this direction, which is you say something, we understand you and we help you do it. And what happens as we put windows on the Rabbit hole that you can see is that the agent will break down different steps. I’m going to Google first. I’m searching for The Verge, I’m clicking to The Verge’s home website. I’m trying to find this title as you requested. I’m clicking the button to share this. And in theory you can chain multiple steps, infinite steps, follow up queries to the system. So I’ll gave you an example. I think I showed this to another reporter, it’s “hey, go to Reddit first and search for what are people recommending for the 2024 best TV 4K HDR. Get that model, then go to Best Buy, add that to my cart. If Best Buy is out of stock, then search on Amazon. If they both are out of stock, get me the second recommended model.” So you can actually chain different queries and you can pause it, you can add, you can tweak it, you can fine tune it. So it’s really just like a playground. You can freely explore the system and the system is fairly good enough to do daily tasks. And people are obviously developers and our hackers — white hat hackers of course — are giving us impressive showcases. There are people using the LAM playground to create an app just by talking to R1 because there are third party AI destinations that you can just use prompt and create an app and download the code and stuff like that. So it’s really amazing to see all this great showcases just within actually precisely 24 hours. So I want to make the marker between yesterday and the day before it, right? You announced the Rabbit at CES in January with the LAM, but it wasn’t there. Why announce it without its fundamental enabling feature? It is not accurate. I want to take this opportunity to address that. If you go to the connections, now we have seven apps. By day one we have four apps. Those are the first iteration of LAM, which is not a generic technology. We never on the CES claimed that you can now go to Amazon to order something. We said we are working towards this piece and today there’s four apps that you can connect. We are going to add more services. And over the past couple of months we did add three more services. So as of today there are seven services in total, then we keep working on the current LAM Playground and when the time is right, we swap it. So there’s a lot of debate saying LAM wasn’t there. That is not true. I can trace back to where this rumor starts is where there are people hacking into the R1. They saw R1 is fundamentally powered by an Android system on the local device, and obviously that should be the case. It would be more sketchy if it’s not Android. So at the bottom of it is an Android system and they dump the code, which — you can do that. In fact, every good piece of hardware in history has been hacked. So someone goes into this and jailbreaks the R1, which I guess every piece of hardware is jailbreakable at some point. Obviously, that’s flattering to us. If you build a form factor and no one even bothered to jailbreak it, it’s probably not a good form factor anyway. So people jailbreak it, find out the Android code, they dump the Android code to another media and they say, hey, there’s nothing about AI here. There’s nothing about LAM here. Of course, because all the stuff is in AWS. That’s where the rumor starts. And then there’s a lot of media and they just take that piece and reiterate that. The apps you started with, Spotify, DoorDash, there are a few others. Those are APIs, right? You were using their APIs. You were actually opening Spotify on the web in Chrome and clicking on it. Yes. Yes. Because what do you mean — Why? There is no API — That’s the most brittle way to use Spotify I can think of — There is no API. There is no API. You made a smart speaker. Spotify can run on smart speakers and other kinds — That’s a partnership. That’s a partnership. Go to Spotify, read their documentations. There is a specific line is that you cannot use API to build a voice-activated application. Literally. So Spotify right now on the R1, when I asked to play song, it goes and opens Spotify on the web somewhere — Goes to the window. Yes. And then you’re re-streaming the audio to my device through your service. Correct. Correct. Yes. Does Spotify know that you’re doing this? Yes. And they’re okay with that? We had a conversation. They realize this is agent behavior. And we said, look, we ask the user to log in on your website and they’re a 100 percent legitimate user and they’re a paid user. And when we do the trick, we help them click the button. I’ve always been very curious about this. I’ve been dying to ask you these questions. So I ask my R1 to play a song. Somewhere in AWS, a virtual machine fires up, opens a web browser, opens Spotify, logs into my Spotify account using my credentials, clicks around on Spotify, pushes a button to play a song, and then you capture that audio and re-stream it to me on my R1? Everything is accurate except we don’t help you log in. You have to log in for yourself and we don’t save your connection. But the part where you are re-streaming audio that Spotify is playing to your virtual machine to me, you’re doing that? We are basically giving everyone a virtual machine, which is a VNC, which is 100 percent within policy, and you have the right to access that VNC. And on that VNC, we basically work directly on a website just like today’s LAM Playground. So we’re not getting the audio from the server from Spotify or somewhere else. We’re basically going to the Spotify website and playing — and do the things for you and play that song for you. Okay, but where do the bits go? The bits come to the virtual machine and then they come from the virtual machine to my Rabbit. Correct. So you are re-streaming the song to me. I’m not re-streaming the song to you. I’m basically presenting the VNC directly to your R1. Wait, explain how that works. Maybe I’m not technical enough to understand how that works. You’re presenting the VNC to my R1. Correct. So it is running locally on my computer? With no UI. Okay, I see what you mean. So I’m logged into a cloud computer. The R1 is the client to a cloud computer. And Spotify is playing on that cloud computer and the R1 is taking that audio. Okay. That raises a million extra questions, right? First of all, I see where you’re going. Okay? Before you go deeper, I just want to say first of all, we’re not using API. Second of all to say LAM is not there, that’s false claim. Because we have all these services, if you really pay attention to their documentation, there is no API for like DoorDash. There is no API for Uber. But I just want to be clear, that’s a choice those companies have made to prevent companies like Rabbit from automating their services and disintermediating their services from the user. So as you think about these agent models going out onto the web, however they’re expressed, whether it’s the LAM, whether it’s whatever you’re doing before the LAM Playground hit, all of those companies are going to have a point of view on whether agents can use their services in this way. That’s pretty unsettled. Yes. And I’m curious, you have a few services, they might’ve just said, okay, let’s see how this goes. But over time you’re going to enter into a much more complicated set of negotiations that will actually be probably determined by the big companies making deals, right? You can see how OpenAI or Microsoft or Amazon would make a deal to have DoorDash accessible by agents and DoorDash would say, “we’ve made this deal, you can’t be accessible.” How do you solve that problem? It’s not a problem for now. We’ll see how this problem evolves, but I remember when Apple is relatively not so big, not as big as today. When I read the Steve Jobs book, there’s one chapter. He said, okay, “go talk to Sony, from tomorrow 99 cents per track,” right? Remember that moment? So at some point this level of negotiation needs to be happening. I’m not sure if we’re leading this or someone else is leading this, but this is the working proof that we’re not using API, and I don’t think the services are not building API just because they’re trying to prevent people from automating the company. It’s just because API to them is not making money. And they for sure will love to set up a negotiation in some phase later when we grow bigger. You know, we tried to reach out to Uber, we did, before launch. They were like, “who are you? You’re too small.” That’s it. “We don’t care.” And so then you have Uber on the R1 now, that’s opening the Uber desktop app? No, the Uber website, which is very janky, which is very — That’s what I’m asking. Sorry. What I meant by desktop app is in the web browser you’re calling an Uber. If you’re running on Android, why not open an Android virtual machine and use the Android app? It is a little bit more technical to achieve that, which we are working on the other platforms. I think I showed a vary select group of people a working prototype that LAM is operating on the desktop OS such as Linux with all the local apps. So we’re definitely heading in that direction. Is there a possibility they can detect the fact that these are not human users, but in fact agent users? I guess there’s always a way that you can detect, but I think the question is — this is actually a very good topic that we’re talking about here. Think about CAPTCHAs. Sure. LAM playground or any capable AI models now can go there and solve text-based CAPTCHAs. So their old systems to prevent automated systems like this are currently failing. This is an industry effort to push everyone in the industry to rethink about — now with this AI, now with all these agents, how their business is going to reform or how all these policies need to be changed? I do agree, this is a very complicated topic, but what I can see is that this is not Rabbit doing some really fancy magic here. Every company is doing this. We have other agent companies even the GPTs are doing this. So this is a new wave emerging for all this old services that they have to think about. But I can tell you my personal experience dealing with scenarios like this, like when we first started building one of the first smart speakers back in 2013 — all this music labels, they don’t care. They didn’t care until everyone’s building smart speakers, they’re like, ‘okay, we have to resell the whole copyrights for this particular form factor.” I guess at the end of day, it’s about money. They want to sell the same copyrights to as many form factories as they want, if there’s a popular one. So we’re okay to have this kind of negotiations, but certainly like you said, there’s bigger companies that are doing similar things or even more advanced things that needs to be addressed. I give you another example like Siri and Microsoft, there’s a feature called Microsoft Recall, which they pulled back that feature now and I think they relaunched it. Which is very aggressive, that is taking screenshots of your local computer. So this is what I saw happening in AI in these early days. There’s going to be a lot of different takes and tries and eventually people will reconcile and agree on single piece of terms and agreements. But if you check how we automate the website to their interface, the most important part is we don’t create fake users. We don’t create spam users. We don’t log in on your behalf and you are you. The way I help you to do things is by help you click the buttons and mouse. It’s equivalent of, if I want my buddy to help me — I’ll give you example. So if I’m busy, I’m about to head into a meeting, I want my buddy to help me order a burger from DoorDash. All I need to do is I unlock my phone, I pass my phone to my guy and my guy helped me click that. And in this process, I’m not sharing my credentials to my buddy. I’m not telling him my phone password, I’m not telling him my DoorDash password. I’m not even sharing my credit card info. All he has to do is just add to the cart and click confirm. That’s it. So this guy is the equivalent of the first generation of LAM, which is unfortunately we don’t like it. So that’s why we work so hard. Now we have Playground, which is a more generic technology. Well, let me ask you about that difference between the first generation of LAM and the playground. The playground sounds like the thing you’ve always wanted to build. You actually have an agent that can look at web pages, understand them, take action on them. The first one, it might have been a LAM in the broader definition, but as technology it was expressed as testing software that was moving in an automated way through these interfaces. You weren’t actually understanding the interfaces. You were able to just navigate them. Because that’s pretty normal robotic process automation stuff. Were you just building on that kind of technology while the LAM came into existence? No, no. No? Okay. We’re working on neuro-symbolic, right? So the idea is that — But even in the first versions? Yeah. The question I’ve always had is, what happens if Spotify — before the LAM existed because I understand that the claim is that this version can understand every website — but if Spotify changed its interface or DoorDash changed its interface, Rabbit was kind of getting tripped up, right? I’ll tell you, Spotify changes its interface all the time and I think in the past six months, five months since the first LAM was adding the Spotify with the connection since launch. I think we probably put Spotify under maintenance for maybe two times, one hour in total. That’s a very hard proof. That’s a hard proof, but I — just take this for what it’s worth, I think that means it’s not good enough, right? The Spotify app on my phone never goes down for maintenance, and if the claim is the agent can go take actions for me, I have to rely on that at 100 percent. No — And so I think the question for me that I have, this whole thing, is the delta between what you want to do, which is have agents go and crawl the web for me and the reality of what we can do now. Actually the middle ground is APIs, the middle ground is not so brittle. You — Okay — It makes more sense to me that the agent would, instead of using an interface designed for my eyes, use an interface designed for computers. I really want to laugh hard. Okay. Really. Two things. I disagree that Spotify is not working good. Spotify has been working amazing. Sure. Five months, maybe two times we put it under maintenance and the total amount of time put under maintenance is probably under one hour. You can ask any R1 users. That’s not through API, which is impressive. That’s through agent. I’m — That’s through agent to handle to — I get that it’s impressive for an agent. I’m just saying that API — You said it’s not — I said it’s not — You said it’s not good. Good enough. I said it’s not good enough. It is not good enough. Right? Where’s the curve where it’s 100 percent? Okay, now that’s my — Because the API is 100 percent. That’s my second part. Yes, API is 100 percent, but you’re relying on, they gave you the API that’s stable, that works, that never break- I’m the user, I don’t care. That’s what I’m getting at: as the user, why should I care? The user doesn’t need to care. We need to care. Okay. We need to care and we need to care because we checked what are the good APIs we can use, don’t get me wrong, Perplexity API’s has being great. Sure. OpenAI’s API breaks every day or two and they said , “We observe an issue.” You can follow the, Is ChatGPT Down? It’s very detailed, how many breaks per day, it’s, I guess more than 10 on average that the ChatGPT API breaks or is unstable, whatever it takes. We have a notifier. So, first of all, API is not stable. It is not stable. Sure. And you have to chase for the services people want. We want to offer this music feature and we think Spotify has the best experience overall, and we want to chase for this partnership and we’re still chasing for this partnership. But to talk from a technical perspective, why I said I don’t like APIs is because — think about Alexa. Alexa speakers are all using APIs and you literally have to go there and negotiate. Because like I said, today, not everyone’s opening APIs, a lot of the traditional services don’t have APIs, and then startups, for a startup it’s impossible. wWen you go talk to them, they think you’re too small, right? We did that, we just did that to everyone. They think we’re too small, they don’t care, so we can’t get an API, Does that mean that we’re not going to figure out an alternative way to make it work? No, hell no! We’re going to make it work and this is exactly how we make it work. So we care about users to use this feature. We don’t care about how to do it. In fact, because we know that you don’t care how this has been done, I don’t want to spend six months, eight months suited up to talk to Spotify people and Uber people, and one by one, let’s do that. Well the promise here is you’re going to eventually have a general purpose LAM that is just using the web for you, right? You said you hand your phone to a buddy, which is why you can make the Rabbit device and just talk to it and it goes off and does stuff in the general case. The enormous Death Star that everyone sees is that Apple has announced substantially the same feature for Siri on the iPhone. Yeah. And Apple can get the deals and Apple can pull developers into an API relationship locally on the phone with Siri, and Apple honestly can just burn money until it chooses not to build a car or whatever it wants to do. And getting people to buy another device that doesn’t just fall back to the Spotify app on iOS when it breaks seems very challenging. How do you overcome that? Because if the technology isn’t 100 percent better 100 percent of the time, that feels like a challenging sale. Yeah, this is the fun part of the game, really. How do you win the game? I think, first of all, speaking for myself, I’ve sold my company before when I was 25. I don’t want to build another app. I should chase my same dream because I really think that the grand vision that I have and our team was working on is actually the current direction everyone’s chasing. And it just feels so bad if you don’t chase the same dream no matter how hard it is, really, and in reality, we feel blessed and happy to say the exact situation because we don’t have any serious competitors from startups to be honest. When everyone — Well there’s one, and they seem like a pretty spectacular failure, right? Yes. Humane launched with a lot of money and a big T-Mobile partnership and a subscription fee and Time magazine and all that stuff and it doesn’t seem like that has gone very well. So I said as of right now I don’t think we have serious competitors from startup and then when we talk about competitors, obviously there’s Apple, there’s every big company out there, including OpenAI. So first of all, I think this is good for us because it validates our direction is absolutely correct and I also am curious about — what are going to be the definitive routes for the generic agent technology because different people in the industry might have different ideas. There are still debatable states, there is no eval for agent systems yet, there is no very good eval yet, and you can see a lot of different research houses and companies trying different routes. Obviously there’s API routes like GPT’s, which doesn’t really take off, there’s pure neuro-symbolic routes, there’s Haber routes, there’s all this multi-modality. So we’re still in the phase of everyone trying their own recipe and hopefully that can become a definitive recipe, including Apple. I think the benefit for Apple to do that is that yes, they understand the user better, much, much better than any companies out there and they have infinite money, theoretically infinite money, and they have the very closed ecosystem. The way that they’re rolling this out is that they have this SDK called App Intent, right? So different companies or app developers need to choose to enroll or not enroll with that to have the new Siri to control stuff. I guess my relative advantage as a small group, as Rabbit, is that we move fast. We move fast and we keep growing. I think if we put all the cards on our table, we had a spectacular launch. We are the most sold dedicated hardware yet, and we have made good profit, we fix all the day one problems and the company actually quadrupled the size. So we’re growing, we’re moving fast, and now we drop this. Like you said, put a marker between today and yesterday. I think today I can say, a lot of things that you can do on R1, you cannot do it on a iPhone, I believe eventually everyone will be able to come to the same solution that all the devices can do kind of like similar stuff, but I firmly believe at least this remaining half of the year or the Q4 of 2024 and probably till Q1 2025, it is still a game of you have something that they don’t have, versus you guys all have the similar stuff, who’s done better? So I think relatively we have a good six to eight months headstart, we have our little room here, but obviously I also believe when a big company wants to kill a startup, they have a million ways to kill you. That’s just the reality. People keep talking to me and asking questions, “What happens if the risk is too high? What happens if the company dies?” I really don’t think that all these questions matter because we’re on this course, we’re going to see the end, whether it’s a good end or bad end, and I don’t think any answer to these questions will change our course to be honest. I can go here and tell you and be a cry baby like, “This is super hard, this is impossible. Everyone in the industry can kill us easily, or a YouTube reviewer can kill us by posting a review.” It doesn’t change the course because we are doing things, we’re launching, we’re shipping things, we’re moving forward. So it’ll be interesting to see what Apple came from. I was on the Apple iPhone upgrade program, so I automatically get a new iPhone every year by paying the same monthly fee, but I really don’t find any reason to upgrade that because people are talking about Rabbit being launched too early, now you have a company like Apple, if you go to the... What is that called? Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles where it’s close to here or, I guess Mission Street in San Francisco. You go to any major cities, you see these gigantic posters, billboards that Apple put there, right? iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Pro, what are the other lines underneath? It says Apple Intelligence. Is it ready? Is it out? No. Let me talk about growth for a second. You mentioned you quadrupled and I guess you mean by employee size? Yeah. You told Fast Company last month the R1 is only being used daily by 5,000 people. Is that higher or lower than you expected? First of all, you saw that article from I guess Verge? I think — No, it’s Fast Company, that’s what it says. Yeah, no, yeah, but there’s — I’m reading it, I’m looking at it. No, but there’s a Verge [article] says R1 only has 5,000 users daily, which is from- Well that’s a quote from you. First of all, I think that what I said there can be misinterpreted. What I said is that if you go look at the data dump right now, you probably will find 5,000 people using R1. At least 5,000 people. I’m just going to quote you. Fast Company. “Lyu said, ‘Right now around 5,000 people use the R1 daily.’” I said it can be misinterpreted. Okay? Okay. First of all, I think we saw a very steady growth of all the people interacting with R1 and each time with new features, there’s going to be more people using it. I will give you some numbers that I want to throw to you and maybe I can share very detailed usage sometime in the future. First of all, there are about 5 percent of people that have their R1, they’re not happy, that return it, less than 5 percent. Sure. Which is a very good number, and I think the top features that people are using are asking questions and vision and all that, and we really are hoping for people to discover more use cases, but unfortunately we have like four or seven apps on the connections, that’s one of the bottleneck. So if you check for the total query, most of the cases you ask a question, you forget about it, so it’s not about how many times you ask R1, it’s about what kind of task you ask R1 and is R1 actually going to help you? So I guess, yeah, very unfortunate, it seems that that’s a misinterpretation. So what’s the number? What’s the daily active number? We’ll issue the correction tomorrow, what is it? I will go back and get you a very accurate number, but I can tell you yesterday our server actually crashed, so I think — Is it double? Is it 10,000? Is it 25,000? Oh, yesterday our cloud cost actually, I think... Actually, let me check right here, because I can check right here. This is why I love having a founder on the show. Okay, so the past one day is 33,760. Okay. So 33,760, yes. So almost 34K yesterday. Okay. 34,000 active users yesterday. Okay. Yeah, and — What percentage of your sales is that? Yesterday? Yeah, 33,760 people. What percentage of your total sales is that? I think we delivered more than 100,000 units, and that should be around 33 percent, 34 percent. Sure, that makes sense, and that I’m assuming yesterday, because it was a launch of LAM playground, this is a big spike. Yes. What were the days before that? So past two days, 5206, so if you minus 33, that’s another 20,000. Wait, I’m sorry, I don’t think I followed. You said numbers, but I don’t think I followed them. Past two days, say it again. So past two days, 5206, so — That’s the total of two days? Correct. Okay, and one day is with the LAM playground on, so okay, I got what you’re saying. Correct. So you’re saying it’s 5,000 active users at any time, not daily. Correct. Okay. And then you’re getting about 20,000 users daily and then we’ll see if that goes up — Correct. ... because of the LAM playground. Correct. Then there’s an article by The Verge that used that title, 5,000, which is wrong. I can tell you, that’s wrong. That’s very wrong. That’s me saying — Well, you tell Fast Company and then we will update it, but we — Well, he was a — ... ran your quote in the magazine, so we feel good about that. He wasn’t there and he... he or she. That journalist wasn’t there and that’s not what I said in the quote, okay? Welcome back. So you heard all that back and forth about Rabbit’s daily active users, and CEO Jesse Lyu saying he’d get us a better number. I asked the company to clear it up, and what Jesse actually said to Fast Company was that at any given time, Rabbit has 5,000 users. The Fast Company article has been corrected, and we’ll use Jesse’s number of between 20,000 and 34,000 daily active users, which is between – which is still substantially less than the 100,000 units sold. Now that we have the number, we’ll run it, but my question to you is, you’ve got to sell more R1s, you’ve got to get more people who’ve already bought them to continue using it, and you are, in fact, whether or not Apple Intelligence has arrived or not, it will arrive in some fashion in the coming weeks. There’s a report just a week or so ago that Jony Ive is working with Sam Altman and OpenAI on a hardware device. Something will happen with Humane, something will happen with Google, something will happen with Samsung. As that universe of competitors expands, it feels like the core technology you’re betting on is being able to automate a VNC with a large action model, right? You’re going to open up user sessions for people in the cloud and then your LAM is going to go click around on the web for them and that will get you out of the challenges of needing to strike API deals with various companies, with other kinds of deals, copyright deals with various companies, whatever you might need. Is that durable? The idea that this will keep Rabbit away from needing all of the deals that the big companies will just go pay and get? Because that’s the thing that I think about the most. I can think of 10 companies that came up with a technical solution to a legal problem, and even if the technical solution was amazing, the legal problem eventually caught up with them. We’re confident that this technology is the current technology route that it will work, and I haven’t yet seen another approach that actually makes any generic agent system work in any other manner. That doesn’t mean that we’re locked in to one technical path. If you talk to any company, it’s probably not a smart idea to say, “Hey, we just bet on this for the next 10 years.” The technology changes so fast, you have to adapt. But right now, I think we’re off to a good start, we launched a concept with playground with free of charge that you can explore so that we understand how this system can be improved. In fact, I believe the speed can be improved very fast, but we’re not here to say, “Hey, we’re stuck into this.” We do have patents about this, but we’re not saying, “Hey, we think this is the correct path to go.” I don’t think anyone in the AI industry can give you a very definitive answer, be like, “Hey, if you just do this, here’s the structure. This is going to guarantee you the best result in the long run.” I think that’s not a good way to think of it, but yeah, I agree. Everyone in the industry are experimenting with something new and a lot of companies that we saw are going to, like you said, run into some sort of legal problems. There’s music generation platforms, there’s — I mean, this feels like the story of the AI industry broadly, right? There’s a YouTube training video can be used by this or that. There’s all sorts of things like this. But I think it’s not just the builders are adapting, the industry are going to adapt to the builders too. At some point, there’s going to be a conclusion that, “Okay, this is a new policy, these are new terms that we need to follow.” Are you building to that goal? I think, again, this is just the big question I’m thinking about all of these things. Basically every AI product is a technical solution that is ahead of wherever the legal system is or wherever the business deals are. At some point Spotify might show up on your doorstep and say, “You know what? We’re not going to allow agents. It has to be a human user, and we’re going to change our terms of service to say it has to be a human user.” DoorDash might say it, whoever might say it. Are you ready for that outcome? Do you have the budget socked away to go lawyer up and fight that fight? No. At the moment we don’t have the resources to fight that fight, and at the moment, that’s not a real threat to us because they said we’re too small. [Laughs] Fair enough. When do you think the turn hits? I don’t think that it’s a dead end for us, right? No, I’m saying when do you think it’s a turn? When do you think that becomes a conversation about whether you can have agent users or human users? Yeah, that’s exactly what I’m talking about. I don’t think that they are not willing to change their terms. And I think it’s unlikely they’re going to put terms like, it has to be a human. It cannot be. There’s a lot of automation tools out there already. There’s no turning back. I think what they would like to work with any companies, including us, is that when they see a popular demand from this new kind of agent technology, they want to charge for it, and then we ask our user and us to pay for them, and that’s a business deal. That’s more like money terms. That’s what I can see. But as for now, we’re not breaking any of their terms and agreements. And if they change the terms and agreements tomorrow, we’ll take a look and we’ll see how we adapt. But the agent is out there already. There’s a lot of agents running already, so I think there’s no turning back, and it’s very unlikely to say, “Hey, we are going to stop agents using our services.” That’s not going to happen. Think on the longest timeline you can, let’s assume everything works out and it’s all solved. How much time and money is it going to take before the general purpose agent you’re trying to build is a hundred percent reliable and can just do all the things that we all imagine them being able to do? I might have a different opinion here. I think foundation models like OpenAI’s, obviously they’re raising a crazy amount of money. I think we take benefit from what they’ve been working on, because their primary services is selling their models as APIs, which saves a lot of money. We don’t want to recreate the wheel retraining an LLM. I think it might not be as scary as a lot of people might think. I think there’s a huge gap between converting the latest technology into a piece of product versus pushing for a more advanced technology. Obviously I’m very proposed to do high-end research. We want to have a research house here set up at the same scale as OpenAI and DeepMind, even though they’re already far, far behind. But I think what we’re trying to do right now at this current scale, because here’s the money we have. We don’t have $1 billion, we don’t have $2 billion. We have this very limited budget. Is that how can we convert the latest technology and research, and build to a product that we can ship early and collect feedback and learn from it? So a lot of people have different definitions of AGI. I don’t really talk about this term because I think so many people have so many definitions for it. But I do think that AI understands what you say and can help you do things, and maybe here we’re talking about virtually help you click buttons and stuff. There are a lot of companies doing humanoid android that they’re actually giving a hand and legs for the AI to do things. I think it is an entire humanity’s effort, and a lot of the resources can be shared instead of each company has to go raise for this amount of money and take that amount of time to achieve the same goal. So it’s really hard to say, but we know we need more money and resources, that’s for sure. But I think you’ve seen how efficient this team has been performing from seven people, 17 people till today. We raised obviously much less than Humane or any big companies out there. I think it’s actually one of our advantages that we can do things in a relatively cost-efficient way and fast. Timeline wise though — again, assuming everything goes your way, is it a year from now that you can build on all the foundation models and all the other investment in this thing? Just does whatever I ask on the web, is it five years? What do you think? I think the AI model will get very smart very fast, but I think we’re talking about a generational shift. I think obviously we don’t want a 2024 piece of technology operating on eBay’s website, which is basically designed back in 1990, right? So I think a lot of the infra needs to be refreshed, and the biggest gap as I can see here is productionized. So I think in our roadmap we think that it’s very likely that we can get all this separate piece of technology we have like LAM playground, Teach Mode and rabbitOS at some point, maybe next year, merged into a new rabbitOS 2.0. And that actually will push a huge step forward towards this generic goal. But my general take is that the AI model is smart enough, but the action part is a lot of infrastructure. There’s a huge gap between research and productionized, so that’s what we learned. So I will say I’m very optimistic in the three years term, but I think, like I said, right now and starting next year is everyone trying different approaches, and we’ll see which one works, but I think we’re confident on the approach we’re take right now. I just want to end by asking about form factors. Obviously the Rabbit is a very distinctive piece of hardware. People really like the design. We’ve seen just a lot of interesting glasses lately. The idea that we’re all going to work cameras on our face and someone’s going to build the display. Do you think that’s correct? I was wearing the Meta Ray-Bans yesterday. I was like, why would I wear these all the time? I’d rather have a thing. I am not against any form factors. In fact, I really think that there will be a lot of form factors. But when we were trying to design R1, the reason is that we know it’s not going to be a smartphone because we know people are going to do a lot of other things on smartphones, which the current AI cannot do. So we deliberately avoided the smartphone phone factor. Talking about pins with lasers and glasses — I have different comments for each phone factor because there’s no universal rules here. Let’s talk about pins. I think my general pushback for making it a pin with a laser like Humane, I think first of all, I think it’s really cool, but I think it’s too risky. You are trying to offer a new way of utilizing your technology, to have user use the software. That’s already new to them, and you don’t want to just introduce a sci-fi type of gear. So two new things stacked together that’s too risky. So if you look at r1, it’s a very familiar design. You know there’s a button you know you’re going to push, you know the wheel probably can scroll. There’s a screen, you can look at things. So the r1 form factor is very conservative, in the sense that it de-risks the software. It’s just like, people haven’t figured out how to interact in a virtual world, and all of a sudden back in 2016, there’s 200 different companies making goggles and they all failed. So I think I’m very, very conservative on the hardware form factor. Talking about glasses, that’s a different story. I think your skull actually grows to fit the frame, not the other way around. I used to wear prescription frames. I know the pain, your skull is growing to fit the glass frame, not the other way around. So I think there is really no generic fit on the glass frame. I was having fun with my design team joking, I’m like, “Maybe if we do the glass, we’ll probably do the Dragon Ball style,” like the power reader or whatever that is. Like the old Google Glass form factor? I can’t wrap my head around “I have to put a frame that doesn’t fit.” So we’ll see. I think the current smartphone is perfect. I really like the slate of a glass or a screen form factor, but the real problem here is not about the form factor. The problem is about the apps, right? Because now we see all this agent technology, AI stuff, and they’re doing things that apps are doing, and they’re doing things that apps can’t do, so I think the problem is with apps. I forgot to ask you the main question. You’ve had a number of startups, you’ve done a number of things, you have a big idea here. How do you make decisions? What’s your framework for making decisions? I am a very intuitive person. I like to trust my intuition on big directions like what’s going to happen in the long run. But meanwhile, I’m quite conservative in that I hate to predict things. So I think when people replay this episode, they’ll hear probably that I got really tricked by some of your questions. It’s just my brain couldn’t work for predictions. It’s that I don’t like to make predictions — like what happens if this happens, if that happens, what do you think? When I manage my team, I tell people, “We make decisions based on current facts, and we find the best solutions to it.” If you spend too much time — at least, if I spend too much time thinking about what if Apple knocks on your door, what you’re going to do? What if A happens, then B happens, then C happens, what you’re going to do? Most likely you’re going to get a different strategy, right? Because if you think if B is a solution to A — when A happens, you just do B. But there are other types of people they’re like, “Hold on, have you ever thought of when A happens then D happens, then E happens, then F happens, are you still going to do B?” If you think that way, probably not. So I just choose not to predict a lot of what ifs, and I make short, clear, concise decisions based on current facts. And in fact, if you do the recap for what we launched back in the CES, it was probably the best timing. The price is probably just right, the color probably just right, and the decisions of not negotiating, spending six months negotiating with T-Mobile is probably just right. I make current decisions and that’s my style. And I talk to people, everyone talks to me. I told everyone in my team, they can find me anytime. Talk to me anytime. I spend a lot of time talk to my people. We’re, in general, just a very real team, down to earth. I really don’t like some of the other types of startups that spend too much time enjoying the feeling, if you understand what I’m indicating. But there are a lot of people that they say, “Oh, I’m a founder. I’m cool.” No, I’ve grown enough to get rid of that. Probably the same way as if I’m 21, 22, but now I’m 34. Startups are really tough. It’s a war. It’s about survival. It is really, really tough. And it doesn’t really matter if others want to do something. You have to survive, and just surviving by your own is tough in any sense. So that’s why a lot of people ask me — I get asked a lot like, “Okay, what if they do this? What if they do that?” Well, end of the day, there’s nothing you can do. You have to do your thing and they will react to it. I think it’s fair to say that with Rabbit and other startups like us, the biggest companies like Apple, they react to us. They react to us in a very hostile way, a very unusual way that they have this new phone, but all those things are still not there. We’re making very small dent, but that even doesn’t matter. I think for us, we care about our customers. One thing I want to say is that yes, there are a lot of misinformation, there are haters, there are all that feedbacks, criticisms. If you talk to the r1 user, they’re happy. That’s what I care. That’s what I care. Otherwise, there will be a lot of returns, there will be a lot of refunds. We have less than 5 percent return. Put that term in any consumer market electronics device, it’s a good benchmark, and we are going to keep releasing all the stuff. We pushed 17 OTA within five months. The other company pushed like, what? 2, 3, 4, 5 OTAs. So I really hope people can see us — we’re a bunch of underdogs. Our solution isn’t perfect, but it is David versus Goliath on day one because it’s a reality, and don’t expect perfect stuff from us because we are not perfect. We raise very little amount of money and we’re a small team, but we move fast. What we can guarantee is that when Rabbit shows you something, you probably couldn’t even find somewhere else. Just like the hardware, just like the playground or even the very janky day one version of LAM. We are the first company that has Apple Music can be streamed to our device. Yeah. Does Apple, because you’re opening it on the web? Yeah. I mean, I don’t get legal documents to my door. Maybe I will get one, but maybe they think we’re too small, but we do things in our way. I guess, that’s what I want to say. We’re really down to the ground team. That’s my style. Yeah. Jesse, thank you so much for coming to Decoder and being so game to answer these questions. I really appreciate it. Yeah, thank you so much.

Title: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy's work-from-office mandate aims to help new recruits learn company work culture
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/amazon-ceo-andy-jassys-work-from-office-mandate-aims-to-help-new-recruits-learn-company-work-culture-11728300451459.html
Time Published: 2024-10-07T14:04:58Z
Full Content:
Amazon Inc Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy's decision to bring back employees to the office full-time shows the executive's concern that new recruits don't understand the company culture, reported the news agency Bloomberg on Monday, October 7. Last month, Jassy surprised the employees with a memo instructing them to start coming to the office five days a week from January. Amazon currently lets many employees work from home two days a week, as per the report. The order stunned many of Amazon's more than 350,000 employees and restarted a heated debate in the tech industry about employee perks and the value of in-person work. They wonder if this was Jassy’s way of further thinning the ranks following a series of layoffs in recent years. The CEO expressed his intention to reduce management layers in efforts to reduce bureaucracy, which, according to him, was slowing down Amazon, as per the agency report. The senior leadership made the part change, as they believed the next generation of workers was being left behind rather than taught the Amazon way, according to three people aware of the development cited by the agency. Jassy mentioned the word “culture” a dozen times in his memo. “Keeping your culture strong is not a birthright,” he wrote. “You have to work at it all the time,” according to the report. Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser refused to comment beyond the CEO's memo, as per the report. Amazon, which sees itself as operating like a startup, has long acknowledged that its culture may seem peculiar to outsiders. Employees pitching new ideas are expected to write detailed memos and avoid deck slides. According to the report, there’s a strong preference for analysis of data and trends and plenty of tolerance for frank and heated debate. Amazon is also famous for its tough environment and aggressive deadlines, as employees are expected to work long, hard and smart, according to founder Jeff Bezos who put it to the company's first recruits. According to the CEO's colleagues, Jassy who started at Amazon out of business school in 1997, is a product of and advocate for those approaches. After succeeding Bezos three years ago, he’s been a one-man ambassador for the Amazon culture, speaking frequently to employee groups and even cutting videos in which he explains each of Amazon’s leadership principles, said the report. Amazon doubled its headcount and reduced the requirement for recruits be physically located in a major hub with their team. Company executives have been openly saying that fresh grads, new to the workforce, are missing elements of the company's culture which cannot be effectively conveyed through videoconferences or chat windows. “Culture is a very important part of how we go and do the work, and how we have maintained the innovation and pace of what we do for the last 25 years,” said Matt Garman, CEO of Amazon Web Services, at a press event last week. “And that’s really hard to communicate, really hard to teach to new employees and really hard to maintain when you’re over a video call,” according to the agency report. Keeping in mind the new schedule would be controversial, senior leadership spent weeks weighing the pros and cons, according to two of the people aware of the development. The company denied the policy was designed to push employees out, according to the report. Workers expressed dissatisfaction and pressed the company to reconsider, in internal surveys. Some of the employees have already resigned and others are seeking work in other places. The last time the company ordered its employees to come back to the office for work, employees walked out at the company's Seattle headquarters, as per the report. It is unclear whether the employees will make a similar attempt again. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

INSIDE: Economic growth could slowly pick up in the U.S. and globally, as inflationary pressures continue to ease, with the Fed joining the rate-cut “party,” which could lead to even stronger corporate earnings growth following this year’s robust gains The megatrends behind the secular bull market in stocks aren’t going anywhere, with the tech revolution, the AI boom, the medical revolution, the expansion of global trade, and the emergence of China's and India’s middle class fueling global growth in the coming decade The U.S. economy’s relative strength will likely persist, and there is no reason to believe that domestic stocks will give up their global dominance, meaning that the U.S. market is still the place to be for outsized returns After hitting new record highs and consolidating their gains, the major indices are primed for further gains, leaving the key technical levels of 40K in the Dow, 18K in the Nasdaq, and 5,500 in the S&P 500 behind for good following the elections Growth-focused companies could take center stage as financing costs drop, and despite two stellar years, tech stocks might continue their dominance Cyclical stocks, the Dow, and small-caps, which have already started to flex their muscles, could catch up with the market-leading Nasdaq as the impact of easing monetary conditions increases Volatility could continue to trend lower, with a few spikes above 20 in the VIX, corresponding to orderly profit-taking events in stocks, which should still be treated as buying opportunities Five Stocks To Own Going Into The Elections & Beyond 2024 began exactly how bulls hoped it would, with stocks extending last year's technical breakout to new record highs, thanks to the tech sector’s continued leadership and the bull market’s broadening base. Overseas stocks joined the party in earnest, too, with even European equities eclipsing their prior highs, despite a mild recession on the Old Continent, proving that, against all odds, a global bull market began in 2023. Despite the promising long-term trends and the early-year rally, geopolitical tensions, lingering inflation fears, and the market-leading Nasdaq’s extremely overbought momentum readings led to several months of sideways price action and a deep, albeit brief, selloff in August. While the past few months were frustrating for investors, they likely set the stage for something big toward the end of the year. Although the pre-election uncertainty could weigh on risk assets, this autumn could provide one of the best opportunities to load up on stocks in years. The positive backdrop doesn't mean that you should ignore stock picking and buy stocks without thinking. In fact, we are still in the “New Golden Age of Stock Picking” that started in 2022, and this year's strong divergences between the main sectors prove just that. But, before diving deep into the Gorilla’s top picks, let's see the fundamental and technical drivers behind the bull market in detail! Bullish Technicals In The Wake Of A Frustrating Summer Despite all the fear, the case for the bull market’s continuation remains as strong as ever, with fundamentals and technicals lining up for a potentially stellar end to 2024, and extending well into 2025. The major indices are trading in strong long-term advancing trends, and following last year's major technical breakout, the benchmarks just had their first meaningful pullback, which is considered one of the best, lowest-risk entry points by trading pros. August’s deep pullback came and went so quickly that you might have missed it during your holiday trip. And even though some analysts, including one of Goldman Sachs’ (GS), believe that this is a warning sign for bulls, the Gorilla tends to disagree. Such quick recoveries are hallmarks of strong markets. While it's true that sentiment was a bit too bullish before the summer, many retail investors are waiting on the sidelines right now, providing ample future buying power. There is still plenty of skepticism about the bull market when it comes to professional investors as well, which is not how bear markets begin, as market tops and euphoria usually go hand in hand. In all likelihood, this summer’s pullback will only be a side note in the history of 2024, and the secular bull market will march on. But, if you don’t believe in the power of technicals and sentiment analysis, maybe the changing monetary conditions and the improving economic outlook will be enough to convince you that stocks should be near the top of your investment shortlist. The Fed’s New Focus: Jobs and Growth The Fed’s fight against inflation was long and painful for some sectors, with the real estate sector suffering the most, but overall, the economy and the stock market weathered the storm very well. That said, lower-income consumers were hit hard by surging prices and rising interest rates, which led to weaker growth in the consumer economy, but those trends have already reversed or are about to reverse. Real wages are rising, energy prices are near their war-era lows despite the sky-high tension in the Middle East, and inflation indicators have been surprising to the downside across the globe this summer. What’s more, inflation is now officially in the Fed’s rear-view mirror, and the past few months’ trends will likely give confidence to the Central Bank to be as aggressive in cutting interest rates as it was raising them. At the Fed’s Jackson Hole Symposium, which has a history of huge announcements, Chairman Jerome Powell all but confirmed that a rate cut is coming this month. Mr. Powell also stated that full employment is the Fed’s new focus, hinting at a brand-new monetary era, which will likely last for many years. Most experts now agree that going into the elections, the Fed will likely ease at least one more time. Yields hit one-year lows in August, with more cuts to follow in 2025. Furthermore, the ongoing tech revolution and the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, in particular, will mean that long-term deflationary forces, such as increasing productivity and the impact of global trade will dominate again, leading to another extended period of low interest rates. Let’s see how the economy is doing ahead of the Fed’s easing cycle. Financials Are Breaking Out, Goldilocks Rally Ahead? Most seasoned investors would agree that one of the best ways to lose money on Wall Street is to go against the trends in the financial sector. The banking system’s strength is not only essential for growth, but the sector is usually a great forward-looking indicator of the economy and, in turn, the stock market. In fact, the bank sector’s stability in the face of last year’s regional bank crisis was among the Gorilla’s main reasons to expect a sustained breakout to new all-time highs from the major indices in 2024. So, what are financials up to these days, you might ask? Well, they are busy breaking out to new record highs. Focusing on this summer’s gloomy headlines, this might be quite the head-scratcher, but financials were among the first issues erasing August’s pullback. Why is that? Just in August, U.S. GDP growth was revised higher, retail sales blew away expectations, and the all-important services sector signaled accelerating growth, which is enough to make a feared recession highly unlikely anytime soon. Evidence for a “soft landing” is piling up and even though manufacturing is still struggling, the housing sector could start to contribute to GDP growth in a big way soon as demand remains strong, the financial system remains healthy, and mortgage rates are finally dropping. From a broader standpoint, the economic super-cycle that began following the COVID crisis and the shock of Russia’s war in Ukraine has the potential to last for many more years, and the technological leadership of the U.S., unique domestic market, solid demographic trends, and stable supply of resources provide a great fundamental backdrop for domestic stocks. With all the above in mind, the coming quarters could easily bring “Goldilocks” conditions for the market - solid growth coupled with easing monetary conditions - which usually means outstanding returns for stocks and other risk assets, but investors will have to keep adapting to the ever- changing market conditions. A Maturing Bull Market Before the start of 2024, the Gorilla expected a “slightly boring, frustrating, but bullish year.” By the end of August, even the worst-performing Dow was up nearly double-digits, with the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 sporting gains of over 15% each. These lofty gains - the product of the first quarter’s grinding and “boring” advance - might come as a surprise for investors who don’t closely follow the market, but such gains are normal in mature bull markets. Short-term traders likely experienced plenty of frustration, as volatility also followed the Gorilla’s expectations, with the Volatility Index (VIX) spending most of the year under the widely watched 20 level, outside of a few brief spikes. As before, all selloffs should be considered buying opportunities, but making a quick buck becomes more and more difficult in low-volatility markets. Small-caps surged to new multi-year highs after lagging the major indices last year, and even though the Russell 2000 is yet to take out its 2021 high, the broadening of the rally’s base is undeniable. The odds are that this year’s trends will continue well into next year, and the positive global developments mean that an accelerating rally could be in the cards following November’s elections, meaning that the current buying opportunity might not last long. This year’s increasing valuations make stock- picking even more important, and the Gorilla is ready to share his picks, which could thrive no matter the winning party! American Tower Corp. (AMT): The Ideal Interest Rate Play? If following Warren Buffet's investment principles is your goal, American Tower (AMT) checks at least one of the boxes; it's a simple business that is protected by a sizable moat and a stable client base. American Tower specializes in leasing real estate to telecommunication companies suited for a wide range of mobile, broadcast, and wireless applications across the globe, with its market capitalization climbing above $100 billion this year. The company was founded in 1995, and thanks to its three decades of experience and vast know-how, it is dominating its primary markets while having a competitive advantage throughout its secondary geographies. Through its comprehensive offerings, American Tower became one of the largest specialized REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) globally, giving it excellent bargaining power and comparatively low financing rates. The company has over 220K sites under its umbrella, spanning five continents and over 30 countries, with a clear focus on North and Latin America but a strong presence in Europe, Asia, and Africa as well. Increasing global mobile penetration rates, surging data usage, the 5G rollout, and the looming generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom all but guarantee that the secular growth trend behind the company's growth won’t slow down anytime soon. Stable Income Streams, Global Exposure, And Relentless Growth AMT’s average lease agreement lasts nearly eight years, which, together with a very high client retention rate, leads to predictable and stable long- term income streams, with economic cycles barely affecting its core business. American Tower also enjoys very high renewal rates across its geographies, making it unique among REITs and a top pick to benefit from a sustained decline in interest rates. Its bargaining power and lean structure also place the company near the top of the industry’s profitability rankings, while presenting a strong barrier to entry to its potential competitors. American Tower has long implemented a strategy based on global growth, but over the past couple of years, it has refocused its capital allocation toward developed markets, and India, in particular, in a bid to reduce risk and further improve stability. This shift could improve execution, project success rate, and the spread between rental rates and financing costs. Since growth remains strong in the Americas and Europe, its growth impact will likely be negligible. That said, the bulk of the company's revenue relies on a specific niche, with some uncertainty regarding long-term demand, prompting a push to diversify while maintaining its competitive edge. Through the $10 billion acquisition of CoreSite, the company entered the data center business in 2021, complementing its core offerings, and American Tower now operates 25 sites, accounting for 7% of its total revenues in the second quarter of the year. This expansion aided growth while improving margins and providing exposure to a quickly growing market with deep synergies connected to the company’s core business. The new segment posted double-digit year-over-year growth in the latest quarter, and thanks to its AI exposure and substantial CAPEX spending, data center growth could even accelerate in the coming quarters. Financials and Valuation American Tower’s short-term performance is strongly tied to interest rate rates due to its financing and income structure, but digging down to its organic growth metrics shows steady growth and improving operational efficiency. The company's sales have been growing at a high-single-digit rate over the past five years, with operating expenses consistently surprising to the downside under new CEO Steven Vondara, and the company's crucial Funds From Operations (FFO) metric - essentially cash-flow for REITs - beating expectations. American Tower recently upgraded its bottom-line projections for the next couple of years, forecasting a growth rate of over 6%, with analysts predicting earnings growth to top 25% per year through 2029. The company’s growth strategy utilizes leverage, hence its strongly rate- sensitive nature, Despite its debt-based business model, the company's balance sheet is also stable, with a declining net leverage ratio. Since American Tower uses a Consumer Price Index (CPI) -based re-pricing clauses in its contracts, its revenue has also been tracking the past couple of years’ surge in inflation, and contract resets will continue to increase cash-flow in the coming years. The company is paying a respectable and stable dividend of roughly 3%, but American Tower still boasts stable Free-Cash-Flows (FCF) generation, which easily covers its dividend and provides the base for further growth. American Tower’s valuation remains attractive despite this year's gains, and an aggressive rate-cut cycle from the Fed could see the company’s valuation metrics plummet, making its current price a substantial bargain. With the entire real estate sector currently “underinvested” due to its recent struggles, retail investors could provide additional buying power once the recovery gains steam, which could lead to a multi-year rally. The potential downside should there be a rebound in inflation, is limited at its current level. Hence, the stock offers a low risk/reward ratio for investors, with the company’s substantial backlog and the recent surge in rental demand, assuring healthy top-line growth. Technicals and Recent Performance AMT staged a turnaround this year following a grueling three-year period, and since the company’s fundamentals have been steadily improving over the past several years, the stock might have plenty of gas left in the tank. AMT is now trading in a well-established long-term bullish trend, well above its 200-day moving average, and after breaking out above the $235 level, bulls could, in the medium-term, have their sights on the stock’s all-time high from 2021. The stock recently formed a classic cup-and-handle pattern, confirming its trend reversal, which could provide technical tailwinds for the rest of the year. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM): A New Dawn for the IT Giant? Despite its pivotal role in establishing the modern tech industry, IBM has been dismissed as a perpetual laggard for over a decade, and for a good reason. Even though the company tried to reinvent itself multiple times, its bloated organizational structure, surging costs, sluggish growth, and low margins made it a tough choice as an investment. Over the past five years, IBM went through a real transformation under CEO Arvind Krishna, spinning off a significant portion of its low-margin legacy IT infrastructure business into Kyndryl Holdings (KD) to entirely focus on its hybrid-cloud-based software and consulting business. Since the spinoff, IBM has managed to enter a phase of organic growth. Although IBM hasn't solved all of its issues, the company’s recent track record in execution, cost management, and strategic decisions make it an attractive and cheap option in the tech space. The company's quickly improving financials, combined with its massive knowledge base and research and development prowess, give its shares significant upside potential. What's more, IBM’s growth has been greatly aided by its business-to-business (B2B) AI offerings, which could be one of the catalysts of the company's developing turnaround story. Software and Consulting Surge Fueled by Generative AI Adoption Why is IBM, of all companies, such a promising low-risk AI play? Well, IBM primarily serves business customers across multiple industries, providing essential productivity, communication, and analytics tools. One of generative AI’s most relevant use cases, at its current level, is customized “in-house” productivity solutions, which align perfectly with IBM’s expertise, especially given the company’s “hands-on” approach to its projects, which manifests in close long-term collaborations with its clients. The company recognized this synergy and was quick to implement a wide range of AI-driven software solutions, such as customized assistants, knowledge bases, and data-analytic tools, which were met by strong demand over the past couple of years. IBM’s strategic focus on its software and consulting segments resulted in steady top and bottom-line growth over the past years, and analysts expect continued mid-single-digit expansion in both areas. The company’s hybrid cloud platforms have been driving growth in its software segment, but AI adoption also led to an uptick in infrastructure revenues through an accelerated upgrade cycle. IBM’s latest software partnerships on cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and AI data solutions with industry leaders such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon’s (AMZN) AWS have increased its reach, and its stable B2B client base provides a great foundation for further cloud growth. IBM has been active on the acquisition front this year, making use of its improving financial position, and the market reacted well to the company's growth push, with its $6.4 billion HashiCorp deal making the biggest waves. The cloud automation company’s offerings fit well into IBM’s strategic vision, and its quick integration into the company's platforms shows that IBM is a different, more agile beast that can maintain its momentum. That said, IBM is still a laggard in the eyes of a slew of players in the industry, and the company has plenty of room to improve its brand, but IBM's new management seems to be on the right path. Financials and Valuation IBM's margins have been improving across the board since 2019, with the company's revenue hitting a five-year high over the past twelve months, with its operational costs flat over the same period. Since 2020, IBM’s operational costs are down by roughly 10%, which might not seem much, but given the size of IBM’s operations and the 100% increase in comparable sales, its margin impact is massive, and the company’s further cost-saving initiatives could lead to rapid improvements in the coming quarters. IBM’s latest quarters have been consistently stronger than analyst expectations, with its free cash flow of over $13 billion, in particular, turning heads, which vastly improved the company's financial position. IBM’s debt load of $53 billion remains higher-than-average compared to its competitors, but thanks to its improving profitability and steady growth, the company is unlikely to face financing issues, especially during the Fed’s easing cycle. In fact, IBM is now in a position to significantly reduce its debt burden or refinance it at lower rates in the coming years, with the company having enough resources to continue investing in growth while returning capital to investors. IBM offers a dividend yieldof 3% at its current price level, which will become more and more attractive as the Fed cuts interest rates in the coming quarters. Even though the consensus regarding IBM’s business is starting to shift, its stock still trades at a hefty discount compared to its peers, both based on current and future earnings, giving it massive upside potential for years to come. Technicals and Recent Performance IBM has been showing relative strength compared to the large-cap benchmarks and its closest peers since the summer of 2023, and the stock is currently “testing” the $200 level after hitting decade-long highs earlier this year. Currently, IBM offers a unique blend of low volatility and outperformance that could provide stability and above-average returns for years to come, with plenty of headroom once the stock clears its all-time high from 2013. IBM is trading in a strong bullish trend, above both its 50- and 200-day moving averages, and while up by over 20% on a year-to-date basis, the stock could enjoy technical tailwinds throughout the rest of the year, should it complete its technical breakout above $200. Spotify(SPOT): The Next Billion-User Tech Giant? Spotify is the undoubted global leader in the audio streaming market, controlling roughly one-third of the quickly growing segment. Spotify has over 625 million active users, up from 77 million in 2015 and 232 million in 2019, with the company registering continuous growth thanks to its dual freemium model, based on an ad-supported free tier and ad-free premium tiers. Spotify also boasts nearly 250 million paying subscribers. With the secular shift toward streaming in music consumption still in full swing, the company’s mid-term goal of reaching 1 billion users seems realistic. The company’s mobile app remains one of the fastest-growing apps globally, with the company having a strong presence in North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The Swedish company’s biggest market is still the U.S., despite strong competition from the likes of Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN), but its other geographies have been growing quicker than its established markets in recent years, transforming Spotify into a truly global powerhouse in audio streaming space. Spotify is often referred to as the Netflix (NFLX) of music, and for a good reason, as the company's audio offerings are comparable to Netflix’s video products, with a few caveats, which analogy will be crucial in understanding the company's huge potential and the strategic challenges it faces. Product and Pricing Innovation Fueling Growth Amid Owned -Content Push For nearly a decade, Netflix faced scrutiny over the viability of its business model due to its high royalty costs, expensive content strategy, and stiff competition across its key markets. However, the video streaming company showed that such a model could be successful in the long run with a strong brand, global presence, and aggressive growth strategy. That said, Spotify and other audio services generally pay higher royalty fees, and audio streaming services products tend to be more comprehensive but more homogeneous than video services, with less exclusive content. In theory, this makes switching between services less costly for customers, but Spotify has a few aces up its sleeve that have been helping it with these strategic weaknesses. Spotify, thanks to its high engagement levels, has a huge competitive advantage compared to its closest peers and even Netflix; according to research firm, Antenna, of all video and audio streaming services, Spotify’s customers are the least likely to cancel their subscriptions in the U.S. with a monthly cancellation rate of less than 2%. This explains that, despite the fierce competition, Spotify’s U.S. market share has steadily increased over the past three years, capturing market shares from big guns like Apple and Amazon, a feat deemed unlikely by many analysts. Spotify continues to be laser-focused on growing its user base of its core business globally while expanding its offerings and increasing the share of its owned-content portfolio. The company recently started offering audiobooks with promising initial results, with paid podcasts also being an important part of Spotify’s diversification push. These new products could broaden the company’s demographic reach beyond its traditional young adult audience, Spotify is offering its new products both individually and in bundles - which are being rolled out across its geographies - and the company’s bundling strategy could significantly boost its margins in the long run. Financials and Valuation Spotify proved its pricing power and user retention capability over the past couple of years amid a global surge in inflation, raising its prices two times in some regions, with its average price now above its major peers’ fees, such as Apple Music, in the U.S. Paying subscriber growth has been very strong in recent quarters, with its paid segment outperforming its ad-supported segment, despite its price hikes, and the company’s increasing global footprint means that its growth potential continues to be exceptional. Paid subscriptions comprise over 85% of Spotify’s total revenue, and should its owned-content strategy pan out, the path to becoming a “cash cow” would be clear, especially given the company's low churn rates. When it comes to evaluating Spotify’s financials, profitability is the elephant in the room, with some analysts doubting the company's ability to turn a sustained profit, as effectively monetizing its quickly growing user base could prove tricky. Furthermore, royalties make up the vast majority of the company’s costs, and since the royalty-holding studios are in a strong bargaining position, Spotify could face long-term margin pressures. At the same time, Spotify’s optimized subscriber plans and new monetization avenues have already boosted its profitability measures, leading to a surge in its share price. Spotify’s revenue neared $16 billion over the past twelve months, with its quarterly revenue growing by 20% on a year-over-year basis, despite the headwinds in the consumer sector. The company executed a significant cost- cutting program following its COVID-era boom, and its gross margin climbed back to nearly 30% in the second quarter of 2024, after dropping below 25% in 2022. Thanks to the past couple of years’ positive developments, the company’s financial position has improved significantly, with its FCF reaching $490 million and its cash hoard topping $5 billion in the second quarter of this year, which eclipses its total debt of $2 billion. Based on its current earnings, Spotify’s valuation is sky-high. Still, its recent momentum and its lofty long- term profit potential could easily justify its market cap of $60 billion, even considering substantial execution- and competition-related risks. Technicals and Recent Performance SPOT has been on a tear ever since the start of 2023, coinciding with the company’s cost-cutting push, and the stock is still trading in an explosive bullish trend. Despite its lofty year-to-date gains, the stock is only now nearing its all-time high from 2021, and a technical breakout could open a brand new chapter for SPOT in the coming months. As the company’s business continues to mature, the stock’s sky-high volatility is bound to decline, but SPOT is the riskiest of the Gorilla’s picks while having the most upside potential as well. Tradewed Markets(TW): Exceptional Growth in a Unique Market Even though Tradeweb (TW) is a lesser-known company, it has definitely made its mark in the institutional bond trading space, exploding into the scene with unique and modern solutions aiming to bring the market into the 21st century. Government bond and credit markets are still stuck in the past in a sense, with traditional deal-making methods holding up in the face of the retail trading markets' rapid electronification. That said, the secular trend of modernization is clear, and Tradeweb is in a prime position to benefit from it in the coming decade, which has been the company’s strategic focus since well before going public in 2019. Despite fierce competition in its markets, Tradeweb has been executing its growth-focused strategy - expanding into new products and geographies while increasing its market share - without hiccups. The company’s platform- based strategy makes it easy to expand into new product segments, and currently, Tradeweb is already offering trading, processing, and data services for over 50 products, making it the go-to provider for a slew of institutional investors. The company navigated the past couple of years’ bond turmoil in an exemplary fashion, sticking to its strategic plans and using the market’s weakness for “bolt-on” acquisitions, such as By now, Tradeweb provides services for over 2,500 clients primarily in North America, Europe, and Asia, including the vast majority of the top global asset managers and their clients, with its market share nearing 20% in its main electronic markets., and its reach is still growing in the professional space. Connecting Markets and Providing Synergies for A Wide Range of Clients Tradewed defines itself as an “operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities, and money markets,” which, in layman's terms, places it somewhere between an exchange and a brokerage, with the company serving institutional, wholesale, retail, and corporate clients. Tradeweb’s average daily trading volume was above $1.8 trillion in the second quarter, with double-digit growth across its U.S. credit, European credit, municipal growth, credit derivatives, and money markets offerings. Even though growth rates, such as Tradeweb’s, often lead to organizational issues and mismanagement of resources, the company’s growth is largely based on providing products previously unconnected to existing clients. For example, Tradeweb recently became the first electronic trading platform to connect repo (short-term borrowing for bond dealers) and IRS (interest rate swap) markets while expanding its data services based on real-world needs. Thanks to its product expansion, the company’s addressable market has been growing by over 10% over the past five years, but its sales are up by an annualized 20% in the same period, highlighting its increased market share and organic growth potential. The company's latest acquisitions reflect its client-first approach and its goal to target new clients. Earlier this year, Tradeweb bought Institutional Cash Distributors, an investment technology provider focusing on corporate clients trading short-term Treasury-related investments, for $785 million to open a whole new client channel leveraging its existing infrastructure. Last year, through its acquisition of r8fin, Tradeweb dipped its toes into algorithmic trading while entering the Australian and New Zealand fixed- income markets via the $80 million Yieldbroker deal. Financials and Valuation Tradeweb aims to be a disruptor in its business while maintaining a lean corporate structure, which is no easy feat, but the company's low cost and debt levels suggest that it has efficiently dealt with its double-digit growth rate. Looking at its last quarter, its revenue and earnings were up by 30% and 35%, respectively, with Tradeweb’s profits topping $400 million while its sales surpassing $1.5 billion over the past twelve months. The company’s revenue roughly doubled since 2021, with its earnings growing even more. Tradeweb’s rates and credit segments provide the bulk, roughly two-thirds of its sales. However, its money market and market data businesses are also increasing organically and through its acquisitions. Despite its stellar growth and the seasonal nature of its business, the company’s financials have been steady, with Tradeweb successfully harnessing economies of scale while integrating its acquisitions. Looking at just its current P/E ratio of over 50, Tradeweb might seem expensive, but the company’s growth outlook is unparalleled in its industry, with the consensus calling for a yearly earning growth rate north of 15% for the next five years. Tradeweb has over $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, providing ample liquidity and funds for further expansion, and the company has been returning capital to investors ever since its IPO, both through dividends and stock repurchases. TW is operating with very low debt, and although growth always has its risks, the stock’s valuations seem reasonable, and its relatively low institutional ownership suggests that demand for its shares could remain strong for years to come, especially since TW is not yet part of any major index. Technicals and Recent Performance Tradeweb’s great execution is reflected in its shares’ performance and the company’s valuation, with TW being up nearly 300% since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2019 while also registering a gain of over 100% since its 2022 trough. TW hit a new all-time high in February, eclipsing its COVID-era spike, and after consolidating its technical breakout, the stock continued its march to new highs during the summer. TW is trading in a bullish long-term trend, with plenty of technical “support” below, and given the company's expansion, this year's breakout could be the start of a multi-year bull run, while easing financial conditions could provide additional tailwinds for the stock. Uber(UBER): Global Innovation and Growth Powerhouse Uber is the leader in the global app-based ride-hailing market, both in the U.S. and globally, while being a major player in food and grocery delivery as well through its Uber Eats brand. Uber’s core business is sporting a monthly active user base of 150 million, with the company’s ever-growing platform boasting a global user pool of well over 500 million. Uber emerged as a poster child of the “new economy” over the past decade, despite its controversies, emerging from the “unicorn” status as a sustainably profitable but still growth-focused tech company. Throughout its 15-year history, the company has had its fair share of legal scrutiny, but Uber has been successfully navigating the legal minefield, always maintaining its focus on relentless growth. Uber carved out significant market shares in multiple markets and geographies, taking full advantage of its platform, with innovative pricing models and aggressive cost management strategies aiding its expansion, and Uber’s revenues crossed $40 billion for the first time over the past twelve months, with its market capitalization breaching $150 billion. The Gorilla believes that Uber's growth story is far from over, and as an investment, it entered a new phase of its life cycle this year, as the company reached stable profitability while maintaining its growth potential. Uber might now be ready to join the “big guns” of the tech sector. Although Uber’s markets aren't considered highly interest-rate- sensitive, the company's stock has been showing as strong a correlation with yields as the real estate and utilities sectors over the past few years. With all that in mind, Uber is in a unique position to benefit from the Fed’s easing cycle, while transitioning from a low-margin growth powerhouse to a more mature but still agile tech giant. Network Effects Drive Strategic Strength Even though Uber faces stiff competition in its core markets while eyeing already competitive new opportunities, its personalized, flexible, and dynamic pricing practices give it a clear edge over its traditional competitors, with its closest peers also being forced to adapt to the company’s strategies. Uber has a history of executing bold expansion strategies, with a clear focus on achieving dominance in its markets to harvest network effects and platform synergies. Be it its ride-hailing or delivery segments, Uber managed to disrupt established markets, and with 85% of its major markets being already profitable and its margins improving in the vast majority of its geographies, it’s hard to question its strategic vision. Uber One, the company’s membership program, is a great example of its focus on aggressive growth, and the fact that in just over two years, the service reached a 50% share of gross delivery bookings underlines the company’s great execution. Uber One has already contributed to consumer retention, gross booking growth, and cross-selling across its segments while maintaining its competitive advantage and pricing strength and providing an easy path to enter new niches. Uber’s platform allows the company to rapidly deploy and test new offerings at a low cost while offering its strategic partners easy access to a massive pool of potential clients, which could remain a strong growth driver. According to a slew of analysts, autonomous vehicles or robotaxis are considered a major threat to Uber’s ride-hailing business in the long run. However, given its market penetration, strategic advantages, and platform strength, the company might even benefit from the technological shift. Uber is well aware of the looming revolution and, through expanding its portfolio and forming strategic partnerships, such as its Waymo deal, the company is actively managing the robotaxi risk, which likely won’t impact its business in a meaningful way until at least the 2030s. Financials and Valuation In its early years, profitability was Uber’s achilles heel, but since 2018, the company’s revenue is up by a whopping 300%, and doubts about the company’s ability to turn sustained profits diminished in recent years. Uber not only delivered consistent growth despite the challenges of the past five years, but it also outperformed its peers both in the U.S. and globally. Year- over-year booking and revenue growth were roughly 20% and 15%, respectively, in the second quarter, despite a slowdown in the consumer economy, with its Mobility and Delivery segments fueling growth. Even though its shift toward subscription-based pricing led to a slight drop in delivery margins, the company continues to lead the market in profitability while keeping up with its main competitor, DoorDash, in pure growth metrics. Uber has also been expanding its offerings while improving network density and expanding into retail fulfillment, and the segment now accounts for 50% of its bookings. The company’s strong brand recognition and increased offerings helped maintain the inflow of new customers, which has been one of the main catalysts behind UBER’s strong performance over the past couple of years. Although the company’s debt load is still substantial, Uber’s swift expansion, improving margins, and other profitability metrics led to a sharp drop in its financing costs, which, together with the global rate-cut cycle, is expected to have an outsized effect on the growth-focused company’s bottom line and its balance sheet. This positive shift is yet to be fully priced in by the market, and even though its current valuation is rich from a simple P/E perspective, its post-COVID growth rate and its financing costs -which allow for further expansion - make its shares fundamentally attractive here. Technicals and Recent Performance Since its IPO in 2019, UBER had multiple volatile swings, with the twin crises of the past four years leading to quite the roller-coaster ride for its investors. That said, 2023 saw a clear shift in the stock’s market value, with the company’s surging profitability fueling a bullish trend and an eventual breakout to new all-time highs. UBER’s relative strength compared to its closest peers suggests that this technical breakout was just the start of a multi-year bull run, and its exceptional growth potential could finally translate to great sustained returns for its investors. UBER is in a great position to ride the next wave higher in the bull market, and its 2021 high provides ample technical support, meaning that the stock is at a low-risk- high-reward entry point. Conclusion Even though the media always likes to paint a picture of an imminent crisis to grab people's attention, the “boring” truth is that we are in a secular bull market with plenty of room to run following a hectic start to the 2020s. Investors, understandably so, remain cautious and exit their positions at the first sign of trouble, which explains August’s historic surge in volatility - one of the Volatility Index’s (VIX) most violent ones in its 30-year history - which lasted for a mere three days. Folks, bull markets generally last way longer than anyone dares to predict, so it’s important to keep your eyes on the target: increasing your capital by investing in strong businesses. The current bull easily survived the recent surge in inflation, the Fed’s painful cure, the escalation in the Middle East, and the rising tensions between the West and the Global South, and there is still no crisis in sight that could derail the secular trend. This means that violent pullbacks such as the one we experienced this past August, however scary they are, should be viewed as buying opportunities, as they usually set the stage for the next swing higher. That said, we are entering a new phase of the bull market, with easing monetary conditions and a transition to a maturing economic cycle. Like at the start of the inflationary crisis and near the end of the Fed’s tightening cycle, a new crop of stocks will have an advantage over the prior leaders due to the changing financing and economic backdrop. Taking advantage of this “rotation” could be the key to beating the market and elevating your investments to the next level. This doesn't mean that you should completely overhaul your portfolio, in fact, sticking to your guns during bull markets usually pays off, but changing conditions will lead to new opportunities. That's where the Gorilla’s hand- picked picks come in, offering different levels of risk and upside potential. Early- and late-stage disruptors, a dominant real estate giant, and a potential turnaround star give you plenty of options, with all companies being well- positioned to benefit from the ongoing macroeconomic and monetary shifts moving toward the elections. With fundamentals and technicals looking bullish again following a frustrating summer, these stocks could greatly boost to your portfolio!

INSIDE: Economic growth could slowly pick up in the U.S. and globally, as inflationary pressures continue to ease, with the Fed joining the rate-cut “party,” which could lead to even stronger corporate earnings growth following this year’s robust gains The megatrends behind the secular bull market in stocks aren’t going anywhere, with the tech revolution, the AI boom, the medical revolution, the expansion of global trade, and the emergence of China's and India’s middle class fueling global growth in the coming decade The U.S. economy’s relative strength will likely persist, and there is no reason to believe that domestic stocks will give up their global dominance, meaning that the U.S. market is still the place to be for outsized returns After hitting new record highs and consolidating their gains, the major indices are primed for further gains, leaving the key technical levels of 40K in the Dow, 18K in the Nasdaq, and 5,500 in the S&P 500 behind for good following the elections Growth-focused companies could take center stage as financing costs drop, and despite two stellar years, tech stocks might continue their dominance Cyclical stocks, the Dow, and small-caps, which have already started to flex their muscles, could catch up with the market-leading Nasdaq as the impact of easing monetary conditions increases Volatility could continue to trend lower, with a few spikes above 20 in the VIX, corresponding to orderly profit-taking events in stocks, which should still be treated as buying opportunities Five Stocks To Own Going Into The Elections & Beyond 2024 began exactly how bulls hoped it would, with stocks extending last year's technical breakout to new record highs, thanks to the tech sector’s continued leadership and the bull market’s broadening base. Overseas stocks joined the party in earnest, too, with even European equities eclipsing their prior highs, despite a mild recession on the Old Continent, proving that, against all odds, a global bull market began in 2023. Despite the promising long-term trends and the early-year rally, geopolitical tensions, lingering inflation fears, and the market-leading Nasdaq’s extremely overbought momentum readings led to several months of sideways price action and a deep, albeit brief, selloff in August. While the past few months were frustrating for investors, they likely set the stage for something big toward the end of the year. Although the pre-election uncertainty could weigh on risk assets, this autumn could provide one of the best opportunities to load up on stocks in years. The positive backdrop doesn't mean that you should ignore stock picking and buy stocks without thinking. In fact, we are still in the “New Golden Age of Stock Picking” that started in 2022, and this year's strong divergences between the main sectors prove just that. But, before diving deep into the Gorilla’s top picks, let's see the fundamental and technical drivers behind the bull market in detail! Bullish Technicals In The Wake Of A Frustrating Summer Despite all the fear, the case for the bull market’s continuation remains as strong as ever, with fundamentals and technicals lining up for a potentially stellar end to 2024, and extending well into 2025. The major indices are trading in strong long-term advancing trends, and following last year's major technical breakout, the benchmarks just had their first meaningful pullback, which is considered one of the best, lowest-risk entry points by trading pros. August’s deep pullback came and went so quickly that you might have missed it during your holiday trip. And even though some analysts, including one of Goldman Sachs’ (GS), believe that this is a warning sign for bulls, the Gorilla tends to disagree. Such quick recoveries are hallmarks of strong markets. While it's true that sentiment was a bit too bullish before the summer, many retail investors are waiting on the sidelines right now, providing ample future buying power. There is still plenty of skepticism about the bull market when it comes to professional investors as well, which is not how bear markets begin, as market tops and euphoria usually go hand in hand. In all likelihood, this summer’s pullback will only be a side note in the history of 2024, and the secular bull market will march on. But, if you don’t believe in the power of technicals and sentiment analysis, maybe the changing monetary conditions and the improving economic outlook will be enough to convince you that stocks should be near the top of your investment shortlist. The Fed’s New Focus: Jobs and Growth The Fed’s fight against inflation was long and painful for some sectors, with the real estate sector suffering the most, but overall, the economy and the stock market weathered the storm very well. That said, lower-income consumers were hit hard by surging prices and rising interest rates, which led to weaker growth in the consumer economy, but those trends have already reversed or are about to reverse. Real wages are rising, energy prices are near their war-era lows despite the sky-high tension in the Middle East, and inflation indicators have been surprising to the downside across the globe this summer. What’s more, inflation is now officially in the Fed’s rear-view mirror, and the past few months’ trends will likely give confidence to the Central Bank to be as aggressive in cutting interest rates as it was raising them. At the Fed’s Jackson Hole Symposium, which has a history of huge announcements, Chairman Jerome Powell all but confirmed that a rate cut is coming this month. Mr. Powell also stated that full employment is the Fed’s new focus, hinting at a brand-new monetary era, which will likely last for many years. Most experts now agree that going into the elections, the Fed will likely ease at least one more time. Yields hit one-year lows in August, with more cuts to follow in 2025. Furthermore, the ongoing tech revolution and the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, in particular, will mean that long-term deflationary forces, such as increasing productivity and the impact of global trade will dominate again, leading to another extended period of low interest rates. Let’s see how the economy is doing ahead of the Fed’s easing cycle. Financials Are Breaking Out, Goldilocks Rally Ahead? Most seasoned investors would agree that one of the best ways to lose money on Wall Street is to go against the trends in the financial sector. The banking system’s strength is not only essential for growth, but the sector is usually a great forward-looking indicator of the economy and, in turn, the stock market. In fact, the bank sector’s stability in the face of last year’s regional bank crisis was among the Gorilla’s main reasons to expect a sustained breakout to new all-time highs from the major indices in 2024. So, what are financials up to these days, you might ask? Well, they are busy breaking out to new record highs. Focusing on this summer’s gloomy headlines, this might be quite the head-scratcher, but financials were among the first issues erasing August’s pullback. Why is that? Just in August, U.S. GDP growth was revised higher, retail sales blew away expectations, and the all-important services sector signaled accelerating growth, which is enough to make a feared recession highly unlikely anytime soon. Evidence for a “soft landing” is piling up and even though manufacturing is still struggling, the housing sector could start to contribute to GDP growth in a big way soon as demand remains strong, the financial system remains healthy, and mortgage rates are finally dropping. From a broader standpoint, the economic super-cycle that began following the COVID crisis and the shock of Russia’s war in Ukraine has the potential to last for many more years, and the technological leadership of the U.S., unique domestic market, solid demographic trends, and stable supply of resources provide a great fundamental backdrop for domestic stocks. With all the above in mind, the coming quarters could easily bring “Goldilocks” conditions for the market - solid growth coupled with easing monetary conditions - which usually means outstanding returns for stocks and other risk assets, but investors will have to keep adapting to the ever- changing market conditions. A Maturing Bull Market Before the start of 2024, the Gorilla expected a “slightly boring, frustrating, but bullish year.” By the end of August, even the worst-performing Dow was up nearly double-digits, with the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 sporting gains of over 15% each. These lofty gains - the product of the first quarter’s grinding and “boring” advance - might come as a surprise for investors who don’t closely follow the market, but such gains are normal in mature bull markets. Short-term traders likely experienced plenty of frustration, as volatility also followed the Gorilla’s expectations, with the Volatility Index (VIX) spending most of the year under the widely watched 20 level, outside of a few brief spikes. As before, all selloffs should be considered buying opportunities, but making a quick buck becomes more and more difficult in low-volatility markets. Small-caps surged to new multi-year highs after lagging the major indices last year, and even though the Russell 2000 is yet to take out its 2021 high, the broadening of the rally’s base is undeniable. The odds are that this year’s trends will continue well into next year, and the positive global developments mean that an accelerating rally could be in the cards following November’s elections, meaning that the current buying opportunity might not last long. This year’s increasing valuations make stock- picking even more important, and the Gorilla is ready to share his picks, which could thrive no matter the winning party! American Tower Corp. (AMT): The Ideal Interest Rate Play? If following Warren Buffet's investment principles is your goal, American Tower (AMT) checks at least one of the boxes; it's a simple business that is protected by a sizable moat and a stable client base. American Tower specializes in leasing real estate to telecommunication companies suited for a wide range of mobile, broadcast, and wireless applications across the globe, with its market capitalization climbing above $100 billion this year. The company was founded in 1995, and thanks to its three decades of experience and vast know-how, it is dominating its primary markets while having a competitive advantage throughout its secondary geographies. Through its comprehensive offerings, American Tower became one of the largest specialized REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) globally, giving it excellent bargaining power and comparatively low financing rates. The company has over 220K sites under its umbrella, spanning five continents and over 30 countries, with a clear focus on North and Latin America but a strong presence in Europe, Asia, and Africa as well. Increasing global mobile penetration rates, surging data usage, the 5G rollout, and the looming generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom all but guarantee that the secular growth trend behind the company's growth won’t slow down anytime soon. Stable Income Streams, Global Exposure, And Relentless Growth AMT’s average lease agreement lasts nearly eight years, which, together with a very high client retention rate, leads to predictable and stable long- term income streams, with economic cycles barely affecting its core business. American Tower also enjoys very high renewal rates across its geographies, making it unique among REITs and a top pick to benefit from a sustained decline in interest rates. Its bargaining power and lean structure also place the company near the top of the industry’s profitability rankings, while presenting a strong barrier to entry to its potential competitors. American Tower has long implemented a strategy based on global growth, but over the past couple of years, it has refocused its capital allocation toward developed markets, and India, in particular, in a bid to reduce risk and further improve stability. This shift could improve execution, project success rate, and the spread between rental rates and financing costs. Since growth remains strong in the Americas and Europe, its growth impact will likely be negligible. That said, the bulk of the company's revenue relies on a specific niche, with some uncertainty regarding long-term demand, prompting a push to diversify while maintaining its competitive edge. Through the $10 billion acquisition of CoreSite, the company entered the data center business in 2021, complementing its core offerings, and American Tower now operates 25 sites, accounting for 7% of its total revenues in the second quarter of the year. This expansion aided growth while improving margins and providing exposure to a quickly growing market with deep synergies connected to the company’s core business. The new segment posted double-digit year-over-year growth in the latest quarter, and thanks to its AI exposure and substantial CAPEX spending, data center growth could even accelerate in the coming quarters. Financials and Valuation American Tower’s short-term performance is strongly tied to interest rate rates due to its financing and income structure, but digging down to its organic growth metrics shows steady growth and improving operational efficiency. The company's sales have been growing at a high-single-digit rate over the past five years, with operating expenses consistently surprising to the downside under new CEO Steven Vondara, and the company's crucial Funds From Operations (FFO) metric - essentially cash-flow for REITs - beating expectations. American Tower recently upgraded its bottom-line projections for the next couple of years, forecasting a growth rate of over 6%, with analysts predicting earnings growth to top 25% per year through 2029. The company’s growth strategy utilizes leverage, hence its strongly rate- sensitive nature, Despite its debt-based business model, the company's balance sheet is also stable, with a declining net leverage ratio. Since American Tower uses a Consumer Price Index (CPI) -based re-pricing clauses in its contracts, its revenue has also been tracking the past couple of years’ surge in inflation, and contract resets will continue to increase cash-flow in the coming years. The company is paying a respectable and stable dividend of roughly 3%, but American Tower still boasts stable Free-Cash-Flows (FCF) generation, which easily covers its dividend and provides the base for further growth. American Tower’s valuation remains attractive despite this year's gains, and an aggressive rate-cut cycle from the Fed could see the company’s valuation metrics plummet, making its current price a substantial bargain. With the entire real estate sector currently “underinvested” due to its recent struggles, retail investors could provide additional buying power once the recovery gains steam, which could lead to a multi-year rally. The potential downside should there be a rebound in inflation, is limited at its current level. Hence, the stock offers a low risk/reward ratio for investors, with the company’s substantial backlog and the recent surge in rental demand, assuring healthy top-line growth. Technicals and Recent Performance AMT staged a turnaround this year following a grueling three-year period, and since the company’s fundamentals have been steadily improving over the past several years, the stock might have plenty of gas left in the tank. AMT is now trading in a well-established long-term bullish trend, well above its 200-day moving average, and after breaking out above the $235 level, bulls could, in the medium-term, have their sights on the stock’s all-time high from 2021. The stock recently formed a classic cup-and-handle pattern, confirming its trend reversal, which could provide technical tailwinds for the rest of the year. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM): A New Dawn for the IT Giant? Despite its pivotal role in establishing the modern tech industry, IBM has been dismissed as a perpetual laggard for over a decade, and for a good reason. Even though the company tried to reinvent itself multiple times, its bloated organizational structure, surging costs, sluggish growth, and low margins made it a tough choice as an investment. Over the past five years, IBM went through a real transformation under CEO Arvind Krishna, spinning off a significant portion of its low-margin legacy IT infrastructure business into Kyndryl Holdings (KD) to entirely focus on its hybrid-cloud-based software and consulting business. Since the spinoff, IBM has managed to enter a phase of organic growth. Although IBM hasn't solved all of its issues, the company’s recent track record in execution, cost management, and strategic decisions make it an attractive and cheap option in the tech space. The company's quickly improving financials, combined with its massive knowledge base and research and development prowess, give its shares significant upside potential. What's more, IBM’s growth has been greatly aided by its business-to-business (B2B) AI offerings, which could be one of the catalysts of the company's developing turnaround story. Software and Consulting Surge Fueled by Generative AI Adoption Why is IBM, of all companies, such a promising low-risk AI play? Well, IBM primarily serves business customers across multiple industries, providing essential productivity, communication, and analytics tools. One of generative AI’s most relevant use cases, at its current level, is customized “in-house” productivity solutions, which align perfectly with IBM’s expertise, especially given the company’s “hands-on” approach to its projects, which manifests in close long-term collaborations with its clients. The company recognized this synergy and was quick to implement a wide range of AI-driven software solutions, such as customized assistants, knowledge bases, and data-analytic tools, which were met by strong demand over the past couple of years. IBM’s strategic focus on its software and consulting segments resulted in steady top and bottom-line growth over the past years, and analysts expect continued mid-single-digit expansion in both areas. The company’s hybrid cloud platforms have been driving growth in its software segment, but AI adoption also led to an uptick in infrastructure revenues through an accelerated upgrade cycle. IBM’s latest software partnerships on cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and AI data solutions with industry leaders such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon’s (AMZN) AWS have increased its reach, and its stable B2B client base provides a great foundation for further cloud growth. IBM has been active on the acquisition front this year, making use of its improving financial position, and the market reacted well to the company's growth push, with its $6.4 billion HashiCorp deal making the biggest waves. The cloud automation company’s offerings fit well into IBM’s strategic vision, and its quick integration into the company's platforms shows that IBM is a different, more agile beast that can maintain its momentum. That said, IBM is still a laggard in the eyes of a slew of players in the industry, and the company has plenty of room to improve its brand, but IBM's new management seems to be on the right path. Financials and Valuation IBM's margins have been improving across the board since 2019, with the company's revenue hitting a five-year high over the past twelve months, with its operational costs flat over the same period. Since 2020, IBM’s operational costs are down by roughly 10%, which might not seem much, but given the size of IBM’s operations and the 100% increase in comparable sales, its margin impact is massive, and the company’s further cost-saving initiatives could lead to rapid improvements in the coming quarters. IBM’s latest quarters have been consistently stronger than analyst expectations, with its free cash flow of over $13 billion, in particular, turning heads, which vastly improved the company's financial position. IBM’s debt load of $53 billion remains higher-than-average compared to its competitors, but thanks to its improving profitability and steady growth, the company is unlikely to face financing issues, especially during the Fed’s easing cycle. In fact, IBM is now in a position to significantly reduce its debt burden or refinance it at lower rates in the coming years, with the company having enough resources to continue investing in growth while returning capital to investors. IBM offers a dividend yieldof 3% at its current price level, which will become more and more attractive as the Fed cuts interest rates in the coming quarters. Even though the consensus regarding IBM’s business is starting to shift, its stock still trades at a hefty discount compared to its peers, both based on current and future earnings, giving it massive upside potential for years to come. Technicals and Recent Performance IBM has been showing relative strength compared to the large-cap benchmarks and its closest peers since the summer of 2023, and the stock is currently “testing” the $200 level after hitting decade-long highs earlier this year. Currently, IBM offers a unique blend of low volatility and outperformance that could provide stability and above-average returns for years to come, with plenty of headroom once the stock clears its all-time high from 2013. IBM is trading in a strong bullish trend, above both its 50- and 200-day moving averages, and while up by over 20% on a year-to-date basis, the stock could enjoy technical tailwinds throughout the rest of the year, should it complete its technical breakout above $200. Spotify(SPOT): The Next Billion-User Tech Giant? Spotify is the undoubted global leader in the audio streaming market, controlling roughly one-third of the quickly growing segment. Spotify has over 625 million active users, up from 77 million in 2015 and 232 million in 2019, with the company registering continuous growth thanks to its dual freemium model, based on an ad-supported free tier and ad-free premium tiers. Spotify also boasts nearly 250 million paying subscribers. With the secular shift toward streaming in music consumption still in full swing, the company’s mid-term goal of reaching 1 billion users seems realistic. The company’s mobile app remains one of the fastest-growing apps globally, with the company having a strong presence in North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The Swedish company’s biggest market is still the U.S., despite strong competition from the likes of Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN), but its other geographies have been growing quicker than its established markets in recent years, transforming Spotify into a truly global powerhouse in audio streaming space. Spotify is often referred to as the Netflix (NFLX) of music, and for a good reason, as the company's audio offerings are comparable to Netflix’s video products, with a few caveats, which analogy will be crucial in understanding the company's huge potential and the strategic challenges it faces. Product and Pricing Innovation Fueling Growth Amid Owned -Content Push For nearly a decade, Netflix faced scrutiny over the viability of its business model due to its high royalty costs, expensive content strategy, and stiff competition across its key markets. However, the video streaming company showed that such a model could be successful in the long run with a strong brand, global presence, and aggressive growth strategy. That said, Spotify and other audio services generally pay higher royalty fees, and audio streaming services products tend to be more comprehensive but more homogeneous than video services, with less exclusive content. In theory, this makes switching between services less costly for customers, but Spotify has a few aces up its sleeve that have been helping it with these strategic weaknesses. Spotify, thanks to its high engagement levels, has a huge competitive advantage compared to its closest peers and even Netflix; according to research firm, Antenna, of all video and audio streaming services, Spotify’s customers are the least likely to cancel their subscriptions in the U.S. with a monthly cancellation rate of less than 2%. This explains that, despite the fierce competition, Spotify’s U.S. market share has steadily increased over the past three years, capturing market shares from big guns like Apple and Amazon, a feat deemed unlikely by many analysts. Spotify continues to be laser-focused on growing its user base of its core business globally while expanding its offerings and increasing the share of its owned-content portfolio. The company recently started offering audiobooks with promising initial results, with paid podcasts also being an important part of Spotify’s diversification push. These new products could broaden the company’s demographic reach beyond its traditional young adult audience, Spotify is offering its new products both individually and in bundles - which are being rolled out across its geographies - and the company’s bundling strategy could significantly boost its margins in the long run. Financials and Valuation Spotify proved its pricing power and user retention capability over the past couple of years amid a global surge in inflation, raising its prices two times in some regions, with its average price now above its major peers’ fees, such as Apple Music, in the U.S. Paying subscriber growth has been very strong in recent quarters, with its paid segment outperforming its ad-supported segment, despite its price hikes, and the company’s increasing global footprint means that its growth potential continues to be exceptional. Paid subscriptions comprise over 85% of Spotify’s total revenue, and should its owned-content strategy pan out, the path to becoming a “cash cow” would be clear, especially given the company's low churn rates. When it comes to evaluating Spotify’s financials, profitability is the elephant in the room, with some analysts doubting the company's ability to turn a sustained profit, as effectively monetizing its quickly growing user base could prove tricky. Furthermore, royalties make up the vast majority of the company’s costs, and since the royalty-holding studios are in a strong bargaining position, Spotify could face long-term margin pressures. At the same time, Spotify’s optimized subscriber plans and new monetization avenues have already boosted its profitability measures, leading to a surge in its share price. Spotify’s revenue neared $16 billion over the past twelve months, with its quarterly revenue growing by 20% on a year-over-year basis, despite the headwinds in the consumer sector. The company executed a significant cost- cutting program following its COVID-era boom, and its gross margin climbed back to nearly 30% in the second quarter of 2024, after dropping below 25% in 2022. Thanks to the past couple of years’ positive developments, the company’s financial position has improved significantly, with its FCF reaching $490 million and its cash hoard topping $5 billion in the second quarter of this year, which eclipses its total debt of $2 billion. Based on its current earnings, Spotify’s valuation is sky-high. Still, its recent momentum and its lofty long- term profit potential could easily justify its market cap of $60 billion, even considering substantial execution- and competition-related risks. Technicals and Recent Performance SPOT has been on a tear ever since the start of 2023, coinciding with the company’s cost-cutting push, and the stock is still trading in an explosive bullish trend. Despite its lofty year-to-date gains, the stock is only now nearing its all-time high from 2021, and a technical breakout could open a brand new chapter for SPOT in the coming months. As the company’s business continues to mature, the stock’s sky-high volatility is bound to decline, but SPOT is the riskiest of the Gorilla’s picks while having the most upside potential as well. Tradewed Markets(TW): Exceptional Growth in a Unique Market Even though Tradeweb (TW) is a lesser-known company, it has definitely made its mark in the institutional bond trading space, exploding into the scene with unique and modern solutions aiming to bring the market into the 21st century. Government bond and credit markets are still stuck in the past in a sense, with traditional deal-making methods holding up in the face of the retail trading markets' rapid electronification. That said, the secular trend of modernization is clear, and Tradeweb is in a prime position to benefit from it in the coming decade, which has been the company’s strategic focus since well before going public in 2019. Despite fierce competition in its markets, Tradeweb has been executing its growth-focused strategy - expanding into new products and geographies while increasing its market share - without hiccups. The company’s platform- based strategy makes it easy to expand into new product segments, and currently, Tradeweb is already offering trading, processing, and data services for over 50 products, making it the go-to provider for a slew of institutional investors. The company navigated the past couple of years’ bond turmoil in an exemplary fashion, sticking to its strategic plans and using the market’s weakness for “bolt-on” acquisitions, such as By now, Tradeweb provides services for over 2,500 clients primarily in North America, Europe, and Asia, including the vast majority of the top global asset managers and their clients, with its market share nearing 20% in its main electronic markets., and its reach is still growing in the professional space. Connecting Markets and Providing Synergies for A Wide Range of Clients Tradewed defines itself as an “operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities, and money markets,” which, in layman's terms, places it somewhere between an exchange and a brokerage, with the company serving institutional, wholesale, retail, and corporate clients. Tradeweb’s average daily trading volume was above $1.8 trillion in the second quarter, with double-digit growth across its U.S. credit, European credit, municipal growth, credit derivatives, and money markets offerings. Even though growth rates, such as Tradeweb’s, often lead to organizational issues and mismanagement of resources, the company’s growth is largely based on providing products previously unconnected to existing clients. For example, Tradeweb recently became the first electronic trading platform to connect repo (short-term borrowing for bond dealers) and IRS (interest rate swap) markets while expanding its data services based on real-world needs. Thanks to its product expansion, the company’s addressable market has been growing by over 10% over the past five years, but its sales are up by an annualized 20% in the same period, highlighting its increased market share and organic growth potential. The company's latest acquisitions reflect its client-first approach and its goal to target new clients. Earlier this year, Tradeweb bought Institutional Cash Distributors, an investment technology provider focusing on corporate clients trading short-term Treasury-related investments, for $785 million to open a whole new client channel leveraging its existing infrastructure. Last year, through its acquisition of r8fin, Tradeweb dipped its toes into algorithmic trading while entering the Australian and New Zealand fixed- income markets via the $80 million Yieldbroker deal. Financials and Valuation Tradeweb aims to be a disruptor in its business while maintaining a lean corporate structure, which is no easy feat, but the company's low cost and debt levels suggest that it has efficiently dealt with its double-digit growth rate. Looking at its last quarter, its revenue and earnings were up by 30% and 35%, respectively, with Tradeweb’s profits topping $400 million while its sales surpassing $1.5 billion over the past twelve months. The company’s revenue roughly doubled since 2021, with its earnings growing even more. Tradeweb’s rates and credit segments provide the bulk, roughly two-thirds of its sales. However, its money market and market data businesses are also increasing organically and through its acquisitions. Despite its stellar growth and the seasonal nature of its business, the company’s financials have been steady, with Tradeweb successfully harnessing economies of scale while integrating its acquisitions. Looking at just its current P/E ratio of over 50, Tradeweb might seem expensive, but the company’s growth outlook is unparalleled in its industry, with the consensus calling for a yearly earning growth rate north of 15% for the next five years. Tradeweb has over $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, providing ample liquidity and funds for further expansion, and the company has been returning capital to investors ever since its IPO, both through dividends and stock repurchases. TW is operating with very low debt, and although growth always has its risks, the stock’s valuations seem reasonable, and its relatively low institutional ownership suggests that demand for its shares could remain strong for years to come, especially since TW is not yet part of any major index. Technicals and Recent Performance Tradeweb’s great execution is reflected in its shares’ performance and the company’s valuation, with TW being up nearly 300% since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2019 while also registering a gain of over 100% since its 2022 trough. TW hit a new all-time high in February, eclipsing its COVID-era spike, and after consolidating its technical breakout, the stock continued its march to new highs during the summer. TW is trading in a bullish long-term trend, with plenty of technical “support” below, and given the company's expansion, this year's breakout could be the start of a multi-year bull run, while easing financial conditions could provide additional tailwinds for the stock. Uber(UBER): Global Innovation and Growth Powerhouse Uber is the leader in the global app-based ride-hailing market, both in the U.S. and globally, while being a major player in food and grocery delivery as well through its Uber Eats brand. Uber’s core business is sporting a monthly active user base of 150 million, with the company’s ever-growing platform boasting a global user pool of well over 500 million. Uber emerged as a poster child of the “new economy” over the past decade, despite its controversies, emerging from the “unicorn” status as a sustainably profitable but still growth-focused tech company. Throughout its 15-year history, the company has had its fair share of legal scrutiny, but Uber has been successfully navigating the legal minefield, always maintaining its focus on relentless growth. Uber carved out significant market shares in multiple markets and geographies, taking full advantage of its platform, with innovative pricing models and aggressive cost management strategies aiding its expansion, and Uber’s revenues crossed $40 billion for the first time over the past twelve months, with its market capitalization breaching $150 billion. The Gorilla believes that Uber's growth story is far from over, and as an investment, it entered a new phase of its life cycle this year, as the company reached stable profitability while maintaining its growth potential. Uber might now be ready to join the “big guns” of the tech sector. Although Uber’s markets aren't considered highly interest-rate- sensitive, the company's stock has been showing as strong a correlation with yields as the real estate and utilities sectors over the past few years. With all that in mind, Uber is in a unique position to benefit from the Fed’s easing cycle, while transitioning from a low-margin growth powerhouse to a more mature but still agile tech giant. Network Effects Drive Strategic Strength Even though Uber faces stiff competition in its core markets while eyeing already competitive new opportunities, its personalized, flexible, and dynamic pricing practices give it a clear edge over its traditional competitors, with its closest peers also being forced to adapt to the company’s strategies. Uber has a history of executing bold expansion strategies, with a clear focus on achieving dominance in its markets to harvest network effects and platform synergies. Be it its ride-hailing or delivery segments, Uber managed to disrupt established markets, and with 85% of its major markets being already profitable and its margins improving in the vast majority of its geographies, it’s hard to question its strategic vision. Uber One, the company’s membership program, is a great example of its focus on aggressive growth, and the fact that in just over two years, the service reached a 50% share of gross delivery bookings underlines the company’s great execution. Uber One has already contributed to consumer retention, gross booking growth, and cross-selling across its segments while maintaining its competitive advantage and pricing strength and providing an easy path to enter new niches. Uber’s platform allows the company to rapidly deploy and test new offerings at a low cost while offering its strategic partners easy access to a massive pool of potential clients, which could remain a strong growth driver. According to a slew of analysts, autonomous vehicles or robotaxis are considered a major threat to Uber’s ride-hailing business in the long run. However, given its market penetration, strategic advantages, and platform strength, the company might even benefit from the technological shift. Uber is well aware of the looming revolution and, through expanding its portfolio and forming strategic partnerships, such as its Waymo deal, the company is actively managing the robotaxi risk, which likely won’t impact its business in a meaningful way until at least the 2030s. Financials and Valuation In its early years, profitability was Uber’s achilles heel, but since 2018, the company’s revenue is up by a whopping 300%, and doubts about the company’s ability to turn sustained profits diminished in recent years. Uber not only delivered consistent growth despite the challenges of the past five years, but it also outperformed its peers both in the U.S. and globally. Year- over-year booking and revenue growth were roughly 20% and 15%, respectively, in the second quarter, despite a slowdown in the consumer economy, with its Mobility and Delivery segments fueling growth. Even though its shift toward subscription-based pricing led to a slight drop in delivery margins, the company continues to lead the market in profitability while keeping up with its main competitor, DoorDash, in pure growth metrics. Uber has also been expanding its offerings while improving network density and expanding into retail fulfillment, and the segment now accounts for 50% of its bookings. The company’s strong brand recognition and increased offerings helped maintain the inflow of new customers, which has been one of the main catalysts behind UBER’s strong performance over the past couple of years. Although the company’s debt load is still substantial, Uber’s swift expansion, improving margins, and other profitability metrics led to a sharp drop in its financing costs, which, together with the global rate-cut cycle, is expected to have an outsized effect on the growth-focused company’s bottom line and its balance sheet. This positive shift is yet to be fully priced in by the market, and even though its current valuation is rich from a simple P/E perspective, its post-COVID growth rate and its financing costs -which allow for further expansion - make its shares fundamentally attractive here. Technicals and Recent Performance Since its IPO in 2019, UBER had multiple volatile swings, with the twin crises of the past four years leading to quite the roller-coaster ride for its investors. That said, 2023 saw a clear shift in the stock’s market value, with the company’s surging profitability fueling a bullish trend and an eventual breakout to new all-time highs. UBER’s relative strength compared to its closest peers suggests that this technical breakout was just the start of a multi-year bull run, and its exceptional growth potential could finally translate to great sustained returns for its investors. UBER is in a great position to ride the next wave higher in the bull market, and its 2021 high provides ample technical support, meaning that the stock is at a low-risk- high-reward entry point. Conclusion Even though the media always likes to paint a picture of an imminent crisis to grab people's attention, the “boring” truth is that we are in a secular bull market with plenty of room to run following a hectic start to the 2020s. Investors, understandably so, remain cautious and exit their positions at the first sign of trouble, which explains August’s historic surge in volatility - one of the Volatility Index’s (VIX) most violent ones in its 30-year history - which lasted for a mere three days. Folks, bull markets generally last way longer than anyone dares to predict, so it’s important to keep your eyes on the target: increasing your capital by investing in strong businesses. The current bull easily survived the recent surge in inflation, the Fed’s painful cure, the escalation in the Middle East, and the rising tensions between the West and the Global South, and there is still no crisis in sight that could derail the secular trend. This means that violent pullbacks such as the one we experienced this past August, however scary they are, should be viewed as buying opportunities, as they usually set the stage for the next swing higher. That said, we are entering a new phase of the bull market, with easing monetary conditions and a transition to a maturing economic cycle. Like at the start of the inflationary crisis and near the end of the Fed’s tightening cycle, a new crop of stocks will have an advantage over the prior leaders due to the changing financing and economic backdrop. Taking advantage of this “rotation” could be the key to beating the market and elevating your investments to the next level. This doesn't mean that you should completely overhaul your portfolio, in fact, sticking to your guns during bull markets usually pays off, but changing conditions will lead to new opportunities. That's where the Gorilla’s hand- picked picks come in, offering different levels of risk and upside potential. Early- and late-stage disruptors, a dominant real estate giant, and a potential turnaround star give you plenty of options, with all companies being well- positioned to benefit from the ongoing macroeconomic and monetary shifts moving toward the elections. With fundamentals and technicals looking bullish again following a frustrating summer, these stocks could greatly boost to your portfolio!

INSIDE: Economic growth could slowly pick up in the U.S. and globally, as inflationary pressures continue to ease, with the Fed joining the rate-cut “party,” which could lead to even stronger corporate earnings growth following this year’s robust gains The megatrends behind the secular bull market in stocks aren’t going anywhere, with the tech revolution, the AI boom, the medical revolution, the expansion of global trade, and the emergence of China's and India’s middle class fueling global growth in the coming decade The U.S. economy’s relative strength will likely persist, and there is no reason to believe that domestic stocks will give up their global dominance, meaning that the U.S. market is still the place to be for outsized returns After hitting new record highs and consolidating their gains, the major indices are primed for further gains, leaving the key technical levels of 40K in the Dow, 18K in the Nasdaq, and 5,500 in the S&P 500 behind for good following the elections Growth-focused companies could take center stage as financing costs drop, and despite two stellar years, tech stocks might continue their dominance Cyclical stocks, the Dow, and small-caps, which have already started to flex their muscles, could catch up with the market-leading Nasdaq as the impact of easing monetary conditions increases Volatility could continue to trend lower, with a few spikes above 20 in the VIX, corresponding to orderly profit-taking events in stocks, which should still be treated as buying opportunities Five Stocks To Own Going Into The Elections & Beyond 2024 began exactly how bulls hoped it would, with stocks extending last year's technical breakout to new record highs, thanks to the tech sector’s continued leadership and the bull market’s broadening base. Overseas stocks joined the party in earnest, too, with even European equities eclipsing their prior highs, despite a mild recession on the Old Continent, proving that, against all odds, a global bull market began in 2023. Despite the promising long-term trends and the early-year rally, geopolitical tensions, lingering inflation fears, and the market-leading Nasdaq’s extremely overbought momentum readings led to several months of sideways price action and a deep, albeit brief, selloff in August. While the past few months were frustrating for investors, they likely set the stage for something big toward the end of the year. Although the pre-election uncertainty could weigh on risk assets, this autumn could provide one of the best opportunities to load up on stocks in years. The positive backdrop doesn't mean that you should ignore stock picking and buy stocks without thinking. In fact, we are still in the “New Golden Age of Stock Picking” that started in 2022, and this year's strong divergences between the main sectors prove just that. But, before diving deep into the Gorilla’s top picks, let's see the fundamental and technical drivers behind the bull market in detail! Bullish Technicals In The Wake Of A Frustrating Summer Despite all the fear, the case for the bull market’s continuation remains as strong as ever, with fundamentals and technicals lining up for a potentially stellar end to 2024, and extending well into 2025. The major indices are trading in strong long-term advancing trends, and following last year's major technical breakout, the benchmarks just had their first meaningful pullback, which is considered one of the best, lowest-risk entry points by trading pros. August’s deep pullback came and went so quickly that you might have missed it during your holiday trip. And even though some analysts, including one of Goldman Sachs’ (GS), believe that this is a warning sign for bulls, the Gorilla tends to disagree. Such quick recoveries are hallmarks of strong markets. While it's true that sentiment was a bit too bullish before the summer, many retail investors are waiting on the sidelines right now, providing ample future buying power. There is still plenty of skepticism about the bull market when it comes to professional investors as well, which is not how bear markets begin, as market tops and euphoria usually go hand in hand. In all likelihood, this summer’s pullback will only be a side note in the history of 2024, and the secular bull market will march on. But, if you don’t believe in the power of technicals and sentiment analysis, maybe the changing monetary conditions and the improving economic outlook will be enough to convince you that stocks should be near the top of your investment shortlist. The Fed’s New Focus: Jobs and Growth The Fed’s fight against inflation was long and painful for some sectors, with the real estate sector suffering the most, but overall, the economy and the stock market weathered the storm very well. That said, lower-income consumers were hit hard by surging prices and rising interest rates, which led to weaker growth in the consumer economy, but those trends have already reversed or are about to reverse. Real wages are rising, energy prices are near their war-era lows despite the sky-high tension in the Middle East, and inflation indicators have been surprising to the downside across the globe this summer. What’s more, inflation is now officially in the Fed’s rear-view mirror, and the past few months’ trends will likely give confidence to the Central Bank to be as aggressive in cutting interest rates as it was raising them. At the Fed’s Jackson Hole Symposium, which has a history of huge announcements, Chairman Jerome Powell all but confirmed that a rate cut is coming this month. Mr. Powell also stated that full employment is the Fed’s new focus, hinting at a brand-new monetary era, which will likely last for many years. Most experts now agree that going into the elections, the Fed will likely ease at least one more time. Yields hit one-year lows in August, with more cuts to follow in 2025. Furthermore, the ongoing tech revolution and the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, in particular, will mean that long-term deflationary forces, such as increasing productivity and the impact of global trade will dominate again, leading to another extended period of low interest rates. Let’s see how the economy is doing ahead of the Fed’s easing cycle. Financials Are Breaking Out, Goldilocks Rally Ahead? Most seasoned investors would agree that one of the best ways to lose money on Wall Street is to go against the trends in the financial sector. The banking system’s strength is not only essential for growth, but the sector is usually a great forward-looking indicator of the economy and, in turn, the stock market. In fact, the bank sector’s stability in the face of last year’s regional bank crisis was among the Gorilla’s main reasons to expect a sustained breakout to new all-time highs from the major indices in 2024. So, what are financials up to these days, you might ask? Well, they are busy breaking out to new record highs. Focusing on this summer’s gloomy headlines, this might be quite the head-scratcher, but financials were among the first issues erasing August’s pullback. Why is that? Just in August, U.S. GDP growth was revised higher, retail sales blew away expectations, and the all-important services sector signaled accelerating growth, which is enough to make a feared recession highly unlikely anytime soon. Evidence for a “soft landing” is piling up and even though manufacturing is still struggling, the housing sector could start to contribute to GDP growth in a big way soon as demand remains strong, the financial system remains healthy, and mortgage rates are finally dropping. From a broader standpoint, the economic super-cycle that began following the COVID crisis and the shock of Russia’s war in Ukraine has the potential to last for many more years, and the technological leadership of the U.S., unique domestic market, solid demographic trends, and stable supply of resources provide a great fundamental backdrop for domestic stocks. With all the above in mind, the coming quarters could easily bring “Goldilocks” conditions for the market - solid growth coupled with easing monetary conditions - which usually means outstanding returns for stocks and other risk assets, but investors will have to keep adapting to the ever- changing market conditions. A Maturing Bull Market Before the start of 2024, the Gorilla expected a “slightly boring, frustrating, but bullish year.” By the end of August, even the worst-performing Dow was up nearly double-digits, with the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 sporting gains of over 15% each. These lofty gains - the product of the first quarter’s grinding and “boring” advance - might come as a surprise for investors who don’t closely follow the market, but such gains are normal in mature bull markets. Short-term traders likely experienced plenty of frustration, as volatility also followed the Gorilla’s expectations, with the Volatility Index (VIX) spending most of the year under the widely watched 20 level, outside of a few brief spikes. As before, all selloffs should be considered buying opportunities, but making a quick buck becomes more and more difficult in low-volatility markets. Small-caps surged to new multi-year highs after lagging the major indices last year, and even though the Russell 2000 is yet to take out its 2021 high, the broadening of the rally’s base is undeniable. The odds are that this year’s trends will continue well into next year, and the positive global developments mean that an accelerating rally could be in the cards following November’s elections, meaning that the current buying opportunity might not last long. This year’s increasing valuations make stock- picking even more important, and the Gorilla is ready to share his picks, which could thrive no matter the winning party! American Tower Corp. (AMT): The Ideal Interest Rate Play? If following Warren Buffet's investment principles is your goal, American Tower (AMT) checks at least one of the boxes; it's a simple business that is protected by a sizable moat and a stable client base. American Tower specializes in leasing real estate to telecommunication companies suited for a wide range of mobile, broadcast, and wireless applications across the globe, with its market capitalization climbing above $100 billion this year. The company was founded in 1995, and thanks to its three decades of experience and vast know-how, it is dominating its primary markets while having a competitive advantage throughout its secondary geographies. Through its comprehensive offerings, American Tower became one of the largest specialized REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) globally, giving it excellent bargaining power and comparatively low financing rates. The company has over 220K sites under its umbrella, spanning five continents and over 30 countries, with a clear focus on North and Latin America but a strong presence in Europe, Asia, and Africa as well. Increasing global mobile penetration rates, surging data usage, the 5G rollout, and the looming generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom all but guarantee that the secular growth trend behind the company's growth won’t slow down anytime soon. Stable Income Streams, Global Exposure, And Relentless Growth AMT’s average lease agreement lasts nearly eight years, which, together with a very high client retention rate, leads to predictable and stable long- term income streams, with economic cycles barely affecting its core business. American Tower also enjoys very high renewal rates across its geographies, making it unique among REITs and a top pick to benefit from a sustained decline in interest rates. Its bargaining power and lean structure also place the company near the top of the industry’s profitability rankings, while presenting a strong barrier to entry to its potential competitors. American Tower has long implemented a strategy based on global growth, but over the past couple of years, it has refocused its capital allocation toward developed markets, and India, in particular, in a bid to reduce risk and further improve stability. This shift could improve execution, project success rate, and the spread between rental rates and financing costs. Since growth remains strong in the Americas and Europe, its growth impact will likely be negligible. That said, the bulk of the company's revenue relies on a specific niche, with some uncertainty regarding long-term demand, prompting a push to diversify while maintaining its competitive edge. Through the $10 billion acquisition of CoreSite, the company entered the data center business in 2021, complementing its core offerings, and American Tower now operates 25 sites, accounting for 7% of its total revenues in the second quarter of the year. This expansion aided growth while improving margins and providing exposure to a quickly growing market with deep synergies connected to the company’s core business. The new segment posted double-digit year-over-year growth in the latest quarter, and thanks to its AI exposure and substantial CAPEX spending, data center growth could even accelerate in the coming quarters. Financials and Valuation American Tower’s short-term performance is strongly tied to interest rate rates due to its financing and income structure, but digging down to its organic growth metrics shows steady growth and improving operational efficiency. The company's sales have been growing at a high-single-digit rate over the past five years, with operating expenses consistently surprising to the downside under new CEO Steven Vondara, and the company's crucial Funds From Operations (FFO) metric - essentially cash-flow for REITs - beating expectations. American Tower recently upgraded its bottom-line projections for the next couple of years, forecasting a growth rate of over 6%, with analysts predicting earnings growth to top 25% per year through 2029. The company’s growth strategy utilizes leverage, hence its strongly rate- sensitive nature, Despite its debt-based business model, the company's balance sheet is also stable, with a declining net leverage ratio. Since American Tower uses a Consumer Price Index (CPI) -based re-pricing clauses in its contracts, its revenue has also been tracking the past couple of years’ surge in inflation, and contract resets will continue to increase cash-flow in the coming years. The company is paying a respectable and stable dividend of roughly 3%, but American Tower still boasts stable Free-Cash-Flows (FCF) generation, which easily covers its dividend and provides the base for further growth. American Tower’s valuation remains attractive despite this year's gains, and an aggressive rate-cut cycle from the Fed could see the company’s valuation metrics plummet, making its current price a substantial bargain. With the entire real estate sector currently “underinvested” due to its recent struggles, retail investors could provide additional buying power once the recovery gains steam, which could lead to a multi-year rally. The potential downside should there be a rebound in inflation, is limited at its current level. Hence, the stock offers a low risk/reward ratio for investors, with the company’s substantial backlog and the recent surge in rental demand, assuring healthy top-line growth. Technicals and Recent Performance AMT staged a turnaround this year following a grueling three-year period, and since the company’s fundamentals have been steadily improving over the past several years, the stock might have plenty of gas left in the tank. AMT is now trading in a well-established long-term bullish trend, well above its 200-day moving average, and after breaking out above the $235 level, bulls could, in the medium-term, have their sights on the stock’s all-time high from 2021. The stock recently formed a classic cup-and-handle pattern, confirming its trend reversal, which could provide technical tailwinds for the rest of the year. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM): A New Dawn for the IT Giant? Despite its pivotal role in establishing the modern tech industry, IBM has been dismissed as a perpetual laggard for over a decade, and for a good reason. Even though the company tried to reinvent itself multiple times, its bloated organizational structure, surging costs, sluggish growth, and low margins made it a tough choice as an investment. Over the past five years, IBM went through a real transformation under CEO Arvind Krishna, spinning off a significant portion of its low-margin legacy IT infrastructure business into Kyndryl Holdings (KD) to entirely focus on its hybrid-cloud-based software and consulting business. Since the spinoff, IBM has managed to enter a phase of organic growth. Although IBM hasn't solved all of its issues, the company’s recent track record in execution, cost management, and strategic decisions make it an attractive and cheap option in the tech space. The company's quickly improving financials, combined with its massive knowledge base and research and development prowess, give its shares significant upside potential. What's more, IBM’s growth has been greatly aided by its business-to-business (B2B) AI offerings, which could be one of the catalysts of the company's developing turnaround story. Software and Consulting Surge Fueled by Generative AI Adoption Why is IBM, of all companies, such a promising low-risk AI play? Well, IBM primarily serves business customers across multiple industries, providing essential productivity, communication, and analytics tools. One of generative AI’s most relevant use cases, at its current level, is customized “in-house” productivity solutions, which align perfectly with IBM’s expertise, especially given the company’s “hands-on” approach to its projects, which manifests in close long-term collaborations with its clients. The company recognized this synergy and was quick to implement a wide range of AI-driven software solutions, such as customized assistants, knowledge bases, and data-analytic tools, which were met by strong demand over the past couple of years. IBM’s strategic focus on its software and consulting segments resulted in steady top and bottom-line growth over the past years, and analysts expect continued mid-single-digit expansion in both areas. The company’s hybrid cloud platforms have been driving growth in its software segment, but AI adoption also led to an uptick in infrastructure revenues through an accelerated upgrade cycle. IBM’s latest software partnerships on cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and AI data solutions with industry leaders such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon’s (AMZN) AWS have increased its reach, and its stable B2B client base provides a great foundation for further cloud growth. IBM has been active on the acquisition front this year, making use of its improving financial position, and the market reacted well to the company's growth push, with its $6.4 billion HashiCorp deal making the biggest waves. The cloud automation company’s offerings fit well into IBM’s strategic vision, and its quick integration into the company's platforms shows that IBM is a different, more agile beast that can maintain its momentum. That said, IBM is still a laggard in the eyes of a slew of players in the industry, and the company has plenty of room to improve its brand, but IBM's new management seems to be on the right path. Financials and Valuation IBM's margins have been improving across the board since 2019, with the company's revenue hitting a five-year high over the past twelve months, with its operational costs flat over the same period. Since 2020, IBM’s operational costs are down by roughly 10%, which might not seem much, but given the size of IBM’s operations and the 100% increase in comparable sales, its margin impact is massive, and the company’s further cost-saving initiatives could lead to rapid improvements in the coming quarters. IBM’s latest quarters have been consistently stronger than analyst expectations, with its free cash flow of over $13 billion, in particular, turning heads, which vastly improved the company's financial position. IBM’s debt load of $53 billion remains higher-than-average compared to its competitors, but thanks to its improving profitability and steady growth, the company is unlikely to face financing issues, especially during the Fed’s easing cycle. In fact, IBM is now in a position to significantly reduce its debt burden or refinance it at lower rates in the coming years, with the company having enough resources to continue investing in growth while returning capital to investors. IBM offers a dividend yieldof 3% at its current price level, which will become more and more attractive as the Fed cuts interest rates in the coming quarters. Even though the consensus regarding IBM’s business is starting to shift, its stock still trades at a hefty discount compared to its peers, both based on current and future earnings, giving it massive upside potential for years to come. Technicals and Recent Performance IBM has been showing relative strength compared to the large-cap benchmarks and its closest peers since the summer of 2023, and the stock is currently “testing” the $200 level after hitting decade-long highs earlier this year. Currently, IBM offers a unique blend of low volatility and outperformance that could provide stability and above-average returns for years to come, with plenty of headroom once the stock clears its all-time high from 2013. IBM is trading in a strong bullish trend, above both its 50- and 200-day moving averages, and while up by over 20% on a year-to-date basis, the stock could enjoy technical tailwinds throughout the rest of the year, should it complete its technical breakout above $200. Spotify(SPOT): The Next Billion-User Tech Giant? Spotify is the undoubted global leader in the audio streaming market, controlling roughly one-third of the quickly growing segment. Spotify has over 625 million active users, up from 77 million in 2015 and 232 million in 2019, with the company registering continuous growth thanks to its dual freemium model, based on an ad-supported free tier and ad-free premium tiers. Spotify also boasts nearly 250 million paying subscribers. With the secular shift toward streaming in music consumption still in full swing, the company’s mid-term goal of reaching 1 billion users seems realistic. The company’s mobile app remains one of the fastest-growing apps globally, with the company having a strong presence in North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The Swedish company’s biggest market is still the U.S., despite strong competition from the likes of Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN), but its other geographies have been growing quicker than its established markets in recent years, transforming Spotify into a truly global powerhouse in audio streaming space. Spotify is often referred to as the Netflix (NFLX) of music, and for a good reason, as the company's audio offerings are comparable to Netflix’s video products, with a few caveats, which analogy will be crucial in understanding the company's huge potential and the strategic challenges it faces. Product and Pricing Innovation Fueling Growth Amid Owned -Content Push For nearly a decade, Netflix faced scrutiny over the viability of its business model due to its high royalty costs, expensive content strategy, and stiff competition across its key markets. However, the video streaming company showed that such a model could be successful in the long run with a strong brand, global presence, and aggressive growth strategy. That said, Spotify and other audio services generally pay higher royalty fees, and audio streaming services products tend to be more comprehensive but more homogeneous than video services, with less exclusive content. In theory, this makes switching between services less costly for customers, but Spotify has a few aces up its sleeve that have been helping it with these strategic weaknesses. Spotify, thanks to its high engagement levels, has a huge competitive advantage compared to its closest peers and even Netflix; according to research firm, Antenna, of all video and audio streaming services, Spotify’s customers are the least likely to cancel their subscriptions in the U.S. with a monthly cancellation rate of less than 2%. This explains that, despite the fierce competition, Spotify’s U.S. market share has steadily increased over the past three years, capturing market shares from big guns like Apple and Amazon, a feat deemed unlikely by many analysts. Spotify continues to be laser-focused on growing its user base of its core business globally while expanding its offerings and increasing the share of its owned-content portfolio. The company recently started offering audiobooks with promising initial results, with paid podcasts also being an important part of Spotify’s diversification push. These new products could broaden the company’s demographic reach beyond its traditional young adult audience, Spotify is offering its new products both individually and in bundles - which are being rolled out across its geographies - and the company’s bundling strategy could significantly boost its margins in the long run. Financials and Valuation Spotify proved its pricing power and user retention capability over the past couple of years amid a global surge in inflation, raising its prices two times in some regions, with its average price now above its major peers’ fees, such as Apple Music, in the U.S. Paying subscriber growth has been very strong in recent quarters, with its paid segment outperforming its ad-supported segment, despite its price hikes, and the company’s increasing global footprint means that its growth potential continues to be exceptional. Paid subscriptions comprise over 85% of Spotify’s total revenue, and should its owned-content strategy pan out, the path to becoming a “cash cow” would be clear, especially given the company's low churn rates. When it comes to evaluating Spotify’s financials, profitability is the elephant in the room, with some analysts doubting the company's ability to turn a sustained profit, as effectively monetizing its quickly growing user base could prove tricky. Furthermore, royalties make up the vast majority of the company’s costs, and since the royalty-holding studios are in a strong bargaining position, Spotify could face long-term margin pressures. At the same time, Spotify’s optimized subscriber plans and new monetization avenues have already boosted its profitability measures, leading to a surge in its share price. Spotify’s revenue neared $16 billion over the past twelve months, with its quarterly revenue growing by 20% on a year-over-year basis, despite the headwinds in the consumer sector. The company executed a significant cost- cutting program following its COVID-era boom, and its gross margin climbed back to nearly 30% in the second quarter of 2024, after dropping below 25% in 2022. Thanks to the past couple of years’ positive developments, the company’s financial position has improved significantly, with its FCF reaching $490 million and its cash hoard topping $5 billion in the second quarter of this year, which eclipses its total debt of $2 billion. Based on its current earnings, Spotify’s valuation is sky-high. Still, its recent momentum and its lofty long- term profit potential could easily justify its market cap of $60 billion, even considering substantial execution- and competition-related risks. Technicals and Recent Performance SPOT has been on a tear ever since the start of 2023, coinciding with the company’s cost-cutting push, and the stock is still trading in an explosive bullish trend. Despite its lofty year-to-date gains, the stock is only now nearing its all-time high from 2021, and a technical breakout could open a brand new chapter for SPOT in the coming months. As the company’s business continues to mature, the stock’s sky-high volatility is bound to decline, but SPOT is the riskiest of the Gorilla’s picks while having the most upside potential as well. Tradewed Markets(TW): Exceptional Growth in a Unique Market Even though Tradeweb (TW) is a lesser-known company, it has definitely made its mark in the institutional bond trading space, exploding into the scene with unique and modern solutions aiming to bring the market into the 21st century. Government bond and credit markets are still stuck in the past in a sense, with traditional deal-making methods holding up in the face of the retail trading markets' rapid electronification. That said, the secular trend of modernization is clear, and Tradeweb is in a prime position to benefit from it in the coming decade, which has been the company’s strategic focus since well before going public in 2019. Despite fierce competition in its markets, Tradeweb has been executing its growth-focused strategy - expanding into new products and geographies while increasing its market share - without hiccups. The company’s platform- based strategy makes it easy to expand into new product segments, and currently, Tradeweb is already offering trading, processing, and data services for over 50 products, making it the go-to provider for a slew of institutional investors. The company navigated the past couple of years’ bond turmoil in an exemplary fashion, sticking to its strategic plans and using the market’s weakness for “bolt-on” acquisitions, such as By now, Tradeweb provides services for over 2,500 clients primarily in North America, Europe, and Asia, including the vast majority of the top global asset managers and their clients, with its market share nearing 20% in its main electronic markets., and its reach is still growing in the professional space. Connecting Markets and Providing Synergies for A Wide Range of Clients Tradewed defines itself as an “operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities, and money markets,” which, in layman's terms, places it somewhere between an exchange and a brokerage, with the company serving institutional, wholesale, retail, and corporate clients. Tradeweb’s average daily trading volume was above $1.8 trillion in the second quarter, with double-digit growth across its U.S. credit, European credit, municipal growth, credit derivatives, and money markets offerings. Even though growth rates, such as Tradeweb’s, often lead to organizational issues and mismanagement of resources, the company’s growth is largely based on providing products previously unconnected to existing clients. For example, Tradeweb recently became the first electronic trading platform to connect repo (short-term borrowing for bond dealers) and IRS (interest rate swap) markets while expanding its data services based on real-world needs. Thanks to its product expansion, the company’s addressable market has been growing by over 10% over the past five years, but its sales are up by an annualized 20% in the same period, highlighting its increased market share and organic growth potential. The company's latest acquisitions reflect its client-first approach and its goal to target new clients. Earlier this year, Tradeweb bought Institutional Cash Distributors, an investment technology provider focusing on corporate clients trading short-term Treasury-related investments, for $785 million to open a whole new client channel leveraging its existing infrastructure. Last year, through its acquisition of r8fin, Tradeweb dipped its toes into algorithmic trading while entering the Australian and New Zealand fixed- income markets via the $80 million Yieldbroker deal. Financials and Valuation Tradeweb aims to be a disruptor in its business while maintaining a lean corporate structure, which is no easy feat, but the company's low cost and debt levels suggest that it has efficiently dealt with its double-digit growth rate. Looking at its last quarter, its revenue and earnings were up by 30% and 35%, respectively, with Tradeweb’s profits topping $400 million while its sales surpassing $1.5 billion over the past twelve months. The company’s revenue roughly doubled since 2021, with its earnings growing even more. Tradeweb’s rates and credit segments provide the bulk, roughly two-thirds of its sales. However, its money market and market data businesses are also increasing organically and through its acquisitions. Despite its stellar growth and the seasonal nature of its business, the company’s financials have been steady, with Tradeweb successfully harnessing economies of scale while integrating its acquisitions. Looking at just its current P/E ratio of over 50, Tradeweb might seem expensive, but the company’s growth outlook is unparalleled in its industry, with the consensus calling for a yearly earning growth rate north of 15% for the next five years. Tradeweb has over $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, providing ample liquidity and funds for further expansion, and the company has been returning capital to investors ever since its IPO, both through dividends and stock repurchases. TW is operating with very low debt, and although growth always has its risks, the stock’s valuations seem reasonable, and its relatively low institutional ownership suggests that demand for its shares could remain strong for years to come, especially since TW is not yet part of any major index. Technicals and Recent Performance Tradeweb’s great execution is reflected in its shares’ performance and the company’s valuation, with TW being up nearly 300% since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2019 while also registering a gain of over 100% since its 2022 trough. TW hit a new all-time high in February, eclipsing its COVID-era spike, and after consolidating its technical breakout, the stock continued its march to new highs during the summer. TW is trading in a bullish long-term trend, with plenty of technical “support” below, and given the company's expansion, this year's breakout could be the start of a multi-year bull run, while easing financial conditions could provide additional tailwinds for the stock. Uber(UBER): Global Innovation and Growth Powerhouse Uber is the leader in the global app-based ride-hailing market, both in the U.S. and globally, while being a major player in food and grocery delivery as well through its Uber Eats brand. Uber’s core business is sporting a monthly active user base of 150 million, with the company’s ever-growing platform boasting a global user pool of well over 500 million. Uber emerged as a poster child of the “new economy” over the past decade, despite its controversies, emerging from the “unicorn” status as a sustainably profitable but still growth-focused tech company. Throughout its 15-year history, the company has had its fair share of legal scrutiny, but Uber has been successfully navigating the legal minefield, always maintaining its focus on relentless growth. Uber carved out significant market shares in multiple markets and geographies, taking full advantage of its platform, with innovative pricing models and aggressive cost management strategies aiding its expansion, and Uber’s revenues crossed $40 billion for the first time over the past twelve months, with its market capitalization breaching $150 billion. The Gorilla believes that Uber's growth story is far from over, and as an investment, it entered a new phase of its life cycle this year, as the company reached stable profitability while maintaining its growth potential. Uber might now be ready to join the “big guns” of the tech sector. Although Uber’s markets aren't considered highly interest-rate- sensitive, the company's stock has been showing as strong a correlation with yields as the real estate and utilities sectors over the past few years. With all that in mind, Uber is in a unique position to benefit from the Fed’s easing cycle, while transitioning from a low-margin growth powerhouse to a more mature but still agile tech giant. Network Effects Drive Strategic Strength Even though Uber faces stiff competition in its core markets while eyeing already competitive new opportunities, its personalized, flexible, and dynamic pricing practices give it a clear edge over its traditional competitors, with its closest peers also being forced to adapt to the company’s strategies. Uber has a history of executing bold expansion strategies, with a clear focus on achieving dominance in its markets to harvest network effects and platform synergies. Be it its ride-hailing or delivery segments, Uber managed to disrupt established markets, and with 85% of its major markets being already profitable and its margins improving in the vast majority of its geographies, it’s hard to question its strategic vision. Uber One, the company’s membership program, is a great example of its focus on aggressive growth, and the fact that in just over two years, the service reached a 50% share of gross delivery bookings underlines the company’s great execution. Uber One has already contributed to consumer retention, gross booking growth, and cross-selling across its segments while maintaining its competitive advantage and pricing strength and providing an easy path to enter new niches. Uber’s platform allows the company to rapidly deploy and test new offerings at a low cost while offering its strategic partners easy access to a massive pool of potential clients, which could remain a strong growth driver. According to a slew of analysts, autonomous vehicles or robotaxis are considered a major threat to Uber’s ride-hailing business in the long run. However, given its market penetration, strategic advantages, and platform strength, the company might even benefit from the technological shift. Uber is well aware of the looming revolution and, through expanding its portfolio and forming strategic partnerships, such as its Waymo deal, the company is actively managing the robotaxi risk, which likely won’t impact its business in a meaningful way until at least the 2030s. Financials and Valuation In its early years, profitability was Uber’s achilles heel, but since 2018, the company’s revenue is up by a whopping 300%, and doubts about the company’s ability to turn sustained profits diminished in recent years. Uber not only delivered consistent growth despite the challenges of the past five years, but it also outperformed its peers both in the U.S. and globally. Year- over-year booking and revenue growth were roughly 20% and 15%, respectively, in the second quarter, despite a slowdown in the consumer economy, with its Mobility and Delivery segments fueling growth. Even though its shift toward subscription-based pricing led to a slight drop in delivery margins, the company continues to lead the market in profitability while keeping up with its main competitor, DoorDash, in pure growth metrics. Uber has also been expanding its offerings while improving network density and expanding into retail fulfillment, and the segment now accounts for 50% of its bookings. The company’s strong brand recognition and increased offerings helped maintain the inflow of new customers, which has been one of the main catalysts behind UBER’s strong performance over the past couple of years. Although the company’s debt load is still substantial, Uber’s swift expansion, improving margins, and other profitability metrics led to a sharp drop in its financing costs, which, together with the global rate-cut cycle, is expected to have an outsized effect on the growth-focused company’s bottom line and its balance sheet. This positive shift is yet to be fully priced in by the market, and even though its current valuation is rich from a simple P/E perspective, its post-COVID growth rate and its financing costs -which allow for further expansion - make its shares fundamentally attractive here. Technicals and Recent Performance Since its IPO in 2019, UBER had multiple volatile swings, with the twin crises of the past four years leading to quite the roller-coaster ride for its investors. That said, 2023 saw a clear shift in the stock’s market value, with the company’s surging profitability fueling a bullish trend and an eventual breakout to new all-time highs. UBER’s relative strength compared to its closest peers suggests that this technical breakout was just the start of a multi-year bull run, and its exceptional growth potential could finally translate to great sustained returns for its investors. UBER is in a great position to ride the next wave higher in the bull market, and its 2021 high provides ample technical support, meaning that the stock is at a low-risk- high-reward entry point. Conclusion Even though the media always likes to paint a picture of an imminent crisis to grab people's attention, the “boring” truth is that we are in a secular bull market with plenty of room to run following a hectic start to the 2020s. Investors, understandably so, remain cautious and exit their positions at the first sign of trouble, which explains August’s historic surge in volatility - one of the Volatility Index’s (VIX) most violent ones in its 30-year history - which lasted for a mere three days. Folks, bull markets generally last way longer than anyone dares to predict, so it’s important to keep your eyes on the target: increasing your capital by investing in strong businesses. The current bull easily survived the recent surge in inflation, the Fed’s painful cure, the escalation in the Middle East, and the rising tensions between the West and the Global South, and there is still no crisis in sight that could derail the secular trend. This means that violent pullbacks such as the one we experienced this past August, however scary they are, should be viewed as buying opportunities, as they usually set the stage for the next swing higher. That said, we are entering a new phase of the bull market, with easing monetary conditions and a transition to a maturing economic cycle. Like at the start of the inflationary crisis and near the end of the Fed’s tightening cycle, a new crop of stocks will have an advantage over the prior leaders due to the changing financing and economic backdrop. Taking advantage of this “rotation” could be the key to beating the market and elevating your investments to the next level. This doesn't mean that you should completely overhaul your portfolio, in fact, sticking to your guns during bull markets usually pays off, but changing conditions will lead to new opportunities. That's where the Gorilla’s hand- picked picks come in, offering different levels of risk and upside potential. Early- and late-stage disruptors, a dominant real estate giant, and a potential turnaround star give you plenty of options, with all companies being well- positioned to benefit from the ongoing macroeconomic and monetary shifts moving toward the elections. With fundamentals and technicals looking bullish again following a frustrating summer, these stocks could greatly boost to your portfolio!

INSIDE: Economic growth could slowly pick up in the U.S. and globally, as inflationary pressures continue to ease, with the Fed joining the rate-cut “party,” which could lead to even stronger corporate earnings growth following this year’s robust gains The megatrends behind the secular bull market in stocks aren’t going anywhere, with the tech revolution, the AI boom, the medical revolution, the expansion of global trade, and the emergence of China's and India’s middle class fueling global growth in the coming decade The U.S. economy’s relative strength will likely persist, and there is no reason to believe that domestic stocks will give up their global dominance, meaning that the U.S. market is still the place to be for outsized returns After hitting new record highs and consolidating their gains, the major indices are primed for further gains, leaving the key technical levels of 40K in the Dow, 18K in the Nasdaq, and 5,500 in the S&P 500 behind for good following the elections Growth-focused companies could take center stage as financing costs drop, and despite two stellar years, tech stocks might continue their dominance Cyclical stocks, the Dow, and small-caps, which have already started to flex their muscles, could catch up with the market-leading Nasdaq as the impact of easing monetary conditions increases Volatility could continue to trend lower, with a few spikes above 20 in the VIX, corresponding to orderly profit-taking events in stocks, which should still be treated as buying opportunities Five Stocks To Own Going Into The Elections & Beyond 2024 began exactly how bulls hoped it would, with stocks extending last year's technical breakout to new record highs, thanks to the tech sector’s continued leadership and the bull market’s broadening base. Overseas stocks joined the party in earnest, too, with even European equities eclipsing their prior highs, despite a mild recession on the Old Continent, proving that, against all odds, a global bull market began in 2023. Despite the promising long-term trends and the early-year rally, geopolitical tensions, lingering inflation fears, and the market-leading Nasdaq’s extremely overbought momentum readings led to several months of sideways price action and a deep, albeit brief, selloff in August. While the past few months were frustrating for investors, they likely set the stage for something big toward the end of the year. Although the pre-election uncertainty could weigh on risk assets, this autumn could provide one of the best opportunities to load up on stocks in years. The positive backdrop doesn't mean that you should ignore stock picking and buy stocks without thinking. In fact, we are still in the “New Golden Age of Stock Picking” that started in 2022, and this year's strong divergences between the main sectors prove just that. But, before diving deep into the Gorilla’s top picks, let's see the fundamental and technical drivers behind the bull market in detail! Bullish Technicals In The Wake Of A Frustrating Summer Despite all the fear, the case for the bull market’s continuation remains as strong as ever, with fundamentals and technicals lining up for a potentially stellar end to 2024, and extending well into 2025. The major indices are trading in strong long-term advancing trends, and following last year's major technical breakout, the benchmarks just had their first meaningful pullback, which is considered one of the best, lowest-risk entry points by trading pros. August’s deep pullback came and went so quickly that you might have missed it during your holiday trip. And even though some analysts, including one of Goldman Sachs’ (GS), believe that this is a warning sign for bulls, the Gorilla tends to disagree. Such quick recoveries are hallmarks of strong markets. While it's true that sentiment was a bit too bullish before the summer, many retail investors are waiting on the sidelines right now, providing ample future buying power. There is still plenty of skepticism about the bull market when it comes to professional investors as well, which is not how bear markets begin, as market tops and euphoria usually go hand in hand. In all likelihood, this summer’s pullback will only be a side note in the history of 2024, and the secular bull market will march on. But, if you don’t believe in the power of technicals and sentiment analysis, maybe the changing monetary conditions and the improving economic outlook will be enough to convince you that stocks should be near the top of your investment shortlist. The Fed’s New Focus: Jobs and Growth The Fed’s fight against inflation was long and painful for some sectors, with the real estate sector suffering the most, but overall, the economy and the stock market weathered the storm very well. That said, lower-income consumers were hit hard by surging prices and rising interest rates, which led to weaker growth in the consumer economy, but those trends have already reversed or are about to reverse. Real wages are rising, energy prices are near their war-era lows despite the sky-high tension in the Middle East, and inflation indicators have been surprising to the downside across the globe this summer. What’s more, inflation is now officially in the Fed’s rear-view mirror, and the past few months’ trends will likely give confidence to the Central Bank to be as aggressive in cutting interest rates as it was raising them. At the Fed’s Jackson Hole Symposium, which has a history of huge announcements, Chairman Jerome Powell all but confirmed that a rate cut is coming this month. Mr. Powell also stated that full employment is the Fed’s new focus, hinting at a brand-new monetary era, which will likely last for many years. Most experts now agree that going into the elections, the Fed will likely ease at least one more time. Yields hit one-year lows in August, with more cuts to follow in 2025. Furthermore, the ongoing tech revolution and the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, in particular, will mean that long-term deflationary forces, such as increasing productivity and the impact of global trade will dominate again, leading to another extended period of low interest rates. Let’s see how the economy is doing ahead of the Fed’s easing cycle. Financials Are Breaking Out, Goldilocks Rally Ahead? Most seasoned investors would agree that one of the best ways to lose money on Wall Street is to go against the trends in the financial sector. The banking system’s strength is not only essential for growth, but the sector is usually a great forward-looking indicator of the economy and, in turn, the stock market. In fact, the bank sector’s stability in the face of last year’s regional bank crisis was among the Gorilla’s main reasons to expect a sustained breakout to new all-time highs from the major indices in 2024. So, what are financials up to these days, you might ask? Well, they are busy breaking out to new record highs. Focusing on this summer’s gloomy headlines, this might be quite the head-scratcher, but financials were among the first issues erasing August’s pullback. Why is that? Just in August, U.S. GDP growth was revised higher, retail sales blew away expectations, and the all-important services sector signaled accelerating growth, which is enough to make a feared recession highly unlikely anytime soon. Evidence for a “soft landing” is piling up and even though manufacturing is still struggling, the housing sector could start to contribute to GDP growth in a big way soon as demand remains strong, the financial system remains healthy, and mortgage rates are finally dropping. From a broader standpoint, the economic super-cycle that began following the COVID crisis and the shock of Russia’s war in Ukraine has the potential to last for many more years, and the technological leadership of the U.S., unique domestic market, solid demographic trends, and stable supply of resources provide a great fundamental backdrop for domestic stocks. With all the above in mind, the coming quarters could easily bring “Goldilocks” conditions for the market - solid growth coupled with easing monetary conditions - which usually means outstanding returns for stocks and other risk assets, but investors will have to keep adapting to the ever- changing market conditions. A Maturing Bull Market Before the start of 2024, the Gorilla expected a “slightly boring, frustrating, but bullish year.” By the end of August, even the worst-performing Dow was up nearly double-digits, with the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 sporting gains of over 15% each. These lofty gains - the product of the first quarter’s grinding and “boring” advance - might come as a surprise for investors who don’t closely follow the market, but such gains are normal in mature bull markets. Short-term traders likely experienced plenty of frustration, as volatility also followed the Gorilla’s expectations, with the Volatility Index (VIX) spending most of the year under the widely watched 20 level, outside of a few brief spikes. As before, all selloffs should be considered buying opportunities, but making a quick buck becomes more and more difficult in low-volatility markets. Small-caps surged to new multi-year highs after lagging the major indices last year, and even though the Russell 2000 is yet to take out its 2021 high, the broadening of the rally’s base is undeniable. The odds are that this year’s trends will continue well into next year, and the positive global developments mean that an accelerating rally could be in the cards following November’s elections, meaning that the current buying opportunity might not last long. This year’s increasing valuations make stock- picking even more important, and the Gorilla is ready to share his picks, which could thrive no matter the winning party! American Tower Corp. (AMT): The Ideal Interest Rate Play? If following Warren Buffet's investment principles is your goal, American Tower (AMT) checks at least one of the boxes; it's a simple business that is protected by a sizable moat and a stable client base. American Tower specializes in leasing real estate to telecommunication companies suited for a wide range of mobile, broadcast, and wireless applications across the globe, with its market capitalization climbing above $100 billion this year. The company was founded in 1995, and thanks to its three decades of experience and vast know-how, it is dominating its primary markets while having a competitive advantage throughout its secondary geographies. Through its comprehensive offerings, American Tower became one of the largest specialized REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) globally, giving it excellent bargaining power and comparatively low financing rates. The company has over 220K sites under its umbrella, spanning five continents and over 30 countries, with a clear focus on North and Latin America but a strong presence in Europe, Asia, and Africa as well. Increasing global mobile penetration rates, surging data usage, the 5G rollout, and the looming generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom all but guarantee that the secular growth trend behind the company's growth won’t slow down anytime soon. Stable Income Streams, Global Exposure, And Relentless Growth AMT’s average lease agreement lasts nearly eight years, which, together with a very high client retention rate, leads to predictable and stable long- term income streams, with economic cycles barely affecting its core business. American Tower also enjoys very high renewal rates across its geographies, making it unique among REITs and a top pick to benefit from a sustained decline in interest rates. Its bargaining power and lean structure also place the company near the top of the industry’s profitability rankings, while presenting a strong barrier to entry to its potential competitors. American Tower has long implemented a strategy based on global growth, but over the past couple of years, it has refocused its capital allocation toward developed markets, and India, in particular, in a bid to reduce risk and further improve stability. This shift could improve execution, project success rate, and the spread between rental rates and financing costs. Since growth remains strong in the Americas and Europe, its growth impact will likely be negligible. That said, the bulk of the company's revenue relies on a specific niche, with some uncertainty regarding long-term demand, prompting a push to diversify while maintaining its competitive edge. Through the $10 billion acquisition of CoreSite, the company entered the data center business in 2021, complementing its core offerings, and American Tower now operates 25 sites, accounting for 7% of its total revenues in the second quarter of the year. This expansion aided growth while improving margins and providing exposure to a quickly growing market with deep synergies connected to the company’s core business. The new segment posted double-digit year-over-year growth in the latest quarter, and thanks to its AI exposure and substantial CAPEX spending, data center growth could even accelerate in the coming quarters. Financials and Valuation American Tower’s short-term performance is strongly tied to interest rate rates due to its financing and income structure, but digging down to its organic growth metrics shows steady growth and improving operational efficiency. The company's sales have been growing at a high-single-digit rate over the past five years, with operating expenses consistently surprising to the downside under new CEO Steven Vondara, and the company's crucial Funds From Operations (FFO) metric - essentially cash-flow for REITs - beating expectations. American Tower recently upgraded its bottom-line projections for the next couple of years, forecasting a growth rate of over 6%, with analysts predicting earnings growth to top 25% per year through 2029. The company’s growth strategy utilizes leverage, hence its strongly rate- sensitive nature, Despite its debt-based business model, the company's balance sheet is also stable, with a declining net leverage ratio. Since American Tower uses a Consumer Price Index (CPI) -based re-pricing clauses in its contracts, its revenue has also been tracking the past couple of years’ surge in inflation, and contract resets will continue to increase cash-flow in the coming years. The company is paying a respectable and stable dividend of roughly 3%, but American Tower still boasts stable Free-Cash-Flows (FCF) generation, which easily covers its dividend and provides the base for further growth. American Tower’s valuation remains attractive despite this year's gains, and an aggressive rate-cut cycle from the Fed could see the company’s valuation metrics plummet, making its current price a substantial bargain. With the entire real estate sector currently “underinvested” due to its recent struggles, retail investors could provide additional buying power once the recovery gains steam, which could lead to a multi-year rally. The potential downside should there be a rebound in inflation, is limited at its current level. Hence, the stock offers a low risk/reward ratio for investors, with the company’s substantial backlog and the recent surge in rental demand, assuring healthy top-line growth. Technicals and Recent Performance AMT staged a turnaround this year following a grueling three-year period, and since the company’s fundamentals have been steadily improving over the past several years, the stock might have plenty of gas left in the tank. AMT is now trading in a well-established long-term bullish trend, well above its 200-day moving average, and after breaking out above the $235 level, bulls could, in the medium-term, have their sights on the stock’s all-time high from 2021. The stock recently formed a classic cup-and-handle pattern, confirming its trend reversal, which could provide technical tailwinds for the rest of the year. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM): A New Dawn for the IT Giant? Despite its pivotal role in establishing the modern tech industry, IBM has been dismissed as a perpetual laggard for over a decade, and for a good reason. Even though the company tried to reinvent itself multiple times, its bloated organizational structure, surging costs, sluggish growth, and low margins made it a tough choice as an investment. Over the past five years, IBM went through a real transformation under CEO Arvind Krishna, spinning off a significant portion of its low-margin legacy IT infrastructure business into Kyndryl Holdings (KD) to entirely focus on its hybrid-cloud-based software and consulting business. Since the spinoff, IBM has managed to enter a phase of organic growth. Although IBM hasn't solved all of its issues, the company’s recent track record in execution, cost management, and strategic decisions make it an attractive and cheap option in the tech space. The company's quickly improving financials, combined with its massive knowledge base and research and development prowess, give its shares significant upside potential. What's more, IBM’s growth has been greatly aided by its business-to-business (B2B) AI offerings, which could be one of the catalysts of the company's developing turnaround story. Software and Consulting Surge Fueled by Generative AI Adoption Why is IBM, of all companies, such a promising low-risk AI play? Well, IBM primarily serves business customers across multiple industries, providing essential productivity, communication, and analytics tools. One of generative AI’s most relevant use cases, at its current level, is customized “in-house” productivity solutions, which align perfectly with IBM’s expertise, especially given the company’s “hands-on” approach to its projects, which manifests in close long-term collaborations with its clients. The company recognized this synergy and was quick to implement a wide range of AI-driven software solutions, such as customized assistants, knowledge bases, and data-analytic tools, which were met by strong demand over the past couple of years. IBM’s strategic focus on its software and consulting segments resulted in steady top and bottom-line growth over the past years, and analysts expect continued mid-single-digit expansion in both areas. The company’s hybrid cloud platforms have been driving growth in its software segment, but AI adoption also led to an uptick in infrastructure revenues through an accelerated upgrade cycle. IBM’s latest software partnerships on cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and AI data solutions with industry leaders such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon’s (AMZN) AWS have increased its reach, and its stable B2B client base provides a great foundation for further cloud growth. IBM has been active on the acquisition front this year, making use of its improving financial position, and the market reacted well to the company's growth push, with its $6.4 billion HashiCorp deal making the biggest waves. The cloud automation company’s offerings fit well into IBM’s strategic vision, and its quick integration into the company's platforms shows that IBM is a different, more agile beast that can maintain its momentum. That said, IBM is still a laggard in the eyes of a slew of players in the industry, and the company has plenty of room to improve its brand, but IBM's new management seems to be on the right path. Financials and Valuation IBM's margins have been improving across the board since 2019, with the company's revenue hitting a five-year high over the past twelve months, with its operational costs flat over the same period. Since 2020, IBM’s operational costs are down by roughly 10%, which might not seem much, but given the size of IBM’s operations and the 100% increase in comparable sales, its margin impact is massive, and the company’s further cost-saving initiatives could lead to rapid improvements in the coming quarters. IBM’s latest quarters have been consistently stronger than analyst expectations, with its free cash flow of over $13 billion, in particular, turning heads, which vastly improved the company's financial position. IBM’s debt load of $53 billion remains higher-than-average compared to its competitors, but thanks to its improving profitability and steady growth, the company is unlikely to face financing issues, especially during the Fed’s easing cycle. In fact, IBM is now in a position to significantly reduce its debt burden or refinance it at lower rates in the coming years, with the company having enough resources to continue investing in growth while returning capital to investors. IBM offers a dividend yieldof 3% at its current price level, which will become more and more attractive as the Fed cuts interest rates in the coming quarters. Even though the consensus regarding IBM’s business is starting to shift, its stock still trades at a hefty discount compared to its peers, both based on current and future earnings, giving it massive upside potential for years to come. Technicals and Recent Performance IBM has been showing relative strength compared to the large-cap benchmarks and its closest peers since the summer of 2023, and the stock is currently “testing” the $200 level after hitting decade-long highs earlier this year. Currently, IBM offers a unique blend of low volatility and outperformance that could provide stability and above-average returns for years to come, with plenty of headroom once the stock clears its all-time high from 2013. IBM is trading in a strong bullish trend, above both its 50- and 200-day moving averages, and while up by over 20% on a year-to-date basis, the stock could enjoy technical tailwinds throughout the rest of the year, should it complete its technical breakout above $200. Spotify(SPOT): The Next Billion-User Tech Giant? Spotify is the undoubted global leader in the audio streaming market, controlling roughly one-third of the quickly growing segment. Spotify has over 625 million active users, up from 77 million in 2015 and 232 million in 2019, with the company registering continuous growth thanks to its dual freemium model, based on an ad-supported free tier and ad-free premium tiers. Spotify also boasts nearly 250 million paying subscribers. With the secular shift toward streaming in music consumption still in full swing, the company’s mid-term goal of reaching 1 billion users seems realistic. The company’s mobile app remains one of the fastest-growing apps globally, with the company having a strong presence in North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The Swedish company’s biggest market is still the U.S., despite strong competition from the likes of Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN), but its other geographies have been growing quicker than its established markets in recent years, transforming Spotify into a truly global powerhouse in audio streaming space. Spotify is often referred to as the Netflix (NFLX) of music, and for a good reason, as the company's audio offerings are comparable to Netflix’s video products, with a few caveats, which analogy will be crucial in understanding the company's huge potential and the strategic challenges it faces. Product and Pricing Innovation Fueling Growth Amid Owned -Content Push For nearly a decade, Netflix faced scrutiny over the viability of its business model due to its high royalty costs, expensive content strategy, and stiff competition across its key markets. However, the video streaming company showed that such a model could be successful in the long run with a strong brand, global presence, and aggressive growth strategy. That said, Spotify and other audio services generally pay higher royalty fees, and audio streaming services products tend to be more comprehensive but more homogeneous than video services, with less exclusive content. In theory, this makes switching between services less costly for customers, but Spotify has a few aces up its sleeve that have been helping it with these strategic weaknesses. Spotify, thanks to its high engagement levels, has a huge competitive advantage compared to its closest peers and even Netflix; according to research firm, Antenna, of all video and audio streaming services, Spotify’s customers are the least likely to cancel their subscriptions in the U.S. with a monthly cancellation rate of less than 2%. This explains that, despite the fierce competition, Spotify’s U.S. market share has steadily increased over the past three years, capturing market shares from big guns like Apple and Amazon, a feat deemed unlikely by many analysts. Spotify continues to be laser-focused on growing its user base of its core business globally while expanding its offerings and increasing the share of its owned-content portfolio. The company recently started offering audiobooks with promising initial results, with paid podcasts also being an important part of Spotify’s diversification push. These new products could broaden the company’s demographic reach beyond its traditional young adult audience, Spotify is offering its new products both individually and in bundles - which are being rolled out across its geographies - and the company’s bundling strategy could significantly boost its margins in the long run. Financials and Valuation Spotify proved its pricing power and user retention capability over the past couple of years amid a global surge in inflation, raising its prices two times in some regions, with its average price now above its major peers’ fees, such as Apple Music, in the U.S. Paying subscriber growth has been very strong in recent quarters, with its paid segment outperforming its ad-supported segment, despite its price hikes, and the company’s increasing global footprint means that its growth potential continues to be exceptional. Paid subscriptions comprise over 85% of Spotify’s total revenue, and should its owned-content strategy pan out, the path to becoming a “cash cow” would be clear, especially given the company's low churn rates. When it comes to evaluating Spotify’s financials, profitability is the elephant in the room, with some analysts doubting the company's ability to turn a sustained profit, as effectively monetizing its quickly growing user base could prove tricky. Furthermore, royalties make up the vast majority of the company’s costs, and since the royalty-holding studios are in a strong bargaining position, Spotify could face long-term margin pressures. At the same time, Spotify’s optimized subscriber plans and new monetization avenues have already boosted its profitability measures, leading to a surge in its share price. Spotify’s revenue neared $16 billion over the past twelve months, with its quarterly revenue growing by 20% on a year-over-year basis, despite the headwinds in the consumer sector. The company executed a significant cost- cutting program following its COVID-era boom, and its gross margin climbed back to nearly 30% in the second quarter of 2024, after dropping below 25% in 2022. Thanks to the past couple of years’ positive developments, the company’s financial position has improved significantly, with its FCF reaching $490 million and its cash hoard topping $5 billion in the second quarter of this year, which eclipses its total debt of $2 billion. Based on its current earnings, Spotify’s valuation is sky-high. Still, its recent momentum and its lofty long- term profit potential could easily justify its market cap of $60 billion, even considering substantial execution- and competition-related risks. Technicals and Recent Performance SPOT has been on a tear ever since the start of 2023, coinciding with the company’s cost-cutting push, and the stock is still trading in an explosive bullish trend. Despite its lofty year-to-date gains, the stock is only now nearing its all-time high from 2021, and a technical breakout could open a brand new chapter for SPOT in the coming months. As the company’s business continues to mature, the stock’s sky-high volatility is bound to decline, but SPOT is the riskiest of the Gorilla’s picks while having the most upside potential as well. Tradewed Markets(TW): Exceptional Growth in a Unique Market Even though Tradeweb (TW) is a lesser-known company, it has definitely made its mark in the institutional bond trading space, exploding into the scene with unique and modern solutions aiming to bring the market into the 21st century. Government bond and credit markets are still stuck in the past in a sense, with traditional deal-making methods holding up in the face of the retail trading markets' rapid electronification. That said, the secular trend of modernization is clear, and Tradeweb is in a prime position to benefit from it in the coming decade, which has been the company’s strategic focus since well before going public in 2019. Despite fierce competition in its markets, Tradeweb has been executing its growth-focused strategy - expanding into new products and geographies while increasing its market share - without hiccups. The company’s platform- based strategy makes it easy to expand into new product segments, and currently, Tradeweb is already offering trading, processing, and data services for over 50 products, making it the go-to provider for a slew of institutional investors. The company navigated the past couple of years’ bond turmoil in an exemplary fashion, sticking to its strategic plans and using the market’s weakness for “bolt-on” acquisitions, such as By now, Tradeweb provides services for over 2,500 clients primarily in North America, Europe, and Asia, including the vast majority of the top global asset managers and their clients, with its market share nearing 20% in its main electronic markets., and its reach is still growing in the professional space. Connecting Markets and Providing Synergies for A Wide Range of Clients Tradewed defines itself as an “operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities, and money markets,” which, in layman's terms, places it somewhere between an exchange and a brokerage, with the company serving institutional, wholesale, retail, and corporate clients. Tradeweb’s average daily trading volume was above $1.8 trillion in the second quarter, with double-digit growth across its U.S. credit, European credit, municipal growth, credit derivatives, and money markets offerings. Even though growth rates, such as Tradeweb’s, often lead to organizational issues and mismanagement of resources, the company’s growth is largely based on providing products previously unconnected to existing clients. For example, Tradeweb recently became the first electronic trading platform to connect repo (short-term borrowing for bond dealers) and IRS (interest rate swap) markets while expanding its data services based on real-world needs. Thanks to its product expansion, the company’s addressable market has been growing by over 10% over the past five years, but its sales are up by an annualized 20% in the same period, highlighting its increased market share and organic growth potential. The company's latest acquisitions reflect its client-first approach and its goal to target new clients. Earlier this year, Tradeweb bought Institutional Cash Distributors, an investment technology provider focusing on corporate clients trading short-term Treasury-related investments, for $785 million to open a whole new client channel leveraging its existing infrastructure. Last year, through its acquisition of r8fin, Tradeweb dipped its toes into algorithmic trading while entering the Australian and New Zealand fixed- income markets via the $80 million Yieldbroker deal. Financials and Valuation Tradeweb aims to be a disruptor in its business while maintaining a lean corporate structure, which is no easy feat, but the company's low cost and debt levels suggest that it has efficiently dealt with its double-digit growth rate. Looking at its last quarter, its revenue and earnings were up by 30% and 35%, respectively, with Tradeweb’s profits topping $400 million while its sales surpassing $1.5 billion over the past twelve months. The company’s revenue roughly doubled since 2021, with its earnings growing even more. Tradeweb’s rates and credit segments provide the bulk, roughly two-thirds of its sales. However, its money market and market data businesses are also increasing organically and through its acquisitions. Despite its stellar growth and the seasonal nature of its business, the company’s financials have been steady, with Tradeweb successfully harnessing economies of scale while integrating its acquisitions. Looking at just its current P/E ratio of over 50, Tradeweb might seem expensive, but the company’s growth outlook is unparalleled in its industry, with the consensus calling for a yearly earning growth rate north of 15% for the next five years. Tradeweb has over $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, providing ample liquidity and funds for further expansion, and the company has been returning capital to investors ever since its IPO, both through dividends and stock repurchases. TW is operating with very low debt, and although growth always has its risks, the stock’s valuations seem reasonable, and its relatively low institutional ownership suggests that demand for its shares could remain strong for years to come, especially since TW is not yet part of any major index. Technicals and Recent Performance Tradeweb’s great execution is reflected in its shares’ performance and the company’s valuation, with TW being up nearly 300% since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2019 while also registering a gain of over 100% since its 2022 trough. TW hit a new all-time high in February, eclipsing its COVID-era spike, and after consolidating its technical breakout, the stock continued its march to new highs during the summer. TW is trading in a bullish long-term trend, with plenty of technical “support” below, and given the company's expansion, this year's breakout could be the start of a multi-year bull run, while easing financial conditions could provide additional tailwinds for the stock. Uber(UBER): Global Innovation and Growth Powerhouse Uber is the leader in the global app-based ride-hailing market, both in the U.S. and globally, while being a major player in food and grocery delivery as well through its Uber Eats brand. Uber’s core business is sporting a monthly active user base of 150 million, with the company’s ever-growing platform boasting a global user pool of well over 500 million. Uber emerged as a poster child of the “new economy” over the past decade, despite its controversies, emerging from the “unicorn” status as a sustainably profitable but still growth-focused tech company. Throughout its 15-year history, the company has had its fair share of legal scrutiny, but Uber has been successfully navigating the legal minefield, always maintaining its focus on relentless growth. Uber carved out significant market shares in multiple markets and geographies, taking full advantage of its platform, with innovative pricing models and aggressive cost management strategies aiding its expansion, and Uber’s revenues crossed $40 billion for the first time over the past twelve months, with its market capitalization breaching $150 billion. The Gorilla believes that Uber's growth story is far from over, and as an investment, it entered a new phase of its life cycle this year, as the company reached stable profitability while maintaining its growth potential. Uber might now be ready to join the “big guns” of the tech sector. Although Uber’s markets aren't considered highly interest-rate- sensitive, the company's stock has been showing as strong a correlation with yields as the real estate and utilities sectors over the past few years. With all that in mind, Uber is in a unique position to benefit from the Fed’s easing cycle, while transitioning from a low-margin growth powerhouse to a more mature but still agile tech giant. Network Effects Drive Strategic Strength Even though Uber faces stiff competition in its core markets while eyeing already competitive new opportunities, its personalized, flexible, and dynamic pricing practices give it a clear edge over its traditional competitors, with its closest peers also being forced to adapt to the company’s strategies. Uber has a history of executing bold expansion strategies, with a clear focus on achieving dominance in its markets to harvest network effects and platform synergies. Be it its ride-hailing or delivery segments, Uber managed to disrupt established markets, and with 85% of its major markets being already profitable and its margins improving in the vast majority of its geographies, it’s hard to question its strategic vision. Uber One, the company’s membership program, is a great example of its focus on aggressive growth, and the fact that in just over two years, the service reached a 50% share of gross delivery bookings underlines the company’s great execution. Uber One has already contributed to consumer retention, gross booking growth, and cross-selling across its segments while maintaining its competitive advantage and pricing strength and providing an easy path to enter new niches. Uber’s platform allows the company to rapidly deploy and test new offerings at a low cost while offering its strategic partners easy access to a massive pool of potential clients, which could remain a strong growth driver. According to a slew of analysts, autonomous vehicles or robotaxis are considered a major threat to Uber’s ride-hailing business in the long run. However, given its market penetration, strategic advantages, and platform strength, the company might even benefit from the technological shift. Uber is well aware of the looming revolution and, through expanding its portfolio and forming strategic partnerships, such as its Waymo deal, the company is actively managing the robotaxi risk, which likely won’t impact its business in a meaningful way until at least the 2030s. Financials and Valuation In its early years, profitability was Uber’s achilles heel, but since 2018, the company’s revenue is up by a whopping 300%, and doubts about the company’s ability to turn sustained profits diminished in recent years. Uber not only delivered consistent growth despite the challenges of the past five years, but it also outperformed its peers both in the U.S. and globally. Year- over-year booking and revenue growth were roughly 20% and 15%, respectively, in the second quarter, despite a slowdown in the consumer economy, with its Mobility and Delivery segments fueling growth. Even though its shift toward subscription-based pricing led to a slight drop in delivery margins, the company continues to lead the market in profitability while keeping up with its main competitor, DoorDash, in pure growth metrics. Uber has also been expanding its offerings while improving network density and expanding into retail fulfillment, and the segment now accounts for 50% of its bookings. The company’s strong brand recognition and increased offerings helped maintain the inflow of new customers, which has been one of the main catalysts behind UBER’s strong performance over the past couple of years. Although the company’s debt load is still substantial, Uber’s swift expansion, improving margins, and other profitability metrics led to a sharp drop in its financing costs, which, together with the global rate-cut cycle, is expected to have an outsized effect on the growth-focused company’s bottom line and its balance sheet. This positive shift is yet to be fully priced in by the market, and even though its current valuation is rich from a simple P/E perspective, its post-COVID growth rate and its financing costs -which allow for further expansion - make its shares fundamentally attractive here. Technicals and Recent Performance Since its IPO in 2019, UBER had multiple volatile swings, with the twin crises of the past four years leading to quite the roller-coaster ride for its investors. That said, 2023 saw a clear shift in the stock’s market value, with the company’s surging profitability fueling a bullish trend and an eventual breakout to new all-time highs. UBER’s relative strength compared to its closest peers suggests that this technical breakout was just the start of a multi-year bull run, and its exceptional growth potential could finally translate to great sustained returns for its investors. UBER is in a great position to ride the next wave higher in the bull market, and its 2021 high provides ample technical support, meaning that the stock is at a low-risk- high-reward entry point. Conclusion Even though the media always likes to paint a picture of an imminent crisis to grab people's attention, the “boring” truth is that we are in a secular bull market with plenty of room to run following a hectic start to the 2020s. Investors, understandably so, remain cautious and exit their positions at the first sign of trouble, which explains August’s historic surge in volatility - one of the Volatility Index’s (VIX) most violent ones in its 30-year history - which lasted for a mere three days. Folks, bull markets generally last way longer than anyone dares to predict, so it’s important to keep your eyes on the target: increasing your capital by investing in strong businesses. The current bull easily survived the recent surge in inflation, the Fed’s painful cure, the escalation in the Middle East, and the rising tensions between the West and the Global South, and there is still no crisis in sight that could derail the secular trend. This means that violent pullbacks such as the one we experienced this past August, however scary they are, should be viewed as buying opportunities, as they usually set the stage for the next swing higher. That said, we are entering a new phase of the bull market, with easing monetary conditions and a transition to a maturing economic cycle. Like at the start of the inflationary crisis and near the end of the Fed’s tightening cycle, a new crop of stocks will have an advantage over the prior leaders due to the changing financing and economic backdrop. Taking advantage of this “rotation” could be the key to beating the market and elevating your investments to the next level. This doesn't mean that you should completely overhaul your portfolio, in fact, sticking to your guns during bull markets usually pays off, but changing conditions will lead to new opportunities. That's where the Gorilla’s hand- picked picks come in, offering different levels of risk and upside potential. Early- and late-stage disruptors, a dominant real estate giant, and a potential turnaround star give you plenty of options, with all companies being well- positioned to benefit from the ongoing macroeconomic and monetary shifts moving toward the elections. With fundamentals and technicals looking bullish again following a frustrating summer, these stocks could greatly boost to your portfolio!

More Info Last weekend, we warned readers that according to the latest data from Goldman Sachs, a massive short squeeze in energy stocks was on deck. Specifically we noted that at a time when funds were the most short oil on record, the broader energy space "was the most net sold sector" on the Goldman US Prime book, "driven entirely by short sales, which outpaced long buys (6.4 to 1)." And here, we said, was "the hint to the next mega squeeze" as the recent short selling in energy was the largest in over 5 years. Last weekend, we warned readers that according to the latest data from Goldman Sachs, a massive short squeeze in energy stocks was on deck. Specifically we noted that at a time when funds were the most short oil on record, the broader energy space "was the most net sold sector" on the Goldman US Prime book, "driven entirely by short sales, which outpaced long buys (6.4 to 1)." And here, we said, was "the hint to the next mega squeeze" as the recent short selling in energy was the largest in over 5 years. What happened next was for the history books, as Brent crude soared the most in almost two years on the back of what was a historic market imbalance with record shorts suddenly starting to run for cover... ... with the Kamala lackeys at Bloomberg going so far as to mock those who actually did the right thing and trade ahead of the inevitable squeeze as "tourists", when in reality the only tourists here are those who expected the ridiculous plunge in oil prices to persist despite Cushing approaching tank bottoms (Bloomberg's message is loud and clear: keep shorting oil unless you want to be branded a "tourist", especially since a spike in oil - and gas - prices may adversely impact its favorite presidential candidate). Unfortunately for Bloomberg, the squeeze in energy is just getting started, and not just due to fundamentals. Crude oil soared last week as a result of the rapidly deteriorating situation in the middle east. On Tuesday, spot month WTI and Brent rallied >5% from the lows on the initial headlines from the White House that an Iranian attack was imminent. Goldman's research desk noted on Tuesday that the jump in oil prices reflected a moderate risk premium as actual production disruptions have been limited and spare capacity remains elevated. The energy complex jumped again Thursday on news that the US was considering whether or not to support Israel’s potential retaliatory attacks against Iranian energy infrastructure. Then, over the weekend, the bank's commodity analysts published a new report (available to pro subs) in which they tried to calculate the impact on the price of oil should Iran oil output be "limited" by Israel, to wit: But it's not just fundamentals: Goldman's Prime Brokerage wrote in its latest weekly must-read note (also available to pro subs) that "after heightened geopolitical tensions and rising crude oil price, HFs reversed course and net bought US Energy stocks for the first time in 7 weeks, driven almost entirely by short covers." As a result, the US Energy long/short ratio increased +5% – the largest weekly increase in nearly 5 months – to 1.36, which is in the 69th percentile vs. the past year and 14th percentile vs. the past five years." That said, the short overhang in energy remains staggering, and hints at a far more brutal unwind once the upward momentum persists for another week, and not only in energy stocks where the short flow on Goldman's Prime Broekrage is just shy of record highs... ... but also in the oil patch, because after oil short interest hit a record two weeks ago as traders turned the most bearish on oil they have ever been, the amount of short covering was virtually non existent, and net managed-money (i.e., hedge fund) exposure across the 4 main oil contracts (Nymex and ICE WTI, Nymex and ICE Brent), is barely above its record lows! Putting it all together, Goldman Energy specialist Ryan Novak writes that "energy led to the upside on the week after we exited the prior week with aggressive PB selling/short selling that flipped this week, managed money positioning remains short - at all-time lows and tensions across the Middle East escalating with Israel beginning its ground invasion. E&Ps led on the week +7%. All eyes on any incremental news regarding any attack on Iranian energy infrastructure which would pose further upside risk to the commodity and equities." Bottom line: with record shorts now painfully squeezed as upward momentum has been ignited across the energy sector, and the risk of a flashing red headline that Israel has leveled Kharg Island looming, unwind of what until a week ago was a record short position in oil and energy stocks is just getting started. And that's without Israel even doing anything. Should Israel however take the plunge and either take out Iran's oil infrastructure or, worse, target its nuclear industry, then the coming explosion in oil will make the Volkswagen short squeeze of 2008 seem like quaint amateur hour.

Title: Layer raises $6M to make incorruptible foundations of the internet
URL: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/10/07/2959037/0/en/Layer-raises-6M-to-make-incorruptible-foundations-of-the-internet.html

October 07, 2024 10:00 ET | Source: Layer Layer New York, Oct. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A well-functioning internet is something we get to take for granted, thanks to the built-in security protocols carefully designed underneath. Without them, no data could be securely transferred from place to place at the incredible speed required to support the tech industry’s biggest products. Today, the existing security protocols are struggling to protect users from even bigger threats, specifically the threats posed by large companies, cyberattackers, and AI that manipulate our online experience and erode trust. Blockchain technologies, like smart contracts, are a real hope to restore trust in the internet. However, smart contracts can only use a small amount of compute, putting limits on what they can support. To build great user experiences on a trustworthy Decentralized Web, we need a way to verify computations outside of blockchains, and make unstoppable applications that, once released, cannot be tampered with. Recently founded startup Layer aims to extend the functionality of Ethereum by making the first developer tools that support full-stack decentralized applications with Web Assembly. The company has raised a $6M seed round led by 1kx, with participation from Fabric Ventures, Arrington Capital, Stake Capital Group, and IOBC. Notable angels include Sreeram Kannan of EigenLayer, Rok Kopp and Mike Silagadze of Ether.fi, and Paul Taylor, formerly of BlackRock. Layer founders: (L to R) Sam Cassatt, Jake Hartnell and Ethan Frey Typically, smart contracts are small programs, specially packaged to be run by trustworthy “validators” on the blockchain. However, to power major software products, like web platforms, smartphone apps, and AI models, smart contracts would need to run thousands of lines of software at speeds you would find on a personal device or datacenter server. While many teams are optimizing the performance of blockchains like Ethereum, smart contracts alone are not capable of meeting the high computational demand of many applications. Layer utilizes Web Assembly, which allows developers to write applications in languages like rust, that can run anywhere – even on your iPhone. Layer’s upcoming product, the “Layer SDK”, will allow developers to build new layers on top of Ethereum that run full-stack blockchain-based applications consisting of smart contracts, consensus mechanisms, UI, and verifiable off-chain services (AI agents, ZK provers, serverless functions, decentralized messaging servers, and more). This means, for the first time, a software developer can launch sovereign, incorruptible versions of their software products without any sacrifice to the user experience. The founders, Sam Cassatt, Jake Hartnell, and Ethan Frey are three of the most seasoned builders in the blockchain space. Their combined experience has been instrumental in the proliferation of blockchain technologies like MetaMask wallets, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and cross-chain protocols. By making the decision to band together, the founding team hopes to use all the lessons they have learned in blockchain to fulfill one of its biggest promises – to make all experiences on the internet inherently trustworthy, from the UI down to the functionality, through the shared security mechanisms of smart contracts. “All three of us have realized that, while smart contracts have given us a foundational layer of trust, they aren’t enough to support a full decentralized version of the Internet,” Sam Cassatt, Co-Founder of Layer explains. “We wanted to complete the full narrative arc of decentralized architecture, and give the world the tools necessary to build any application, with any performance requirements in this trust-minimized way.” They predict this original ideal, espoused by blockchain’s true believers, will soon be seen as an essential solution to existential threats in our digital world. According to Sam, Jake, and Ethan, the only way to verify the software and data you interact with online has not been manipulated by its creator, its host, a cybercriminal, an AI model, the government, or any other powerful actor would be with a protocol that guarantees trust. “We are thrilled to back Jake, Sam, and Ethan on their mission to build out the next generation of blockchain infrastructure.” says Wei Dai, Research Partner at 1kx, “Traditional smart contract platforms rely on replicated execution which limits scalability. Layer’s platform and SDK offer the best-in-class scalability, programmability, and configurability for shared-security applications.” Richard Muirhead, Managing Partner, Fabric Ventures commented: “We at fabric have long been excited to back teams expanding the boundaries of what is possible in crypto and Lay3r are doing exactly that. By defining a new category of shared economic security that spans hybrid off-chain and on-chain worlds, we believe Lay3r can be a Schelling point for new teams looking to build applications taking advantage of these core primitives.” - The team believes tools like Layer SDK will be the key to mitigating these incredible threats, and make the Decentralized Web the dominant web, complete with all the exciting products the founders have helped to pioneer in blockchain over the last 14 years.

Title: Heliene Partners With Transition Equity Partners to Expand Domestic Solar Manufacturing Capacity

October 07, 2024 08:00 ET | Source: Heliene, Inc.; Transition Equity Partners Heliene, Inc.; Transition Equity Partners MOUNTAIN IRON, Minn., Oct. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Heliene Inc., a leading North American solar PV module manufacturer, is pleased to announce closing a strategic equity investment up to $54 million from Transition Equity Partners (“TEP”) in collaboration with a consortium of limited partners, including affiliates of Hamilton Lane. The investment will support the expansion of Heliene’s industry-leading operations, which have served the North American solar market through multiple market cycles over the past 14 years, making Heliene one of the longest tenured solar manufacturers in North America. This strategic investment from TEP follows the $170M in capital that Heliene raised in 2023 from Orion Infrastructure Capital (OIC) and several of Heliene’s key customers. This capital infusion will support the development of a new 550MW production line in Rogers, MN, and the creation of 150+ new full time jobs at the facility. Heliene’s MN #3 manufacturing line will boost the company’s total U.S. based manufacturing capacity to ~1.5GW per year. Heliene has industry leading partners underpinning this expansion, including a 2.0GW supply agreement with Excelsior Energy Capital and 1.5GW supply agreement with Nexamp, touted by U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm as an investment that would “boost American manufacturing and create American jobs, while lowering families’ energy bills.” By leveraging the Inflation Reduction Act, Heliene is set to capitalize on the 45X production tax credit, whilst Heliene’s customers can unlock significant incremental value through the Domestic Content Adder (DCA). This creates strong tailwinds for Heliene, while offering its customers a decisive competitive edge in the renewable energy market. Heliene has leveraged the IRA to build a leading domestic solar supply chain, partnering with Suniva for U.S. made solar cells starting in Q3 2024, SOLARCYCLE for US made solar glass, OMCO Solar as a domestically produced racking partner, Premier Energies to pursue a cell manufacturing JV and NorSun for domestic wafer production among other initiatives to expand the United States solar supply chain and energy security. Martin Pochtaruk, CEO of Heliene, stated “This investment from Transition Equity Partners is a key milestone in Heliene’s growth journey. It empowers us to expand our capacity to deliver high-quality, bankable, domestically produced solar modules that power the clean energy transition. We are proud to play a pivotal role in strengthening North America’s renewable energy supply chain and contributing to the global energy transition.” TEP believes Heliene’s proven track record and strategic positioning make them particularly compelling among US solar companies. Michael Allison, Partner at TEP, commented: “Heliene’s operational excellence and strong market position, combined with the support of the Inflation Reduction Act, make this a rare opportunity to invest in U.S. solar manufacturing at an attractive entry point. Our investment reflects our confidence in Heliene’s leadership and its growth potential as the demand for clean energy continues to surge." Stifel served as exclusive financial advisor to Heliene in connection with the entire transaction. ABOUT HELIENE Heliene, Inc. is one of North America’s fastest-growing domestic module manufacturers serving the utility-scale, commercial, and residential markets. With an in-house logistics team and remarkably responsive support staff, Heliene delivers competitively priced, high performance solar modules precisely when and where customers need them to accelerate North America’s clean energy transition.

Title: Webscale Network Operators: 2Q24 Market Review - Outlook, Analysis, Key Stats, Company Drilldown, Top 8 WNOs, Company Benchmarking, Regional Breakouts

Full Content:
October 07, 2024 06:51 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Oct. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Webscale Network Operators: 2Q24 Market Review" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. This report reviews the growth and development of the webscale network operator (WNO, or webscale) market since 2011. It covers 21 companies. In the most recent 12 months (3Q23-2Q24), webscalers represented $2.47 trillion (T) in revenues (+8.2% YoY), $301 billion (B) in R&D spending (+5.4% YoY), and $226B in capex (+15.4% YoY). They had $612B of cash and short-term investments (-8.5% YoY) on the books as of June 2024, and $527B in total debt (-3.6% YoY). The value of webscalers' net plant, property & equipment (net PP&E) on the books as of June 2024 was $787B, up 19.8% YoY. Webscalers employed approximately 4.182 million (M) people at the end of 2Q24, up a bit from the June 2023 total of 4.085M. Below are key highlights from the report: Revenues: Single quarter revenues in 2Q24 were $614.4 billion (B), up 8.4% YoY. That pushed annualized revenues to $2.466 trillion. Topline growth has been driven by the big 4: Alphabet, Amazon, Meta (FB) and Microsoft. For four straight quarters, all of these companies have recorded double digit revenue growth, well above the rest of the pack. For the 2Q24 annualized period, the fastest growth came from Meta, up 24.3% versus 3Q22-2Q23, followed by Microsoft (+15.7%), Alphabet (13.4%), and Amazon (12.3%). The biggest dollar impact on growth in 2Q24 came from Amazon, as its revenues grew $13.6 billion from 2Q23 to end 2Q24 at $148B, up 10.1% YoY. The biggest curb on growth was Chinese ecommerce player JD.com, which recorded 2Q24 revenues of $40.2B, down $0.8B YoY (-2.0%). Capex: After declining 5% in 2023, webscale capex has been on a tear for the first two quarters of 2024, growing 25% and 51% in 1Q24 and 2Q24 respectively. That pushed 2Q24 annualized capex to $226.4 billion in 2Q24, an all-time high and up 15.4% YoY. Webscalers continue with big land purchases and long-term efforts to develop all-new data center campuses. However, the surge appears to be driven largely by technology spending, in particular purchases of servers (GPU and CPU) for data center facilities already up and running. From 44% of annualized capex in 2Q22, Network/IT and software capex was 54% of total capex for the last two quarters. The biggest capex outlays in 2Q24 came from Amazon ($17.6B), Microsoft ($13.9B), Alphabet ($13.2B), and Meta (FB) ($8.2B). These four account for about 80% of single quarter spending. They are the reason behind the unsustainable surge in the price of NVIDIA stock. Profitability: Webscale free cash flow margins averaged out to 18.6% for the 2Q24 annualized period, much higher than the 16.3% and 14.4% recorded in the annualized 2Q23 and 2Q22 timeframes. Average net profit margins are also strong, totaling 18.8% for the overall market in 2Q24 annualized, from 15.2% in 2Q23 and 16.3% in 2Q22. Meta (FB) and Microsoft have the highest overall margins across these two categories. Amazon is a perpetual drag on margins despite its size. Alibaba and Alphabet both reported FCF figures substantially lower than 2Q23, impacting the market average negatively. Employees: Headcount in the webscale market totaled to 4.18 million in June 2024, slightly up from 4.08 million in June 2023. This difference is negligible, considering the size of some of the webscalers and how quickly the ecommerce specialists in particular can change workforce levels. Headcount has been approximately 4.1 to 4.2 million steadily since late 2021. Some of the biggest webscalers are investing heavily in AI and GenAI, with one clear goal being to improve their internal cost efficiencies. This inevitably will mean fewer employees. Even within the ecommerce space, there is a rising use of robots and autonomous vehicles in the logistics chain. Webscale employment is unlikely to rise much from here, if at all. Regional trends: The Asia-Pacific region has been a drag on the market for several quarters. Webscale revenues in the Americas, Europe, and MEA have been growing in the low double digit range for a few quarters, but AP has been weak: 2Q24 revenue growth was 3% YoY, after a 2% increase in 1Q24. Weak Asian currencies and a very competitive 'big tech' market in China account for the gap. One factor is TikTok's owner, ByteDance: this private company has exploded in the last 3 years, impacting negatively the measured growth of the publicly traded Chinese webscalers that we do track (Alibaba, Baidu, JD, and Tencent). The ByteDance surge also ate into the 2022-23 growth of some western webscalers, notably Meta (FB), but that effect has ebbed.

Title: Wall Street futures slip as markets reprice rate path ahead of busy week

By Sinéad Carew and Lisa Pauline Mattackal (Reuters) -Wall Street's three major indexes closed down around 1% on Monday while Treasury yields rose, as traders tamped down bets for Federal Reserve interest-rate easing and worried about the Middle East conflict's impact on oil prices. While waiting for quarterly earnings season and fresh economic data, investors also braced for another big hurricane, Milton, which is expected to hit the United States this week. Relief efforts are under way after Helene, a Category-4 hurricane, killed more than 200 people across six states. Further dampening sentiment on Monday was an order from a U.S. judge for market heavyweight Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google to overhaul its mobile-app business to give Android phone users more options. Analyst reports also spurred selling of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). After Friday's stronger-than-expected jobs report, traders pulled back from bets for a 50-basis-point rate cut in November. They were pricing in an 86% chance of a 25-basis-point cut and a roughly 14% chance the central bank would not cut rates at all, according to the CME's FedWatch tool. The change in rate-cut expectations caused U.S. Treasury yields to rally, with the yield on benchmark 10-year notes exceeding 4% for the first time in two months. Besides next month's Fed meeting, investors are waiting for the Consumer Price Index inflation reading for September and the kickoff of third-quarter earnings season with reports from banks, both due this week. "It's a combination of things over the last couple of days: the jobs report, the hurricane damage, the elevated energy prices and negative comments about some of the large-cap tech names," said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. "All of that combined just makes for a nervous day, and the Google headlines tipped things over to more aggressive selling in the last hour." James pointed to the Middle East conflict as a concern for U.S. investors who are worried about the war's economic impact, including rising oil prices. Investors continue to fret about how Israel would respond to Iran's missile strikes. On Monday, Lebanon's armed group Hezbollah fired rockets at Israel's city of Haifa while Israeli forces looked poised to expand ground raids into south Lebanon. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 398.51 points, or 0.94%, to 41,954.24, the S&P 500 lost 55.13 points, or 0.96%, to 5,695.94 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 213.94 points, or 1.18%, to 17,923.90. The CBOE Volatility index, Wall Street's fear gauge, closed up 3.4 points at 22.64, marking its biggest one-day points gain in more than a month and its highest closing level since Aug. 8. Among the S&P 500's 11 major industry indexes, only energy advanced, finishing up 0.4%. U.S. crude futures settled up 3.7% in their fifth-straight advance on concerns about Middle East supply disruptions. [O/R] The biggest industry laggard was utilities, down 2.3%, followed by communications services, which was under pressure from Alphabet's 2.5% drop. The benchmark S&P 500's biggest drag from a single stock was from Apple, after Jefferies assumed coverage with a "hold" rating, sending the stock down 2.3%. Amazon.com finished down 3% after a Wells Fargo downgrade. Among the benchmark's biggest gainers was Generac Holdings (NYSE:GNRC), which added 8.52% as investors bet on solid demand for backup power generators because of the pending hurricane. Shares of Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) rose 2% after a report that activist investor Starboard Value has taken a roughly $1-billion stake in the drugmaker. Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD) closed up 9.5% on a report that activist hedge fund Mantle Ridge has built a position in the company. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.73-to-1 ratio on the NYSE where there were 222 new highs and 55 new lows. On the Nasdaq, 1,292 stocks rose and 2,988 fell as declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.31-to-1 ratio. The S&P 500 posted 34 new 52-week highs and two new lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 83 new highs and 118 new lows. On U.S. exchanges, 11.39 billion shares changed hands compared with the 12.06-billion average for the last 20 sessions.

Title: Rocket Lab to study Mars sample retrieval for NASA

LONG BEACH, Calif. - Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB), a space systems company, has been selected by NASA to conduct a study for the Mars Sample Return Program, aiming to bring Martian rock samples back to Earth. This mission, if realized, would mark the first time in history that materials from Mars are retrieved for analysis, potentially advancing our understanding of the planet and the possibility of past life on its surface. The study is part of NASA's Rapid Mission Design Studies for Mars Sample Return, which seeks proposals for mission designs that can transport samples collected by the Mars Perseverance rover back to Earth. Rocket Lab's proposal suggests a simplified, cost-effective mission concept that could be executed significantly earlier and at a lower cost than the current projected sample return date in 2040. Rocket Lab founder and CEO Sir Peter Beck emphasized the company's track record in delivering cost-efficient planetary science missions. Beck stated, "We've developed an innovative mission concept to make it happen affordably and on an accelerated schedule." He highlighted Rocket Lab's experience, including delivering missions to the Moon, enabling orbital rendezvous, re-entering capsules from orbit, and contributing to NASA's Mars missions. The specifics of Rocket Lab's proposed mission architecture will be disclosed upon completion of the study in the upcoming months. Rocket Lab, founded in 2006, is recognized for its launch services, satellite manufacturing, spacecraft components, and on-orbit management solutions. The company has successfully launched 197 satellites to orbit since its first orbital launch in January 2018 and is currently developing a larger launch vehicle, Neutron, for constellation deployment. This press release contains forward-looking statements, and the final outcome of the study and any subsequent missions will depend on various factors, including technological developments and budgetary considerations. The information in this article is based on a press release statement. In other recent news, aerospace company Rocket Lab USA has been the subject of significant developments. KeyBanc analyst has increased the price target for Rocket Lab shares to $11.00 from the previous $8.00, maintaining an Overweight rating. This adjustment follows a roadshow with the company's CFO, Adam Spice, and reflects confidence in Rocket Lab's potential to expand its operations and its continued growth trajectory. Rocket Lab reported a substantial increase in Q2 revenue, hitting $106 million, primarily due to the success of its Electron rocket. However, Q3 revenue is projected to decrease slightly, estimated between $100 million and $105 million. The company also completed testing and integration of its second Pioneer spacecraft for Varda Space Industries, Inc., marking a significant advancement in in-space manufacturing and logistics. Rocket Lab also announced key personnel changes, appointing Frank Klein as its new Chief Operations Officer and adding Kenneth Possenriede, a former Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) executive, to its Board of Directors.

Title: US stock futures lower; CPI and earnings ahead this week - what's moving markets

Investing.com -- US stock futures edge lower following a Friday spike on Wall Street that was fueled by a strong jobs report. Markets are now gearing up for fresh inflation data which could provide more clarity on the path ahead for Federal Reserve interest rate policy in the coming months. Elsewhere, global miner Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) confirms a takeover bid for US-based Arcadium Lithium . 1. Futures lower US stock futures pointed lower on Monday following a rally in the prior session sparked by a bumper September employment report. By 03:28 ET (07:28 GMT), the Dow futures contract had shed 89 points or 0.2%, S&P 500 futures had fallen by 13 points or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had dipped by 46 points or 0.2%. On Friday, the main averages on Wall Street jumped after Labor Department figures showed that the US economy added far more jobs than anticipated last month. The numbers bolstered hopes that the the world's largest economy was on solid footing heading into the fourth quarter. Although the reading dented projections that the Federal Reserve would roll out another jumbo 50-basis point interest rate reduction at its final meetings this year, it served to boost the idea that the central bank was on course to achieve a so-called "soft landing" -- a scenario in which elevated inflation is successfully quelled without a igniting a wider downturn in the economy or jobs market. The 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a record closing high, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite added 1.2% and the benchmark S&P 500 grew by 51 points or 0.9%. The increases also helped the major indices eke out a fourth consecutive positive week. 2. Data, earnings ahead this week Investors will have more economic data to pour over this week, as well as a raft of new quarterly corporate earnings. Thursday’s consumer price index (CPI) data for September is expected to show that price pressures continued to moderate at the end of the third quarter. The data, coming on the heels of Friday’s robust jobs report is likely to shape expectations around the size and pace of Fed rate cuts in the coming months. Producer price inflation data on Friday is also expected to point to tamer inflationary pressures. “CPI for September will be a key data release. If prices rise faster than expected on top of the stronger labor data, chances for the Fed to skip the November meeting will increase,” analysts at UBS said in a recent note. Meanwhile, US third-quarter earnings season is about to kick into gear, in what will be a test for a stock market near record highs and trading at lofty valuations. Major financial firms -- including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) -- are all due to report on Friday. 3. Rio Tinto confirms approach to acquire Arcadium Lithium Mining giant Rio Tinto (LON:RIO) has made an approach to purchase lithium producer Arcadium Lithium (NYSE:ALTM), the companies announced in separate statements on Monday. Both groups said the approach was "non-binding," adding that they would divulge more about a potential deal when they had "news to share." Should it be completed, the agreement would make Rio Tinto one of the world's biggest producers of lithium, the ultralight metal essential in powering electric vehicle batteries and power storage. Prior to the announcement, media reports had speculated that Rio may pursue a bid following months of slumping lithium prices due in part to oversupply in China and weaker EV demand. No financial details were provided, but Arcadium Lithium has a market capitalization of around $3.3 billion. Shares in the Philadelphia-based firm surged by more than 24% in premarket trading. Reuters previously reported the discussions on Friday, saying that Arcadium could be valued at between $4 billion to $6 billion or higher. 4. Activist investor Starboard Value takes stake in Pfizer - WSJ Activist investor Starboard Value has taken a stake in Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) worth around $1 billion as part of a bid to overhaul the pharmaceutical company, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. Starboard has approached two former Pfizer executives -- ex-CEO Ian Read and ex-CFO Frank D'Amelio -- to help in the process, the paper added, citing people familiar with the matter. The report comes as Pfizer's leadership team is facing growing calls to turn around its recently flagging performance. The drugmaker was a key COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer during the pandemic, but it has struggled to plug a subsequent sales gap as the health crisis has abated. In late-2023, Pfizer issued a revenue warning and a disappointing 2024 outlook, along with a $3.5 billion cost-cutting drive. Shares in Pfizer, which are now trading below pre-pandemic levels, were higher in premarket dealmaking following the report. 5. Oil jumps Oil prices jumped on Monday following hefty gains posted in the previous week, as traders eye ongoing tensions in the Middle East. By 03:28 ET, the Brent contract had risen by 0.5% to $78.47 per barrel, while U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.8% higher at $74.94 a barrel. Oil prices last week recorded their biggest weekly gains in over a year on the mounting threat of a region-wide war in the Middle East. Israel has sworn to strike Iran for launching a barrage of missiles at the country in retaliation for the assassination of the leader of Tehran-backed Hezbollah.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in Ford securities. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan and is captioned Guzman v. Ford Motor Company, et al., No. 24-cv-12080. What is the Lawsuit About? Ford is an automotive manufacturing company that develops, delivers, and services a range of trucks, cars, and luxury vehicles worldwide. The complaint alleges that during the relevant period, the company misrepresented its warranty reserves and that it had completed a sequence of organizational changes designed to ensure higher quality and lower costs. In truth, Ford was experiencing higher warranty costs, and the warranty reserves did not accurately reflect the quality issues in its vehicles. On July 24, 2024, after the market closed, Ford announced second quarter 2024 financial results (the “2Q24 Press Release”). The 2Q24 Press Release revealed that the Company’s “[p]rofitability was affected by an increase in warranty reserves” and “higher warranty costs.” It was reported that, in the second quarter, Ford’s warranty and recall costs totaled $2.3 billion, $800 million more than the first quarter and $700 million more than a year ago. This news caused the price of Ford’s stock to decline by $2.51 per share, or over 18%, to close at $11.16 per share on July 25, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/ford-motor-company.

Good morning. On this day 22 years ago, a company named Palm introduced a mobile device called Zire, a $99 attempt to woo regular people—consumers—into using handheld computers, then called personal digital assistants. Two decades later, handheld computers are ubiquitous, and personal assistants are, shall we say, a bit more AI-flavored than they used to be. But $99? Friend, those days are long gone. —Andrew Nusca Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here. There is not a video game company on earth that hasn’t had a tough time of it in the last two years as the passage of time eroded pandemic gains. But Ubisoft has had it tougher than most. The market value of the French maker of Assassin’s Creed has been steadily declining since it peaked in 2021. At Ubisoft’s height, you needed the equivalent of $20 to purchase a share on the Paris stock exchange; lately, you needed just $2. Ouch. So it comes as no surprise that Tencent and Ubisoft’s founding Guillemot family, which both retain minority stakes in the game publisher, are reportedly exploring taking the company private as it approaches its 39th birthday. (Ubisoft’s CEO is Yves Guillemot.) Its share price jumped more than 30% on the news. A push to go private may shield the company from investors trying to dismantle it, but it won’t rectify its challenges elsewhere. Sales of first-person shooter XDefiant underwhelmed, as did Star Wars Outlaws. Meanwhile, Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been pushed to 2025 and the company’s workers in France are on the cusp of a strike. Remember, Yves: The world is an illusion. One you can either submit to, as most do, or transcend. —AN The company behind Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp has unveiled a new tool that will let people create short video clips by merely entering simple text prompts describing what they want to see and hear. Don’t count on using Meta’s new Movie Gen to become the next Steven Spielberg anytime soon, however—it’s not yet publicly available. And the clips the tool produces are limited to just 16 seconds. In announcing the service, Meta is joining a race that promises to revolutionize filmmaking. Upstarts Runway and Pika already offer similar tools, while OpenAI has developed one that is available only to a small number of users. Critics fear this new wave of AI for video creation risks being misused to spread disinformation. What is clear, though, is that Hollywood stands to both benefit from using AI to create new films and face challenges if anyone in their bedroom can do the same. —Jason Del Rey The Lone Star State has sued TikTok for allegedly misusing the data of its young users, adding to the social media company’s long list of legal woes in the U.S. The lawsuit, filed Thursday, accuses TikTok of violating a new Texas law banning social media companies from selling or sharing a minor’s data without an adult’s approval. The service is also accused of failing to add tools that let parents see how their children use social media; the current version works only if minors consent to being monitored. TikTok denied the allegations, telling the Texas Tribune that it complies with data-sharing laws and that parents can request that their kids’ accounts be deleted. Texas isn’t the only U.S. state to take TikTok to court. Utah, Nebraska, Indiana, and Arkansas have also sued the company, which is based in Los Angeles and Singapore, over alleged privacy and safety violations involving children. Of course, all of this may soon be moot. TikTok, owned by Beijing-headquartered ByteDance, is fighting for its life against the federal government’s order earlier this year that the service be sold or shut down. The clock ticks until mid-January. —Jenn Brice Over the years, major tech companies have come to define the idea of the “open web” to their own benefit—often to the disadvantage of their users. Google is the latest example of such tortured redefinition. New proposed legislation in New Zealand will force the U.S. company to compensate the news publishers that provide a significant portion of the content for its massively profitable search engine (not to mention training data for its generative AI models). Google’s response: Fine, we’ll just stop linking to news articles in our products. The company’s argument for removing the ability for New Zealand’s 5 million residents to access news articles through its popular search engine and other services is that remunerating publishers for using their content is “in conflict with the principles of the open web.” It would also harm small publishers and create unlimited financial exposure for the company, whose parent Alphabet generated $307 billion of revenue in its last full fiscal year. In recent years Australia and Canada have passed laws aimed at forcing Google and rival Meta to pay for news content that appears on their platforms. In Australia, the tech giants entered deals worth many millions; in Canada, they stopped linking to news. How distant a memory is the open web in New Zealand? We’ll soon find out. —Kali Hays Max Schrems strikes again! The Austrian-activist-turned-Meta-arch-nemesis has scored a ruling from the EU’s highest court, saying Meta and other online ad players can’t just use every morsel of someone’s personal data to target ads at them, forever. That’s because the “data minimization” principle in the General Data Protection Regulation says Facebook has to limit how long it can exploit a user’s data and the types of data that can be used for ad targeting. Schrems has been dragging Meta through the EU courts for a dozen years, leaving the wreckage of multiple EU-U.S. data-sharing agreements and forcing the Facebook owner to ask for users’ consent before targeting ads at them. He told me he was “happy to have gotten a clear ruling that Meta and other online advertisers have to minimize the use of personal data for ads.” —David Meyer —Apple Intelligence will arrive Oct. 28. Gird your iPhones. —“Salt Typhoon” cyberattack affects U.S. telcos. It links to the Chinese government. —Can you revamp Facebook for Gen Z? Meta is sure trying. (Sus.) —"Perfctl" malware is going after Linux servers. And has been for three years.

Title: Japan’s Metaplanet expands Bitcoin portfolio with latest purchase

Metaplanet has made thirteen acquisitions since it began accumulating BTC on 23rd April. Bitcoin’s [BTC] recent price activity has drawn attention as it fluctuated from nearly $66,000 at the end of September, dipping to $60,000 on 1st October, before bouncing back. Trading at $63,480 at press time, up by 2.3% over the last 24 hours according to CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency is showing strong bullish signs. Riding on this momentum, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet announced its acquisition of an additional 108.78 BTC for $6.7 million (1 billion yen), bringing its total holdings to 639.5 BTC, valued at approximately $40 million. Source: Metaplanet Inc./X Remarking on the same an X user noted, “Nice investment choice!” Additionally, Bitcoin Treasuries data revealed that Metaplanet initiated its BTC acquisitions on 23rd April. Hence the recent purchase made on 7th October marks its thirteenth purchase, with the recent accumulation, being of 107.9 BTC, valued at 1 billion yen ($6.9 million). These recent purchases reflect Metaplanet’s consistent strategy to expand its BTC holdings amid renewed optimism in the crypto market’s outlook for the year’s final quarter. That being said, Metaplanet has gained attention for its proactive Bitcoin acquisition approach, drawing comparisons to MicroStrategy and earning the title – “Asia’s MicroStrategy” due to its institutional-level commitment to BTC. Thus, by adopting BTC, Metaplanet seeks to navigate Japan’s challenging economic landscape marked by negative interest rates and extensive quantitative easing. Needless to say, the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs has marked a turning point, shifting mainstream sentiment—especially within Wall Street—from seeing BTC as a risk to viewing it as a strategic opportunity. Subsequently, institutional interest in BTC has surged, with U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs now holding 4.6% of BTC’s total supply, equating to $58 billion and approaching the holdings of Bitcoin’s largest owner, Satoshi Nakamoto. This was further confined by data from SoSoValue which showed that BTC ETFs have amassed $57.73 billion in total assets, with BlackRock leading the charge, managing $22.91 billion in its Bitcoin ETF alone. Remarking on the same, Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s Senior ETF Analyst in a recent tweet had noted, “U.S. bitcoin ETFs had good day yesterday pushing YTD flows to new high water mark of $17.8b. They’re now 92% of the way to owning 1million bitcoin and 83% of way to passing Satoshi as top holder. Tick tock..” Hence, with the increasing adoption of BTC, it will be intriguing to observe whether Nakamoto will maintain his status as the top Bitcoin holder or if things take a u-turn.

Title: Inside the slow-motion fall of Patrick Drahi
URL: https://qz.com/patrick-drahi-sotheby-altice-john-malone-1851665674
Time Published: 2024-10-07T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
A version of this article originally appeared in Quartz’s members-only Weekend Brief newsletter. Quartz members get access to exclusive newsletters and more. Sign up here. Back at the end of the last century, Patrick Drahi was a fledgling French media entrepreneur, a one-time protege of U.S. cable king John Malone. He was intent on building an empire to rival that of his mentor, who borrowed heavily to build two media conglomerates and today controls significant stakes in Sirius XM and Charter Communications. Within little more than a decade, Drahi, a graduate of the Polytechnique, France’s MIT, had an empire stretching from Israel, across Europe into the U.S., and down to the Dominican Republic. His holdings included France’s oldest phone company and the country’s 24-hour news channel, a chunk of British Telecom, Portuguese mobile phone and cable operators, and mobile phone and TV news networks in Israel. In 2015, he moved into the U.S., buying Suddenlink, a southwestern cable company, for $9 billion. He bought New York-area cable and internet provider Cablevision for $17.7 billion from the Dolan family, and paid $200 million for Cheddar, a youth-oriented cable business channel. For fun, Drahi, who has a 750 million-euro collection of modern art, bought auction house Sotheby’s in 2019 for $3.7 billion. Drahi built his empire buying undervalued and underperforming cable and telecom companies, and applying what he and his aides claimed was telecom engineering — lowering costs with better technology and using the ensuing low prices to win customers. In truth, it wasn’t just telecom engineering, but a large dose of financial engineering that grew Drahi’s empire, most of it under the brand Altice. Drahi and his companies borrowed some $60 billion in bonds and bank loans to pay for it all. But rising interest rates, slower-than-expected growth, the pandemic, and poor management combined to push Drahi and his Altice empire to the brink. Now Drahi is engaged in a fierce battle with creditors, but is nearing the end of his rope, as interest payments rise, revenue is coming up short, and few buyers want to refinance his debt. At a meeting of creditors last fall in Goldman Sachs’ London office, Drahi said everything he owned would be for sale in an effort to cut debt and keep a smaller Altice conglomerate float. “Everything is open, it’s just a question of offer and demand,” Drahi said, according to a transcript of the meeting reported by Bloomberg. “All in man, all in. Plus the Eiffel Tower, OK?” “The house of cards is tumbling like it has never tumbled before,” investment banker Thomas Coudry told Bloomberg at the time. But more than a year later, Drahi has yet to sell enough of Altice’s holdings to right the ship. In fact, the outlook is so bad that the share price of Altice’s U.S. operations, which had almost $25 billion in debt at the end of June, has dropped 93% since the company went public in 2017. Net income for the first half of the year was down 92% from a year earlier, meaning there’s not much cash floating around to service that debt. In the U.S., Altice lost 51,000 broadband subscribers in the last quarter, despite building up its fiber-optic network and vastly reducing the number of trips its repair trucks need to make, and the number of calls to its helplines. Across his empire, which Drahi has largely divided into Altice units in several countries, $21 billion of debt comes due by the end of 2027. Yet Drahi seems in no hurry to sell major assets. Sales so far have included various media and data assets in France for about 3.5 billion euros, $1 billion for Teads, a European video ad platform once worth $5 billion, the giveaway of Cheddar to Archetype, with up to $50 million in payments if Cheddar reaches revenue targets, and the sale of a 24.5% stake in British Telecom to India’s Bharti Enterprises for 3.2 billion pounds ($4.2 billion). But that’s still a small fraction of what Altice owes. Complicating his task is a growing lack of confidence in Drahi’s leadership, exemplified by the arrest last year of his chief lieutenant, Armando Pereira, for allegedly bilking Altice’s various units out of millions of dollars in purchasing scams. Drahi conceded he’d been caught flat-footed by the scheme. “He built his empire on debt,” Coudry, the banker, told Bloomberg. “And it’s starting to crumple because of it. And he built his group with a small circle of people at the helm, which is also turning against him.” The most fashionable part of Drahi’s empire is Sotheby’s, the 280-year-old auction house that has stood alongside crosstown rival Christie’s as a symbol of wealth, taste, and power. But a major market downturn has left Sotheby’s struggling, and Drahi’s penchant for leveraging his assets may cost him control of the auction house. Leaked data published by The Financial Times in August showed Sotheby’s core income down 88%, amid a 25% drop in the value of art and other items sold in its auctions. A newly-opened Hong Kong office failed to muster enough worthy works to even hold its planned inaugural auction in the Chinese territory last month (Christie’s was able to go ahead with its Hong Kong sales). Sotheby’s has other ills: Employees and contractors are finding payments and bonuses delayed, The Wall Street Journal reported, and around New York, at least, Sotheby’s employees say morale at the firm is low. A planned move to new quarters at the former home of the Whitney Museum of American Art, designed in the middle of the last century by the brutalist master Marcel Breuer, has been delayed. New York City real estate records indicate the sale hasn’t yet closed, despite Sotheby’s having already agreed to sell part of its current headquarters. Drahi has also split Sotheby’s into three parts: the auction business, the buildings that house it, and the discrete business of lending money, both to collectors who offer their prizes for auction, and at high rates to buyers who purchase those same works. It’s all part of an effort to keep the market liquid and boost sale prices. But all of those businesses are now in a downturn. Certainly, Sotheby’s has been the victim of an economic cycle that has hit the art market. That market has been contracting for the past two years after a pandemic-fueled wave of exuberance had stuck-at-home collectors paying high prices to cover their walls in trophy art, said Katya Kazakina, who writes the Art Detective column for industry publication Artnews, and closely follows the auction market. Even though the stock market is still up, few works now in collections are coming on the art market, and that’s pushing prices and auction revenue down. “The rich people are still very rich, but psychologically, the market is seen as in a downturn and discretionary sellers are not in any rush to consign anything to auction when values have been falling,” Kazakina said in an interview. But part of the pressure on Sotheby’s is of Drahi’s own making, she added. “He’s leveraged other assets, and he’s leveraging Sotheby’s now, [but] auction revenues are down very significantly.” With the Breuer move still on hold, Drahi agreed last month to take in a new partner and recapitalize the auction house. Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund, known as ADQ, has just put $700 million into Sotheby’s for an undisclosed ownership stake, and Drahi himself has put in $300 million. According to the results obtained by the FT, Sotheby’s will use the $700 million to “reduce the company’s leverage” when the deal closes this fall. But with more than $1.8 billion in net long-term debt as of June, Sotheby’s will still be carrying more than $1 billion in long-term debt. The overall debt load is staggering, and observers say there’s a good chance Drahi may lose his empire. Secured creditors, including major financial investors BlackRock, Elliott Investment Management, and Pacific Investment Management Co., are pressing for payment and appear tired of the financial engineering that’s moved some assets out of their reach. They’re proposing a new deal that would give them bonds they could convert into stock, potentially taking control of the companies from Drahi. Meanwhile, Drahi is in talks with Apollo Global Management, a fiercely competitive asset manager founded by Leon Black, to borrow enough cash to start paying back his creditors and win time to turn the companies around. The problem is that, given the vast number of people switching off cable for online subscriptions, and the immense investments needed to keep cable and internet infrastructure up to date, there’s not much chance that Drahi’s various firms can actually generate enough cash to meet their heavy debt load. Or as Malone, Drahi’s one-time mentor, told CNBC last fall, as Altice’s debt load became visibly stressed, “It’s all toast.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Miriam O’Callaghan has posted a video paying tribute to her friend and RTÉ colleague Rhona O’Byrne Prime Time presenter Miriam O’Callaghan has paid tribute to her RTÉ programme colleague, Rhona O’Byrne, following her death last week. Ms O’Byrne worked with the national broadcaster as a production manager in their News and Current Affairs TV division, working on Prime Time with Ms O’Callaghan. "Sometimes angels do exist in this life, incredible people who are just so special they’re touched by stardust,” Miriam O’Callaghan wrote in tribute to her colleague. She said that this week all of the team on Prime Time and in RTÉ News and Current Affairs were “truly shocked to lose our amazing colleague Rhona O Byrne to Heaven”. “We are all beyond broken hearted. It’s hard to put into words what she meant to us all - she was just everything that’s good about what we do, she was the beating heart of our workplace,” she added.

Title: Third-quarter earnings season to be focused on "more macro" topics - Evercore ISI

Investing.com -- US third-quarter earnings season is set to kick into gear this week, in what will be a test for a stock market trading near record highs and hovering around lofty valuations. Major financial firms including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) all report on Friday. Bank results offer an important view into the economy, including the strength of demand for loans. Investors will also be on the lookout for signs of whether the Federal Reserve’s large interest rate cut last month is already influencing the economy through rising auto sales or the purchase of other big-ticket items. Other companies reporting results during the week include PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL). Bullish investors are hoping the results will justify increasingly rich valuations in the stock market. The S&P 500 is up 20% for the year so far and is trading near record highs despite recent volatility spurred by rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. In a note to clients on Sunday, analysts at Evercore ISI argued that the latest quarterly earnings will be more focused on the macroeconomic picture, including the Middle East concerns, the looming presidential election in the US in November, and the possibility of additional stimulus measures from the Chinese government. These topics "will continue to exaggerate the macro, and its very uncertain uncertainties, over micro this earnings season," the analysts said. They added that they expect growth in third-quarter results to slow from a "torrid pace" clocked in the prior period, when income per share expanded by 11.3% -- its fastest rate in more than two years. The Evercore ISI analysts are forecasting earnings per share growth to come in at 6.5% during the third quarter. Wall Street consensus estimates see the figure at 2.9%, Evercore ISI noted. "Earnings strength is likely to come from [artificial intelligence]-exposed sectors Information Technology and Communication Services (both Outperform rated) as well as Defensives Health Care (Outperform) and Utilities (In Line)," the analysts said. "Cyclically geared Energy (In Line) is most at risk. Broadly though, the support from the S&P 493 is likely to moderate in [the third quarter] (albeit still supportive) before improving in [the fourth quarter of 2024] and 2025."

Title: Barclays sees Netflix shares out of sync with growth prospects, downgrades to underweight

On Monday, Barclays downgraded shares of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), the streaming giant listed on NASDAQ: NFLX, from Equalweight to Underweight, while setting a price target of $550. The firm cited concerns over the company's growth prospects and valuation as reasons for the downgrade. The analyst from Barclays acknowledged Netflix's exceptional execution through various business model shifts and changes in the industry structure, highlighting the company's success in building the largest content and content distribution business worldwide. Netflix has been recognized as a major winner in the entertainment shift toward streaming and stands as the leading incumbent in the space. Despite these achievements, the analyst pointed out that over the past two to three years, Netflix has increasingly relied on new growth drivers, such as paid sharing, to sustain double-digit revenue growth. These strategies, however, may be accelerating future growth prematurely. Growth is reportedly slowing, and each new lever that Netflix pulls comes with trade-offs. Moreover, the analyst noted that Netflix has benefited from margin expansion being pulled forward, which may have created unrealistic expectations for the company's long-term margins and free cash flow (FCF). In light of these considerations, the firm believes that Netflix's current valuation does not align with its probable growth trajectory. Barclays' new price target reflects a more cautious outlook on Netflix's ability to maintain its growth pace in the face of evolving market dynamics and increased competition in the streaming industry. The report from Barclays suggests that investors may need to recalibrate their expectations for the company's performance moving forward. In other recent news, the Philippines has imposed a 12% value-added tax on digital services provided by tech giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix, Disney, and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). The move aims to create a level playing field between these global entities and local businesses. The tax could generate approximately 105 billion pesos ($1.9 billion) from 2025 to 2029, with 5% of these funds earmarked to support Philippine creative industries. On the analysts' front, KeyBanc Capital Markets has adjusted its price target for Netflix upward to $760 from the previous $735, maintaining an Overweight rating on the shares. The firm projects that Netflix could achieve earnings per share of approximately $24 in 2025 and $30 in 2026, marking an estimated 25% growth for each year. JPMorgan and Evercore ISI also show confidence in Netflix's potential, predicting that the streaming giant's ad revenue could account for more than 10% of total revenue by 2027 and maintaining an Outperform rating respectively. Netflix has scheduled its third quarter 2024 earnings release and has been making significant strides in its advertising business. The company's earnings announcement is set to be broadcast live on the Netflix Investor Relations YouTube channel, with management responding to questions from sell-side analysts. TD Cowen has reiterated a Buy rating for Netflix, indicating faith in the company's advertising growth trajectory. The firm predicts that advertising will represent 13% of Netflix's total revenue by 2029. Disney's proposed merger with Reliance's Indian media assets is facing regulatory hurdles due to concerns about monopolizing cricket broadcast rights. The companies may need to sell some of their cricket broadcast rights or commit to advertisement price caps for cricket matches to address these antitrust concerns. While Barclays has downgraded Netflix, citing concerns over growth prospects and valuation, recent data from InvestingPro offers a nuanced perspective on the streaming giant's financial position. Netflix's market capitalization stands at an impressive $308.87 billion, reflecting its dominant position in the entertainment industry. An InvestingPro Tip highlights that Netflix is trading at a low P/E ratio relative to its near-term earnings growth, with a PEG ratio of 0.62 for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. This suggests that the stock may still offer value despite its recent price appreciation. Additionally, Netflix has demonstrated strong financial performance, with a revenue growth of 13.0% and an EBITDA growth of 50.33% over the same period. Another InvestingPro Tip notes that Netflix operates with a moderate level of debt, which aligns with the article's mention of margin expansion and free cash flow expectations. This financial stability could provide Netflix with flexibility as it navigates new growth strategies and competitive challenges. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 13 additional tips that could provide further insights into Netflix's market position and financial health.

Time Published: 2024-10-07T09:42:36Z

Feature-packed website builders for those with diverse needs When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Squarespace is a top website builder known for its elegant designs and robust features. With over 100 premium, mobile-optimized templates, it’s a favorite for creatives and businesses seeking visually stunning, professional websites. GoDaddy Website Builder is a popular choice for beginners, offering a user-friendly interface and quick setup. With customizable templates and integrated marketing tools, it’s designed to help small businesses and entrepreneurs create functional websites with ease. Creating a website is easier and more affordable than ever before. From no-code website builders to finding cheap domains and hosting plans, it seems like you can do it all for a couple of bucks. But, among countless brands, two stand out. Both Squarespace and GoDaddy are well known as two of the best website builders on the market, but with many similar tools and features, it is no surprise potential customers often get confused about which one is best for them. Squarespace primarily offers a drag-and-drop website builder, dynamic website templates, and even multiple products targetting specific businesses such as dedicated templates for sellers, Bio Sites, creator tools for freelancers/ influencers, and SEO tools for digital marketers. GoDaddy's primary business is the sale of domains, and not very long ago, it started providing additional services like website building, logo making, and more. But this isn’t to say that GoDaddy isn’t a strong competitor in the website building space. In fact, in a short time, it has become one of the key players with powerful tools that are comparable to the likes of Squarespace. In this guide, we take a look at the most important areas of website building and offer a comparison between what is offered by the two players. The goal isn’t to give a generic answer to ‘which is the best website builder’, but instead provide you with the information you need to make an informed decision on which platform best suits your unique needs and goals. Squarespace pricing is straightforward, starting with the Personal plan. For $16/month (billed annually) you get features like a custom domain, SSL security, unlimited bandwidth, and Squarespace AI. If you need more, the Business plan for $23/month adds advanced website analytics, free invoices, promotional pop-ups, banners, and a nominal 3% transaction fee on sales. For ecommerce, the Basic Commerce plan at $27/month includes customer accounts, product waitlists, and low stock alerts and the Advanced Commerce plan adds advanced shipping, discounts, and abandoned cart recovery for $52/month. You can also save on your Squarespace subscription by signing up for an annual plan over monthly billing and using one of the best Squarespace promo codes at checkout. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! GoDaddy, on the other hand, starts with the Basic plan at $9.99/month, ideal for small businesses that need SSL, unlimited social media platforms alongside unified inbox and website chat. On top of this, the Standard plan adds additional marketing tools like built-in SEO and social posts for $11.99/month. Next up, the Premium plan at $14.99/month includes all the benefits of the Standard plan, plus recurring appointments. Lastly, if you just want to build an online store, the Ecommerce plan at $24.99/month is the best choice as it covers all the essentials like product listings, shipping, and abandoned cart recovery. My Verdict: Squarespace is a premium option with higher pricing, ideal for businesses and creatives needing strong design and e-commerce features. GoDaddy offers more affordable, simple plans, perfect for beginners or businesses looking for a quick and easy website setup. Squarespace’s setup and editing process are both minimalist and visually appealing. With a Fluid Engine drag-and-drop editor, Squarespace offers real-time previews of your edits and even offers many AI features to improve your website. You get dedicated theme patterns, tons of templates distributed on an industry basis, and limited yet versatile font options to fulfill your brand’s persona. If you plan on running an online store, Squarespace has dedicated e-commerce themes and well-organized sections for payments, shopping carts, and products. GoDaddy’s layout may be less visually appealing, but its editor is simpler than Squarespace's, particularly for non-technical users. With a guided walkthrough to set up your site, you can add pictures, design pages, etc., using the swipe-to-style editor both from your desktop or even your phone. Plus, GoDaddy Airo AI creates your website, logo, and more by just using details of your business. Likewise, once your ecommerce store is ready, you can upgrade to start selling and connect with top marketplaces like Instagram, Google, Etsy, eBay, Facebook, and Amazon. My Verdict: Squarespace is perfect if you want a visually-driven, customizable setup, while GoDaddy is better for beginners who value ease of use and speed over advanced design and customization. Squarespace lets you send invoices and sell content like online courses, videos, blogs, memberships as well as physical products. Further, you can use your own domain for checkout and connect with different Point-Of-Sale (POS) systems, helping create a seamless experience for your customers. If you want to go all in with your store, Squarespace provides product reviews for your customers, features for selling your products and services on Facebook and Instagram, limited availability labels, and abandoned cart recovery. On high-tier plans, you get advanced options for shipping, discounts, and access to Commerce APIs. With the GoDaddy Ecommerce plan, you can create dedicated websites to sell products. Just integrate your online store to add products and services, set up payment methods, manage shipping options and return policies, warranties, and guarantees. Plus, you can highlight featured products, integrate Square, PayPal, and Stripe, and keep subscribers informed about sales, coupon offers, and online events along with email marketing tools. GoDaddy also lets you customize your online store with WordPress and WooCommerce integration. My Verdict: Both platforms have extensive ecommerce features and support flat-rate, calculated, and free shipping, along with a range of third-party app integrations. In a nutshell, consider Squarespace if you want a neatly designed and stunning-looking online store and GoDaddy if you’re a beginner on a tight budget who just wants to get started with a simple yet effective ecommerce website. When it comes to SEO, both Squarespace and GoDaddy let you edit tags and meta descriptions, add image alt text, customize URLs, and access keyword support. But there are a few things to consider. Squarespace site comes with a site map using the .xml format, so you don't need to create one manually. Squarespace also lets you add Meta Pixel & Ads for targeted advertising. Plus, you can explore keywords with time filters and access an SEO Checklist making optimizing your site a breeze.. On the other hand, GoDaddy has a step-by-step wizard that guides you through optimizing your homepage, and if you've used it before, you can revisit tasks to refine any page, blog post, or image. Similarly, you can track your site's performance using Google Analytics and return to optimize further as needed. My Verdict: While Squarespace comes with an integrated sitemap and Meta Pixel for users who prefer simplicity, GoDaddy’s SEO wizard provides a more guided, step-by-step approach for beginners. Since both offer quite basic SEO tools, you can try their free trial to see which one suits your business better. Both Squarespace and GoDaddy are solid website builders, but they cater to different needs. GoDaddy is the cheaper and faster option, perfect for those who want to get online quickly without fussing over too many details. It’s great for beginners with its straightforward email marketing process and essential features at an affordable price. GoDaddy’s guided approach is ideal for those who want to get things up and running with minimal hassle. Squarespace, while more expensive, excels in aesthetics and creative control. Its beautiful templates, drag-and-drop editor, and powerful tools like built-in SEO and automatic sitemaps make it a top choice for creatives, artists, and anyone wanting to build a visually stunning online presence. A generous student discount also makes it a great option for young entrepreneurs and creators looking to save while building something professional. In the end, if speed, simplicity, and cost are your main concerns, GoDaddy wins. But if you're after elegance, customization, and appealing aesthetics, Squarespace is a better choice.

Title: Hong Kong and Japan shares rally after U.S. jobs report

Shares in Asia jumped Monday, building on U.S. gains after Friday’s blockbuster jobs report fueled investor optimism. Oil prices paused their sharp rise as investors awaited Israel’s response to Iran’s missile attack. China’s markets reopen tomorrow after the Golden Week holidays. China: Hong Kong stocks surge again as mainland markets prepare to reopen Hong Kong shares jumped again, rising 1.60% the day before mainland China markets reopen. Beijing said it would explain the details of its economic stimulus plans at a Tuesday morning news conference. Japan: Yen falls and Nintendo jumps The Nikkei 225 jumped 1.8% as the yen fell, at one point touching its weakest level against the dollar in over two months. That’s good news for the country’s big export manufacturers, but a weak yen raises the cost of imports at a time of rising oil prices. Shares in Nintendo jumped 4.4% on news that Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund was open to expanding its stake in the game maker. Europe: Middle East worries outweigh jobs optimism European stocks opened higher Monday morning but slid back, as worries about Mideast tensions outweighed optimism inspired by Friday’s strong jobs report in the U.S. Further tempering investors was data showing that factory orders in Germany plummeted in August. The STOXX Europe 600 fell 0.27% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 was flat in early trading. U.S. premarket down as investors consider ‘no landing’ scenario All three U.S. indexes fell in premarket trading Monday, as optimism inspired by Friday’s blockbuster jobs report shifted to predictions of a “no landing” scenario—where the U.S. keeps growing and inflation returns, trimming back hopes for more interest rate reductions by the Fed. Pfizer shares rose more than 2% in pre-market trading after the Wall Street Journal reported that the activist investor Starboard Value had taken an approximately $1 billion stake in the struggling drugmaker. Starboard wants Pfizer to make changes to turn its performance around as it struggles with fading sales of COVID-19 products. U.S. markets surged Friday on job numbers. Now, it’s earnings season Stocks surged Friday on news that U.S. employers added 254,000 jobs in September, surpassing estimates and signaling continued economic strength. The S&P 500 closed up 0.90%, and the Dow neared its record, up 0.81%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 1.22% with big gains for Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices. Now investor attention will turn to earnings. Pepsico kicks it off with its report Tuesday, followed by Delta Air Lines on Thursday and JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and BlackRock on Friday. The CEP inflation index for September also comes out before the bell on Thursday. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: US stock futures lower; CPI and earnings ahead this week - what's moving markets

Investing.com -- US stock futures edge lower following a Friday spike on Wall Street that was fueled by a strong jobs report. Markets are now gearing up for fresh inflation data which could provide more clarity on the path ahead for Federal Reserve interest rate policy in the coming months. Elsewhere, global miner Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) confirms a takeover bid for US-based Arcadium Lithium . 1. Futures lower US stock futures pointed lower on Monday following a rally in the prior session sparked by a bumper September employment report. By 03:28 ET (07:28 GMT), the Dow futures contract had shed 89 points or 0.2%, S&P 500 futures had fallen by 13 points or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had dipped by 46 points or 0.2%. On Friday, the main averages on Wall Street jumped after Labor Department figures showed that the US economy added far more jobs than anticipated last month. The numbers bolstered hopes that the the world's largest economy was on solid footing heading into the fourth quarter. Although the reading dented projections that the Federal Reserve would roll out another jumbo 50-basis point interest rate reduction at its final meetings this year, it served to boost the idea that the central bank was on course to achieve a so-called "soft landing" -- a scenario in which elevated inflation is successfully quelled without a igniting a wider downturn in the economy or jobs market. The 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a record closing high, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite added 1.2% and the benchmark S&P 500 grew by 51 points or 0.9%. The increases also helped the major indices eke out a fourth consecutive positive week. 2. Data, earnings ahead this week Investors will have more economic data to pour over this week, as well as a raft of new quarterly corporate earnings. Thursday’s consumer price index (CPI) data for September is expected to show that price pressures continued to moderate at the end of the third quarter. The data, coming on the heels of Friday’s robust jobs report is likely to shape expectations around the size and pace of Fed rate cuts in the coming months. Producer price inflation data on Friday is also expected to point to tamer inflationary pressures. “CPI for September will be a key data release. If prices rise faster than expected on top of the stronger labor data, chances for the Fed to skip the November meeting will increase,” analysts at UBS said in a recent note. Meanwhile, US third-quarter earnings season is about to kick into gear, in what will be a test for a stock market near record highs and trading at lofty valuations. Major financial firms -- including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) -- are all due to report on Friday. 3. Rio Tinto confirms approach to acquire Arcadium Lithium Mining giant Rio Tinto (LON:RIO) has made an approach to purchase lithium producer Arcadium Lithium (NYSE:ALTM), the companies announced in separate statements on Monday. Both groups said the approach was "non-binding," adding that they would divulge more about a potential deal when they had "news to share." Should it be completed, the agreement would make Rio Tinto one of the world's biggest producers of lithium, the ultralight metal essential in powering electric vehicle batteries and power storage. Prior to the announcement, media reports had speculated that Rio may pursue a bid following months of slumping lithium prices due in part to oversupply in China and weaker EV demand. No financial details were provided, but Arcadium Lithium has a market capitalization of around $3.3 billion. Shares in the Philadelphia-based firm surged by more than 24% in premarket trading. Reuters previously reported the discussions on Friday, saying that Arcadium could be valued at between $4 billion to $6 billion or higher. 4. Activist investor Starboard Value takes stake in Pfizer - WSJ Activist investor Starboard Value has taken a stake in Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) worth around $1 billion as part of a bid to overhaul the pharmaceutical company, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. Starboard has approached two former Pfizer executives -- ex-CEO Ian Read and ex-CFO Frank D'Amelio -- to help in the process, the paper added, citing people familiar with the matter. The report comes as Pfizer's leadership team is facing growing calls to turn around its recently flagging performance. The drugmaker was a key COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer during the pandemic, but it has struggled to plug a subsequent sales gap as the health crisis has abated. In late-2023, Pfizer issued a revenue warning and a disappointing 2024 outlook, along with a $3.5 billion cost-cutting drive. Shares in Pfizer, which are now trading below pre-pandemic levels, were higher in premarket dealmaking following the report. 5. Oil jumps Oil prices jumped on Monday following hefty gains posted in the previous week, as traders eye ongoing tensions in the Middle East. By 03:28 ET, the Brent contract had risen by 0.5% to $78.47 per barrel, while U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.8% higher at $74.94 a barrel. Oil prices last week recorded their biggest weekly gains in over a year on the mounting threat of a region-wide war in the Middle East. Israel has sworn to strike Iran for launching a barrage of missiles at the country in retaliation for the assassination of the leader of Tehran-backed Hezbollah.

Title: Bitcoin Dominates 2024 Despite $12B Sell-Off: NYDIG Predicts Bigger Gains Ahead
URL: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/10/bitcoin-dominates-2024-despite-12b-sell-off-nydig-predicts-bigger-gains-ahead/
Time Published: 2024-10-07T07:29:44Z
Full Content:
According to a recent research note by Greg Cipolaro, Global Head of Research at NYDIG, Bitcoin posted a modest 2.5% gain in the third quarter of 2024, bouncing back after a decline in Q2. Despite this, Cipolaro notes that the cryptocurrency’s trading has remained largely rangebound, fluctuating between $70,000 and $54,000 for most of the past six months. NYDIG’s report highlights that while Bitcoin struggled to make significant moves, it demonstrated resilience in a challenging environment. NYDIG (New York Digital Investment Group) is a prominent player in Bitcoin financial services, offering a range of solutions tailored to institutions, corporations, and high-net-worth individuals. They focus on Bitcoin custody, financing, asset management, and infrastructure, enabling clients to securely integrate Bitcoin into their businesses. Their services are highly compliant with regulatory standards, helping banks and financial institutions offer Bitcoin-related products without directly holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets​. The firm operates as a subsidiary of Stone Ridge Holdings Group. A significant factor weighing on Bitcoin’s performance in Q3 was the near resolution of several major bankruptcies, including the Mt. Gox bankruptcy, which resulted in the return of billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin to creditors, according to NYDIG. Cipolaro explains that these developments, combined with notable Bitcoin sales by the U.S. and German governments, contributed to downward pressure on the asset’s price. However, NYDIG’s analysis suggests that the mere fear of these coins coming to market may have had a greater impact on Bitcoin’s price than the actual selling activity. NYDIG’s research also points out that Bitcoin investors found the third quarter frustrating, as traditional asset classes outperformed the cryptocurrency. Cipolaro explains that lower interest rates provided a tailwind for assets such as utilities, real estate, and small-cap stocks, which fared better than Bitcoin during this period. NYDIG also notes that gold set new all-time highs, further challenging Bitcoin’s performance relative to other assets. Despite these headwinds, Bitcoin remains the best-performing asset in 2024, according to NYDIG. Cipolaro emphasizes that Bitcoin’s lead over other asset classes has narrowed, especially as volatility spiked in August. While other assets, including precious metals and equities, gained ground, NYDIG’s analysis shows that Bitcoin continues to outperform on a year-to-date basis. Cipolaro notes that most asset classes are enjoying a strong year, echoing the trends seen in 2023. Cipolaro also highlights that Bitcoin defied typical trends in September, posting a gain in what is historically a weak month for the asset, according to NYDIG. Bitcoin’s correlation with U.S. equities also increased during Q3, ending the quarter with a rolling 90-day correlation of 0.46. However, NYDIG’s report notes that while Bitcoin’s correlation with stocks has risen, it remains low enough to offer significant diversification benefits for multi-asset portfolios. One of the dominant themes in Q3, as outlined by NYDIG, was the emergence of large Bitcoin holders who distributed or sold their holdings. Cipolaro explains that the Mt. Gox and Genesis bankruptcies, as well as government sell-offs, led to the transfer of approximately 204,000 Bitcoins during the quarter, valued at over $12.6 billion. However, NYDIG’s analysis shows that despite the magnitude of these events, there was little evidence of panic selling by creditors. NYDIG’s report also points to continued demand from U.S. spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as a key factor supporting Bitcoin’s price during the quarter. According to Cipolaro, U.S. spot ETFs gathered $4.3 billion in total flows, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust leading the pack. NYDIG notes that while Grayscale’s new Bitcoin Mini Trust made a competitive entry into the market, BlackRock continues to dominate ETF inflows. Cipolaro concludes by looking ahead to Q4, traditionally one of Bitcoin’s strongest periods, as noted by NYDIG. He identifies several catalysts that could boost Bitcoin’s performance, including the upcoming U.S. presidential election. According to Cipolaro, a Trump victory would likely deliver substantial gains for Bitcoin, given the former president’s endorsement of the crypto industry. However, NYDIG also suggests that Bitcoin’s strength as an asset detached from traditional financial and political systems could benefit from post-election instability, regardless of the outcome.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Monday, boosted by a largely positive handover from Asia after last week’s strong US jobs report, with the new corporate earnings season drawing near. At 03:05 ET (07:05 GMT), the DAX index in Germany traded 0.2% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.3% and the FTSE 100 in the U.K. climbed 0.3%. The main European indices have started the new week on a positive note, boosted by gains in Asia, with Japan’s Nikkei leading the way with gains of 2%, on the back of the latest U.S. jobs report that exceeded expectations. Nonfarm payrolls data, released on Friday, showed the U.S. economy added 254,000 jobs in September, ahead of the near 150,000 forecast. This release has shifted the narrative from worries about a U.S. economic recession to the potential for a so-called "soft landing", a cyclical slowdown in economic growth that avoids the world’s largest economy going into recession. Back in Europe, the economic news is less impressive, as German factory orders slumped 5.8% on the month in August, data showed earlier Monday, a significant deterioration from the prior month’s revised higher 3.9% gain. The business climate in the German retail sector clouded over in September, according to an Ifo survey published on Monday. Retailers assessed their current situation as slightly worse than in the previous month and are more pessimistic about the coming months, the survey showed. However, Monday’s main release will be the latest eurozone retail sales data, as a guide for how the important consumer is holding up during these tricky times. Retail sales are expected to have climbed 0.2% in August, a marginal improvement from the 0.1% gain the previous month. ECB chief economist Philip Lane as well as board members Piero Cipollone and Jose Luis Escriva are all scheduled to speak later Monday, and are likely to follow President Christine Lagarde in signalling a brisk pace of further easing. In the corporate sector, the third-quarter earnings season is drawing near, with the US banking sector leading the way. Major financial firms including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) all report on Friday, with their European counterparts set to follow shortly afterwards. Elsewhere, Shell (LON:SHEL) stock rose 0.4% despite the energy giant indicating in a trading update that its refining profit margins dropped sharply in the third quarter from the previous three months as global demand sagged, while oil product trading earnings also weakened. Oil prices slipped slightly Monday, handing back some of the previous week’s hefty gains as traders continue to look to the Middle East for developments. By 03:05 ET, the Brent contract slipped 0.2% to $77.86 per barrel, while U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.2% lower at $74.25 per barrel. Oil prices last week recorded their biggest weekly gains in over a year on the mounting threat of a region-wide war in the Middle East, with Israel having sworn to strike Iran for launching a barrage of missiles at Israel last Tuesday after Israel assassinated the leader of Iran-backed Hezbollah. On Monday, Israelis marked the first anniversary of the Hamas attack that triggered a war, which risks igniting a wider conflict in the Middle East.

Title: Take Five: Rate cuts and politics, say no more

(Reuters) -It's a packed week ahead with U.S. inflation data, the start of Q3 earnings, a French budget and possibly a big rate cut from New Zealand. Investors are also on edge as Middle East tensions escalate, while Japan's new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is in the spotlight. Here's all you need to know about the week ahead in global markets from Lewis Krauskopf in New York, Yoruk Bahceli in Amsterdam, Karin Strohecker and Amanda Cooper in London and Kevin Buckland in Tokyo. 1/ ONE YEAR OF WAR One year on from Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel and the region looks on the brink of a sprawling war that could potentially reshape the oil-rich Middle East. The conflict, which has killed more than 42,000 people, the vast majority in Gaza, is spreading. Israeli troops are now in neighbouring Lebanon, home to Iran-backed Hezbollah; Iran launched a large scale missile attack on Israel last week. Global markets have remained broadly unfazed. Oil prices, the main conduit for tremors further afield, jumped about 8% last week, but soft demand and ample supply globally have kept a lid on gains. A further escalation between Iran and Israel could change that, especially if Israel strikes Iran's oil facilities, an option that U.S. President Joe Biden said was under discussion. The scars of the conflict are visible on Israel's economy, which has suffered a number of sovereign downgrades and seen its default insurance spike and bonds slide. 2/ BUSY TIMES The U.S. third-quarter earnings season is about to kick into gear, posing a test for a stock market near record highs and trading at elevated valuations. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) report on Friday. Other results earlier in the week include PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL). S&P 500 companies overall are expected to have increased Q3 earnings by 5.3% from a year earlier, according to LSEG IBES. Thursday's September U.S. consumer price index, meanwhile, will be closely watched for signs that inflation is moderating. Robust jobs numbers could mean smaller rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, which kicked off its easing cycle last month. Elsewhere, investors will seek to gauge the economic fallout from a dockworker strike after U.S. East Coast and Gulf Coast ports reopened on Thursday. 3/ A RECKONING France's new government presents its long-awaited budget to parliament on Thursday. It's planning a 60-billion-euro belt-tightening drive, around 2% of GDP, next year. It reckons spending cuts and tax hikes should bring the deficit, seen rising to 6.1% this year in the latest upward revision, to 5% by end-2025. The target date for reaching the euro zone's 3% deficit limit is also being pushed back to 2029 from 2027. That's bad news just ahead of rating reviews kicking off with Fitch on Friday. Markets are not impressed. Having eased slightly, the extra premium France pays for its 10-year debt over Germany's widened back to just under 80 bps, near its highest since August. Ultimately, what may matter more is whether Prime Minister Michel Barnier can pass the budget, given a divided parliament that has investors questioning how long his government will last. Left-wing lawmakers filed a no-confidence motion against Barnier's government on Friday, but it is not expected to pass. 4/ FEELING SHEEPISH A reluctant joiner to global easing, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is catching up fast. It meets on Wednesday, and traders reckon the central bank could follow the Fed's example and cut rates by half a point. The RBNZ cut rates by 25 bps to 5.25% in August, a year ahead of its own projections. Markets price in a drop below 3% by end-2025. This will still be above where traders think U.S. and euro area rates will be. Shorter-term investors are neutral towards the kiwi, but hedge funds have lapped it up this year. Positioning and potentially higher rates than others might insulate New Zealand's currency. So could the return of so-called carry trades and in this case, essentially a bearish bet on the yen in favour of bullish ones on high-yielders such as the kiwi. 5/ POLL POSITIONING When Shigeru Ishiba surprised markets by winning the contest to become Japan's prime minister, investors rushed to reposition themselves for higher interest rates. A week on and the landscape looks different, as Ishiba back-flipped not just on monetary policy, but on prior market-unfriendly support for higher corporate and capital gains taxes. It's perhaps not surprising for a hawk to hide his talons with a snap election looming on Oct. 27. Even so, Ishiba was unabashedly blunt, saying after a meeting with the Bank of Japan - whose independence Ishiba has pledged to honour - that the economy is not ready for further rate hikes. The yen, which had been surging, slid past 149 to a seven-week trough on Monday. Japanese stocks rebounded from their steepest slide since early August. Check back in a month from now for any further policy flip-flops.

According to "Naftemporiki" sources, the highest participation was recorded by private investors rather than institutional investors, while in the international book the lead (over 70%) was held by the "heavy" names, such as Lazard Asset Management, RWC, Wellington, Capital World, Blackrock and Fidelity, among others According to “Naftemporiki” sources, the highest participation was recorded by private investors rather than institutional investors, while in the international book the lead (over 70%) was held by the “heavy” names, such as Lazard Asset Management, RWC, Wellington, Capital World, Blackrock and Fidelity, among others. A smaller percentage was secured by investors with a short-term investment horizon such as hedge funds. It is recalled that of the total shares allocated, 15% ended up in the hands of investors in Greece and the remaining 85% to foreign investors. The placement was oversubscribed by 10.4 times in total (12 times in the international offer and 1.5 times in the Greek offer). The final sale price of the HFSF shares was significantly lower than the initial estimates, at 7.55 euros from 7.95 euros that the shareholder had initially set the threshold. Both the war conflicts in the Middle East and the shareholder’s overestimation of the success of the transaction played a role in this development. According to market sources, the HFSF “fell a victim” of its success with Piraeus Bank where the placement was completed with a marginal premium.

Title: BlackRock: Bitcoin is ‘gold alternative,’ Ethereum a ‘technology bet’ – Why?

Time Published: 2024-10-07T03:00:18Z

Here’s BlackRock’s insights and selling points for BTC and ETH. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, recently presented unique yet different pitch decks for Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH]. The dual pitch deck was presented during a digital assets conference held in Brazil. BlackRock’s Robbie Mitchnick presented BTC as a ‘risk-off’ asset, putting it at par with or better than gold. On the other hand, ETH was pitched as a ‘risk-on’ asset, similar to U.S. stocks. The asset manager praised BTC as a global monetary alternative and an excellent hedge against declining trust in governments and fiat currencies’ relentless debasement (devaluation). Source: BlackRock On the contrary, ETH was showcased as a speculative bet on blockchain technology adoption, an investment that Mitchnick equated to US stocks. He noted, “On one hand, you have BTC, a commodity like gold and an alternative to stocks and bonds. Ethereum, more of a long-term technology bet that this blockchain will provide more use cases and more value to the economy going forward.” Part of the crypto community echoed Mitchnick’s presentations, underscoring that BTC is ‘money’ with less inflationary pressure than fiat currencies, which lose value annually. But it also settled the raging debate that has been going on for a while: ETH isn’t money. In fact, since the introduction of Blobs earlier this year, ETH’s inflation has hiked, making it less of an “ultra-sound money.” If the projections hold, BTC could rally more during future geopolitical tensions, while ETH could decline in such scenarios. BlackRock’s perspective is crucial since it is a trendsetter and widely accredited. Along with Grayscale, the asset managers are perceived to be responsible for the US shift and final approval of US spot BTC ETFs. Since the ETFs debuted, BlacRock’s ETFs have outperformed every alternative offering and crossed key milestones. At the time of writing, its BTC ETF, iShares Bitcoin Trust [IBIT], had a cumulative netflow of $21.5 billion with nearly $23 billion in net assets. That said, since it began trading in July, BlacRock’s ETH ETF, ETHA, has netted $1.1 billion in total inflows. Ergo, the world’s largest asset manager, could influence how other investors view the sector. According to some market observers, the message seems clear — Bitcoin is money, while the rest of crypto is speculative. In the meantime, BTC was valued at $62K, down 5% on the weekly charts. On the other hand, ETH was valued at $2.4K, down 8.5% over the same period. Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

However, escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could weigh on investor sentiment this month. Nonetheless, investors could benefit by ignoring short-term noise and tracking the recommendations of top Wall Street analysts to pick stocks with attractive long-term growth potential. Bearing that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. This week's first pick is CyberArk Software (CYBR), a cybersecurity company that is mainly focused on identity security. The company delivered better-than-expected quarterly results and raised its full-year guidance, indicating solid demand for its products. Recently, RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg initiated coverage of CYBR stock with a buy rating and a price target of $328, calling it a top mid-cap cybersecurity idea. The analyst thinks that the company is in a "good position to consolidate identity spending and maintain durable and increasingly profitable growth." Hedberg expects CyberArk to sustain strong growth, driven by the demand for identity security and substantial room to grow within its core Privileged Access Management (PAM) market. Additionally, the analyst thinks that the company can grow beyond the PAM market by pursuing cross-sell opportunities in the Access, Secrets, Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) and machine identities markets. Hedberg also expects the company to benefit from its acquisition of Venafi, a machine identity specialist. He anticipates that Venafi's growth will rebound to more than 20% and be accretive to CyberArk's growth and margins over time. Overall, Hedberg is optimistic about a further rise in CyberArk's profitability and expects the company's organic growth to be above 20% for several years, backed by an estimated total addressable market (TAM) of $60 billion. Hedberg ranks No. 164 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 62% of the time, delivering an average return of 14.7%. (See CYBR Hedge Fund Activity on TipRanks) We move to the ride-sharing and food delivery platform Uber Technologies (UBER). After hosting meetings with the company's management, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth reaffirmed a buy rating on UBER stock with a price target of $95. Highlighting the key takeaways from the meetings, Anmuth said that management is confident about achieving a three-year compound annual growth rate of mid- to high-teens for gross bookings, backed by a stable macro and demand backdrop since the second-quarter earnings. In particular, management stated that demand continues to be healthy in both the Mobility and Delivery businesses. Anmuth also noted the company's optimism about expanding its advertising business across Uber Eats and grocery. Notably, the ad business is on a run-rate of $1 billion (as of the second quarter) or about 1% of delivery gross bookings. In fact, delivery profits have improved over the recent quarters due to the high-margin ad business. Uber expects its grocery ad business to account for 5% of gross bookings over time. The analyst also pointed out the company's growing interest in autonomous vehicles (AV). "Uber can add value to AV tech providers by driving higher demand/utilization and building out the AV ecosystem through fleet operations," Anmuth said, based on discussions with management. Anmuth ranks No. 93 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 62% of the time, delivering an average return of 18.4%. (See UBER Stock Buybacks on TipRanks) This week's third stock pick is social media company Meta Platforms (META). At the recently held Meta Connect event, the company highlighted Quest 3S, its latest virtual reality headset, as well as other innovations, including its latest prototype of augmented-reality (AR) smart glasses (Orion) and the new features of its Meta AI chatbot. Following the announcements at the event, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian reaffirmed a buy rating on Meta stock and boosted the price target to $605 from $530. The analyst attributed the higher price target to a number of factors, including significant opportunities to expand core monetization with artificial intelligence (AI)/generative AI features and the ongoing momentum in Messaging. His improved outlook also reflects "generally positive social media ad checks," with September looking better than the trends noted in August. The analyst raised his 2025 revenue and 2024 and 2025 earnings per share estimates to reflect stable macro trends, higher contributions from Messaging and enhancements related to devices and AI-driven platform. However, he slightly lowered his 2025 operating margin estimate to reflect increased networking and depreciation expenses. Commenting on Meta Connect, Sebastian said he thinks that this year's event reflects the significant progress the company has made with its Reality Labs division and AI/generative AI. Specifically, the analyst thinks that the Llama update provides a further edge to Meta's LLMs (large language models) over close rivals like Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI's ChatGPT, and Google's Gemini. He is also optimistic about the innovations related to Meta AI assistant and expects it to be the most popular AI assistant by the end of 2024. Sebastian ranks No. 277 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 57% of the time, delivering an average return of 13.6%.

Title: Robust Job Gains Remove Recession Fears

The jobs report was so broadly strong that it signaled the end of the recent labor market cooling ... [+] trend. The September jobs report on Friday put to rest any fears that the labor market might be on a path to cool enough to endanger U.S. economic growth. On the contrary, the report was so broadly strong as to give rise to worries that the Federal Reserve might pause further cuts and reignited wage growth might be a looming danger. Employment grew by 254,000 nonfarm jobs, which was well above expectations, and the upwardly revised 159,000 in August. The household survey data was also robust at a gain of 430,000 jobs, with the research series, which mirrors the payroll report criteria, soaring by a whopping 666,000. Monthly Job Growth The unemployment rate was reported at 4.1% but was close to 4.0% at 4.05%, down from 4.2%. Unemployment Rate Wages crept up to 4.0% year-over-year, above the expectations of 3.8%, which reinforces the strength of the labor demand but might raise questions about renewed inflation pressures. The only blemish on the jobs report was the average workweek hours falling to 34.2, a four-year low also seen in July and January. Hours & Wage Growth The high-frequency initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits confirm that the cooling trend in the labor market has stabilized, with both measures off their respective peaks. Initial Jobless Claims Before the recent decline, the unemployment rate had risen enough off the lows to trigger the Sahm Rule, which has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession. However, there are several reasons to believe that the Sahm Rule might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Monitoring the prime-age, 25 to 54 years old, employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The rising prime-age employment-to-population ratio is further evidence that the labor market does not yet pose an imminent threat to the health of the economy. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio: 3 Month Average Stocks had another positive week, with the S&P 500 near all-time highs by Friday’s market close. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), moved higher as well. Stock Returns Looking below the surface, the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks outperformed defensive stocks, which are less impacted by the economy. The lower probability of recession after the healthy jobs report is reflected in the better performance of economically sensitive companies. Cyclicals Versus Defensives The crucial economic reports before the next Federal Reserve meeting on November 7 include Thursday’s consumer inflation (CPI) and another monthly jobs report. Consensus estimates expect September CPI to slow to 2.3% year-over-year from 2.5%. The Cleveland Fed’s CPI supports this view and should leave the door open to a 25 basis point cut at the November meeting. U.S. CPI Estimate Futures pricing reacted to the strong jobs report by slashing the expected pace of 2024 rate cuts. A short-term interest rate cut of 25 (0.25%) basis points at the November and December Fed meetings is implied. In response to the slower expected pace of rate cuts, the 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields rose to 3.92% and 3.97%, respectively. Expected Fed Rate Cuts Friday’s job report increases the probability that the Federal Reserve can engineer a soft landing with the U.S. economy remaining remarkably resilient. The Atlanta Fed’s estimate of third-quarter GDP is at 2.5%, according to their last update on October 1. As the fears of recession recede and have been reflected in all-time high stock prices, earnings will likely need to be the next catalyst for higher prices. Third-quarter earnings season kicks off at the end of the week as if on cue. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOGL) within its recommended investment strategies.

Title: Bose Reinvented Itself Just in Time. Now Comes the Tricky Part

Bose might have turned 60, but the audio company seems to be firmly settling into its graduate school era. After late founder Amar Bose donated majority ownership to MIT in 2011—a little-known fact—it became higher-ed’s most valuable audio brand, and broadened its focus. Gone are the days of wired speakers, or a few paltry headphone options to pair with your stylish Bose Wave CD radio. In the past four years with CEO Lila Snyder—a former 15-year McKinsey consultant who is herself an MIT graduate with a master’s in mechanical engineering—Bose has seemingly righted a ship that appeared to be banking toward shore. Snyder and her team grabbed the helm after Bose shuttered its retail stores in the middle of a global pandemic. She also helped turn a rickety start in the wireless earbud and Bluetooth speaker space into some of the sleekest, best-sounding models on the market. In a world where management consultants and tech executives are known for stripping companies for parts and raising prices, Snyder and a slimmed-down Bose have maintained the brand’s noise-canceling superiority in the face of stiff competition from Apple, Sony, and others. What impresses me most about the Bose of 2024 is that it doesn’t have to play to the trends that publicly traded brands do: It has been an innovator for six decades, and it continues to be in everything from product development to retail strategy. It has quietly been deciphering the tricks behind in-car noise cancelation and beam-forming glasses, and has been developing personal line array systems for small-venue musicians. Ten years ago, I'd tell folks that beyond its excellent noise canceling, Bose offered very little for most people. Now? I’d say the company is getting dangerously close to eating Sonos’ lunch. Bose’s boxy new Smart Soundbar can pair with its Ultra Open earbuds for immersive sound in a small space. There are very few brands that have pushed personal audio technology so far forward in the past six decades. From vinyl record players to CDs, and now the streaming and portable listening era, Bose has made competitive products for higher-end listeners, even though it made a few missteps along the way—a few absolutely huge and uncomfortable pairs of early wireless earbuds, for example. It can be a surreal culture to join, Snyder says. The first female CEO of Bose, Snyder grew up a tinkerer who saved up for her first Bose radio. “I grew up with Bose as an aspirational brand, and an iconic one. And it's funny to join a company when you have stories from your background, right?” Still, even though Snyder no longer has to save up for access to the latest kit, apparently new hires and old get the same repetitive query from folks in their personal orbits. “Every Bose employee will tell you that the most common question they get is, ‘Do you get a discount?’” Snyder jokes. The company has always had premium prices, but in certain categories the products haven't always matched the brand's prestige: 2010s attempts at noise-canceling earbuds were bulky, sounded middling, and had poor battery life; and it also sold a line of too-expensive Bluetooth speakers with screens that nobody needed. Then, after its physical storefronts were not having the billboard-like effect Bose wanted, the brand, just prior to Snyder joining, decided to dramatically pivot—a word that can so often be replaced with “panic”—to a strategy that focused on online sales and bolstering exhibits in existing storefronts such as Best Buy in the United States. This seismic shift meant that every single Bose store in the US, Europe, Australia, and Japan shuttered, resulting in 119 store closures and hundreds of layoffs worldwide. So far, under Snyder's stewardship, that swerve toward online and in-store retail has, according to the company, worked out—but it could have gone the other way. Brands like Nike that have pivoted away from brand-owned retail stores have seen sales dives, but the key difference lies in Bose's decision to lean into retail partners. By bolstering exhibits in places such as Best Buy and other stores, as well as leaning into sales on Amazon and other online retailers besides its own website, Bose has been able to maintain a broad reach while also not keeping retail overhead in-house. According to Snyder, this slimmed-down approach has been effective in righting Bose's fortunes, especially when paired with excellent new products. In being a tech company that entirely focuses on audio products, Snyder says that the secret sauce at Bose is research. Engineers are constantly looking for innovation in materials, acoustics, design, production, and more. When asked about recent innovations in solid-state driver technology, for example, she isn’t shy about its prodigious market research. “What's interesting about Bose is we have been an audio company for 60 years,” says Synder. “We know we're going to be in competitive markets. We've always been in competitive markets, whether that's headphones, or in the home, or in the car. What makes us different is we're all about audio. You can be assured we experiment with everything. When we believe something’s ready, we bring it forward. We’re always looking for technology that can change the game.” This is particularly evident when it comes to noise canceling, which was pioneered by the brand for aviators—a market Snyder says Bose is proud to remain dominant in—rather than folks in the main cabin of the plane. By investigating what pilots needed to operate safely and comfortably in the cockpit, and constantly asking them for improvements and ideas, Bose was able to develop and trickle down what remain the best noise-canceling algorithms WIRED has ever tested. That makes sense, given that latest generation of Bose Quietcomfort over-ears and earbuds offer genuine professional-grade aerospace technology. Snyder says the brand uses professionals, or semi-professinals in the case of its PA gear for small-venue musicians, not only to improve its products but also to market to folks who are interested in higher-end audio. “They're a professional musician. They have a great ear. They know what great sound sounds like. Those products create a sort of halo.” However, a significant marketing tool Bose used for considerable time was NFL games, where it was the sideline sponsor for headsets for eight years, ending the partnership early this decade. The partnership has since been taken over by Sony. Bose CEO Lila Snyder at Bose headquarters Snyder with Bose’s latest over-ear headphones The other problems Bose faces are ones that top-tier makers in all industries suffer from: It must keep innovating to maintain its place atop the mountain of noise canceling; and it must continue to make other products, such as speakers and soundbars, that do the same. Current projects that excite Synder include the company’s developing work in car audio, aiming to help reduce the road noise in cars that’s even more apparent in the quieter electric vehicle era. “We have been, and we'll continue to be, everywhere that music is important to our customers,” Synder says, not-so-subtly hinting at new tech to come. “We're excited about what we're about ready to bring to the market.” In the weeks since our conversation, Bose has announced a new affordable pair of noise-canceling earbuds that have gotten rave early reviews (our review is forthcoming), as well as a new soundbar option that features an AI-based dialog mode. Bose also announced that you can pair its Ultra Open earbuds to the soundbar to use them as faux-rear speakers in surround sound—just the type of genre-bending listening she was alluding to. We expect to see more innovation and are keen to see what happens when Bose combines its beam-forming audio tech we've seen in its Frame sunglasses, and the noise-canceling and personal audio experiences it has been testing for the car. As has been true for much of its six decades, I have a feeling the best of Bose is yet to come.

Title: How to handle a potential Chinese 'bazooka'

Investing.com -- The recent stimulus announcements out of China have left investors raising questions about how to position themselves in case Beijing unleashes a more aggressive economic boost—a so-called “bazooka” stimulus. In a Tuesday note, Barclays analysts acknowledge that this is not their base case, but they emphasize that investors should prepare for such a scenario due to its potential to significantly impact global markets. Despite the recent rally in Chinese equities, the broader market reaction has been relatively subdued, leaving room for opportunities in other asset classes. Chinese equities have shown some of their largest movements in history, with the CSI 300 posting a staggering 1-week sigma move of +17.6. “The magnitude of these moves suggests that investors were unprepared for such announcements, and also that technicals, such as positioning, may have acted as a tailwind,” Barclays analysts noted. “Additionally, it also indicates that while there may be further room for upside, the bulk of the move in the near-term may be over.” The rally has largely been confined to Chinese equities and their proxies, such as European miners, but Barclays believes the real impact could come if China unveils a massive fiscal stimulus plan, like a CNY10 trillion package over two years. In such a scenario, the effects could spill over into global markets, creating opportunities in non-Chinese assets. “Notably, in a 'bazooka' scenario stimulus would likely have more farreaching effects on global assets, making upside opportunities on non-Chinese assets more attractive, given less extended moves and cheaper vol.,” analysts continued. They outlined several strategies to capitalize on this potential, focusing on oil, industrials, and U.S. stocks with high exposure to China. Among those, analysts discussed buying U.S. Oil Fund (USO (NYSE:USO)) calls, conditional on a stronger euro against the dollar, as oil is particularly sensitive to positive surprises in Chinese demand. A second opportunity lies in industrials, where Barclays advises buying hybrid XLI (Industrials) vs. SPY (S&P 500) call spreads. The Chinese credit cycle has historically been a strong leading indicator for industrials' performance, and a major stimulus could give this sector a significant boost. Finally, for investors looking for direct exposure to U.S.-China trade, Barclays screens for companies with high Chinese sales exposure and attractive volatility profiles. Top candidates include Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN), Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), and Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS), which could see significant gains if China’s economy rebounds on the back of stimulus.

Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week. InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today! Mizuho desk analysts said Friday they view Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock as an "out of favor long idea," noting that negative headlines and concerns over declining iPhone sales have already been factored into the price. They expect iPhone sales for fiscal 2025, particularly for the iPhone 16, to remain relatively stable, forecasting flat to low single-digit declines year-over-year—better than many fear. According to the analysts, after a challenging period through March 2025, Apple's stock could rebound, driven by the preview of a new iOS in June and the release of a more AI-integrated iPhone 17 in September 2025. “Patience will be rewarded, near-term downside risk [is] limited as buy-side super negative and short,” the analysts commented. The team at Mizuho now anticipates a 6% decline in iPhone production for 2024, revising their estimate to 220 million units, down from the previous 90 million forecast for the iPhone 16 model. Despite the downgrade for 2024, they project a recovery in 2025, with unit sales expected to rise by 8% to 239 million. This growth would be supported by the introduction of a new iPhone SE and the expected launch of the iPhone 17. Looking further ahead, the forecast for 2026 suggests iPhone sales could reach roughly 250 million units. The analysts also estimate that Apple’s upcoming iPhone 17 will sell around 97 million units in 2025, which represents a 10% increase over the revised estimate for the iPhone 16. Moreover, they foresee Apple starting to use its own internal modem chips with the iPhone 18, phasing out Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) modems by the time the iPhone 18 launches. Apple is also expected to introduce a foldable iPhone in 2027, potentially spurring further investment in G6 OLED panels. Mizuho's team believes new AI features in iOS could drive stronger upgrade and replacement cycles beginning with the iPhone 17. “Buyside feedback could not be more negative on AAPL and iPhone supply chain,” analysts continued. “Feels like a lazy and super crowded short where buyside unit estimates for CY25 iPhone likely expect negative unit growth in low-single-digits year-on-year vs sell side consensus that was 5% growth and now likely flat year-on-year.” JPMorgan issued a cautionary note for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) on Thursday, adjusting its price target while still predicting a potential significant downside for the stock. The bank maintained its Underweight rating on Tesla but raised the price target from $115 to $130. Still, the new price implies a downside risk of nearly 50% from Tesla’s last closing share price. "TSLA shares fell -3.5% Wednesday vs. the S&P 500 flat, ostensibly upon the release of sales and production figures indicating 3Q global deliveries tracked modestly less than our estimate and in line with Bloomberg consensus but, from our conversations, may have represented more of a miss vs. investor expectations," JPMorgan stated. JPMorgan also warned that Tesla might see its first-ever full-year decline in unit volumes, which could threaten its hypergrowth valuation. Tesla's third-quarter deliveries of 464,000 units slightly missed JPMorgan's estimate but matched Bloomberg’s consensus forecast. However, analysts believe the figures may have underperformed relative to broader investor expectations. "The continued softer trend now appears to position Tesla to potentially not grow full-year unit volumes for the first time in its history," JPMorgan explained, suggesting that this could prompt investors to reconsider Tesla's standing as a growth stock. The report highlighted Tesla's resilience in the stock market, despite its deteriorating performance over the past two years. "While TSLA shares are flat to slightly higher over the past two years, expectations have crumbled for every performance metric," the note pointed out, citing declines in unit volumes, revenue, gross margin, and free cash flow. The analysts also stressed that Tesla's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) for 2024 are now forecasted at $7.3 billion—a sharp 74% drop from the $28 billion projected two years ago for the same period. Bank of America (BofA) analysts reaffirmed their Buy rating for Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) stock ahead of the company’s “Advancing AI” event on October 10. The analysts noted that AMD's previous AI event, held on December 6, led to significant stock gains of 19% and 80% over the following one and three months, respectively, outperforming the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index’s 10% and 37% increases during the same periods. The upcoming event is expected to feature roadmap updates in AI and server CPU, alongside comments from key cloud customers, which “could reinvigorate AMD stock,” the analysts said. AMD has recorded a modest 9% year-to-date (YTD) increase, trailing behind the SOX index's 22% rise. Despite growing competition in the AI accelerator market, BofA highlighted the potential for AMD to expand its market share. Consensus estimates project AMD’s AI sales to reach $5.1 billion in 2024, with the possibility of doubling to $10 billion in 2025. The current consensus for AMD’s AI sales over the 2024-2026 period stands at $5.1 billion, $9.7 billion, and $12.8 billion, respectively, which suggests AMD’s market share in AI accelerators will likely stay around 5-7%. This is significantly lower than its 20%+ market share in consumer CPUs and gaming GPUs. Although AMD has made strides in AI, BofA analysts cautioned that further expanding its market share could be difficult, given NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corporation’s commanding 80-85%+ market share and strong presence in cloud, along with competition from cost-optimized custom ASICs from companies like Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL). However, if AMD demonstrates a viable strategy to capture more than 10% of the AI market share by 2026, it could add approximately $5 billion in sales, with potential earnings per share (EPS) in the range of $8-$9, compared to the current consensus of $7.37. “Faster growth could also help AMD rerate towards 30-55x forward price-to-earnings (PE) it managed to trade during prior periods of rapid share gains and 40%+ annual sales growth,” BofA analysts said. “We expect AMD to emphasize its improving end-end positioning including recent acquisitions (ZT Systems, Silo AI), open-source software (ROCm) and networking (infinity fabric),” they added. Loop Capital analysts reiterated their bullish outlook on Super Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI) this week, maintaining a Buy rating and affirming that the stock is still on track to reach $1,000 (pre-10-for-1 stock split), despite recent news of a U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation. In their note, Loop Capital downplayed the significance of the DOJ inquiry, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. The analysts speculated that the investigation likely pertains to shipments to countries such as China and Russia but emphasized that this is unlikely to impact Super Micro’s ongoing operations. “SMCI would be able to keep doing what it needs to do to get the 10-K filed while handling anything with the DOJ separately,” the analysts wrote. They also pointed out that Super Micro might have already been aware of the DOJ probe. Although the company has yet to publicly acknowledge the investigation, Loop Capital noted that management seemed "constructive" during recent investor events in September, suggesting that the AI server maker could already be addressing the situation. “We believe there is a legitimate possibility SMCI was already aware of anything that may now be going on with the DOJ,” the analysts added. Loop Capital remains optimistic about Super Micro’s long-term prospects, projecting normalized revenues of $40 billion, with a return to 14% gross margins and 10% operating margins. The analysts argue that these fundamentals could result in a $50 normalized earnings per share (EPS) and a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 20x, supporting their view that SMCI is “a $1,000 stock.” Northland Capital Markets upgraded Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) to Outperform following the launch of Agentforce, a platform integrating Agentic AI technology. Northland highlights that Agentforce has not only matched Microsoft’s advancements in AI but may have surpassed them in terms of AI evolution. Officially rolled out on September 12th, the platform allows for the deployment of GenAI agents across sales, service, marketing, and commerce workflows. Agentforce is powered by the Atlas reasoning engine and the xLAM series of Large Action Models. This technology eliminates the need for coding to build agents on the platform. In addition, the system’s ability to transfer tasks to human agents when dealing with complex or ambiguous scenarios is seen as a key innovation, ensuring high levels of relevance and accuracy in its autonomous agents. Northland Capital Markets also mentioned the platform’s pricing model, which is based on consumption and averages $2 per conversation. This structure is designed to capture part of the value that GenAI delivers to customers. The analysts expect this development to significantly expand Salesforce’s total addressable market (TAM) for software from $0.8 trillion to $3.2 trillion, representing a four-fold increase. “We believe CRM is well positioned to capitalize on the more than 4x in software TAM we expect GenAI will drive,” Northland’s team wrote in its report. The firm extended its discounted cash flow (DCF) forecast from 8 years to 13 years, showing confidence that Salesforce is no longer constrained by average revenue per user (ARPU) limitations. As a result, Northland Capital Markets raised its 12-month price target for Salesforce to $400, up from $270.

All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ 00:00:02 [Speaker Changed] Bloomberg Audio Studios, podcasts, radio News. 00:00:09 [Speaker Changed] This is Masters in business with Barry Riol on Bloomberg Radio. 00:00:15 [Speaker Changed] This week on the podcast, I have a delightful guest. Kyla Scanlan is the person who created the phrase vibe session in 2022. She wrote the book In This Economy How Money and Markets really work. She is quite an accomplished 26-year-old who has built a career as a investing and economic literacy expert, helping to educate people about how the economy really works, why there’s a disconnect in what people feel versus what’s really happening, what we should think about things like sentiment and the dollar and green energy and go down the list. I thought this was a fascinating conversation. I really enjoyed it, and I think you will also, with no further ado, my interview with Kyla Scanlan. 00:01:07 [Speaker Changed] Thanks for having me. 00:01:08 [Speaker Changed] Well, thank you so much for coming. I’ve been looking forward to this since I got the book over the summer. I will tell you, I didn’t see many other people on the beach in the Hamptons reading this, but I enjoyed it. It’s filled with fun. Not only concepts, but sketches and illustrations, and I could tell you had some fun writing this. Yeah, 00:01:27 [Speaker Changed] I 00:01:27 [Speaker Changed] Did. So let’s talk a little bit about your background. You, you graduate western Kentucky in 2019, triple major financial management, economics and business data analytics. That sounds like you knew exactly what you wanted to do. 00:01:43 [Speaker Changed] Well, I didn’t. I didn’t. You did not. Yeah, I didn’t even know you could major in economics till I got to college. 00:01:48 [Speaker Changed] But in college, those three things scream markets and the economy. Right? 00:01:53 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I mean, it was like kind of funny. I don’t know why there was such a big disconnect, but I was trading options when I was in high school. Right. And I got to college and I was like, oh, I’ll just be an engineer. Like I’ll, you know, do that path. And then I took an econ class as a general education course and I just loved it. And then I was like, oh, you can actually major in finance and like you can trade options for a living. Which I didn’t end up doing for obvious reasons. But yeah, so I really fell in love with the data and with the analysis and just the classes were so fun. I had a great time. 00:02:25 [Speaker Changed] You know, the old options traders joke, right? 00:02:29 [Speaker Changed] No, I 00:02:29 [Speaker Changed] Don’t really, what is it? Option traders never die. Oh, they just expire worthless. Right? I mean that’s a, that’s a classic. We’ve all dabbled with options. I, I, I find them compelling and addictive, but I, you know, 90% investor, 10% degenerate speculator. Yeah. Options are perfect for that. Yeah. How, how did you do as an option? Straighter? 00:02:50 [Speaker Changed] I did poorly, which is why I don’t really do it anymore. I’m more of a buy and hold sort of person. There you go. Yeah. But options were fun. It taught me a lot about risk. It, it taught me a lot about management. It was great. 00:03:01 [Speaker Changed] So, so you, you graduate, you joined Capital Group as an associate pretty much right into the pandemic. Tell us what you were doing at Capital Group and, and what was it like starting work right into that mess? 00:03:13 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, it was hard. I remember I graduated, you know, basically June of 2019 and I moved out to LA from Kentucky like five days after I graduated school. I’d never been to LA before. That’s where Capital Group is based. And you know, six months later a pandemic happens. But Capital Group was wonderful. There was a rotational program that I was a part of called the CAP Group. And so I got to experience fixed income. I got to sit on an equity desk, I got to do macroeconomic research. I got to do a big stock project. But I ended up leaving to focus more on financial education because that’s where I felt I wanted to be, um-Huh. Which was really surprising. I thought I’d spend the rest of my life at Capital Group. It was kind of the perfect path. And then I was like, I just, I can’t know what happens without like trying to do this, trying to do the financial education stuff. 00:04:01 [Speaker Changed] I can’t imagine two places more different than Kentucky and la. What was that transition like? It was 00:04:08 [Speaker Changed] Really hard. Yeah. I didn’t understand what it was like to live in a big city. I’d never been to New York at that point. I’d never really left Kentucky those couple years, the whole life that I had there. And yeah, I mean I used to have to be at Capital Group very early in the morning because it’s on the west Coast, right? We do east coast hours. And so I would just like walk around really early in the morning and LA and that’s not so safe. And I got a couple of run-ins there. 00:04:33 [Speaker Changed] Oh, no kidding. Yeah. 00:04:34 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, because I just didn’t know any better. Like nobody gives you a playbook when you move to LA on like how to live there. And so it was, it was a really good experience. The pandemic of course was, was difficult, but it definitely helped me grow a lot faster being in a big city like that. 00:04:50 [Speaker Changed] Did the pandemic and being locked down at home lead to you writing this book? 00:04:56 [Speaker Changed] I think so. Yeah. I had a blog all throughout college that named Majuli actually was reading when I was in college, which was crazy. But it was called Scanlan on Stocks. And so I’d always been really passionate about writing, had always been really passionate about sharing ideas. And then when I got to Capital Group, obviously I was under compliance, they were like, you really can’t be talking about stocks online. That’s like not cool. And I was like, okay, fine. So I started doing these big data analysis pieces and like harvesting data from the various apps I would use that 00:05:25 [Speaker Changed] You could do just not specific stocks. 00:05:26 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, not specific stock stocks. So I do things like with the ride share data with Uber and Lyft that I had like dating app data, like all these different projects. But then during the pandemic, I think a lot of people, myself included were like, oh, you know, maybe I don’t wanna spend the rest of my life doing this thing. And like, I would do want to take a chance because I don’t know what’s going to happen next. And so that’s how I ended up leaving Capital Group, which was really scary. And I joined a tech startup called OnDeck and built out their investment education arm. And then, then I started doing social media basically at the same time. So 00:06:01 [Speaker Changed] It’s funny, I had the exact same experience with compliance at a brokerage firm in the early two thousands when I launched the big picture. Write whatever you want, just don’t recommend or buy or sell any specific stocks. You know, if you stay away from that, you’re fine. Which in hindsight was pretty hip. A lot of places wouldn’t even have given you that much. But data analytics, knock yourself out. Yeah. Whatever you wanna do. Yeah. 00:06:25 [Speaker Changed] Which is cool. So the name of the blog changed the Scanlan on stocks or Scanlan on stats. Sorry? 00:06:30 [Speaker Changed] On stats. 00:06:30 [Speaker Changed] On stats, yeah. It didn’t stay the same. 00:06:32 [Speaker Changed] Can scaling on stocks to scaling on stats. Yeah. So I’m, I’m fascinated by the partnership you have with O’Shaughnessy Ventures. I, I love what Jim is doing with that. Tell us about that experience and and that help you transition to what you’re doing today. 00:06:47 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. No, Jim O’Shaughnessy is amazing. So I approached him with an idea for a financial education startup and he had been, you know, really supportive him, Patrick, both his son. And I was like, Hey Jim, like I’m thinking about starting this tech company that might do financial education. And he was like, do you have a plan? And I was like, sort of. And then this book deal came along and so I was like, it’s gonna be really difficult for me to build a company and then also write a book. And I ended up deciding to focus fully on the book. And so Jim kept me on the team as an entrepreneur in residence. Right. For a year. And so that was neat. It was just kind of like almost a fellowship of sorts that supported me as I did this like book endeavor. 00:07:31 [Speaker Changed] Were you the first entrepreneur in residence that he did? Because now Nessy Ventures almost does like a MacArthur grant Yeah. To a number of people. Were were you literally the first one? 00:07:41 [Speaker Changed] I was the first one, yeah. Wow. Yeah, it, it was really cool. I think what he’s doing is incredible. It’s really nice to see, I guess, I guess you’d call it venture capital money, you know, be used in that way. Like to support 00:07:53 [Speaker Changed] These just less focused on on traditional technology companies. Exactly. And more towards content oriented things. Is that, is that a 00:08:01 [Speaker Changed] Fair description? Yeah, and like maybe stuff that isn’t going to have immediate returns. Like it’s not so much a multiple, which I think traditional VC tends to focus heavily on because that’s their whole game. But I think he is like, okay, like there’s a bunch of people who need just a little bit of money. Right? Right. Like I didn’t, they didn’t gimme a ton of money, but it was enough for me to be like, okay, I’m safe to focus on like this project that is going to take up so much of my time. Right. But also eat away at the other projects that would have earned me money. Huh. 00:08:27 [Speaker Changed] Really kinda interesting. So at your YouTube channel you do a lot of short clips, explainer videos, short form contents on financial topics, really just financial literacy and education. What motivated this idea, this is not your typical, most people go through a cycle of working their way through various aspects of Wall Street before they out of sheer frustration say, Hey, we need a lot more financial literacy and we don’t have it. What led you to financial education so young? 00:09:00 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I mean I think growing up in Kentucky you just kind of see like financial literacy and I sold cars, I sold Hyundais for a summer. And I think that was really formative because people would come in the car lot and they wouldn’t even really know what an interest rate was. Right. And so you were signing these people on 84 month, you know, car leases, 00:09:23 [Speaker Changed] 84 month, believe it or not, Hyundais by the way know it’s, you’re not paying off a Ferrari. You’re paying off a Hyundai. Hyundai, 00:09:29 [Speaker Changed] Right? Yeah. And like you’d have to do all sorts of financing tricks to make sure they could get a card even if their credit wasn’t so good. Right. And so I just saw a lot and I saw a lot of people that could have possibly just been helped if somebody had taught them what an interest rate was, if somebody had taught them like what a car payment meant, if what depreciation was. Right. And so that was when I was 19 and it stuck with me all throughout the rest of my time in college. I worked at a small asset manager in Kentucky called Hilliard Lyons. And I like saw a little bit of stuff there, but it was really the car dealership and just my time growing up in Kentucky that was so formative to this idea that financial education really matters. Like the fact that I didn’t know economics was a major until I got to college. Like isn’t something that should happen. Right. And so I think that’s the goal is just like, talk about econ more, make it more interesting for people. Bring more people into the fold because not only will they learn more and hopefully make better decisions, but it can also put a lot of people on a path that they might not have gone on in the first place. 00:10:34 [Speaker Changed] So I’m a little older than you. Just a touch. When I was in middle school and high school, this is how long ago the boys would get segmented off into shop class. Yeah. Where you would lose a finger if you weren’t paying attention. And the girls, and I’m saying boys and girls purposefully, ’cause we were 10 and 12, they would get shuffled off this way into home economics, which has much less to do with economics than you would imagine it. It’s more about housekeeping and cleaning and cooking, not here’s how to manage a household budget. People are perennially discussing about bringing things like civics back to high school, bringing things like basic budgeting and economics. It never seems to happen. How important is it to teach just basic economics, basic budgeting, basic things that, that we take for granted to, to high school kids? 00:11:34 [Speaker Changed] I think it’s important. Would you agree 00:11:36 [Speaker Changed] A hundred percent? I I, I’m, you know it, it’s amazing. I can’t remember the last time I used calculus. Yeah. But I deal with the budget every day. Yeah. I have a running total of my checking account in my head. I know where my investments are. These are all skills, you know, auto didacticism, teaching yourself this, you kind of forced to. ’cause unless you are study this as a major in college, nobody teaches you how to do this. It’s just trial and error. And hopefully the errors aren’t too, too expensive. So I I’m completely in, in agreement with you on that. And to take it a step further, the big challenge with financial literacy is it has a very short half life. Even people who are fairly financially literate, you know, six to 12 months later, half that stuff is gone. So you have to keep drilling into people, here’s how this works, here’s what happens. There’s a, there’s something you wrote sort of related to what we’re gonna talk about later that I wanna bring out here a quote from the book in this economy, which is you write that people are the economy, so let’s make the economy about the people. Explain the thinking behind that. 00:12:53 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I mean the general idea there is kind of tied into the vibe session where it’s this idea that like how people feel really matters. Like how people feel about their economic circumstances, how they feel about their ability to have upward mobility, basically, like how people are thinking about themselves is going to influence how the economy succeeds or fails. And so I think that’s just something I tried to center throughout the book was that ultimately people and the decisions that they make are the entire economy, right? Like everything that we do is, is the economy, like a coffee cup is an economic transaction, the labor, the beans, the supply chain, all of those things. And throughout the book, I tried to center people because I feel like most of the time in economics education, the reason it doesn’t work in high schools is because the kids are like, this doesn’t really relate to me. I don’t really understand budgeting. Like I don’t have any tangible experience with this. 00:13:51 [Speaker Changed] Sure they do. They have an iPhone, here’s what the iPhone costs, here’s the credit that’s built in, here’s the interest rate impact on it. Here’s supply chains from a million places. Here’s what you pay for apps. Like, I think you could take an iPhone and teach kids everything they need to know about the economy markets and budgeting one device. 00:14:08 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, no, I think that’s a great idea. And that is an experience with the economy and it’s a people-centric one. Right? And so that’s, that’s exactly it. It is like you have to sort of center it on people’s lived experiences, so that way it all feels relatable 00:14:21 [Speaker Changed] And, and you’re, so this theme comes up over and over again. You can’t separate the economy from people. It’s one and the same, isn’t it? Yeah, 00:14:29 [Speaker Changed] I would, I would definitely say so. Some people might argue with that, but I think that that is ignoring the fact that like all the decisions that people make, you know, consumer spending is such a big part of the economy, government spending, all of these things. And those are all people making decisions. Right. 00:14:46 [Speaker Changed] I have to ask you, you are the ripe old age of 26. What led you a few years ago to say, I know I’m gonna write an economics book? 00:14:55 [Speaker Changed] Well, so it actually, I’ve always really loved writing. I, I wrote these books and I was eight about a penguin. And so I’ve always been writing and I wrote a book, a book, you know, quote unquote every year for, I don’t know, five or six years after, after that little penguin book. And so being an author had always been something I’d I’d had was really excited about. I never thought I’d have the opportunity so early. I never actually thought I’d have the opportunity to like be a published author. But the, how it came about was I published this piece with New York Times opinion on the Bob session and Penguin Random House approached me and they were like, have you ever thought about writing a book? And I was like, yeah, I have. And we, we came up with this idea to do a almost like a beginner guide to the economy, but with 60 illustrations all done by me just doing it in a much more fun and accessible way. You know, trying to make an economic guide for the 21st century. 00:15:55 [Speaker Changed] It, it’s funny you mentioned the penguin because in the book you compare the labor market to a goat steadily climbing a mountain. Yeah. While the Fed actively trying to slow the goat down in their progress. So first is this frequent usage of animals and metaphors something you’ve been doing a while, and what made you think of the labor market as a goat and the Fed pulling the rope trying to slow ’em down? 00:16:21 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I, no, lots of metaphors in my, in my writing. I have a substack too, kyla substack.com and I, I always employ some sort of metaphor that I think my readers are like, okay, you know, calm down. So the book was definitely heavy with metaphors, but I really wanted there to be tangible visualizations in the book. So the beginning of the book is this economic kingdom because I think the interconnectivity of the economy is where a lot of people get stuck. It’s like, well how does the inflation, how does inflation, you know, influence labor market? How do they work? Like how does the Fed influence the labor market? How does the Fed influence inflation? How does fiscal policy work? What does the dollar do? And so I drew that at the beginning of the book as kind of like this economic kingdom land where all the castles were interacting and then yeah, the Fed and the labor market mountain or the Fed and the mountain goat. It was just another metaphor on top of that. 00:17:14 [Speaker Changed] So you tackle a number of weighty topics in the book. Let, let’s do a speed round. Tell me what people either get wrong or don’t understand about each of these issues. Let’s start with national debt. 00:17:27 [Speaker Changed] I mean, I think this is a tough one because sometimes people are right, but a lot of people think it’s totally unsustainable. Like the US is gonna go bankrupt. And there’s definitely a plausible like case that the US could go bankrupt, especially ’cause we have that debt ceiling situation that’s coming up in I think 26 days as of time of recording. And so a lot of people get that wrong where they are like, oh, the national debt’s gonna explode. The dollar is gonna not become the reserve currency anymore. 00:17:53 [Speaker Changed] By the way, I’ve been hearing that since I was in college, since Reagan was president. And it’s always, it has yet to be proven wrong. Yeah. I think if you’re wrong for half a century, you’re not early, you’re just wrong. You’re just 00:18:04 [Speaker Changed] Wrong. Absolutely. And like you could say maybe in 500 years the dollar won’t be reserved currency. 00:18:10 [Speaker Changed] And then you’re right. I won’t even give you, I’ll give you 200 years, 250 years. But 00:18:14 [Speaker Changed] If you’re dead and like, are you still right if you’re dead, you know, 00:18:18 [Speaker Changed] More importantly, does it even matter? I don’t know Right at that point. Recessions, what do people get wrong about recessions? Two 00:18:25 [Speaker Changed] Quarters of negative GDP growth. 00:18:27 [Speaker Changed] I, that is a pet peeve of mine that I have been pushing back against for years. It’s a, yeah, it’s, it’s, there have consistently been two quarters of negative GDP that haven’t been recessionary. Yeah. And if you look at what took place in 21 and 22, remember GDP people don’t realize this GDP is reported in real terms, meaning inflation adjusted terms. When you have two negative quarters, maybe it means the economy is slowing down or maybe it means the economy is overheating and prices are going up. Those are two totally different things, aren’t they? Yeah, 00:19:00 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. I think a lot of people get stuck on that one that is unpopular. Yeah, 00:19:04 [Speaker Changed] Very unpopular. What about labor market dynamics? What don’t people understand about that? 00:19:08 [Speaker Changed] I mean, I think the biggest one here is that when the labor force participation rate expands, the unemployment rate can still go up. Go up. Right? That, that’s a tough one. ’cause people are like, oh, like, well that unemployment rate is going up so people are losing their jobs. But sometimes it’s just more people are entering the labor force. Right? 00:19:25 [Speaker Changed] I, I like to call that denominator blindness. Ooh. Because people don’t pay attention, they just see the big scary number. They don’t see the context of the larger data set underneath. Like, hey, this company’s laying out, laying off 10,000 people. Is that a bad thing? Do they have 20,000 people or is it Walmart with 4 million and 10,000 is, you know, a rounding error. It’s one out of one person at every fourth store. Something crazy like that. People ignore the broader context. And you talk about context and framing throughout the book. What about housing market issues and the problem with affordable housing and first time home buyers? 00:20:04 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, housing is something I spend a ton of time on right now. I mean, I think the biggest issue is that, you know, people think that expanding the housing supply will make all home values go down. It’s not necessarily the case, right? It’s very important to expand housing supply. It’s very important that people have access to housing. So I think that’s a big one. There’s a lot of nimbyism that can arise. And then also, this is something that I don’t think a lot of people realize is that if you have a mortgage, you have to have insurance and you, which 00:20:32 [Speaker Changed] Is another crisis you talk about. Yeah, 00:20:34 [Speaker Changed] I’m really concerned about insurance right now. But yeah, I’d say those are the two things with housing. Yeah, 00:20:39 [Speaker Changed] Right there. There was an interesting piece that came out recently, I don’t remember if it was Bloomberg or somewhere else, but I definitely saw it in the past two weeks that the states that build the most amount of houses are having the fastest GDP. So if you look at places like Florida and Texas, and I think we’re probably at peak Florida right now, but hold that aside, Florida cranking up housing left and right. Texas builds a lot of houses. When you look at even fairly robust economies, California and New York, they’re growing much more slowly than those southern states. And they have horrific nimbyism and really challenging to put up new housing. Oh. Unless you’re knocking down another house in just replacing it that you can do, but expanding the amount of housing, big problem in big states. Yeah. 00:21:29 [Speaker Changed] Big problem. And it’s like, it’s kind of funny, I think we maybe saw the same graph where it’s like blue versus red. Like it’s actually a political divide where red states are doing a great job building more housing and, and blue states aren’t. And that’s, you know, we should all be building more housing because that’s kind of the housing theory of everything is something I heavily subscribe to where if people feel like they’re able to get a home, they’re able to afford it, it’s not a big worry. You know, everything will hopefully improve from that. 00:21:54 [Speaker Changed] You, you buy a house, you’re then gonna furnish it. You’re gonna buy durable goods and appliances, you’re probably gonna buy a car or two, you’re gonna spend a ton of money. It means you have a job. It means you have good credit. The housing theory of everything is pretty persuasive. Tell, tell us a little bit about that. 00:22:09 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I mean I, I think it’s, it’s super important. It is that idea that like you will participate in the economy. And I think also for, you know, there’s a chart, the distribution of financial assets from the Federal Reserve. It’s one of my favorite charts and I talk about it all the 00:22:22 [Speaker Changed] Time, is Z one flow of funds or something else. It’s 00:22:24 [Speaker Changed] A distribution of financial assets. Okay. So it shows the breakdown of wealth. 00:22:27 [Speaker Changed] Oh, by deciles or, 00:22:29 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Yeah. So like they’ll have like the bottom 50%, you know, the top 0.1% and if you look at the bottom 50%, all their wealth is in their house, the top 10%. It’s in business ownership and equities. So there’s a lesson to be learned there. But yeah, homes are a wealth generation tool for a lot of people. And I think to the point of like, what do people get wrong about housing is that maybe it can’t be both a speculative asset where, you know, people do invest so much into an expected to appreciate so rapidly and a place to live. I think that’s gonna be a tough dichotomy over the next few 00:23:01 [Speaker Changed] Years. Right. You know, my parents’ generation when they were buying houses for 25, 35, $40,000 and they lived through that big inflationary cycle and then rate crash over from 1980 to 2022 home, you have to live somewhere. Plus, if your home prices appreciate dramatically, hey that’s great for your retirement. I, I’m not so convinced that the current generation are gonna have the same experience. 00:23:29 [Speaker Changed] Oh, I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to buy a home. And I think a lot of people in my generation feel the same way. So I’m technically a Gen Z and one in four Gen Z do own homes, but 78% of them got help from their parents Right. To buy that house. And so I think that’s gonna be the thing for this upcoming generation is that it’s really going to help if your parents did well, they’re the greatest wealth tr the greatest generational wealth transfer is about to happen. 00:23:56 [Speaker Changed] It’s already happening. Right. How is it, what is it I keep seeing 48, 60 8 trillion? Yeah. Crazy, crazy numbers. 00:24:02 [Speaker Changed] 90 trillion by 2045. It’s a lot of wood. It’s a ton of money. Right. And yeah, some people will get a house outta that and I think that’s gonna be maybe the only way that you get a house. People, 00:24:13 [Speaker Changed] Even if you get a down payment out of it, it’s still, oh gosh, it’s gonna help move you in the right, right direction. Absolutely. Public transit. Give us a, what are people getting wrong about public transit? I 00:24:24 [Speaker Changed] Mean, I think people think it’s like not useful to have public transit. Whenever I come to New York, it’s so wonderful because the subway is so efficient. But I think a lot of people are like, no, we should just expand the highways. But if we invested just in light rail in these cities, rather than adding another lane to the highway, you could transmit so many more people and you could free up the gridlock. People really love their cars in the United States because it’s an, you know, it’s a place where you can go, it’s an individualistic thing. But if we are able to invest in public transit, the economy will grow. People will be able to get around better. Just imagine like, you know, not having to rely on a commute in order to go into work. It, it would expand the opportunities for so many people who right now are maybe strapped by not having a car or not wanting to do a certain commute. 00:25:12 [Speaker Changed] Right. And the data shows adding additional lanes to highways just creates additional traffic. It does not, it does not solve the problem. The other thing that’s so interesting about housing is the racial divide. When you look at who’s wealthy and who’s not and where it comes from. African Americans tend to own houses at a much lower percentage rate. When you look at the sources of wealth, let’s call it the, we’ll ignore the top quartile, like the bottom 75%. Very often people who are middle class or above housing, wealth is a big part of it. And you just see much lower ownership rates amongst blacks in America than amongst whites. Has a huge impact on income inequality by racial divides. 00:25:58 [Speaker Changed] Oh no, we have, I think, I believe income inequality has improved, but wealth inequality has worsened since the pandemic, meaning 00:26:06 [Speaker Changed] The difference between salary and your assets. Yeah, 00:26:09 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, yeah. So like a lot of people, you know, didn’t appreciate or didn’t get to benefit from the appreciate of the rise in stock market. Right. Values, they didn’t have a home that was appreciating and value real wages did go up. But you know, that’s not quite enough I think for a lot of people. And it has created a lot of disparity and I think that’s going to, it’s really tough to navigate that. I think the candidates for the election are like trying to figure out like, okay, how do we sort of fix this? And like, one way that the government could address it is by taxing people so they have more money so they could maybe distribute more money. But that’s very unpopular. So like we have to have a total rethink, I think, of these social programs because we’re like just helping people to close that inequality gap because that is going to be a, a massive issue over the next decade. 00:26:57 [Speaker Changed] And, and our last speed round question, green energy. What are your thoughts on renewable or green energy? 00:27:03 [Speaker Changed] Oh, I think it’s so important. I, I mean, I think the thing is a lot of people think it’s all or nothing. You kind of still have to have fossil fuels as you 00:27:11 [Speaker Changed] Try natural gas gonna be a transitional fuel for decades to come. 00:27:14 [Speaker Changed] Transitional is the perfect word for that. Yeah. You have to like still have all that stuff. You can’t just go green right away. But, you know, solar power is becoming extraordinarily useful. You know, hydrogen, all that stuff is solar 00:27:27 [Speaker Changed] Is now cheaper than coal. Yeah. And it’s about to become cheaper than oil. Yeah. Which is a huge, like 20 years ago, that was unthinkable. I know. 00:27:34 [Speaker Changed] And it’s exciting and I think a lot of people are still stuck on, you know, oil being so important. But green energy is, is the only way that we can move forward as a society if we’re just gonna have to rely on the traditional fuels for a little longer. 00:27:47 [Speaker Changed] Tell us about, I I like the way you, you phrase this, the abundance mindset. 00:27:53 [Speaker Changed] That’s Derek Thompson’s term from the Atlantic. Yeah. He’s, he’s tremendous. But that is kinda this idea that we tend to think limiting, right? Like, we’re like, oh, we can’t have all this, we can’t have all this, we can’t have that, we can’t do this. And Derek Thompson argues like, well we can, like we can have abundance, like we can focus on immigration, we can build more housing. Like we can have all these things. We can do green energy, like we can do all of these things. Right? There’s a Keynes quote that’s about that, 00:28:21 [Speaker Changed] About scar, the scarcity mindset, right? 00:28:23 [Speaker Changed] Where it’s like, if, if the gov I think it’s, if the government can pay for it, you can do it essentially. 00:28:27 [Speaker Changed] Is that right? And why can’t the government pay for it? If you think about, you know, it’s ironic how often politicians ignore what Lord Keynes taught us a century ago, which is during economic contractions the government should spend to make up the shortfall and consumer and, and business spending. What politicians always tend to forget is, and when the economy is expanding, well then you pull back and let the private sector fill that gap. The problem is we never seem to pull back. It’s it’s pedal to the metal all the time. 00:28:58 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Which is, that’s going to be interesting with the insurance thing that we were talking about. ’cause the government’s gonna probably have to backstop all of that. And I don’t know how that’ll go, but yet 00:29:07 [Speaker Changed] Why, why should the government backstop that if you, if you move to a part of the world that is being dramatically affected by climate change? Oh, and by the way, if your state governor doesn’t believe it and refuses to do anything to moderate it, why do I as someone in a different part of the country have to bail out your bad decision? It’s one thing when a hurricane hits and, and everybody is shocked. It’s another thing when you’re building waterfront property and no private sector insurer will cover you. ’cause they’re like, no, the, the odds are you’re gone in 10 to 20 years, we’re not gonna take that risk. 00:29:44 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I don’t think the government should backstop those, those that, those decisions. But I, I think it’s going to be really tough because there is that mindset where it’s like, oh, I should be able to build wherever I want. And there’s, you 00:29:58 [Speaker Changed] Can build wherever you want. Well, but you just can’t insure wherever you want. And those are two very different things. 00:30:03 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. But people expect insurance and you can self-insure if you do cash, but Yeah. 00:30:08 [Speaker Changed] A a bank won’t finance you. Yeah. So I remember during Sandy, my wife and I went for a drive along Dune Road out in the Hamptons. And it was shocking to see what essentially is a barrier island that’s been there for hundreds of years. The ocean going straight through it. Oh wow. Like there are parts where you houses were floating away and oh my gosh, big gaps. It was crazy what had taken place there. And the Army Corp of Engineers come in and they rebuild it. The only thing that really has changed is that FEMA has mandated, I think you have to be 11 feet above sea level, above high tide. And so all these houses are built on stilts. And so you could kind of drive up to like the third or fourth step. And so by the time you get to the ground floor, you are relatively safe. If we get another sandy, the house at least shouldn’t wash away, but that doesn’t do any good if the rest of the barrier island washes away. Right. So should I know we have a shortage of housing, do we have a shortage of housing that’s ocean front? 00:31:10 [Speaker Changed] I mean, that’s a good question. It’s, it’s like not only ocean Front though, like insurers have pulled out of California too because 00:31:16 [Speaker Changed] Of wildfires, because of the 00:31:17 [Speaker Changed] Fires. Right. And they’ve pulled outta Louisiana for the same worries about of hurricanes they pulled outta Florida because of the issues with hurricanes too. And so I think it’s just like there’s an increasing climate risk and that’s across, across the board. Right. 00:31:33 [Speaker Changed] It, it’s one thing for politicians to argue about climate risk, but when insurers say, yeah, oh no, we’re not gonna cover that because we’ve done the numbers. This is an opinion. They’re uninsurable in that part of the world or that part of the country. It really raises some fascinating questions. Yeah. 00:31:49 [Speaker Changed] When Florida’s second biggest insurer is the government, it’s citizens insurance. And so that’s kind of the funny situation that we’re going to be in. You know, natural disasters are only in increasing just because of what’s happening to the environment, which is why green energy is so important. And I, I think that’ll just be a big reckoning moment where it’s like, you know, housing is so important, but we also have to have this huge conversation about how we’re going to insure these homes. Right. Because insurance has gone up 20% on average, I think, and since 2023 across the whole country. Right. Like property insurance is a huge burden for a lot of people right now. And that’s something that you have to consider with the broader conversation around what does it mean to own a home in the United States. 00:32:30 [Speaker Changed] Right. I I recall when my mom moved to Florida, you know, decades ago there was a fantastic arbitrage opportunity. The cost of living there was a fraction, real estate was a fraction. Now between taxes, problems with insurance and all the HOA fees, the homeowners association fees for condos and houses have gone up. Hmm. Because their costs have gone so much up. It doesn’t feel like that it’s a bargain anymore. Hey, maybe you get nicer weather when there’s not a hurricane. Yeah. But it doesn’t seem to be the same bargain. 00:33:01 [Speaker Changed] No, I I think Florida’s in a really unique spot as a state because they, there’s nothing that’s being done to like make the homes more insurable. Because one way that you could do that is to maybe invest in climate resilient infrastructure. 00:33:16 [Speaker Changed] No, no. It’s a hoax. We can’t waste money on that. Climate change is a 00:33:19 [Speaker Changed] Hoax. I know. It’s, it’s, it’s a And like, there’s other reasons why insurance has increased other than climate. Like you do have to talk about the reinsurance companies. They there, the people who insure the insurers, they’ve raised rates, you know, inflation has impacted the cost of everything rebuilding the homes. So like, there’s other reasons outside of climate change, but like, we can’t live in this state of denial. Not to like turn into this, into a climate change conversation. But, 00:33:41 [Speaker Changed] But it’s a, it’s a factor and it, I think it’s a more of a factor for your generation than my generation. Yeah. ’cause by the time climate change is really bad, we will be dead and buried for a long time. You’ll still be clear clearing up the mess that I like to blame my parents on. I I’m semi green, you’re probably much greener than me. I have a hybrid. I have an electric vehicle. I also, you know, fly and, and yeah. My house is probably too big relative to what I really need. Yeah. But that’s a very generational thing. You could see how, how Yeah. People’s carbon footprints really vary with, with age. So what happened with the egg situation in 2022? What did people get so wrong about that? 00:34:25 [Speaker Changed] Oh man. I, I think eggs were, it’s funny, like thinking back to it, I’m like, that was so long ago now, but it was, you know, 00:34:31 [Speaker Changed] It was a year or so ago, right. The one, so there was a chicken flu going around Yeah. That was killing Yeah. Millions of hens. Yeah. And people lost their mind when eggs were like seven, $8 a dozen. Yeah, 00:34:43 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. No, people freaked out. They were like, oh, you know, inflation is so bad. Everything is so bad. You know, the eggs, there’s price gouging going on, all this stuff. And it was really just kind of like a supply and demand misbalance because of the chicken flu. 00:34:56 [Speaker Changed] And there was price gouging going on, just not with eggs of all the things to point out to eggs was a legitimate, Hey, you kill 50 million chickens, guess what? Less eggs. Yeah. 00:35:05 [Speaker Changed] And I remember there being egg shortage at the grocery store. People were freaking out, but it all, I mean, it all calmed down like a month. Like it, it really normalized quite quickly. Yeah. 00:35:15 [Speaker Changed] That’s a pretty short gestation period for birds, right? 00:35:19 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. They lay a lot of eggs good for us, I guess when we eat them. But yeah, that was just kind of, I think the, a good example of, you know, people and how important they are for the economy because how people freak out ultimately does impact how everyone feels about things. Because that was kind of like mass hysteria in a really big way too. Like the egg situation. I mean, I remember some of my friends were texting me about it and they were like, Kylo, what’s going on with the eggs? Like economically speaking 00:35:45 [Speaker Changed] By the way that, that would take you a little 30 seconds to figure out on Google. I’m always surprised, like there, there’s an acronym that I haven’t seen recently on Twitter, but it used to be, let me Google that for you. L mgt let me fy And it’s just like, come on, why are you asking me such a readily accessible answer? Ask something more complicated. But people see higher egg prices, they lose their mind. Let’s talk about something else that I found fascinating from the book. People’s eyeballs are now dollar signs. Explain what you mean by that. 00:36:17 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so this is something I talk a lot about in the presentations I give too, because the attention economy is really important. I think that our eyeballs are the most expensive things that we have because advertisers will pay so much to acquire them. And so I think that is both good and bad, right? Like it’s, it’s valuable as a consumer because you kind of are the product. And so a lot of products can be free, like the social networking sites, right. But I think there’s this general sense of exhaustion where people are like, I’m really sick of being advertised to, I know how expensive my attention is and I don’t wanna pay attention anymore. And so I think that’s kind of what we’re seeing with the attention economy is people are quite tired of it because their attention is so valuable. 00:36:57 [Speaker Changed] And, and you mentioned advertising. The younger guys in my office, half their wardrobe comes from Instagram. They see something they like click and, and buy it right From that it’s, it’s, it’s almost as if the advertisers are being removed from the middle. It’s, here’s an influencer wearing this. Oh, I like that. Bang. You’re, you’re purchasing it in real time. 00:37:20 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Instagram shopping is extraordinarily powerful and that’s true. Is is people like, and that’s kind of I think the exhaustion too. Like you do see sort of this influencer pushback. I wrote about this at the end of last year, like the influencer apocalypse that could be upon us where people are very sick of like not knowing what’s an advertisement and what’s not. Right. But there’s also such power in the curation that influencers provide that. I think it’s more just people are like, I, I don’t wanna deal with it, but I think it’s really valuable and the influencers do get paid quite a bit of money to, to be essentially a billboard for these companies. Right. 00:37:55 [Speaker Changed] You know, it’s funny because you and I both do a lot of content marketing, which is a phrase I don’t love. But anybody who pays attention to someone who does that, it’s because, hey, I’ve been following them for a while. I understand their process. I trust their judgment. They’re not for sale. And if they’re telling me, go read this or go look at that, it’s because they’ve done it and they think it’s valuable. Like, is that gonna go away? Also, what, what point, how far down does the influencer apocalypse go? 00:38:25 [Speaker Changed] I don’t know. I I wrote 00:38:26 [Speaker Changed] He he asked self, interestingly. 00:38:28 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, right. Like, what do you think? Yeah, I wrote this piece in February of this year around trust and ’cause I think trust is a very expensive commodity too. And I think that trust is, you know, there’s not a lot of it going around. It’s very difficult to gain trust. And so I think people will still have, you know, people like you where they trust, they, they trust your judgment. They’re like, you knows what he is talking about. He’s not gonna try and peddle me a product. But like, once you do petal somebody a product, 00:38:55 [Speaker Changed] Now variable annuity is coming to you from Right. Once that happens, 00:38:59 [Speaker Changed] Once that happens, trust 00:39:00 [Speaker Changed] Is gone. You’re done, you’re done. So I, I’ve told this war story a million times, but it’s just so perfect. The same day during the lockdown, I wanna say it was like March or April early in 2020. No, maybe it was May or June, but you know, first half of the year, still early days, I get an email f from two different companies the same day. And one was Delta saying, Hey listen, we know you’re stuck at home and this sucks. And everybody’s really frustrated. One thing you don’t have to worry, worry about are your miles. They’re gonna last forever. And your silver Medallion status now platinum, oh, your silver Medallion status won’t expire, will extend it for another 18 months. You don’t have to worry about it once you’re ready to, once this ends and you’re ready to start traveling, Delta’s ready when you are. 00:39:47 And I’m like, holy cow, that’s fantastic. And then I read the next email from Starbucks and it was, Hey, your Starbucks points, which are nonsensical things that you get a free latte if you, you know, buy enough stuff, they’re gonna expire at the end of the month. So go out and use ’em right away. And it’s like, oh wow, are you kidding me? I don’t, I don’t know if it was the juxtaposition, but I know that since then I fly Delta a whole lot and I go to Starbucks a whole lot less. Mm. And I don’t know if the guy from Chipotle is gonna do anything about that, but it just seemed like such a petty, silly, panicky thing to do. Yeah. Like, wait, the, your cost of food is like the least expensive part of the real estate, the labor, everything you do. My dumb egg white whole wheat McMuffin. You’re gonna just take that because we’re in the middle of a pandemic. Yeah. Nobody’s going to your store. Wouldn’t, don’t you don’t you wanna encourage, I I guess that was their attempt. Use it or lose it. It it that lo I’m curious your thoughts on how does corporate America capture and maintain trust from people who, my generation is arguably more loyal to brands. Like my neighbor’s grown up, he’s a Ford guy, he’s a Chevy guy. I don’t, I don’t know if that, that sort of brand loyalty really let exists anymore. 00:41:13 [Speaker Changed] There’s a really good piece called Life After Lifestyle by Toby Shoren. And he kind of talks about this how like some parts of brands are influencing culture, but it’s not the traditional brands. So it would be brands like, you know how your office guys go on Instagram, it would be like Allbirds Allbirds is now a terrible stock, but Right. That’s just one example. Like where, 00:41:32 [Speaker Changed] Oh God, we’ve had those for like seven, eight years. Yeah. That’s like mid 2 20 10. 00:41:36 [Speaker Changed] But, but that they were, they were kind of like the pinnacle of like forming some part of culture and some sort of brand identity. But as you’re saying, people jumped immediately to the next thing. Right. So I don’t think it’s like cohesive brand stories anymore. It’s kind of like these brands that patch together to create like an archetype of a person. Right, right. 00:41:54 [Speaker Changed] Especially in fashion that changes so rapidly. Although, oh gosh, these aren’t Warby Parkers, but they seem to be doing pretty okay. Yeah. Like some companies develop a relationship. I love my Maui gyms or my AKA shoes. And at a certain point, maybe this is being an old man, but it’s just like you, you just know, just reorder the next one. Yeah. Oh, these shoes are ratty. All right. Bring leave ’em out at the beach house. Order another pair. Yeah. Get a new pair. The beach house. But I don’t know if that’s true for your generation. 00:42:24 [Speaker Changed] No, I, I think it is that, you know, you sort of follow the trends. There’s a really good book by Douglas Rushkoff called Present Shock, where he talks about how everything moves in a fashion timeline now. So like people just recycle, like they, they just move through stuff so quickly because 00:42:39 [Speaker Changed] Literally fast fashion is the, is is what, you know, shine and those companies are all about. Yeah, yeah. 00:42:44 [Speaker Changed] Trends move so fast and you wanna, you know, be on top because your whole life is, you know, on on screen, 00:42:50 [Speaker Changed] On screen to say the least. So what were you looking at that led you to the phrase vibe session? 00:42:58 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I mean, I think for me it was really fortunate because I had all these comments. Like I was making these social media videos, so I’d get hundreds of comments a day of me talking about how GDP was going. Okay. And then people would be like, we’re in a recession, I’m upset. Like, what are you talking about? And so I was like, what’s going on? Like, why? Like the economic data’s okay, but all these people are extraordinarily upset. And so I was on a bike ride one day and I was thinking about that and it’s kind of like this disconnect of, of vibes, right? Like it’s this disconnect between consumer sentiment and economic data. And that gap is really the important part. The vibe session has taken a life of its own, which is really cool, but it’s been used incorrectly a couple of times. 00:43:37 [Speaker Changed] How do people use it incorrectly? They’ll 00:43:39 [Speaker Changed] Be like, people shouldn’t be feeling bad. It’s like, and that’s not the point of that word. 00:43:45 [Speaker Changed] That’s a generational thing, isn’t it? We, you and I were talking earlier, my buddy Dave, our, our friend, mutual friend Dave, Dave Nig was saying, Hey, people over 50 hate five session concept and people under seem to get it. What is it about the way it’s being misused that reflects a lack of comprehension 00:44:05 [Speaker Changed] From my experience of having conversations. ’cause a lot of people don’t like the word I got death threats over it. It was 00:44:12 [Speaker Changed] Ah, toxic social media. Right? But what is better than Twitter since Elmo took it over? Oh God, 00:44:18 [Speaker Changed] It’s a nightmare right now. It was lucky. This was two years ago. You know, just to make that word. ’cause I don’t know what the comments would be like currently, but we’re kind of seeing a real time social experiment with that. Like, it’s almost like four chan come back to life, but none of these people are anonymous. 00:44:35 [Speaker Changed] Well, plenty of ’em are anonymous and, and my guess is 30 40% of them are just bots. 00:44:41 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Yeah. That’s the, the foreign interference is a yeah. Really big thing. 00:44:45 [Speaker Changed] Some domestic, but a lot of China, North Korea, Russia, Russia elsewhere for sure. Russia, arguably I ran, although I I I’m not, not as convinced of, of that. Yeah. So you coined this phrase June, 2022, right? By coincidence, CPI inflation peaked at 9% in June, 2022. How much of vibe session was just utter frustration with rapidly rising inflation? 00:45:14 [Speaker Changed] A lot of it, yeah. So the way that I talk about vibe session now, you know, tears years later, is that it is an element of structural affordability, right? Like inflation is really high, even with inflation going down, that doesn’t mean the prices are going down. Housing is unaffordable as we talked about. Elder care is extraordinarily unaffordable. Childcare costs are up 32% since 2019. So like, there’s a structural affordability that is being captured in people’s vibes that doesn’t necessarily show up in the broader economic data. Like, you don’t look at GDP and say, okay, people can’t afford to put their mom in a nursing home. And there’s also media headlines, like the media has become really negative sentiment has, you know, decreased over time too. And so I think it’s those two things where it is unaffordable and then also there’s a lot of stories about things being really bad and that is creating a obsession. 00:46:09 [Speaker Changed] So it’s interesting you mentioned sentiment. I I, I did a blog post around the same time and I was kind of fascinated that the University of Michigan sentiment survey was lower than the pandemic lower than the financial crisis lower than September 11th. Yeah. Lower than the.com implosion. That seemed to be wildly inappropriate. What do you, what else do you think factored into that disconnect? Well, 00:46:38 [Speaker Changed] I don’t know if you saw the Harris Guardian poll that like a lot, God, I can’t remember the exact number, but a number that is way too high percentage of people think that now is worse than the Great Depression. And so I, I think that that’s kind of what’s going on is people are like looking at circumstances and as we were talking about earlier, maybe not having context for what’s happening right now. Like right now we’re not in a great depression. It’s unaffordable, 00:47:04 [Speaker Changed] But we’re not, we’re not even in a recession. 00:47:06 [Speaker Changed] We’re not even in a recession. 00:47:07 [Speaker Changed] Arguably you were expanding two and a half, 3%. Yeah. Somewhere in that range in the third or fourth quarters of, of 2024. So I, I have to ask you this question. I, I, I forgot I looked up the quote. The, the future is here, it’s just not evenly distributed Yeah. By William Gibson. How much of what you describe vibe session is about the abundance of our economies here. It’s also not evenly distributed. Yeah. I, I’m old enough to recall that the baby boomers are in trouble. They’re never gonna pay the wealthiest generation in history. Everybody got that wrong or a lot of people got that wrong. We see Gen X doing well, we see Gen Z kind of coming up a little bit and now they’re a new generation that’s calling Gen Alpha or something like that. Yeah. So, so how does the distribution of wealth backend loaded to the oldest people who have been working and saving and investing the longest, how does that impact the concept of vibe session? 00:48:11 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, there’s, so there’s a couple of things there, right? Like, there’s a saying where America has a lot of wealth, but not a lot of prosperity. And I think that’s kind of the situation where a lot of people have a lot of money and a lot of assets, but that is not evenly distributed as, as you said. And I think also because people are living longer and, you know, staying in jobs longer, taking longer to retire, there isn’t maybe as up as much upward mobility as there used to be. Well, 00:48:40 [Speaker Changed] You people hurry up and die. No. Is that I’m not, is that what’s the problem here? 00:48:44 [Speaker Changed] No, I, I just, it isn’t, it’s, I don’t think people should die. But it is interesting because there’s, I, I need to do more work on this, but there’s almost kind of like a leadership slash mentorship crisis where it seems like 00:48:59 [Speaker Changed] Certainly with remote work is giantly problematic. Yeah, 00:49:03 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. Because like, how do you train up the next generation if you’re not with them? And also there is an element of resistance to training up the next generation, I think because there’s elements of ageism, like the older people don’t wanna be pushed out of their jobs, right. And they feel like that’s happening. And it’s, it’s tough within, like, within the generations too. Like I think it’s 43% of baby boomers have no retirement savings and then some of ’em have, you know, a, a 00:49:28 [Speaker Changed] Bunch a ton, right? It’s not evenly distributed. No doubt about 00:49:30 [Speaker Changed] That. Yeah. And so I, I think that’s totally true. ’cause in the US we are very much a in all or nothing society. Like you either figure it out or you don’t. Right. And there’s nobody who’s going to help you. 00:49:41 [Speaker Changed] So you’re hinting with the mentorship issue, you’re hinting at something vibe session related, which is, I mean, let’s talk about the 800 pound gorilla in the room. How big an impact was the pandemic, the lockdown being forced to work remotely, not being able to have the sort of social interaction that my generation took for granted when I was your age. How big of an impact was that mess on? And, and let’s be blunt, the pandemic was not well handled by the previous administration. You can argue that at least they got the vaccine out and it was somewhat better handled by the, the next administration, although both of them contributed cares, act one cares, act two and Cares Act three, that massive fiscal stimulus is a big part of the inflation spike. Yeah. How much did the pandemic contribute to vibe, obsession feelings? 00:50:37 [Speaker Changed] I, I think a lot. Yeah. I think, you know, to the point of social interactions, like I graduated basically into the pandemic and I still don’t know how to like talk in adult spaces, right? Right. So I think that’s a definitely a big part of it is like the lack of social interaction and then too, like a lot of people ended up just consuming content all day long. Right. And, and what goes viral as you know on social media is dor stuff, right? And so I think that’s a big thing is like, people were consuming because we were stuck inside. It was extraordinarily scary. Nobody knew what was happening. And you had people telling you that the world is ending and you’re like, okay, yeah, that makes sense to me. And you just kind of keep on consuming that info even after things get better, 00:51:21 [Speaker Changed] Right? That that lack of information hygiene is really important. Here’s another generational difference, and I want to ask you how this contributed to the vibe session. So people, I don’t know, over 50, maybe even over 40, like that, that were all already in their teens or twenties when the internet came about, the internet has always been a room in the house we would visit, yeah. Oh, I’m gonna go online for a while. Whereas the 40 and under generation, the internet has always been there. Is that true? 40 and under, let’s say 30 and under, certainly since the mid nineties. And they exist in the internet. It it, it’s not like a separate thing. It’s part of their virtual reality. So it raises the question, what’s the impact of social media on that generation’s self-identity there? The, at least a decade ago, we’re so focused on likes and social approval and you mentioned going viral. Does that lead them to be less data driven, less, more, more embracing of these subjective measures of reality, 00:52:29 [Speaker Changed] Maybe? Yeah. That’s interesting. I think definitely. Yeah. Like the internet is something that, it’s like a room that you go into in your head, right? Right. Like, you are not with other people if you’re on your phone, even if you’re around them, right? And so I think that’s something that we’re like just sort starting to grapple with. I’ve noticed it within myself where it’s like, once I start scrolling, I’m not in the room with my friends, right? Like I’m in the room on Twitter. And so I think that’s a big part of it too, where you do everything does end up being influenced by feelings versus like quantitative measures. And you kind of know how it feels in your head and you kind of extrapolate that out into the world beyond you. And so maybe we do have a more subjective generation that is like, well, this is how I feel about stuff because look how feelings perform on the internet. 00:53:14 [Speaker Changed] Right? And, and listen, social media has perfected the algorithm for outrage because outrage increases engagement even as it slowly eats away like a cancer society from the inside. You know, I, I have mixed feelings on the death of Twitter as it slowly circles the drain, you think 00:53:35 [Speaker Changed] It’s gonna die? 00:53:36 [Speaker Changed] I I think it’s dead already. Really? It, so last, last summer, not 24, 23. Yeah. I lost, I, I got hacked. I call him Elmo, but Elmo decided to make you pay for two-factor authentication, which is standard security practices. It used to come with it. And I came home from dinner Saturday night. Apparently you could send an email requesting a change of password and those idiots would just do it. Like if you don’t object to it in 60 minutes, that’s something silly. So, so that’s how I lost my Twitter account. And fortunately the folks here helped me get it back. It only took three months. Wow. And again, Dave Tigan and I, I was like, lamenting this and he’s like, you’re not, you’re not missing anything. It’s died already. This is a year ago. And I’m genuinely shocked at how the engagement has gone down. Yeah. 00:54:26 How the interaction and half the people I know IRL I’ve met on Twitter over the past 15 years ago. It, it’s so ter and there’s nothing else has come along that quite matches it. Just that. So, so now I’m pretty much down to just focusing on my lists at least. It used to be with your list, you weren’t seeing a lot of other junk Yeah. That even that’s starting to get corrupted. Yeah. ’cause I know I have a list on behavioral finance and a list on, on charts and markets and economics and a list on automobiles and a list on travel and a list on, I have all these lists and I used to be able to just go, you know what, I’m just gonna spend some time learning about, you know, the hills of, of southern Spain and you could do that. And now everything is just intruded with craziness and, and politics. But it, it brings, I wanna bring this back to the vibe session question. So we’ve talked about the pandemic, we’ve talked about inflation as a driver of the vibe session. How much of this is driven by social media? How much of this is that dor loop of people who have been wrong since the financial crisis and yet still have a big 00:55:47 [Speaker Changed] Following? Yeah, no, it’s, it’s something I combat all the time with the stuff that I post on Instagram and TikTok, because that’s what goes viral is like, not the truth, but, but big scary things. And that’s a huge problem on Twitter as we both know. And so I think it is definitely an issue because like, you know, we have these animal brains and they’re trying to protect us. And so they’re like, you know, pay attention to the big scary thing. And that’s always going to be a doomers story, right? Right. Like, nobody really wants to hear, okay, the economy’s going okay. It’s like, no, the economy’s going crazy and you’re in a lot of trouble. Like, that’s what you’re gonna end up paying attention to. And so I, I think totally the vibe session has been heavily influenced by social media. Even when I was writing that initial piece, I reached out to a lot of people in my comment section who had been commenting that they were like not feeling good and that they were very worried. And there’s of course like true economic pain out there, but a lot of these people are like, oh, I read an article that things are not okay. Right. 00:56:45 [Speaker Changed] And what’s the track record of that paper on that author? How, how, why do you assume that? Because it was published. It’s accurate. I’m always, yeah. I spend a lot of time fending off nonsense that clients read and say, Hey, you know, New York stock exchange margin debt is at record highs. So is the New York Stock Exchange look at the two as as long as you’re, it’s at all time highs. Yeah. Margin debt is also gonna be at all time highs. Why is that a problem? Back to denominator blindness, you gotta look at the broader context and yet people don’t seem to ask those questions. 00:57:19 [Speaker Changed] Do you think that’s an element of media literacy? 00:57:22 [Speaker Changed] There’s some of that. It’s also you, you brought up, you know, our, our lizard brains Yeah. Things that are good are not an existential threat. So, all right. It’s great things that are bad. Oh my goodness, this can end. Hey, I’m here to propagate my genetic lineage. Yeah. If, if this threatens that, you know, we we’re hardwired to be classic risk aversion, it’s Yeah. Losses feel twice as bad as gains because losses are an existential threat. Yeah, 00:57:54 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. I, I was reading this really interesting article about the, you know, propagating the genetic lineage thing because I’m really interested in the dating apps and how they’re sort of influencing the mindset of the younger generation around that. And this, this guy, he is a sociologist and he’s arguing that our brains are actually switching away from the desire to repopulate and they’re more so becoming focused on the individual. And that’s maybe why we’re having more and more of a fertility crisis. 00:58:21 [Speaker Changed] Isn’t that a global issue? Oh yeah. Or are you seeing a fertility crisis around the world across the board? You mentioned the quant who works in my shop? Nick Ma, Julie. Yes. Yeah, he did some stuff years ago. Looks scraping the data from the apps. You should dig that up. I remember it was like just insane the sort of numbers he, he pulled out of that. I think I’m hard pressed to imagine that five years or 10 years of social media are gonna undo 2 million years of, of evolutionary biology. Maybe I’m wrong, but I, is this something that it’s just a novel theory? Or are you fighting against a lot of wetware and, and hardwired Yeah. Aspects of the human experience. 00:59:03 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Yeah. I think it’s, it’s definitely like paper covering, right. The deeper, you know, need to do that because I do think that’s a genetic desire, but it is just interesting. Yeah. And like, maybe that’s like why the vibes are disconnected, right? Like why you see these high rates of depression, anxiety, et cetera. You know, whenever you talk about society at large, you’re always pulling theories and Right. There’s always gaps in them. But I think it’s just interesting to think about like, you know, what is the impact of dating apps? What is the impact of being on social media and seeing, you know, not real faces but edited faces, right? Like how does that impact how we actually exist in the real world and ultimately how we feel about everything that we’re doing and the economy at large. 00:59:42 [Speaker Changed] Well, well we know that kids have a much higher depression rate than they used to. Yeah. Ever since, you know, the iPhone came out. Yeah. And all the apps it, so it’s having a real effect. All right. Which leads to my last vibe session question, which is there were a number of economists who thought a vibe session would be a self-fulfilling prophecy and that we would end up a negative sentiment would end up driving recession. That didn’t happen. Why? 01:00:10 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. That, that was good. That was actually the title of the original piece. You know, vibe session self, a self-fulfilling prophecy. And I, I don’t think it ended up happening because the economic data has been so strong. Like the government is spending a lot of money, right. And that’s going to help prop up GDP and that’s going to help prop up the consumer. The consumer had an incredible savings buffer post covid and we did see a real wage gains. And so you had a resilient consumer who is ready to spend, especially on services. And so I think that helped us avoid a recession as we had a government who’s, you know, spending a lot of money. And then we had a consumer that up until recently has been quite strong in a labor market that was incredibly strong. We’re seeing weakness in that now, but I think that’s why we were able to avoid the self-fulfilling prophecy aspect of it. 01:00:54 [Speaker Changed] Are we really seeing weakness or are we just seeing less strength than we did before? We’re 01:00:58 [Speaker Changed] Seeing that’s, that’s a good point. It’s more lukewarm versus hot. Yeah. 01:01:01 [Speaker Changed] Right. And and the crazy thing, I think people, so you talk about the abundance mindset earlier. There are a couple of areas in the economy that scarcity is taken. So we don’t have enough single family homes. Yeah. There aren’t enough laborers. We’ve reduced the number of, of legal immigrants since nine 11. We lost a whole bunch of people to CO we launched, we have removed a whole bunch of people from the labor force through disability, including long COVID. Arguably we’re short two or 3 million houses. We’re short a few million automobiles due to the lag in ramping up semiconductor production. And we’re also short, I don’t know, pick a number. 1, 2, 3, 4 million laborers out of a labor pool of 162 million people. So we have all this abundance and yet at the same time there’s scarcity in very specific areas. 01:01:54 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, absolutely. And the abundance mindset is like, we can have all these things in great numbers and like, it doesn’t have to be this issue where there’s not enough of things. And that creates so much wording and concern for people. But yeah, I think that’s kind of the issue across the board is we don’t have enough and yet we have so much money as a country. Right. 01:02:13 [Speaker Changed] And so wealth but not prosperity. Exactly. I love that dichotomy where if you go to, I remember remember being in Europe right during the.com implosion and everybody was so stressed out in Manhattan, you could feel like, Hey, I get fired, I’m gonna lose my health insurance. What’s gonna happen if my kid needs a operation? You go to Europe and they’re in the cafes having coffee and they’re smoking clove cigarettes and nobody really seems to be bent outta shape that hey, the technology is imploding 80%, they’re all kind of just grooving life. Yeah. It’s a very different mindset where the focus isn’t on wealth, but it’s on prosperity. Yeah. It, it, it, are there that much geographic differences? Is the United States that unique compared to the rest of the world? 01:03:01 [Speaker Changed] I don’t, I mean I think the, there’s actually a big conversation kind of happening around this right now, like why the United States sort of does this to itself. And I, I think the US has these elements of workaholics. Like we, we love the work and Europe maybe doesn’t, but yeah, we’ve chosen maybe not to spend so much on, on the social aspect of it. And you do see consequences of that. Like I think having a social safety net for people is a really good buffer. Like once you have a sense of security, there’s kind of a lot that you can achieve. 01:03:33 [Speaker Changed] A lot less stress also. Yeah, absolutely. Although, although arguably we don’t have that safety net. We don’t And we’ve achieved a, I think the stress is what has driven us. 01:03:42 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Because we’re, we know that we have to have a safety net. 01:03:45 [Speaker Changed] You better get off your and go do something otherwise no one’s feeding you Good luck being homeless. Oh gosh. Which kind of is really about, about the Wall Street bets and all the crypto bros that have fun being poor. Yeah. Was such an interesting basic approach to No, no, you gotta go do something. Even if it’s something like NFTs or crypto, figure something out. Yeah. That’s a uniquely American proposition. 01:04:09 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, absolutely. ’cause there’s nobody to catch you. Right. And so like, you have to go invest in Dogecoin and that’s like now we have this gambling issue as a society like sports gambling. 01:04:20 [Speaker Changed] Oh, unbelievable. Oh 01:04:21 [Speaker Changed] Gosh. It’s awful. Yeah. And it is, I really do believe it’s because we don’t have a safety net for people. And so they’re like, I don’t know what to do. I’ll just gamble my money. 01:04:29 [Speaker Changed] That makes sense. Yeah. Usually if I don’t know what to do, I, I I’ll go watch YouTube, but hey, whatever, whatever you have to do. So the vibe session did not become a self-fulfilling prophecy. I have to do a compare and contrast with something you wrote in the book. Inflation is entirely dependent on what people expect to happen. I disagree, but I want you to explain why you think that is. 01:04:53 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. So this is definitely an unpopular opinion. Jerome Powell actually talked about this in his Jackson Hole speech. You know, inflation expectations have been tempered so people don’t expect as much inflation as it used to. And that’ll help the Fed, you know, so let 01:05:07 [Speaker Changed] Tap on it. So lemme just, lemme just stop you right there. So after inflation has fallen from 9% to 2%, their expectations go down. That sounds quite backwards looking and lagging. Let me also point out that when inflation was about to spike up in 2001, everybody’s forward inflation expectations were pretty low. Isn’t this like asking people what their risk tolerance is? Aren’t you just getting whatever happened over the past six to 12 months? 01:05:35 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, usually. But I, I think the, the reason I said that in the book was like the expectations do matter and they’ll ultimately influence how the Federal Reserve makes decisions. 01:05:45 [Speaker Changed] I mean, Jerome Powell a hundred percent agrees with that. I just think he’s wrong 01:05:48 [Speaker Changed] Because you think it’s what? Like what, like you think inflation 01:05:51 [Speaker Changed] Is. I think people don’t know what the hell they think. They certainly don’t know what they’re gonna do. You ask them a question they don’t know. And because of the American educational experience where we’re tested within inches of our lives, hey, no penalties for filling in that bubble on your multiple choice. So people, nobody likes to say, I don’t know. So here’s a made up answer I guess. Go away. I can, I could talk about this stuff with you forever, but we have a hard stop. So I, I have to get to to my favorite questions that I ask all of my guests. Starting with what’s keeping you entertained these days? What, what are you listening to on podcasts or watching on Netflix, Amazon, Disney, what, whatever you like. 01:06:33 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. So I really like the podcast Philosophize this, 01:06:38 [Speaker Changed] Philosophize 01:06:39 [Speaker Changed] This, yeah. That’s one of my favorite podcasts. It’s by Steven West and he talks all about the different schools of philosophy. It goes back to the very beginning and it’s, it’s just phenomenal. And he walks you through everything and all the different schools of thought. And I, I think he does a fantastic job. And then there’s this series called Land of the Giants by Vox. Have you heard of 01:07:02 [Speaker Changed] 01:07:03 [Speaker Changed] 01:07:07 [Speaker Changed] Times and now he’s at Fox, I 01:07:11 [Speaker Changed] 01:07:13 [Speaker Changed] 01:07:16 [Speaker Changed] 01:07:16 [Speaker Changed] 01:07:19 [Speaker Changed] They, they talk about like delivery apps, they talk about dating apps. They, they talk about Twitter and what happened with Twitter. And so I’ve really enjoyed that. And then I’ve been listening. I listen to a ton of audio books ’cause I, I’m on a, I bike a lot and so I’ll listen to a book on the bike and blood in the machine is really good. It’s talking. That 01:07:40 [Speaker Changed] Sounds so familiar. 01:07:41 [Speaker Changed] Oh, I can’t remember at the author’s name. 01:07:44 [Speaker Changed] So I’m gonna get to specific books. We’ll circle. Okay, sorry. Sorry. So hold on that for a second. Okay. So those are all podcasts. Any, any video, anything you watch on video? 01:07:54 [Speaker Changed] Like YouTube stuff, 01:07:56 [Speaker Changed] YouTube, Netflix, whatever. Oh, 01:07:58 [Speaker Changed] I don’t watch a ton of Netflix. I, I, I do listen to a lot of podcasts. And then on YouTube I’ve been listening to Eddie Burback. Have you heard of him? No. He’s kind of like a commentator YouTube guy. But he did this thing on AI recently. He did this funny video where he visited all the rainforest cafes in the country and he’s just a very good producer. And I really enjoy thinking 01:08:24 [Speaker Changed] About how many Rainforest cafes are there in the co There’s one like, didn’t that come out like 20 year, 25 years ago? Rainforest Cafe Wasn’t that Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwartz. And there, it wasn’t like a crazy collection. What I’m trying 01:08:36 [Speaker Changed] To like they teamed up. That? I’ve heard of that, yes. Yeah, Peter Kafka has done a couple of them, but like he, he Was at business week for a long time and then I think it was briefly at the Think. Yeah, I think so. I think that was his path. Or unless it was backwards times business week, but whatever. Yeah. Like He, he know. Yeah, he’s a, he’s a good economic writer And he’s a great podcaster. Oh really? Yeah. I really enjoyed his, his dives. 01:08:38 [Speaker Changed] So after Planet Hollywood I, I, I don’t remember, that’s why I’m getting that wrong. I know that they were involved, some people were involved in Planet Hollywood and a subset of those people did Rainforest Cafe. I could be completely wrong about that, 01:08:52 [Speaker Changed] I don’t know. But yeah, he, he, he walks, I don’t know, maybe it’s not every, 01:08:55 [Speaker Changed] Are there a lot of these left? 01:08:57 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, there are. Well at least one in every state. I think so. 01:09:01 [Speaker Changed] It’s good. Huh? That’s crazy. I’m gonna share a channel with you ’cause you brought up Mass Transit. Yeah. There is a guy, he’s a Canadian, he moved to Amsterdam and he has a channel called just not just Bikes. Just Bikes. Yeah. And I’m addicted to, first of all, I love Amsterdam. It just barely edged out. Paris is my favorite city. But the whole concept of hey, what you do with your mass transit affects everything from wealth and in income and inequality to quality of life and why people in countries with better mass transits have higher happiness quotient and better health outcomes. And yeah. It’s crazy how it just cascades. Yeah. After higher education, that seems to be the next most important thing. Do you 01:09:45 [Speaker Changed] Know that the average car in the United States has more space for itself than the average person does? Yeah, 01:09:51 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. Yeah. Look, just look at all the plus to say nothing of the parking spots. Gosh. That, 01:09:56 [Speaker Changed] Have you read Pave Paradise? No. Oh, it’s about parking and it’s great. 01:10:01 [Speaker Changed] So, so let’s get to your favorite books. No, let’s talk Pave Parking. Oh yeah. Pave Paradise. Pave Paradise About Parking. What else 01:10:07 [Speaker Changed] Do do you have? Yeah, it’s all about parking blood in the machine, which can, it’s this gorgeous book and he talks about the Luddites and he goes into deep detail and like talks about what it was like in obviously a very hard time, but what it looks like for their lives to be impacted by the introduction of like the spinning machine, right. And how AI is like, kind of comparing to that. And it’s just, it’s really good historical writing. And 01:10:30 [Speaker Changed] I, I just saw a research report this morning. I dunno who put it out. This is the problem with being a, a consumer of just too much junk. So much stuff that AI is gonna be a net positive. Oh, I know it was Torsten Slack looked at unemployment rates in Phil, the Philippines and somewhere else that a lot of, a lot of call centers and a lot of outsource stuff. And despite the introduction of ai, none of these places have seen an uptick in unemployment yet. Oh. Just kind of fascinating. Yeah. Like you would think that’s, that’s the canary in the coal mine. Right. 01:11:02 [Speaker Changed] And I think like the way that a lot of people are thinking about ai, not this author of Blood in the Machine, but as a compliment to the human laborer where it’s like that’s, it’s not something that places you, but something that, that enhances 01:11:13 [Speaker Changed] An augmentation. 01:11:14 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. Yeah. I think I’ve, I’ve seen AI be an augmentation in my 01:11:17 [Speaker Changed] Life. A hundred percent. Yeah. Every time I do do the prep work for this, the last thing I do is, is enter into perplexity and chat GBT and see what comes up. It’s still is occasionally wrong. Yeah. I I you have to be very aware that it’s not trustworthy, but it’s getting a little better all the time. Yeah. And, and every now and then it’ll uncover a nugget that Yeah. We miss. And it’s, I have a research team. It’s not just me. And even still those deep dives will pull, pull stuff out. So Pave Paradise, blend the machine. Any other books you wanna 01:11:49 [Speaker Changed] Read? Oh gosh, yeah. I, I read a ton because I’m on the bike a lot, but I, I, I read this book about the founder of Glossier, which was really interesting. Or Glossier, I think it’s 01:11:59 [Speaker Changed] The water company. 01:12:00 [Speaker Changed] Glossier? It’s the makeup company. Oh, 01:12:02 [Speaker Changed] The makeup company? 01:12:03 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Yeah. So it’s about that, that founder and like what it was like for her to build a makeup company. And that was quite good. I read a lot of fiction. So right now 01:12:13 [Speaker Changed] Those first three are all nonfiction you just 01:12:15 [Speaker Changed] Gave me. Yeah. 01:12:17 [Speaker Changed] So give, all right, so that’s three nonfiction. Give us three fiction that you’re enjoying. 01:12:21 [Speaker Changed] I I’m reading a gentleman in Moscow right now. Have you read that? I 01:12:25 [Speaker Changed] Have it on my list forever. It’s always in my queue. I never get to it. It’s 01:12:28 [Speaker Changed] Like, so I’m, I’m probably a quarter of the way through it and it’s kind of a lot of dialogue, which I don’t always enjoy. Like I really love world building and fiction novels like Lord of the Rings, et 01:12:39 [Speaker Changed] Cetera. Are you a sci-fi or fantasy? I mean obviously Lord of the Rings is a classic, but it like 01:12:43 [Speaker Changed] Kind kind of, it’s more of, I like settings to be very clear so I can have it in my head as a visual. I don’t know if that makes sense. But 01:12:53 [Speaker Changed] CJ Shera was this and you could tell she was a woman ’cause it’s initials. ’cause when she was writing back in the sixties and seventies, you had to hide that. She has, if you like, world building, go check out Pride of Shamu. C-H-A-N-U-R. Okay. 01:13:08 [Speaker Changed] Pride of sha. 01:13:09 [Speaker Changed] If you’re like 20 pages into it and you’re not deeply in love, just throw it away. Okay. And you’re done. Yeah. But I may just have sent you down a rabbit hole that will 01:13:18 [Speaker Changed] Have a That’s all right. Yeah. 01:13:19 [Speaker Changed] And she’s just this amazing builder of worlds. That’s wonderful. That, that very few writers, like I just remember of all the sci-fi stuff I went through as a kid. Yeah. She just Totally, alright, so, so gentleman in Moscow, give us two more. 01:13:37 [Speaker Changed] I’m reading, I read Olive by, I can’t remember her name, but it, it got turned into a TV show. But it’s kind of really interesting because it’s about, and she has a sequel too called Olive Again. And it’s about this woman who just lives in this little town and she has all these little stories that surround this woman and all the stories interweave really beautifully. And I really like that kind of like time bending stuff. 01:13:59 [Speaker Changed] Elizabeth Strout Elizabeth, 01:14:01 [Speaker Changed] Thank you. Right. And then I, 01:14:03 [Speaker Changed] Google makes the universe of information. We, we don’t know anything but we’re knowledge adjacent. Yeah. Yeah. And there it is. 01:14:10 [Speaker Changed] Let me Google that. 01:14:10 [Speaker Changed] Oh wait, olive, olive again. She has too Emma Gannon or Ala or Elizabeth Strout. Those are, 01:14:18 [Speaker Changed] It’s Elizabeth Strout. 01:14:19 [Speaker Changed] Okay. Yeah. There’s another book called Olive by Emma Gannon. 01:14:23 [Speaker Changed] No, 01:14:23 [Speaker Changed] It’s from 2021. No, 01:14:25 [Speaker Changed] It’s Strout. Okay. 01:14:26 Yeah. And then I read Trust by Hernand Diaz. Have you read that? No. Oh, you should. It’s, it’s all about what this guy, it’s, I think it’s a fabrication, but it’s this guy that lived during the Great Depression and it’s actually three stories interwoven into one. And so you get the, like the fictionalized version of this guy’s life and then that guy becomes the second part of the book and we get to hear his actual story. Not one that’s like fabricated by this author. And then you get another part of the book that goes a little bit deeper into his wife’s life. Oh really? And so it’s, it’s really, it’s, I think I won Pulitzer. It’s, it’s quite, 01:15:04 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I’m looking at it right now. Yeah. Gold surprise winner. Yeah. 01:15:06 [Speaker Changed] I, I love when authors are like 01:15:09 [Speaker Changed] 20, 23. That was last year. Yeah. 01:15:11 [Speaker Changed] It’s, it’s really 01:15:12 [Speaker Changed] Good. I don’t understand. The hardcover and the paperback are now the same price. Oh really? This is a new 01:15:17 [Speaker Changed] Books are tough, tough 01:15:19 [Speaker Changed] Industry. I guess one of the New York Times a hundred best books of the 21st century. Yeah. 01:15:24 [Speaker Changed] It’s, it’s quite good. 01:15:25 [Speaker Changed] As long as they’ve read every book in the 21st century so they can make an informed evaluation like that. It’s a big claim. I’m down with that. Yeah, I know. It’s again, more stupid media stuff for the modern era. So that’s a great list of books right there. Yeah. I skipped the question to get to books that I have to ask you. Sure. But I’m, I’m not sure if you’re gonna have a good answer, which is, oh, who were your mentors who helped shape your career? 01:15:52 [Speaker Changed] Oh, because what I said about the mentor 01:15:53 [Speaker Changed] Thing. Well I know Jim O’Shaughnessy is obviously a big influence 01:15:57 [Speaker Changed] Give, oh gosh. I’ve had so many people, like I could, we’d be here all day if I listed everybody. 01:16:01 [Speaker Changed] Give us, give us one or two. So 01:16:02 [Speaker Changed] The two people that have probably been the most influential because they believed in me before I did, was my two professors in college, Dr. Chachi and Dr. Lebinski. I basically would go to them and be like, I wanna start a club. I wanna do research around the s and p 500. I wanna, you know, go travel to this conference. And they’d be like, alright, good. And they would just help me kind of achieve all of these dreams that I had. Huh. And so they were phenomenal. Like I remember I was applying to jobs and I wanted to do a PhD ’cause I really wanted to teach. And Dr. Chachi was like, no, you should go work in in industry for a little bit and then you can go and get your PhD. And so it was just kind of like that really tailored advice and support. And they were probably the most important people to me during my college time. 01:16:47 [Speaker Changed] You know that, that’s really interesting. Angus Deaton, who is the British economist who won the Nobel Prize and I think he’s teaching, is he teaching at Princeton? Yeah. He is teaching at Princeton. And he said you could look across a thousand different factors and nothing impacts your life as much as a higher education. Yeah. We, we see it in wealth inequality, income inequality, health outcomes, whether you go to jail, whether you get divorced, like all these social things that you would think are unrelated. Your, your self-described happiness quotient, like deep, deep down the rabbit hole. And consistently there is a, a gap between, between what we see on the have a ho college education and don’t, it’s pretty amazing. Well, 01:17:36 [Speaker Changed] I mean it’s kind of four, like I worked three jobs during college, but like, it’s, it’s four years to sort of figure yourself out. And I actually think that’s really important. ’cause you learn how to socialize, you learn how to learn, you get tested. But in an environment where like if you fail, it’s okay most of the time. Like if you fail out of college, it’s not okay, but you kind of have the chance to make safe mistakes is what I would call it. And I Is 01:18:01 [Speaker Changed] That still true today with with Oh, I don’t, it seems like some of the campuses, some of that has kind of become more challenging. Well, every 01:18:07 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. From a political angle. Absolutely. Yeah. And I think 01:18:12 [Speaker Changed] Too the cost, but it should, but what you are describing should be true. It should be a place where you can make mistakes. 01:18:17 [Speaker Changed] I think so I graduated in 2019 and I think I was the last year to have that. I, I do because of the pandemic and because I, I just like, I, the scholarship package that I got and the reason that I went to Western Kentucky, it was a full ride and I was paid to go to school and there’s nothing like that. Sure. Unless you’re like a top, top, top student. And I was a good student, but it was an in-state school. And so I had all these opportunities because I was able to have a full ride. Right. And I, I just don’t think that’s, 01:18:48 [Speaker Changed] Where else did you consider going besides in-State? Oh, 01:18:51 [Speaker Changed] Well, Vanderbilt, I wanted to stay close to my family. So Vanderbilt’s, which was in Tennessee, I was in Kentucky. I was looking at Butler up in Indiana, Notre Dame. Yeah. Like just kind of 01:19:00 [Speaker Changed] Big schools, little schools both. Yeah. You looked at everything. Yeah. 01:19:04 [Speaker Changed] I wanted like a, a good school. Right. Because I, I did wanna 01:19:07 [Speaker Changed] Leave Kentucky. Well, none of these are bad schools. You’re talking about all good or better schools. 01:19:11 [Speaker Changed] Yes. Yeah. But like, I wanted to leave Kentucky and the only way I knew how to get out was like through education. And so that’s why I was looking at the schools. But I ended up staying in Western Kentucky because the scholarship and it turned out to be an incredible experience. Huh. 01:19:26 [Speaker Changed] To say, to say the very least. And our final two questions. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interested in a career in either finance or investing education? 01:19:39 [Speaker Changed] So I think for me, and this is the advice I give when people ask, is like to read everything and to figure out what you like to read and then try to challenge yourself to explain it, to write about it, to learn about it as deeply as you can. And I think the only way that you actually understand stuff is if you can explain it simply. And so that’s what I’d recommend is just be a consumer ask questions. You’d be surprised how many people are willing to just take 30 minutes to chat with you and just ask for help as much as you can. But yeah, just absorb as much as possible, but then make sure you’re digesting it by repeating it back to yourself, whether through writing videos, et cetera. 01:20:15 [Speaker Changed] And, and our final question comes with a little bit of a caveat. So I always share the last five questions, partly because they require a little recall with our guests in advance. And I asked you, what do you know about the world of investing today that you wish you knew 25 years ago and you hilariously wrote back 25 years ago? I was one. Don’t bite the cat. I mean, I think that’s so funny. I don’t know if you said that or Dave Ick said that in our, our back and forth. I shared your answer with him and he think, I think he said, don’t bite the cat. Yeah, yeah. But what do you know today that might’ve been helpful earlier in your career? 01:20:55 [Speaker Changed] I, I think for me, there’s so many facets to finance. Like I was very much like, oh, there’s one thing I can do and it’s portfolio management, but there’s so much that you can do education, you can look into IRA space as you all do. You can do media. Like there’s just, and there’s so many different worlds within finance, commodities, fixed income, equities. It’s really massive. And so I think the advice that I would give to my 1-year-old self is to, you know, just keep on learning. And similar to the advice I gave previous, but really just know that the world is so big and there’s so much opportunity within these segments that are just fascinating to explore. You can spend a lifetime doing it. 01:21:32 [Speaker Changed] Well, thank you Kyla, for being so generous with your time. Yeah. I’m gonna have to have you sign this form me.

October 05, 2024 06:37 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, Oct. 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and certain of the Company’s senior executives. If you invested in Ford, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/ford-motor-company. Investors have until October 7, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in Ford securities. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan and is captioned Guzman v. Ford Motor Company, et al., No. 24-cv-12080. What is the Lawsuit About? Ford is an automotive manufacturing company that develops, delivers, and services a range trucks, cars, and luxury vehicles worldwide. The complaint alleges that during the relevant period, the company misrepresented its warranty reserves and that it had completed a sequence of organizational changes designed to ensure higher quality and lower costs. In truth, Ford was experiencing higher warranty costs, and the warranty reserves did not accurately reflect the quality issues in its vehicles. On July 24, 2024, after the market closed, Ford announced second quarter 2024 financial results (the “2Q24 Press Release”). The 2Q24 Press Release revealed that the Company’s “[p]rofitability was affected by an increase in warranty reserves” and “higher warranty costs.” It was reported that, in the second quarter, Ford’s warranty and recall costs totaled $2.3 billion, $800 million more than the first quarter and $700 million more than a year ago. This news caused the price of Ford’s stock to decline by $2.51 per share, or over 18%, to close at $11.16 per share on July 25, 2024.

Title: Vast Majority of CEOs Ready to Make Remote Workers' Lives As Miserable As Possible
URL: https://futurism.com/the-byte/ceos-return-to-office
Time Published: 2024-10-05T10:30:34Z
Full Content:
The battle over remote work continues — and it looks like chief executives are overwhelmingly willing to take extreme measures to get folks back to the office. A recent report from the global research and accounting firm KPMG shows that 89 percent of corporate CEOs at US companies are willing to dangle incentives like "favorable assignments, raises, and promotions" for employees who head back to the office full-time. As Inc and Axios point out, that overwhelming figure suggests that CEOs may also be willing to withhold those same benefits from employees who choose to stay home. In other words, folks who are willing or able to get back into the office will likely have a serious advantage over those who don't want to be back in the office — or, perhaps more importantly, can't due to location, health, or family reasons. It's a staggering figure, and one that comes at a tumultuous moment in the ongoing battle between remote or hybrid workforces and C-suite executives insisting that it's time for employees to get back to the office full-time — despite overwhelming evidence that remote work doesn't affect productivity. The KPMG report also found that 79 percent of CEOs expect that within three years, corporate roles ceded to remote setups during the pandemic will once again be in the office full-time. Per the report, just a few short months ago, only 34 percent of CEOs predicted a mass return-to-office shift. On that note, the report's findings come after Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announced last month that employees must return to the office for all five days a week, or otherwise risk being sacked. And while Jassy's decision might have some chief executives feeling inspired, it's worth noting that the decision was met with outrage from much of Amazon's workforce. Many of them have since looked for work elsewhere. "At first, I didn't quite believe it," one such Amazon employee, a mother who says she was hired with the understanding that there would be no full-time return-to-office mandate, recently told Fortune. "I've been updating my resume and portfolio, and rage applying to new jobs on LinkedIn." Some CEOs have admitted to using return-to-office mandates as a guise for layoffs, expecting the decision to lead to some degree of a voluntary exodus. Whether the executives' gambit to attract workers to come back to the office will pay off in the long run remains to be seen. If there's one certainty, it's that a mandate likely won't go over easy.

Emma Sadler was working in hospitality in early 2020 when the Covid pandemic first swept the nation. She immediately lost her job as a restaurant manager at the Danny Meyer-run MoMa in New York City. "That was when I sat with myself and was like, 'Okay, I think it's time to make a change. The food industry is going to go downhill,'" Sadler, who was 29 then and a single mom, told Business Insider. "My daughter was still relatively young and I'd missed out a lot on her life, and it was only going to get harder for me careerwise in the food and beverage industry. If I wanted to continue to move up, it would just be more hours and more time away from her." She decided to pivot into tech. It was a natural transition for Sadler, who had experience working on websites for the smaller food businesses she'd worked at. In 2021, she landed her first job as a UI/UX designer. She lasted in tech for nearly four years. "I unfortunately did get laid off in 2022 from the company I was working at and then I got laid off in 2024 again. I realized that kind of a similar thing was happening in tech that had previously happened with the food industry during Covid," said Sadler. After the second tech layoff in 2024, Sadler reevaluated her situation, much like she did in 2020, and felt like it was as good a time as any to go all-in on her side hustle: making custom pet portraits and accessories like keychains and pet tags, which she'd been doing since 2023. The side project served two purposes: It provided extra income that she could draw on if she lost her job and provided a creative outlet for someone who grew up making art. "Tech is very screen heavy. It's a different type of creativity, and I've always been a very tactile artist," she said. "I really wanted another outlet where I could make something physical and not just something digital." She settled on custom pet accessories because it was something she personally wanted but couldn't easily find. "A lot of what's out there for keychains or magnets or portraits are all based around designs because they're more scalable," said Sadler. "But I had mutts. They're unique. They have their own personalities. And so that's kind of how it started: I want a keychain of my dog, but none of these really look like my dog." To test whether other people also wanted custom pet portraits and accessories, Sadler applied for a pop-up event in Brooklyn so she could interact with customers and get feedback. She continued doing in-person events around New York and started profiting after the 2023 holiday season, which confirmed that she was onto something. By the time she was let go from her day job in early 2024, "I was like, it's now or never. I have these skills, I've been building this business, people are interested, I really enjoy this personally as a creative. I have this opportunity where I can go ahead and bet on myself and see what happens," recalled Sadler. In a worst-case scenario, "it's not as successful, and I have to fall back on being a bartender or pouring myself back into the job market search." In the six months since committing to her small business, Taleology, Sadler has earned more than she anticipated. "I definitely didn't think I would be making five figures in my first year," she said. BI confirmed her five-figure revenue by looking at her Shopify dashboard. With so much more time to dedicate to the business, she was able to focus on growing her online presence in addition to the pop-up events. TikTok Live, in particular, helped bring in new customers. "I had a spike of growth thanks to TikTok, but I think now my steady growth is coming from word of mouth and from people genuinely caring about the uniqueness of the craft that I offer, as well as the seamless experience that I provide," said Sadler, whose typical turnaround time is one week from when a customer places an order. "I know I'm not Amazon and I never will be Amazon, but I do know that there's a lot of small businesses that can take a very, very long time, especially for something that's custom." Her monthly income hasn't come close to surpassing what she was earning in tech, and she does some freelance work as an email marketing designer and presentation designer, she noted: "Do I think it could eventually one day get to pay my salary? Yes. But as of right now, in the first year, it's definitely not comparable with that, which is why I do have some part-time jobs to help supplement because I do want to put as much of it back into the business. I don't want to really pay myself right now if I can avoid it." In the meantime, she has peace of mind knowing that her earnings are broadly in her control. She expects fluctuations — the end-of-year holiday season is much busier than January and February, for example — but she doesn't have to worry about layoffs and her income abruptly halting. "Building something that's your own definitely comes with a certain level of contentment — knowing that it's something, to a degree, that you control," she said. Her day-to-day as an entrepreneur looks a lot different than it did as a corporate employee, and she prefers it: "The main difference is the freedom. You're making your own schedule. I'm not bound by the meetings from 9-to-5 that I have to attend. I get to structure my day how I want." That said, there are tasks she has to do as a one-woman operation like social media and admin that, for her, are "not really that fun," she noted. "But creating and getting to communicate with customers brings me so much fulfillment that it shadows all the other stuff that I have to do as a business owner." Jump to

We recently compiled a list of the 30 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks. Artificial intelligence (AI) data centers are one of the hottest topics on Wall Street as companies across the industrial spectrum compete in a race to deploy AI technologies in their operations. The latest update comes from data center company Equinix, which recently announced that it would be forming a joint venture with GIC, a Singapore-based sovereign wealth fund, and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, to raise more than $15 billion in capital. Per the data center company, the capital would be used to expand the US footprint of hyperscale data centers. Hyperscale data centers are the largest in the industry, typically developed by technology giants based in the US, and offer massive networking capacity and often consume as much power as a big city or even a small country. Read more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. As technology stocks stage a comeback on the back of Fed rate cuts and AI optimism, the news coming from the commerce department in the US has buoyed investors further. The US government said earlier this week that it plans to award nearly $100 million to boost the use of artificial intelligence in developing new sustainable semiconductor materials. The funding is part of the more than $52 billion in US chip manufacturing and research grants promised by US President Joe Biden. The latest funding would go towards helping universities, national laboratories, and the private sector develop AI-powered autonomous experimentation for sustainable semiconductor manufacturing. The goal is to reduce time needed to develop new semiconductor materials that are less resource-intensive.

Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Bernstein analysts, led by Toni Sacconaghi, recently penned an investor note on the AI space, noting that the potential for continued strong Gen-AI training dynamics was likely constructive for NVIDIA at this point, though questions around the pace and trajectory of Gen-AI inference, however, may come more at the expense of their peers who have broadly acknowledged NVIDIA's training dominance and have hence focused on inference as the bulk of their long-term opportunity. Per Bernstein, leading LLM builders were already pre-buying NVIDIA's Blackwell to prepare for next-generation models. Overall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the AI stocks investors should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: An $803-billion company most people have never heard of just knocked Tesla out of the Magnificent 7
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/10/05/broadcom-tesla-magnificent-7-companies-market-cap/
Time Published: 2024-10-05T08:00:00Z
Full Content:
With hardly anyone noticing, a tech titan you’ve probably never heard of has booted Tesla out of the heavily hyped Magnificent Seven. Can it stay there? The overlooked Magnificent Seventh is Broadcom, a tech company that produces both hardware and software. It’s well-known in the infotech world but unfamiliar beyond it. The Magnificent Seven, conceived as a group of stocks in early 2023, are the most valuable U.S. tech companies by market capitalization. In descending order they include Apple (recent market cap: $3.4 trillion), Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla (recent market cap: $768 billion). Yet Broadcom’s market cap slipped past Tesla’s last spring and has stayed ahead of the EV maker for most of the year. Its market cap is currently around $803 billion. Broadcom is not guaranteed to stay ahead of Tesla, at least in the near term. Tesla’s stock is notoriously volatile, and its market cap could plausibly beat Broadcom’s for a time. But Broadcom’s long-term outlook is by far the sunnier of the two. Wall Street analysts on average expect its stock price to keep climbing, while they expect Tesla’s to continue to fall. Tesla’s stock has retreated to where it was almost four years ago, while Broadcom’s is up 290% since then. So how did this quiet giant sneak into the highest reaches of tech royalty? Mostly by a combination of tech savvy and financial acumen. The company is a grandchild of Hewlett-Packard, which in 1999 spun off a company called Agilent Technologies, which in turn spun off a company called Avago to a pair of private equity firms in 2005. Avago began buying up semiconductor companies, in 2015 buying a big one called Broadcom and taking its name. Broadcom’s PE ancestry has guided it ever since that spinoff. “Broadcom operates pretty much like a PE firm, where it invests in assets that can deliver quick returns,” says Naveen Chhabra, an analyst at the Forrester research and consulting firm. It’s “astute in terms of investing in firms where it can maintain or grow the revenue” and at the same time “can turn the company into a high margin business.” Exhibit A is Broadcom’s biggest acquisition, the cloud-computing firm VMware, which it bought last November. A Forrester report for VMware customers warns them, “Don’t let the price jumps shock you…In most cases, customers will find the renewal quotes multiple times higher than what they paid in the past.” Wall Street approves of Broadcom’s changes. “They appear to be killing it on VMware,” says Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, “which markedly exceeded expectations in the quarter and which seems poised to continue growing.” Shrewd acquisitions and management are central to Broadcom’s growth but don’t fully explain the company’s phenomenally swelling market cap. The other crucial factor is, not surprisingly, the AI frenzy. One of Broadcom’s most important businesses is designing semiconductors—computer chips—and in the past year, demand has been sky-high. Broadcom’s sales of AI chips in fiscal 2023 were $4.2 billion, BofA Securities reports. The company expects AI chip sales will rocket to $12.1 billion this year and $16.9 billion next year. Broadcom’s chip expertise along with VMware’s success has propelled Broadcom’s market cap from just above that of McDonald’s when OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022, to Magnificent Seven levels today. A critical element of Broadcom’s success and its future is CEO Hock Tan, who was recruited to run the company when Avago was spun off in 2005. Now age 72, he was born in Malaysia and earned engineering degrees from MIT plus an MBA from the Harvard Business School. He has spent most of his career in tech companies, though he also held finance jobs at PepsiCo and General Motors—thus the company’s joint expertise in technology and finance. In recent years, Tan has been among the most highly paid U.S. CEOs; he made $162 million last year. Succession is an obvious issue for the company, but no successor is apparent. Tan has said he’ll continue to run the company for at least four more years. Wall Street analysts are mostly cheering for Broadcom. “Numbers look likely to keep going up,” says Bernstein’s Rasgon. “And valuation is looking increasingly attractive.” JPMorgan’s Harlan Sur says the stock “remains our top pick in semiconductors.” No tree grows to the sky, but for now the sun is shining brightly on this company. Beyond that, the only certainty is that Broadcom can’t be anonymous anymore. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

(NYSE: WGO), Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ: KSPI), and Sun Communities (NYSE: SUI). Our investigations concern whether these companies have violated the federal securities laws and/or engaged in other unlawful business practices. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Winnebago Industries, Inc. (NYSE: WGO) On September 23, 2024, Hunterbrook Media published an article called "‘Grand Deception"- Winnebago Muzzles Outcry Over Major Problem That Owners Say Makes RVs Dangerous, Untowable, Worthless." The article stated that Winnebago's "best-selling Grand Design RVs" appear to be "experiencing frame failure, potentially affecting thousands of units sold for more than a billion dollars. This defect has led to costly damage and potential safety hazards, and rendered some RVs unroadworthy." The article continued to state that "Winnebago has used NDAs, buybacks, and online censorship to silence complaints about frame failure[.]" Following this news, Winnebago's stock dropped $1.35 per share, or 2.28%, to close at $57.76 on September 23, 2024.

(NYSE: V) On September 24, 2024, during market hours, The United States Department of Justice issued a release entitled “Justice Department Sues Visa for Monopolizing Debit Markets.” In this release, the DOJ announced that it had “filed a civil antitrust lawsuit today against Visa for monopolization and other unlawful conduct in debit network markets[.]” The release further stated that the “complaint alleges that Visa illegally maintains a monopoly over debit network markets by using its dominance to thwart the growth of its existing competitors and prevent others from developing new and innovative alternatives.” The release quoted Attorney General Merrick Garland as stating that “[w]e allege that Visa has unlawfully amassed the power to extract fees that far exceed what it could charge in a competitive market[.] Merchants and banks pass along those costs to consumers, either by raising prices or reducing quality or service. As a result, Visa’s unlawful conduct affects not just the price of one thing – but the price of nearly everything.” On this news, the price of Visa stock fell 5.4% on September 24, 2024.

Following publication of the Culper Research report, Kaspi's American Depositary Receipt ("ADR") price fell $19.20 per ADR, or 16.13%, to close at $99.81 per ADR on September 19, 2024.

Arista Networks , Inc. (NYSE:ANET) President and CEO Jayshree Ullal has sold a total of $323,264 worth of company stock, according to a recent SEC filing. The transactions, which took place on October 2, 2024, involved multiple sales at prices ranging from $381.82 to $389.6836 per share. Ullal, who also serves as a director of the company, executed the sales under a pre-established trading plan in accordance with Rule 10b5-1. This rule allows company insiders to set up a trading plan for selling stocks they own in a way that avoids accusations of insider trading. The plan was adopted on December 13, 2023. The series of sales included transactions of 10 shares at a price of $381.82, 164 shares at prices between $383.15 and $383.16, 109 shares at prices between $384.52 and $384.53, 155 shares at prices between $386.27 and $386.28, 298 shares at prices between $388.22 and $389.21, and 100 shares at prices between $389.23 and $389.83. In addition to the sales, Ullal also acquired 836 shares of common stock through the exercise of options at a price of $56.585, amounting to a total of $47,305. This transaction is part of a scheduled plan and shows the executive's ongoing investment in the company. Following these transactions, Ullal's direct holdings have changed, but she also has indirect ownership through trusts for family members, including her children and other relatives, where she shares voting and investment control but disclaims beneficial ownership. Investors often monitor insider buying and selling as it can provide insights into a company's internal perspective. The transactions by Arista Networks' CEO are part of routine financial planning and do not necessarily indicate a shift in company outlook. For further details on the transactions, investors can refer to the complete filing available on the SEC's website. In other recent news, Arista Networks has been making significant strides. The company reported a robust Q2 performance with revenues reaching $1.69 billion, indicating a 15.9% increase year-over-year, primarily driven by services and software support renewals. Goldman Sachs maintains a Buy rating on Arista Networks with a steady price target of $430.00, projecting the company to achieve approximately 20% revenue growth in 2024 and 2025. They also expect Arista to outperform in the third quarter of 2024, surpassing revenue and margin expectations. Evercore ISI maintained its Outperform rating for Arista, based on the potential revenue opportunity from Meta (NASDAQ:META)'s development of a massive new AI model training cluster. This could result in a possible $250 million in revenue for Arista if they secure the contract. Deutsche Bank also maintained its Hold rating on Arista, suggesting a positive outlook for the company's growth potential through 2025. In other developments, Arista Networks repurchased $172 million of its common stock and generated $989 million in operating cash. However, it's important to note that operating expenses increased to $319.8 million due to higher headcount and new product introduction costs. These recent developments highlight Arista Networks' strong market position and potential for continued growth. To provide additional context to Jayshree Ullal's recent stock transactions, it's worth examining some key financial metrics and insights from InvestingPro for Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET). As of the latest data, Arista Networks boasts a substantial market capitalization of $124.0 billion, reflecting its prominent position in the Communications Equipment industry.

Founded in 1996 and publicly traded since 2006, Evercore has established a robust presence in the investment banking sector. The firm generates approximately 75% of its revenue from the U.S. market, with the rest coming from its equities trading, equity underwriting, and investment management segments. Despite being significantly overvalued with a GF Value of $129.68 and a current stock price of $251.69, Evercore maintains a strong market position with a capitalization of $9.65 billion. The recent acquisition by Vanguard Group Inc has not only increased its stake in Evercore but also reinforced its position in the financial services sector. Holding 10.02% of Evercore's shares, Vanguard has solidified its influence over the company's strategic directions. This move is aligned with Vanguard's broader investment strategy of diversifying into high-growth potential sectors while maintaining a balanced portfolio across various industries. Evercore operates within the competitive capital markets industry, where it has managed to sustain growth and profitability. The firm's GF Score of 75 indicates a strong potential for future performance. However, its financial metrics such as the Profitability Rank and Growth Rank suggest areas where improvement is needed to enhance its market standing further. While Vanguard has increased its holdings in Evercore, other significant investors like Fisher Asset Management, LLC, John Rogers (Trades, Portfolio), and First Eagle Investment (Trades, Portfolio) also maintain substantial positions. This collective interest from prominent investors underscores Evercore's appeal in the investment banking sector, despite its current overvaluation relative to the GF Value. Vanguard Group Inc's recent acquisition of Evercore shares represents a strategic enhancement of its portfolio, reflecting confidence in Evercore's ongoing growth and stability within the capital markets industry. This move not only diversifies Vanguard's holdings but also positions it strongly in a sector poised for future growth. As the market dynamics evolve, the impact of this transaction will likely be a focal point for both current and potential investors in both Vanguard and Evercore.

On September 30, 2024, Vanguard Group Inc, a prominent investment firm, expanded its portfolio by acquiring an additional 795,032 shares of 8x8 Inc (NASDAQ:EGHT), a leader in cloud communications technology. This transaction increased Vanguard's total holdings in the company to 12,923,468 shares, reflecting a significant endorsement of 8x8 Inc's market potential. The shares were purchased at a price of $2.04 each, underscoring a strategic move by Vanguard to capitalize on current market valuations. Founded in 1975 by John C. Bogle, Vanguard Group Inc has grown into one of the world's largest investment management companies. Known for its low-cost mutual funds and ETFs, Vanguard operates under a unique client-owned structure, which aligns its interests directly with those of its investors. The firm's strategy focuses on broad diversification and rigorous cost management, which has historically provided substantial returns to its investors. Vanguard's global presence and robust product offerings continue to attract a diverse client base, from individual investors to large institutions. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with EGHT. 8x8 Inc specializes in providing unified communications and contact-center-as-a-service software applications. With a primary focus on the U.S. market, the company serves approximately 2.5 million users, facilitating seamless omnichannel communications across various platforms. Despite a challenging market environment, 8x8 Inc maintains a market capitalization of $281.046 million and a current stock price of $2.19, which is below its GF Value of $4.05, indicating potential undervaluation concerns. Vanguard's recent acquisition of 8x8 Inc shares represents a minor addition to its vast portfolio, given the firm's total equity of $5,205.55 trillion. However, this move signals Vanguard's confidence in 8x8 Inc's growth prospects and its strategic fit within Vanguard's investment philosophy. The transaction, while modest, aligns with Vanguard's approach of investing in value-driven and potentially underappreciated assets. 8x8 Inc's financial health presents a mixed picture. The company's GF Score of 64 suggests moderate future performance potential. However, its financial strength could be concerning, with a Altman Z score of -0.37 indicating potential distress. The stock's year-to-date performance has declined by 40.33%, reflecting broader market challenges. Nonetheless, the recent transaction by Vanguard has led to a 7.35% increase in the stock's price, showing immediate positive market reaction. Vanguard's position in 8x8 Inc is now more substantial compared to other major investors, including First Eagle Investment (Trades, Portfolio) Management, LLC, which previously held a significant stake. This strategic increase in Vanguard's holdings could be seen as a move to capitalize on potential long-term growth and market recovery, considering 8x8 Inc's innovative technology solutions and market position. Vanguard Group Inc's recent acquisition of shares in 8x8 Inc underscores its strategy of investing in potentially undervalued companies with strong growth prospects. While the immediate impact on Vanguard's portfolio is minimal, the long-term strategic implications could be significant, aligning with Vanguard's history of successful, value-driven investments. This move not only reflects Vanguard's confidence in 8x8 Inc's business model but also its commitment to securing promising opportunities for its investors.

The stock has shown a remarkable year-to-date increase of 52.46% and an impressive 959.47% rise since its IPO. Despite these gains, SiTime's financial health could be a concern, as indicated by its profitability rank of 3/10 and a growth rank of 7/10. While Vanguard has increased its stake in SiTime, it is noteworthy to mention that Baron Funds remains the largest shareholder, underscoring the competitive interest in SiTime's promising market position and technological offerings. Vanguard's recent acquisition of SiTime shares highlights a strategic positioning by the investment firm to capitalize on the expected growth in the semiconductor industry. This move not only reinforces Vanguard's commitment to diversifying its investment portfolio but also signals confidence in SiTime's future market performance and innovation trajectory.

Title: Vanguard Group Inc's Strategic Acquisition of FTAI Aviation Ltd Shares

On September 30, 2024, Vanguard Group Inc made a significant addition to its investment portfolio by acquiring 10,363,209 shares of FTAI Aviation Ltd (NASDAQ:FTAI). This transaction, executed at a price of $132.90 per share, marks a notable expansion in Vanguard's holdings in the aerospace sector. The shares added represent a 5.96% increase, bringing Vanguard's total ownership in FTAI to a substantial 10.13% of its portfolio. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 12 Warning Signs with FTAI. Founded in 1975 by John C. Bogle, Vanguard Group Inc has grown into a premier mutual funds company with a unique client-owned structure. This structure allows Vanguard to focus on reducing costs and maximizing returns for its investors. Known for its pioneering role in creating index mutual funds, Vanguard continues to lead with cost-efficient investment solutions across a broad spectrum of asset classes. Vanguard's global presence and commitment to investor success have helped it manage over $5.2 trillion in assets worldwide. FTAI Aviation Ltd, established with its IPO in 2015, operates in the aerospace industry, focusing on the leasing and maintenance of commercial jet engines and aircraft. With a market capitalization of $14.28 billion, FTAI has been recognized for its robust business model that leverages stable cash flows from aviation assets to drive growth and asset appreciation. Despite its significant market presence, the company's current financial metrics indicate challenges, as reflected in its GF Value and profitability indicators. The recent acquisition by Vanguard is poised to have a dual impact. Firstly, it increases Vanguard's influence in FTAI, aligning with its strategy to invest in high-potential sectors like aerospace. Secondly, this move could signal to the market a positive endorsement of FTAI's future prospects, potentially influencing other investors' perceptions and the stock's market performance. FTAI's stock is currently priced at $139.69, which is significantly above its GF Value of $62.68, indicating that the stock is currently overvalued. This valuation suggests caution, as the price exceeds the intrinsic value calculated based on historical performance and future business estimates. FTAI's GF Score of 71 indicates an average performance potential. The company has a high Growth Rank of 10/10 but scores low in Financial Strength and Momentum Rank, which could be areas of concern for potential investors. Vanguard's top sectors include Technology and Financial Services, with Business Services, where FTAI operates, also being a significant area of focus. This sector alignment suggests that Vanguard's investment in FTAI is strategic, aiming to capitalize on the growth potential within the aerospace and business services industries. Notably, First Eagle Investment (Trades, Portfolio) Management, LLC, along with other investors like Mario Gabelli (Trades, Portfolio) and Jefferies Group (Trades, Portfolio), also hold significant stakes in FTAI. This collective interest from prominent investment firms could be indicative of FTAI's strong investment appeal in the market. In conclusion, Vanguard's recent acquisition of FTAI shares is a strategic move that aligns with its broader investment philosophy and sector focus. While the current stock valuation suggests a cautious approach, the involvement of significant investors and positive growth metrics provide a balanced view of FTAI's investment potential.

When I was seven, my best friend Matt and I set out to create a video game. We drew elaborate levels, otherworldly scenes full of alien fauna and complex jumping puzzles; we cut handsome avatars out of construction paper to navigate them. For weeks, we met and planned the game, imagining treacherous scenarios, superhuman powers, challenges to unlock and master. We wrote down numbers and symbols, logging foggy statistics and win conditions. It was thrilling. The game world and our powers within it felt nearly limitless, confined only by our imaginations, our childish penmanship, and the ink in our magic markers. A month into this process, Matt turned to me and said, earnestly, “OK, now how do we make this game real?” I was confused and hurt by his question. To me, we were already playing it. On some level I knew we didn’t have the ability to create an “actual” video game. We were pretending, though that seemed a meager word to describe the creative feats we’d accomplished. The joy was in our flights of fancy, in creating rules we broke seconds later, in the endless play of limit and resolution. The game consisted of imagining the game. But Matt hadn’t seen it that way. He was enjoying himself, but he believed that we would eventually transform our paper cut-outs into a functional digital playscape, that our play to that point had been merely preparatory, a prelude to something else, something real and rule bound. And he was disappointed, his face darkening, when I told him, “Matt, we can’t do that. We’re just kids.” Knowing it would hurt him, and suddenly wanting to, I added, “This is make-believe.” And that was the end of our game. The critic Michael Thomsen compares video games to prayers. “They have the most promise when they are the least specific,” he writes. This dynamic reaches its most extreme form in what games journalists call the “hype cycle.” A new game is announced years before its intended release, often with a trailer containing no footage of actual gameplay. (Sometimes, as with a new God of War game anticipated this year, it’s merely a spare title screen with music.) The imaginative work is undertaken by the prospective player herself; YouTube comment sections fill up with delighted speculation about what the game might be—story, setting, mechanics. These fantasies are encouraged by game developers, who leak enticing little nuggets of info to advertisers, journalists, and Twitch streamers. The hype cycle works because gamers enjoy it. Imagining the perfect game is pleasurable in a way that’s distinct from the pleasures of gaming. As Thomsen writes, “Thinking about games when they are still pristine and unsullied by actual play can be revelatory, inspiring future desires on the verge of becoming nameable.” For Thomsen, video games “promise various forms of wish fulfillment,” but more significantly, “they offer reassurance that wishfulness is still worthwhile, that some mechanism waits out there to receive wishes and will at least consistently respond to them.” What, then, to make of those who actually design and develop video games? Are they loving gods, realizing our prayers, inventing worlds, and welcoming us to inhabit them? Or are they uncaring? Do they inevitably disappoint us? After all, designers are charged with a Sisyphean task: turning our wishes into functional, profit-making realities. At the end of the hype cycle, there is usually only a commodity, a game world filled with rote, time-wasting tasks and derivative mechanics, which pales in comparison to the dream—a disappointment that sometimes ignites resentment and backlash. In his new book Press Reset: Ruin and Recovery in the Video Game Industry, Jason Schreier, a reporter at Bloomberg News and cohost of the popular gaming podcast Triple Click, conveys an altogether more prosaic truth: game developers are not gods. They’re people, workers, prayerful dreamers like Matt and me, navigating the often painful gap between their desires and their obligations, between work and play. Schreier’s first book, Blood, Sweat, and Pixels: The Triumphant, Turbulent Stories Behind How Video Games Are Made, focused on the technical challenges of game-making. Press Reset is more preoccupied with the human cost. Its characters are designers, programmers, and writers working for major studios producing some of the most beloved titles of the past few decades (and contributing to the industry’s $150 billion in yearly revenue): the interplanetary survival-horror game Dead Space, the surprisingly innovative Disney/Nintendo crossover Epic Mickey, and the sub-nautical sci-fi shooter BioShock, famously set within a dystopian bathysphere designed by a Randian objectivist. A few sections are dedicated to the experience of renowned auteurs, but the focus remains on rank-and-file game workers, each responsible for some small but essential aspect of the games we love. What unites these subjects, Schreier finds, is a deep passion for the creative rewards of game-making and a deep ambivalence about the conditions of their work. While many jobs in video game development are well-compensated, allowing workers to make ends meet in some of the most expensive cities in the world, the experience is also punctuated by periods of extreme overwork and an extraordinarily high degree of turnover. During a period known euphemistically as “crunch,” usually just before a game ships, 100-hour weeks are not unheard of. “In exchange for the pleasure of creating art for a living,” Schreier declares, “game developers have to accept that it might all fall apart without much notice.” (Even less tantalizing trade-offs are available to the Ethiopian miner unearthing the rare metals used to make motherboards, or the factory worker assembling PlayStations in China, or even the low-wage retail worker selling consoles at Walmart—but I suppose that’s another book.) Schreier is principally concerned with what happens when video game studios close, which they do, we learn, with startling frequency. “Chat with anyone who’s worked in video games for more than a few years, and they’ll almost certainly have a story about that time they lost their job,” Schreier writes. In one particularly well-reported chapter, we learn about 38 Studios, a doomed gaming venture founded by former Red Sox pitcher (and later Donald Trump enthusiast) Curt Schilling, which fell apart after receiving a $75 million loan guarantee from the state of Rhode Island. When the spendthrift studio abruptly shuttered, employees were denied their final paycheck, received no severance, and those who relocated for the job were charged thousands of dollars by moving companies Schilling had stiffed. But 38 Studios is far from unique. As one industry veteran told Schreier, “With all the layoffs I’ve dealt with, I get a PTSD-type thing whenever there is an email for an all-hands meeting in an office. . . . I’m sure it’s a common thing among other developers.” Indeed, studio shutdowns are so frequent in Press Reset that the individual stories and characters in the book begin to run together. Variations on the same trajectory occupy multiple chapters: employees crunch to finish a game; it ships; they celebrate; soon after, there’s an ominous meeting; everyone is fired; the gut-punched coworkers enjoy a funereal beer at a nearby bar, before heading home to update their resumes. Some decide to go “independent,” making less ambitious games over which they can wield more creative control; others quit the industry altogether. Workers—despite their indispensability to every part of the game-making process—are treated as disposable parts of a profit-making machine. “Volatility,” Schreier writes, “has become the status quo.” Schreier declines to provide much analysis of the structural features leading to instability. (For a more vivid picture of the gaming industry’s labor and production processes, see Jamie Woodcock’s 2019 book Marx at the Arcade.) The excuse offered by business leaders is that the industry operates on a boom-and-bust cycle, conditioned by the release of new hardware. Investing in gaming is high risk, high reward; some massively expensive games flop, while others turn billions in profit. And major publishers are constantly buying and selling smaller studios—often, though not always, in the wake of such failures—leading to layoffs and relocations. But a few of Schreier’s sources provide a more frank explanation: the bosses have all the power, and they don’t give a shit. Zach Mumbach, a longtime employee of Electronic Arts (EA), noticed that while he and his coworkers crunched for game after game, the C-suite executives were going home every day at 5 p.m. “I’m tired of working eighty-hour weeks so that people like [former EA exec] Patrick Söderlund can get a new car,” he told Schreier. “It feels like these guys are playing games. They’re playing games with budgets; they’re playing games with revenue; they’re playing games with overhead. They cut people just to hire people back because it looks good for this quarter or that quarter.” Without an organized say in the industry—hardly anyone save a few voice actors in SAG-AFTRA are unionized—workers’ priorities just don’t matter. As in other creative industries, gaming bosses and managers exploit their employees’ passion to silence dissent and coerce consent for unfair conditions. Schreier describes an “underlying sense that people should feel lucky” to be where they are. “There’s a belief in the games industry that working in it is a privilege, and that you should be willing to do whatever it takes to stay there,” Emily Grace Buck, a former employee of Telltale Games, told Time magazine in 2019. Game workers are encouraged to think of their jobs as the fulfillment of their childhood fantasies. They get paid to create dream worlds and grant wishes. Isn’t that enough? As Sarah Jaffe observes in her new book Work Won’t Love You Back, this dynamic is an essential disciplinary mechanism of the modern workplace. Instead of conceding to workers’ desire for stability and work-life balance, game studios, like other tech companies, provide amenities that seek to collapse the division between work and play: free food and bunk beds during crunch time, ping-pong and foosball tables in the office, and whole workdays dedicated to playing the latest titles by their competitors. “Fun is at the heart of what we do,” one studio proclaims on its website, encapsulating this approach. “We know that if we want to make fun games, we also have to have fun making games.” Despite his evident sympathy for his subjects and anger at their misfortunes, Schreier more or less reifies the notion that game designers are in the business of producing “fun.” “Video games,” he writes, “are designed to bring joy to people, yet they’re created in the shadow of corporate ruthlessness”—as if that’s any kind of contradiction. The notion that “fun” workplaces generate “fun” products may be boss propaganda, but it contains a hidden truth: video games, like any creative product, reflect and refract the conditions of their production. And they tend to serve the ideological and reproductive needs of their time and place. For this reason, the most popular games today do not contain, at their heart, “fun.” What they most resemble, what they seem to dream about, is twenty-first-century work. “Amusement under late capitalism is the prolongation of work,” Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer declared in 1944. The mechanization of labor, the Frankfurt theorists thought, had so enmeshed itself with human “leisure and happiness” and so “profoundly” determined the “manufacture of amusement goods” that entertaining diversions were “inevitably after-images of the work process itself.” Following this lead, game theorist Steven Poole observed in 2008 that modern video games “seem to aspire to a mimesis of the mechanized work process.” We learn—or are disciplined by—the game’s rules and receive positive feedback for following them efficiently. “You didn’t play the game,” Poole writes, much less “beat” it. Rather, “you performed the operations it demanded of you, like an obedient employee. The game was a task of labour.” Single-player games with plenty of weapons to upgrade, skills to gain, and currencies to spend are perhaps the archetypal iteration of this phenomenon, but almost all contemporary games contain some mimetic elements of work and market exchange. They don’t offer fantasies of escape, of imaginative play for its own sake; they offer a fantasy of rules—a rationality otherwise missing from the contemporary wage labor process. Vicky Osterweil has called this type of game a “utopian work simulator”; it doles out rewards at predictable intervals in exchange for our disciplined effort. These rewards can make the game easier, allow us to purchase in-game adornments, signal our achievements to others, and progress in a logical and satisfying trajectory toward an achievable goal. Games remain a form of diversion, but what they divert us from is not our labor, but our disappointment with its volatility, its arbitrariness, its cruelty and unfairness. In its most acute form, journalist Cecilia D’Anastasio writes, workers use “video games to perform the ghosts of [their] daily labors.” A long-haul trucker spends his week off grinding in American Truck Simulator; chefs leave their kitchens at midnight to play Cook, Serve, Delicious! before bed. In the game world, unlike our own, D’Anastasio writes, “productivity is quantifiable and discernible.” Games compensate for an absence of control, reliable feedback, clear goals, and fair rewards in our working lives. In this way, games remain a kind of wish fulfillment, one in which the ideological fictions of capitalism are realized. It’s a paltry dream, reconciling us to falsehoods we must otherwise accept. That so many of the most popular games are also highly realistic murder simulators is notable, too. “It’s quite possible,” as Tom Bissell wrote in his classic essay on the “first-person shooter” (FPS) genre, that games like Call of Duty “reveal that somewhere inside every human being is a shadow human being, one who kills and takes and does what he or she pleases.” Such games, which recreate martial combat and reward players for efficiently eliminating humanoid foes, are surely ideologically symptomatic: a sublimation of repressed aggression and imperial fantasies. But so are action films. What shooters do, perhaps more efficiently than any other game type, is transform an acutely repetitive cognitive puzzle—locate a small point in three-dimensional space; press a button to make it bleed—into an endlessly enjoyable, even addictive pastime. Mobilizing various moods and affects, among them fantasies of patriarchal dominance and competition, violent games manage to “structure as pleasurable the repetition, learning, and boredom that one must master and tolerate to live under current economic conditions,” Osterweil writes. In turn, workplaces like Amazon incorporate gamified elements—public leaderboards; notional rewards for expeditious work; even arcade-style mini-games unlocked by completing warehouse tasks—to habituate employees to hours upon hours of monotonous physical and mental labor. As the FPS player’s prowess is expressed by her “kill/death” ratio, the Amazon worker’s value is expressed by her “pick rate,” homologous measures of cognitive and kinetic efficiency. Video game violence, then, does not function, for the most part, as an outlet for antisocial behavior, much less as a perilous gateway to real-world cruelty, but as a pleasurable veil for socially useful disciplining. Ecstatic digital violence conceals and compensates for the more mundane violence of everyday life, of being conditioned to a benumbing labor process. That such a mechanism maintains a frisson of misanthropic transgression (inhered within the “dangerous,” “maladjusted,” and “reactionary” gamer stereotype) is a mark of its ideological sophistication. In truth, nothing could be more normative, more compliant and pro-social, than buying and playing a first-person shooter. One way or another, we all answer the “call of duty.” Though all games are ideological, not all of them are noxiously so. Some, like Frank Lantz’s “orthogonality thesis” simulator Universal Paperclips, reveal and critique the meager fantasies at their core. Others, like 2019’s Disco Elysium—an ambling, aleatoric neo-noir phantasmagoria—exceed the highest hopes of ergodic literature. It’s tempting to attribute the distance between these titles and those put out by major studios to the profit motive. As Schreier writes, “The video game industry, like all artistic pursuits, is built on a tension between two factions: the creative people and the money people. The conflict between game developers trying to make art and game publishers trying to make a profit is as old as video games themselves.” Most of the characters in Press Reset aspire to build more interesting games than those they’re paid to make by studios like EA. When they leave, if they can find the money, they often do. A less comforting hypothesis is that studios churn out “utopian work simulators” because they comport with our desires—and the needs of the economy. I agree with Osterweil that video games are “fundamentally a reproductive technology.” They help “create, sustain, organize, and train workers and subjects in ways that help them function in a fundamentally unlivable society and economy.” The techniques and grammars of game design have co-evolved with advances in automation, globalization, just-in-time production and logistics, the care economy, and precarious part-time work. And video gameplay, to borrow again from Adorno and Horkheimer, “moves rigorously in the worn grooves of association” carved out by our relationship to these forms of labor. Games, like all entertainment products, shape us into the sort of subjects required by capital’s present. And what sort of subjects are those? In his book Bullshit Jobs, anthropologist David Graeber observed that if, as evolutionary theorist of play Karl Groos (following Schiller) would have us believe, “make-believe play is the purest expression of human freedom,” then “make-believe work, imposed by others, is the purest expression of lack of freedom.” The latter, Graeber writes, “is the purest exercise of power for its own sake.” In other words, the stakes couldn’t be higher: if video games are play, they’re an expression of our highest capacities as humans—our love of freedom, of imagination, and creative whim. But when they are work (as they appear to me in those moments when pleasure fails to disguise repetition), then our affection for them is a grim thing indeed, signaling an extraordinary concession to modern conditions of unfreedom. Press Reset is an admirable contribution to a growing body of games journalism focused on the injustices of the gaming industry. Given that just seven years ago, the world of gaming convulsed in rebellion at the slightest effort to apply the lessons of feminism and anti-racism to the industry and its products, it’s encouraging that people like Schreier—who, with his former colleagues at Kotaku, was on the receiving end of some of Gamergate’s reactionary bile—continue to write and publish critical work like this. In his final chapter, Schreier proposes several solutions to the problems he’s identified. One is unionization: “Every new layoff or studio closure is evidence that the video game industry needs more protection for its workers,” Schreier writes, “and unions are an essential, inevitable part of that equation.” As of this writing, no major game studio in the United States is unionized, but the consortium Game Workers Unite (GWU) continues to agitate for labor rights in the industry. The UK division of GWU formally joined the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain in 2019. The Communications Workers of America announced an initiative to organize game workers in January 2020. Schreier also recommends normalizing remote work so that developers need not uproot their lives every time a studio closes or their job moves. And he praises the business model of a company called Disbelief, whose staff have secure jobs working on several contracts at once for major studios. “I think the future is going to be: there’s a small team in charge of the creative vision, and then all of the other work is outsourced,” one of Disbelief’s founders says. Given the frequency with which tedious design and programming tasks are already outsourced by game companies to low-wage workers in India and China, it’s not difficult to imagine this future, but I’m not sure it’s the panacea Schreier imagines. Meanwhile, many people who tire of working for big studios leave to form their own, smaller “indie” companies. These companies are just as capable of exploitation as, and even more liable to run out of money than, their triple-A counterparts. But when it’s just a small group of colleagues, all of whom are co-owners, the stakes are different. As one of the co-creators of Enter the Gungeon, a hugely successful 2016 indie game, told Schreier, “We did crunch very hard, and it sucked, don’t get me wrong, but it’s a huge difference crunching for a game that you know you have revenue share in.” Improving labor conditions for game developers is a worthy goal; I hope they unionize, and I hope more people can form indie collectives, if they want to. But as games journalists become more perceptive and critical of crunch and volatility, and critics more concerned about the toxic political exhaust of certain games, what I aspire to read is more first-order inquiries. The world of games media is populated (and paid for) by people who love video games; they tend not to ask, or be interested in, more fundamental questions about what games do—or what they might be doing to us. (The critics I’ve cited above are, unfortunately, not representative of the overall critical culture of gaming.) It’s obviously not the case that everyone who loves role-playing games is an obedient worker, nor are all games rote and uninspired. Every few years, a title comes out that genuinely delights and challenges me in the manner of a great novel or film, and does so by methods endemic to the interactive artform. (Disco Elysium was one of these.) But it’s rare. Usually I spend untold swaths of time playing games whose status as entertainment—much less as art—confounds me, even as I trudge on, checkpoint to checkpoint, level to level. What kind of subject am I being shaped into by these processes? And what kind of political economy demands that sort of subject? What, to be blunt, would I be spending my time doing otherwise? We cannot dream our way out of the embracing snares of contemporary capitalism; I know that. But we can certainly dream our way deeper in. Sam Adler-Bell is a freelance writer in New York. He co-hosts the Dissent podcast Know Your Enemy. Homework and piece pay in the garment industry were largely abolished by the global labor struggles that preceded the New Deal. Silicon Valley capitalists have brought the model back. Today, inequality—especially racial inequality—is not only produced through the job market but through people’s ability to hustle. Gig economy bosses—including the CEOs of both Uber and Lyft—are using a narrative of technological inevitability to undermine labor law and the social safety net. Sign up for the Dissent newsletter:

Title: What You Need To Know Ahead of AMD’s Advancing AI Event

UPDATE—Oct. 8, 2024: This article has been updated to reflect more recent share price information. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is gearing up to showcase new tech at its 2024 Advancing AI event on Thursday, which Bank of America analysts said could be a "catch-up catalyst" for the chipmaker. AMD is expected to highlight its line of Instinct GPU accelerators and EPYC server processors at the event, and could potentially offer a glimpse into how it plans to capture a larger share of the AI accelerator market. Analysts expect a followup to AMD’s MI300 series of accelerators launched in the fourth quarter of 2023. The company is off to a strong start in its first year of accelerator sales, Bank of America analysts said in a note Wednesday, guiding for more than $4.5 billion in sales this year. The big question is how large of a market share can it command with Nvidia (NVDA) dominating the AI sector. The current analyst consensus suggests that AMD is expected to hold a roughly 5% to 7% share of the AI accelerator market over the next couple years (while Nvidia's share is north of 80%). However, if it could show a path to 10% by the end of 2026, the company would add about $5 billion in sales, Bank of America said. What could help is the announcement of high-profile companies that use AMD's MI300 series accelerators. Analysts said they believe AMD's MI300X is already used by Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), and Meta (META), and others could be announced at the event. Shares of AMD jumped nearly 10% the day after last year’s AI event in December, and could surge again after this year's event. The stock climbed 1.1% Tuesday to $172.80 and is up about 17% so far this year, thanks to surging AI demand.

Title: Obesity is falling for the first time as Ozempic and weight loss drugs rise
URL: https://qz.com/ozempic-glp1s-obesity-rate-novo-nordisk-1851665617
Time Published: 2024-10-04T17:15:00Z
Full Content:
Newly released data shows that the U.S. may have reached peak obesity in 2020 — and the timing unsurprisingly coincides with the rise of Ozempic and other popular weight loss drugs. Obesity rates have been steadily rising around the world for decades. Globally, obesity among adults has more than doubled since 1990, reaching 1 billion people in 2022 — that’s one in eight people in the world, according to the World Health Organization. In the U.S., the situation is even more severe, with 40% of American adults classified as obese. But according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the country’s obesity rate is starting to shrink. The adult obesity rate in the U.S. fell to 40.3% in 2023, from 41.9% in 2020, according to the latest National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Although the report doesn’t specify the cause of the decline, the timing points to the growing use of GLP-1 treatments in the U.S. as a potential factor. GLP-1 drugs, which mimic a hormone that regulates blood sugar and suppresses appetite, have become highly sought after for their weight loss effects. Novo Nordisk (NVO) launched Ozempic in 2017 for diabetes, but its weight loss side effects led doctors to prescribe it off-label for weight management. The company then tested higher doses of the drug’s active ingredient, semaglutide, specifically for weight loss. In 2021, the FDA approved this higher-dose version as Wegovy, which has been shown to help users lose an average of 15% of their body weight in 68 weeks. Soaring demand for these treatments has transformed Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly (LLY), the maker of competing GLP-1 medications Mounjaro and Zepbound, into the most valuable pharma companies in the world. Financial Times columnist John Burn-Murdoch observed that the country’s consumer-driven culture, which has contributed to obesity, could be the solution to overcoming it. “The US leading the descent is a beautiful twist. Its unparalleled consumer culture sent its obesity rate rising faster and further than almost anywhere else. When the solution was regulation or moderation, America was at a disadvantage. But when procuring and distributing large quantities of pharmaceuticals is the name of the game, the U.S. is unrivaled. These drugs are more widely available there than anywhere else,” Burn-Murdoch wrote. A significant portion of sales for these GLP-1 drugs come from the U.S. Since 2018, Novo Nordisk has generated $50 billion in revenue from Ozempic and Wegovy, with 72% of that amount attributed to U.S. sales, as noted by Sen. Bernie Sanders in September during a Senate committee hearing on the high prices of these drugs. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Full Content:
Welcome back, folks! I had a great time at Portland Retro Game Expo last week. We had a weird bit where someone triggered the fire alarm, and we had to wait outside for a few minutes, but it was a great time overall. I got to meet some fascinating artists and people, got to see former-This Week in Games writer Heidi, and got my Taitronica zine from her. I even got to meet Cam Clarke (and was a complete mess during it). Did I find any copies of Izuna: Legend of the Unemployed Ninja? Nope! I only found a single table that had two copies of the sequel—a bunch of the stalls had never even heard of Izuna before. It's rather humbling to see that the one game you love is much, much rarer than you think. I also had a nice bit with some friends in VR chat afterward; someone made a stray reference to Boktai, referencing "a game with a solar cell in the cartridge," and it activated my sleeper agent neurons. My buddies learned a lesson of how passionate I am for the Boktai games last Saturday... Ay, time to bring up Xenoblade Chronicles 3 again! Monolith Soft, the esteemed developer behind the Xeno-games (not just Xenoblade, but also Xenosaga and kinda-sorta Xenogears) officially formed in 1999 and celebrated its 25th anniversary earlier this week. And they commemorated that happy event with a cute music video featuring clips from all of their games. No, not just the Xeno-games, all of them. Monolith Soft's origins lie with Tetsuya Takahashi, formerly an employee of Square Enix. His proposed treatment for Final Fantasy VII, featuring god-like computers, giant robots, and star-crossed lovers, was passed over as a Final Fantasy game but expanded into its own game, titled Xenogears. Sadly, while Xenogears was envisioned as one part of a sprawling epic, its production troubles left it stillborn; Takahashi would leave Square and found Monolith Soft in 1999 with the help of then-Namco's founder Masaya Nakamura. With Namco, Monolith would create the ambitious Baten Kaitos, but also the equally-ambitious Xenosaga series, intended as a second go-around for the ideas and concepts from Xenogears. Sadly, Xenosaga was too ambitious for its own good; the five-part series was condensed into just three and hasn't really been seen since the PS2 days. Monolith would also produce other titles like the Japan-only Soma Bringers, Disaster: Day of Crisis, and Namco × CAPCOM (as well as its sequels, Super Robot Wars OG: Endless Frontier and Project X Zone). Somewhere along the line, they were acquired by Nintendo; while we're normally against acquisitions, Nintendo has managed Monolith Soft well and allowed them to continue to play to their strengths. This led to the creation of Xenoblade Chronicles in 2010. Sure, it took a lot of arm-twisting to get it in America, but it opened the door to a sprawling epic where Takahashi would finally get to tell his story of men and women challenging and defying their fates ordained by tyrannical deities (with lots of Kabbalistic imagery). They'd also serve as Nintendo's pinch hitters, greatly assisting with the production of games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Their anniversary video is simple, showing snippets of Monolith's past titles (minus Xenogears—that one still belongs to Square Enix). They make sure to frame the video around Noah and Mio, the protagonists of their recent Xenoblade Chronicles 3. while also making sure to bring in the rest of the gang: Shulk and Fiora from Xenoblade Chronicles; Rex, Pyra, and Mythra from Xenoblade Chronicles 2; KOS-MOS from Xenosaga and Elma from Xenoblade Chronicles X. With the Xenoblade games being Monolith's magnum opus, and with how much Nintendo has benefited from the epic, it's a small wonder they're giving the Xeno-crew so much love. The video was also retweeted by Monolith collaborators, composer Yasunori Mitsuda and character designer Saito Masatsugu. Monolith has also shared 25 wallpapers with 25 of their characters for the occasion. The video also ends with the message "Pioneering the future of gaming—"; certainly an ambitious claim... but not one that I can blame Monolith for. Ignoring the massive help they've given Nintendo's big franchises, Monolith themselves really know how to make open-world games work on Nintendo's consoles—massive, hundred-hour games packed with story and characters running on glorified android devices (and they barely reach 15 gigs in size!). Sure, the games would look nicer on better hardware, but you don't worry much about framerate when Beyond The Sky finally starts playing. We know Monolith is possibly working on a medieval RPG, given some of the hiring solicitations they sent out starting in 2017. Some folks look at Elma and KOS-MOS in the anniversary video and hope this means we're getting remasters of their respective games, which would be phenomenal (especially since Xenoblade Chronicles X is one of the last few Wii U games still trapped on that console), but we'll cross that bridge when we get there. Especially since Preview Guide has kept me too busy to play games, and I really want to avoid burnout for Xenoblade, it's too special to get burnt out over. But also, I really wanna play Zelda and Mana, guys. Regardless, it's almost inevitable that Xenoblade Chronicles X gets remade eventually, especially with Nintendo's new console on the horizon. I look forward to it, as well as any other surprises Monolith Soft may have for us in the future. We really did end up remembering their names... Off the top of my head, there are only two franchises I can think of that put so much weight upon monster poop: Monster Hunter (wherein monster dung can be used as a deterrent) and Digimon (wherein not a single creature has ever been housebroken). Perhaps you've said to yourself, "Man, I sure would love nothing more than to clean up after a Nargacuga with a portable form factor!" Or maybe you've found yourself wishing that Digimon had more of a rustic survivalist aesthetic. Bandai Namco and CAPCOM have you guys covered! In a wild announcement from last week, we learned that Monster Hunter-themed Digital Monster Color models will be sold on a preorder basis! As part of CAPCOM's celebration of Monster Hunter's 20th anniversary, they've teamed up with Bandai Namco to produce these pets. They're no mere reshells, either: actual Monster Hunter wyverns will be attainable and can be raised as pets. It's all within the Digital Monster format, so there are obviously going to be a few normal Digimon in there—these are based on the Digital Monster Color ver. 1 and ver. 2 pets, so expect some of the usual stand-bys from those rosters like Agumon, Teddymon, Veggiemon, and Gabumon. But the monster selection is also extensive; while they're split across both versions, you'll be able to raise Nargacuga, Rajang, Kezu, Mizutsune, Tigrex, and Gore Magala—along with the two showcase Wyverns, Liolaeus (known as "Rathalos" in the United States) and Zinogre. As a bonus, there will be unique Jogress forms (read: D.N.A. Digivolution) for both Greymon and Garurumon with their respective Wyverns: Greymon gets a unique LaeusGreymon form ("RathGreymon," maybe?), and Garurumon fuses with Zinogre for "ZinoGarurumon" (which rolls off the tongue better). For folks who might be wondering if that'll have any quirks compared to the original Digital Monster virtual pets... sadly, outside of the LaeusGreymon and ZinoGarurumon forms, it likely won't. They're modified Digital Monster Color v-pets, and as such have all the features from those pets (backlit color LCD screens, rechargeable batteries compatible with Type-C power cables, unlockable backgrounds), but that's about it. Quality of life features with the batteries aside, the Digital Monster Color pets are fairly vanilla. If you've raised a Digital Monster v-pet, the Color ones are the exact same, just with a color screen. Oh, and they cost $60 USD. And if you want one, you're up the creek because Bandai Namco only sells Digital Monster v-pets on a preorder basis. At the time of writing, they're not even up on Premium Bandai's U.S. website, so you have to look for a third-party site to serve as a middleman for them (which means that $60 USD price tag will be more like $100 USD). Unless you're an absolute mark for these v-pets like I am, I find it hard to recommend these for all but the most dedicated of Monster Hunter fans who also have an interest in Digimon. In fact, let me lean into this a bit more. See, I really love the Digimon v-pets, and I'm still working on raising a MarineAngemon in my Deep Savers Pendulum Color so I can move on to my Nightmare Soldiers Pendulum in anticipation of the Wind Guardians, Metal Empire and Virus Busters devices coming out later this year. And the Pendulum Colors are fun! Pricey, sure, but the little clacker is satisfying (even if it means my pets tend to die on me when I'm at work because their Training drains super-fast to encourage more playing with the clacker). There are also neat mods for giving your Pendulum Colors a metallic shell, and those are super-snazzy. But it nevertheless disappoints that once you jump past all the hurdles to get your hands on a v-pet in the U.S., you're getting... a bog-standard Digital Monsters pet with very basic functionality. The unlockable backgrounds and some of the new Digimon being introduced (like Tlalocmon) are neat! But then you look at stuff like Tamagochi Connection, which comes from the same parent company. The Anniversary Editions of those pets blow a Digital Monster clear out of the water—you can earn in-game currency from mini-games to buy your Tama new toys (which unlock more minigames); pets have far more forms they can age into as they grow (albeit a bit randomized); and there are even exclusive co-op minigames if you link your Pet to another Tamagochi Connect. And then there are the mechanics for your pet falling in love, getting married, and raising Tama-babies (which works even if you never link your pet up). All that, plus a variety of cool shells, and they're available right now on Amazon, for $30. The Digital Monster X v-pets had a novel RPG system in them wherein your pet could gain experience from battles and gain levels, but Bandai Namco gave up on localizing those after a production kerfuffle with the X2 models. Past that, none of the Digital Monster pets have done anything half as novel as what the recent Tamagotchi pets are doing. And that's without bringing up all the weird stuff some of the older Japan-only Digital Monster v-pets like the Pendulum X pets, the Accel or the Digivice iC (not to be confused with the other Digivice toys, those aren't v-pets) could do. Mechanics of virtual pets aside, this isn't the first time Digimon has crossed over with other franchises with regards to virtual pets. The Digital Monster Vital Bracelets had a neat Medabots-themed DIM card that allowed you to raise series mascots Metabee and Rokusho, along with Medabot-versions of Greymon ("GreyWars") and MetalGarurumon ("GaruruMetal"). They even had cute "Medabots" takes on Omegamon/Omnimon with "Omedamon" and "OmegaKnight." Will the Monster Hunter devices get an official release in the US? Eh, it's a total toss-up; if you really want one, it's best you track down an import site that'll middleman for you (I can vouch for BigBadToystore and ZeninTCG). And don't dawdle on those preorders; they end faster than you expect. Another Tokyo Game Show come and gone! I sadly couldn't go, what with my being in Portland and not Tokyo. But a lot of news was announced! I'll try to stick to the bigger announcements. As much as I would have liked it, Success Corp didn't announce any further news about Izuna 3 (especially not at the time of this writing); they instead appear to be prepping the release of a very cute-looking village-building game called Hamster and the Village of the Sun, which releases in Japan for the Nintendo Switch this November 28th. I'm rather surprised they're not springing for an American release; it seems like it would be a hit with kids or the young-at-heart that are nostalgic for Hamtaro. Anyway, we're here to focus on fighting games! Some bits of news were called out during the past week. The release timing for HUNTER×HUNTER NEN×IMPACT will be changed from the previously announced 2024 timing to now release within 2025.We sincerely apologize for the trouble caused by this delay to the players who are looking forward to the game's release.This delay is so that… https://t.co/35PqDSTYi2 First off, some news about Hunter × Hunter Nen×Impact, Arc System Works' fighting game covering the beloved Hunter × Hunter series. Sadly for Hunter × Hunter fans, this game is being delayed to 2025. The delay is for good reason, at least: Arc System Works wants to implement rollback netcode into the game and needs the extra time to make it work. Hey, I'll take it! The battle to get mainstream fighting game studios to implement rollback netcode (considered a must for any kind of online fighting game to function properly) was a long and bloody one, and I'm glad that mainstream studios have finally taken the hint. If we have to wait a little longer for our games to get the code needed so that we can actually play people online without a match turning into a slideshow, I'm all for it. And it seems the community agrees on that point; they're pretty unanimous in cheering the addition and are set to patiently await Nen×Impact next year. Folks would also like to see the UI gussied up a bit and maybe see a few extra characters added to the roster, but we can cross that bridge when we get there. I'd offer up some suggestions on characters that would be nice to see in Nen×Impact, but uh... I don't know much about Hunter×Hunter. I know it's great, but I've only read, like, two volumes of the manga. We were also privy to a teaser for Dizzy's much-anticipated return to the arena in Guilty Gear -Strive-! Not much of a look at how she'll play yet; the trailer seems to focus on showing us that even as a Queen, Dizzy is still the gentle soul she's always been. Apparently, she and Sol (her dad) have patched things up enough that Sol doesn't seem to mind her calling him "Dad." I like Dizzy's new nun-like outfit; it's very flattering to her, and the design extends to her familiars Necro and Undine (they're more like black shadows with feathery shawls from Dizzy's wings). More to come later in the month as we approach Dizzy's proper release! And as a final bit of major fighting game news, two new characters are announced for SNK's Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves. Street Fighter 6 fans might be having a ton of fun right now with Terry Bogard having recently joined its roster, complete with a ton of love for Fatal Fury's history in the fighting game world. It seems that SNK decided to reciprocate because not one but two of the World Warriors are joining the cast of City of the Wolves: Chun Li and Ken Masters! Yeah, this cameo makes sense. Fatal Fury was developed by ex-CAPCOM devs, and much of what Fatal Fury did iterated upon Street Fighter's foundations. SNK and CAPCOM had a chummy rivalry during the heyday of 90s fighting games, culminating in the massive hatchet-burial (and fighting game classics) that were the CAPCOM Vs SNK titles. On that note, Chun Li being in Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves makes perfect sense; never mind being Street Fighter's de-facto leading lady, she's likely one of the most important female characters in all of gaming, being one of the original members of the historic line-up for Street Fighter 2 back in the day and blazing a trail as one of the first well-known playable women in gaming. That, and the CAPCOM Vs. SNK titles have given her a fun friendship with Mai Shiranui; the two will likely have a lot of catching up to do. But folks might be wondering why Ken was chosen for Fatal Fury's cameo instead of Ryu; after all, Ryu is the proper "face" of the Street Fighter series and the closest thing the franchise has to an actual protagonist if not himself being the defining character of the franchise courtesy of his balanced moveset. Sure, Ken has plenty of fans nowadays because his moveset has been differentiated from Ryu's for ages and ages—but back in the day, Ken was essentially just a recolored Ryu, and the only way you could play an honest 1v1. So why Ken? Well, it's simple: similar to Mai and Chun Li, CAPCOM Vs. SNK gave Ken Masters and Terry Bogard a fun "frenemy" dynamic, even earning a unique intro where Ken would toss Terry his iconic red trucker cap. With that alone, it makes way more sense for Ken to get the cameo than Ryu (especially since he'd likely be too busy meditating under a waterfall somewhere to fly out to Florida). Of course, this crossover has far more ramifications than I could point out since I'm mostly a sideline appreciator of the fighting game community. So once again, I've tapped Maximilian Dood to help us share his thoughts on Ken and Chun Li in Fatal Fury. Max? https://t.co/n5qS7jaIk7 pic.twitter.com/UMcTRJI0ns Cool story bro, we'll make the check out to "cash". Finally, while this wasn't necessarily announced during the Tokyo Game Show, I may as well bring it up while we're talking about fighting games. Street Fighter 6 has implemented a few costume components for collaborations, like when they brought costume parts to re-create the four Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. But with October starting and folks getting into the spooky mindset, they decided to bring in something from their home-grown horror-inspired series...! A full moon glows. 🌕A howl pierces from below. 🐺The Darkstalkers Gala Fighting Pass featuring items from the eerie video game series is coming in October. pic.twitter.com/b785VucHoO Well, folks certainly have a lot of feelings about this one. So, for one thing, we're getting a Darkstalkers collaboration in Street Fighter 6. That's awesome! But a lot of people are disappointed that the represented character is, of all choices, Jon Talbain, the werewolf. Now, I'm glad that they chose Talbain; it's nice to see some representation of one of the other Darkstalkers besides Morrigan Aesland (yes, Virginia, there are other characters besides Morrigan and Lilith). And CAPCOM committed to the bit, even giving the outfit a separate "wolf howl" emote. But some people are nevertheless disappointed that Talbain was chosen instead of, y'know, Morrigan—the character everyone knows and loves. I think this is okay; it's a disservice to Darkstalkers to only focus on the Aesland sisters or Hsien-Ko to the exclusion of literally everyone else. Darkstalkers has a ton of neat characters inspired by classic horror monsters; Rikuo the (curiously attractive) fishman, based off of The Creature from the Black Lagoon; Victor, the Frankenstein-esque creation; Dimitri, the vampire killer... part of the appeal of the Darkstalkers characters was their goofy monster mash designs getting stretched and squashed in gruesome and cartoonish ways (like Jedah Dohma inflating people's limbs with blood until they burst). Also, Talbain in-universe is supposed to be an accomplished martial artist; even if Morrigan is more popular, Talbain fits the setting better. Folks are also disappointed that Talbain's avatar components are components and not an actual avatar skin, but this works better than just giving the skin to just one character. Will this bring back the Darkstalkers games? Man, I don't know; on the one hand, people are extremely loud about wanting Darkstalkers back, but people being loud about wanting a game back doesn't translate into sales. I think there is room for multiple fighting games from a single company (look at how many Arc System Works has on its plate at the moment, with none cannibalizing each other). But I don't have a good enough bead on the situation to make any informed claim. And I really don't need to see opportunists who've never played Darkstalker try and turn Morrigan into some banner for their culture war because, I dunno, she has a Scottish accent or her chin is too big. It's bad enough I lived to see people who've never played Dragon Quest more interested in propping up Dragon Quest as some cultural windmill to tilt at instead of actually playing the Dragon Quest games available right now, I don't wanna see that happen to Darkstalkers. Normally I'd be ecstatic to have an excuse to talk about Dragon Quest. I love the crap out of those games; the only mainline titles I haven't played are VI, VII, X, and XI. It was love at first sight ever since issue 133 of Electronic Gaming Monthly (which, surprise-surprise, I saw a copy of at this past Portland Retro Game Expo). The GameBoy Color port of Dragon Warrior I & II basically solidified my love for RPGs, and I've been a loyal fan of the series ever since. Sadly, Dragon Quest has never been very popular in the United States. There have been a lot of people talking about Dragon Quest lately, and I wish it was because people finally discovered the emotional story about a boy growing into a husband and father in Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride or the wealth of freedom in Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Sky or, hell, the loveable cast of Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King. But that's not the case. People are talking about Dragon Quest because it's become a talking point in the culture war over a character design change and gender options being replaced with a binary "Type A/Type B" selection. I haven't brought up any of that until now because it's all transparent grifter nonsense. These factors have no bearing on the game itself, its story, or its cultural impact over the past 36 years. They do not affect the mechanics or how the game is played. It is as hollow and meaningless as the gnashing of teeth over pronoun selections in character creation modes, a battle in the culture war that is desperately seeking its own validity where it has none. People claim it's "a travesty to the legacy of the late Akira Toriyama," but Toriyama himself drew the redesigns for the cast before he passed and even okayed the Female Warrior's redesign for the Japan-only Dragon Quest Monsters: Terry's Quest remake that came out 12 years ago (which was never even released in the United States). There's no valid discussion to be had here, no insight to be garnered from any of this: just a lot of opportunists on the Internet who have nothing of value to offer audiences tilting at windmills, propping an unseen enemy as a target for audiences of disaffected gamers to claim some "conspiracy" is afoot, that games—and Japan in general—needs to be defended from a nebulous California-based plot, hopping from talking point to talking point once there isn't any outrage left to mine from a given topic. Because don't you know, in an industry where longtime inhumane working conditions towards developers, unsustainable revenue practices, and rampant mergers and acquisitions have led to tens of thousands of game developer layoffs this year alone, the real problem games face is that you might be forced to play as a woman or a Black person—or worse yet, a Black woman. The state of the industry hinges on there never being a video game adaptation of Michiko to Hatchin. This past Tokyo Game Show featured an interview with surviving Dragon Quest producer Yuji Horii and ex-Weekly Shonen Jump editor Kazuhiko Torishima (best known as serving as Akira Toriyama's editor and immortalized as the villainous Dr. Mashirito in Dr. Slump). The interview sparked a discussion between Torishima and Horii, which served to toss gas onto the fire for folks in the United States. Many claimed that this was proof of American intervention regarding Dragon Quest, up to and including Elon Musk retweeting the discussion to give an opinion on it. But even early on, it was quite obvious that the conversation was being taken out of context. Statements from Torishima regarding American Puritanism were blatantly attributed to Yuji Horii, and several Japanese articles stemming from that interview were misconstrued by Americans. Horii made a statement openly wondering "who [was] offended by 'male' and 'female,'" referencing the "types" that replace character options in the menu, which was construed as Square Enix being "forced" to make the change. KosoKoso, the program that hosted the interview, later clarified that the translation of the interview floating around was made by an unaffiliated third party that had mistranslated Torashima's statements, wherein he was talking about puritanism and not sex education. KosoKoso also delisted the video recording of the interview and requested that people not doctor footage or take their content out of context in the future. #kosokoso放送局 から皆様へ日本時間の 9月30日午後、マスク氏が、メンバーの一部が出演した配信番組の英語字幕付き(誤訳)動画を転載した海外のニュースサイトをリポストした件の騒動と関連報道等につきまして、出演者から皆様へご報告とお願いです#maadspin pic.twitter.com/1H2ZzsLUqi Some had taken the interview as confirmation that some manner of grand conspiracy is to blame for the changes in Dragon Quest III, but any kind of glance at the gaming industry in Japan doesn't bear this out. Heck, not even the interview itself bears it out. For one thing, by Torishima's admission, the Dragon Quest series has changed the art in the name of complying with the CERO ratings board in Japan. Dragon Quest being the national institution, it means that it's in Square Enix's best interest to ensure the game can be sold to as broad an audience as possible—hence the aforementioned changes to Female Warrior's design 12 years ago, as mentioned above. This is no surprise to the Japanese audience at all. As for the gender options being changed to "types"—that's not exactly "new" in Japan, either. Animal Crossing: New Leaf opted out of asking players for their "gender" during character creation, opting to ask players for their "style" instead. Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life also allowed players to choose their body type separate from their gender while also letting players choose their personal pronouns. In Japan, the game gave players a third "Other" option. It's less that there's any offense over the terms "male" and "female" and more that there is an effort in Japan to recognize X-gender individuals, "X-gender" being the identity used in Japan by gender-neutral or non-binary people. Again, with Dragon Quest commanding such a nationwide following in Japan, Square Enix is likely trying to be as inclusive as possible within its own local population. It's not like Dragon Quest is any stranger to genderqueerness, either; Dragon Quest XI featured the extremely flamboyant Sylvando, whose story very strongly hints to at his being painfully non-heterosexual. Who knows, maybe Horii doesn't understand the X-gender community (he's an old man). But it's utter nonsense to pretend there's any American-fueled push to force an agenda when you look at the actual status of the queer community in Japan—there's a sizeable queer population in Japan, and there's no reason for Dragon Quest to ignore them. Not to mention, at no point did Horii ever mention anything regarding Americans or sex education or Puritanism. Being an RPG fan sucked for a really long time. It still kinda does. Final Fantasy as a series became a whipping boy over "effeminate male protagonists" and its melodrama. Kingdom Hearts has ensured that Tetsuya Nomura will forever be associated with "confusing stories" and zonko character outfits with too many belts. Where RPGs used to be a prestige genre courtesy of games like Final Fantasy VII, Japanese RPGs became a problem that needed to be solved throughout the 2000s. And no series got it worse than Dragon Quest. For whatever reason, Dragon Quest (known in the U.S. as Dragon Warrior until 2005's localization of Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King) constantly got short thrift. It's not for no good reason; this past weekend at Portland Retro Game Expo, I was able to watch Jeremy Parish host a panel on Dragon Warrior's release in the U.S. and how it bombed drastically—a game that was, at the time of its American release, three years old and far outdated compared to contemporary titles like Phantasy Star, and far surpassed by its later sequels like Dragon Quest III. For reference: Dragon Quest VII was released in the U.S. around the same time as Final Fantasy X and was completely buried over it. It wasn't until Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age that more and more people finally gave the series a chance in some way. Make no mistakes, some dumb complaints still exist—look no further than people scratching their heads at the Dragon Quest Hero joining the Super Smash Bros. Brawl roster. It was heartbreaking to see so many people claim that Japanese RPGs were so "outdated" because Dragon Quest, "old" as it was... always felt fun. Not even fun "in spite of it all," just plain fun. These are the things that keep people playing Dragon Quest, and it's for this reason that it gets so annoying to see people talk about turn-based battles as an archaic, outdated system that needs replacing (which ties into people's problems with Pokémon, for sure). Getting people to notice Dragon Quest isn't an uphill battle; it's a goddamn sheer cliff. And the one time the franchise gets noticed in the United States, it's not because people are finally playing the game. It's not because someone finally experienced Pankraz's tragic end at the hands of Kon and Slan. It's not because they finally saw Torneko Taloon's happy ending, in which he joyously lifts his son in his arms. It's because rabble-rousers want to use Dragon Quest as a talking point in a culture war they've made up in their own heads. And the heartbreaking part about this is that once Dragon Quest III HD-2D comes out and it sells gangbusters in Japan—and it will sell gangbusters in Japan, there's a reason the Dragon Quest overture played during the Tokyo Olympics—the reactionary hordes will have moved on to some other talking point. Would-be pundits who've never played a Dragon Quest in their life will never again give the series a second glance, fighting another made-up battle in a war that doesn't exist against enemies that exist only in their heads. By the time Dragon Quest XII comes to the United States, the ire will have moved onto some other different game where a woman has blue hair or someone's chin is too big, and Dragon Quest III HD-2D will still have "types" instead of genders as options. All that bluster, anger, and harassment towards fellow fans and creators when you could have just sat down and played a fun game about adventuring around the world. People who claim "they just want games to be fun" can't even be bothered to just play a fun game, even if this is a hamfisted way of attempting to recognize non-binary or X-gender players... oh well. Better luck next time. There are worse things than stumbling a little in a good-faith attempt at being inclusive. I think that's the real reason why events like Portland Retro Game Expo are so important. It's important to see what it's like around people who actually like games and enjoy playing them instead of using them as a demagogue talking point. Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake releases this November 14 on Nintendo Switch, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam. Play it, or don't. Here we are, over a year out from F-Zero 99's release in the U.S. Who would have believed that the game would still be going strong? Even I'm surprised. Even now, more new levels and decals are being added to the game—and these are serious doozies that few would have ever imagined they'd see in the US! For reference, you may have heard of the Satellaview, a broadcast satellite add-on for the Super Famicom that allowed players to tune into scheduled broadcasts in order to stream a game onto their console. Given its nature, you couldn't keep the game, but the broadcast allowed for a unique take to these games. BS The Legend of Zelda, for example, was an updated remix of The Legend of Zelda that featured a broadcast soundtrack featuring orchestral music and a voice track. You only had one hour a week to beat the game in its entirety, however. The Satellaview had numerous games made for it, but given their nature, they're mostly considered lost media. Even in the cases where footage has been found of these games, the broadcast nature of their soundtracks means that their music is nevertheless missing. Someone at Nintendo decided to dig deep into their pockets because it looks like some Satellaview content has been brought back to light! Additional content for F-ZERO 99 is now available for #NintendoSwitchOnline members! ➡ New league: Grand Prix Ace League➡ 5 new tracks➡ New machine decals➡ Expanded Practice Modehttps://t.co/NYi3QoTQ62 pic.twitter.com/AvWc5qgXUU The latest update to F-Zero 99 includes five new stages for the game, these being stages from BS F-Zero Gran Prix. These stages—Mute City IV, Sand Storm I, Big Blue II, Sand Storm II, and Silence II—encompass the new "Ace League," just as they did in the BS F-Zero. The update also brings with it new decals for the four racing machines in F-Zero 99, these based on the racing machines from BS F-Zero: Blue Thunder, Luna Bomber, Green Amazone, and Fire Scorpion. Players can also unlock a variety of new badges and emotes as a part of F-Zero 99's one-year anniversary. And the hits keep on coming! If you've been missing the GameBoy Advance F-Zero titles, Nintendo has you covered—and then some! Take down Zoda and his Dark Million organization in F-ZERO CLIMAX and enter the ultra-high-speed F-Zero Grand Prix races in F-Zero - GP Legend! These two classic #GameBoy Advance F-Zero games are coming to #NintendoSwitch for #NintendoSwitchOnline + Expansion members on 10/11! pic.twitter.com/RNiCUxkGKt F-Zero: GP Legend gets forgotten a lot. Understandable, since it was an F-Zero game released on the GameBoy Advanced and it's not F-Zero GX. But it was based on the F-Zero: GP Legend anime (yes, that one) and an otherwise fun little racer all-around. But also easily forgotten is F-Zero: Climax, which never even saw release in the U.S. Until now, that is! It's unfortunately untranslated (I imagine Nintendo can't really be bothered to localize a 20-year-old game from a defunct platform, fair enough). But it nevertheless includes Climax's level editor. Oh, and the exclusive E-Reader levels from F-Zero: GP Legend. Hey, we can't get Climax translated, but we can be sure they'll give us as complete a package as possible. A lot of folks are wondering if this means F-Zero GX will get some kind of re-release, but I'm not holding my breath. Nintendo probably just decided to make some old games available again (and we know for sure that someone working on F-Zero 99 is a true believer that can and will move mountains). The return of the two Golden Sun games hasn't led to a new title, after all, and the releases for Legendary Starfy hasn't led to a new Starfy game either. Let's just appreciate this for what it is: a long-ignored series getting some seriously deeply-set love. If Satellaview levels and an unreleased game finally being brought to America can't move your F-Zero loving heart, I don't know what will. And because we're all in the mood, here's that scene from the F-Zero anime. That'll do it for this week. Once again, I'm encouraging folks to look up any retro-gaming events in their cities or communities. I understand these will likely be a lot harder for folks who live in more remote areas (I know that a retro-game expo would struggle back home in Puerto Rico), but try to make it out to these places whenever you can. It's not because of the nerd celebs that might go; it's because, at the end of the day, it feels good to be around your fellows when they have like-minded interests. It's nice to see folks light up when their cosplay gets recognized (shout-out to the one cosplayer who dressed up as Marina from Fear and Hunger: Termina). It's nice to talk shop with people who are equally as passionate about rare or obscure games or local artists peddling wares. The gaming community is better for people who actually work to bring people together and celebrate what they love and worse for demagogues. Be good to each other, I'll see you in seven.

Title: Wix Stores

It doesn't pay to ignore online shoppers, and Wix Stores ensures that your products or services appear in front of as many potential customers as possible. The e-commerce platform combines a website builder with site creation tools that let you build a professional online shop with no coding knowledge required. You'll pay slightly more money than you would for a standard Wix site, but chances are you'll find the results are well worth it. Accordingly, Wix Stores earns our Editors' Choice award alongside Shopify for e-commerce services geared toward beginners and small businesses that want to sell digital and physical goods. Wix Stores is Wix's e-commerce arm, and you can set up an account in two ways. One method is to visit Wix.com and sign up for at least the Core hosting plan (you cannot accept payments using the entry-level Light tier). The three Wix business-centric plans—Core, Business, and Business Elite—provide e-commerce tools, too. There's also a bespoke Enterprise plan. The second method is for people who created a site using a traditional Wix website builder: the free Wix Stores add-on app. You can find the app in the Wix App Market and add it to your website with just a few clicks. Either method you choose gets you essentially the same service. Due to Wix Stores' proprietary tech, you cannot use the app with other web hosts. Wix offers more affordable plans that don't include e-commerce elements, but for the sake of this review, we'll focus on the site builder plans that offer selling options. Core ($27 per month, with discounts for annual plans) offers a free domain for a year, 50GB of storage, 50,000 products, drop-shipping, gift cards, and the ability to sell products via social channels. That's just the tip of the iceberg; Wix Stores is stacked with potential money-making features. The $39-per-month Business plan (with discounts for yearly plans) builds upon Core by including 100GB of storage, subscriptions and recurring payments, USPS shipping discounts, user reviews, and the ability to sell in online marketplaces. Business Elite ($149 per month, with discounts for long-term plans) has a loyalty program, custom reports, priority customer care, and unlimited storage. The top-tier Enterprise plan (contact Wix for a custom price quote) adds many advanced features, including enterprise-grade security and VIP-level customer support. Wix charges 2.9% and 30 cents for transaction fees across the board. Comparatively, Shopify offers three packages as part of its standard offering: Basic Shopify, Shopify, and Advanced Shopify. They include 10 fulfillment locations, shipping discounts, and the POS Lite software system for brick-and-mortar businesses. Unlike Wix Stores, Shopify has varied transaction fees. It also includes unlimited bandwidth and storage, which is helpful for companies with deep inventories that expect heavy traffic volumes. Like PinnacleCart, Wix Stores is not only a capable and customizable site builder, it's also extremely easy to use. When you start your account, the software site creation wizard asks which kind of store you'd like to create. We created an online store, but we were presented with other site types, such as a blog or an appointment booker. From there, we used the seven-step Set Up Your Site walk-through. Using the tool, purchasing a URL, establishing shipping regions, and making the site Google-friendly by adding keywords, favicons, and other SEO-friendly elements was a breeze. The draw is the product database, which is simple to build and maintain. It lets you upload photos (from your own collection or Wix's massive stock photo library), add descriptive text, and log item counts. For existing companies, Wix Stores asks you to enter your website name, address, and phone number. The tool searches the web for your information. It can find and incorporate your social media accounts and images, and pull the content into your site editor. The design wizard lets you add a gallery, donate page, blog, chat window, or whatever is pertinent to your business. In short, Wix Stores is quite flexible. Like Squarespace, Wix doesn't let you switch templates once you've chosen one. That's a significant ding against the service, as you need to create a separate site and transfer your files to the new pages to give your online destination a fresh look. For more on how the services compare, check out Wix vs. Squarespace. Once your site is up and running, you can use the Promote tab to create social media posts to Facebook and Instagram (you can add others), and conduct basic email marketing. Wix Stores accepts payments via credit cards, debit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, Square, and Stripe. It also accepts point-of-sale (POS) transactions. With any account above the Core tier, Wix Stores offers automated shipping and tax rates. Otherwise, you must set a standard price for both figures and manually adjust taxes and shipping. Like Shopify, Wix Stores lacks a free trial. On the upside, Wix Stores supports developer application programming interface (API), so you can create third-party integrations outside of the Wix App Market—if you know JavaScript. If you don't want to do that, the Wix App Market contains hundreds of add-ons. Wix Stores offers 24/7 phone and chat-based support when emailing is not enough. We found it easy to get someone in chat even in the morning's wee hours, and the phone support representative helped answer our questions about the different options available in each package.Website uptime is one of the most important aspects of a hosting service. If your site is down, clients or customers cannot find you or access your products or services. Wix has a 99.9% uptime rate, and you can monitor the service's uptime via the company's status page. If your goal is to create a gorgeous e-commerce site that's easily edited, Wix Stores is an excellent option. Its wide breadth of features and deep well of stock media are points in its favor, helping you create and customize a site that's uniquely yours. Whether you're an e-commerce wizard or a web-building novice, Wix Stores makes it easy to sell products or services online, earning it our Editors' Choice award alongside Shopify.

Title: Watch These Meta Platforms Price Levels as AI Optimism Boosts Stock to Record High

Meta Platforms (META) shares hit another record high Friday as investors continue to pile into the stock, impressed by the tech giant’s latest artificial intelligence (AI) and metaverse innovations revealed last week at the company’s Connect conference. Earlier this week, the shares received a boost after Pivotal Research analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak initiated coverage on the stock with a “buy” rating, pointing out that the Facebook and Instagram parent’s AI initiatives have it well placed to boost user engagement, helping the company gain market share in search and social media. Meta shares were up 0.4% at around $585 in midday trading Friday. The stock has gained 65% so far in 2024, handily outpacing the S&P 500’s return of around 20% over the same period. Below, we take a closer look at the technicals on Meta’s chart and point out key price levels worth watching. Meta’s price has continued to grind higher since breaking out from an ascending triangle last month, however, trading volumes have decreased throughout the move, potentially signaling a tiring uptrend in the stock. Moreover, while the relative strength index (RSI) confirms bullish price momentum, it also warns of overbought conditions, opening the door to short-term profit taking. Looking ahead, investors should eye several key retracement levels on Meta’s chart, while also monitoring a couple of bullish price targets we can forecast using technical analysis. During an initial pullback in the stock, it’s worth keeping an eye on the $535 level, a key region on the chart near the ascending triangle top trendline that may have flip from providing prior resistance into offering future support. A breakdown below this level could signal a potential trend reversal, leading to a retest of lower support around $480, an area where the shares would likely attract buying interest near the rising 200-day moving average and a range of similar trading levels on the chart between February and August. Forecasting chart-based price targets essentially works by using historical price action to predict future moves. To project a price target using the measuring principle, we calculate the distance between the symmetrical triangle’s two trendlines near the start of the pattern and add that amount to the breakout point. In this case, we add $165 to $535, which forecasts a target of $700. We can predict a price target using the bars pattern by taking Meta’s trend higher from December to March and overlaying it on the chart from last month’s low, a technique that forecasts a target of around $790. The prior move, which also started from the lower trendline of an earlier ascending triangle, occurred over 62 trading days, meaning a similar trending move could potentially play out until early December if price history rhymes.

Title: TikTok's owner is scraping the web 25 times faster than OpenAI

As ByteDance develops artificial intelligence models to compete in China, the bot it uses to scrape data to train those models is reportedly spiking in activity. The TikTok owner launched its own web scraper, Bytespider, in April, and it’s now scraping data multiple times faster than bots from other companies, Fortune reported, citing research from Kasada, a bot management company, and Dark Visitors, a monitor of scraper bots. Companies developing AI models, such as Google (GOOGL) and Meta (META), use scraper bots to gather data to train and improve the large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models that power the companies’ AI services. Bytespider is scraping web data about 25 times faster than OpenAI’s web scraper, GPTbot, Sam Crowther, CEO of Kasada, told Fortune. Compared with Anthropic’s ClaudeBot, Bytespider is 3,000 faster. Like OpenAI’s and Anthropic’s bots, Bytespider ignores instructions from robots.txt, a non-legally binding line of code that tells web scrapers which data it can and cannot access on a website, Fortune reported. According to Kasada’s data, Bytespider has had spikes in scraping activity in the last six weeks. “It’s like they’re trying desperately to catch up,” Crowther told Fortune. ByteDance did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The China-based company released its AI-powered chatbot, Doubao, last August, and it’s proving to be a tough competitor to homegrown rival Baidu’s (BIDU) Ernie Bot. In May, ByteDance launched a series of Doubao LLMs for enterprises, which cost less than models from the company’s Chinese competitors. Now, ByteDance is planning to build a new AI model using chips from China’s Huawei, Reuters reported, citing three unnamed people familiar with the matter. However, a spokesperson for ByteDance previously told Quartz the company is not developing a new AI model. The company has also designed two AI chips with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) that ByteDance plans to mass produce by 2026, The Information reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. By producing its own chips, the company could become less dependent on Nvidia’s (NVDA) pricey graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are subject to U.S. export controls, people told The Information.

Title: JOBS REPORT: U.S. Adds Robust 254,000 Jobs And Unemployment Dips To 4.1%

WASHINGTON (AP) — America’s employers added a surprisingly strong 254,000 jobs in September, easing concerns about a weakening labor market and suggesting that the pace of hiring is still solid enough to support a growing economy. Last month’s gain was far more than economists had expected, and it was up sharply from the 159,000 jobs that were added in August. And after rising for most of 2024, the unemployment rate dropped for a second straight month, from 4.2% in August to 4.1% in September, the Labor Department said Friday. The latest figures suggest that many companies are still confident enough to fill jobs despite the continued pressure of high interest rates. In an encouraging sign, the Labor Department also revised up its estimate of job growth in July and August by a combined 72,000. Including those revisions, September’s job gain — forecasters had predicted only around 140,000 — means that job growth has averaged a solid 186,000 over the past three months. In August, the three-month average was only 140,000. Payroll employment rises by 254,000 in September; unemployment rate changes little at 4.1% #JobsReport #BLSdata https://t.co/ZwrVfLviqL “There’s still more momentum than we had given it credit for,” Stephen Stanley, chief economist at the banking company Santander, said of the job market. “I would call it solid — certainly not as explosive as what we were seeing last year or the year before, when we were catching up from the pandemic. But the pace of job growth overall is very healthy.’’ The September job gains were fairly broad-based, a good trend if it continues. Restaurants and bars added 69,000 jobs. Healthcare companies gained 45,000, government agencies 31,000, social assistance employers 27,000 and construction companies 25,000. A category that includes professional and business services added 17,000 after having lost jobs for three straight months. Average hourly raises were solid, too. They rose by a higher-than-expected 0.4% from August, slightly less than the 0.5% gain the month before. Measured from a year earlier, hourly wages climbed 4% in September, up a tick from a 3.9% year-over-year gain in August. The economy’s progress in taming inflation led the Federal Reserve last month to cut its benchmark interest rate by a sizable half-point, its first rate cut in more than four years, and said further cuts were likely in the coming months. The Fed said it wanted to ease the cost of borrowing to help bolster the job market. In light of Friday’s strong jobs report, the Fed is now likely to reduce its key rate by more typical quarter-point increments. “The September jobs report shows a nice bump in labor demand at the beginning of the fall,″ said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank. ”The U.S. economy is growing solidly in 2024 even as inflation slows to near the Fed’s target.″ The resilience of the economy has come as a relief. Economists had long expected that the Fed’s aggressive campaign to subdue inflation — it jacked up interest rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023 — would cause a recession. It didn’t. The economy kept growing even in the face of ever-higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. Most economists say the Fed appears to have achieved the once-unlikely prospect of a “soft landing,” in which high interest rates help vanquish inflation without triggering a recession. The economy is weighing heavily on voters as the Nov. 5 presidential election nears. Many Americans are unimpressed by the job market’s durability and are still frustrated by high prices, which remain on average 19% above where they were in February 2021. That was when inflation began surging as the economy rebounded with unexpected speed and strength from the pandemic recession, causing severe shortages of goods and labor. The public’s discontent with inflation and the economy under President Joe Biden has been a political burden for Vice President Kamala Harris in her race for the White House against former President Donald Trump. The jobs report for October, which the government will issue four days before Election Day, will likely be muddied by the effects of Hurricane Helene and a strike by Boeing machinists. Across the economy, though, most indicators look solid. The U.S. economy, the world’s largest, grew at a vigorous 3% annual pace from April through June, boosted by consumer spending and business investment. A forecasting tool from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta points to slower but still healthy 2.5% annual growth in the just-ended July-September quarter. While most U.S. companies are still cautious about hiring, some say they’re struggling to find workers. At Overthrow Hospitality, which operates 11 vegan restaurants in New York, Drew Brady, the chief operating officer, has stopped requiring job applicants to have restaurant experience. Brady is seeking applicants who have a passion for food and a sense of the theatrical. His hourly staff now includes actors, students and foodies. It’s difficult, he said, to find experienced restaurant managers. His latest crop includes a former school principal and a server who had no management experience. “I can teach you how to manage a restaurant, but I can’t teach you how to care,” said Brady, whose restaurants employ between 100 and 150 workers. The new approach, he said, appears to be succeeding, and he plans to maintain it even if more experienced applicants become available. “The circumstances pushed us here,” Brady said. “But because of them, the light bulb went off. It’s a lesson in adaptation.” Given Friday’s robust hiring report, economists say the Fed will almost certainly cut its benchmark rate in November by a modest quarter-point, after its larger-than-usual half-point reduction in September. The healthier the job market appears, the less aggressive the Fed would need to be in easing borrowing costs. The policymakers would want to avoid easing credit so fast as to reignite inflation pressures. “The bottom does not appear to be falling out of the labor market,” said Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy at Glenmede. After Friday’s jobs report was released, Wall Street traders priced in a sharply higher likelihood of a quarter-point, rather than a half-point, rate cut at the Fed’s November meeting: 93%, up from 68% on Thursday. At Otis AI in New York, founder Miguel Guerrero said he’s optimistic that Fed rate cuts, which should lead to lower borrowing costs across the economy, will make it easier for startups like his to obtain financing to expand and hire. “There’s a lot more optimism in the startup ecosystem for getting more funding,’’ he said. Otis AI helps companies advertise online. After a round of tech industry layoffs last year, Guerrero said, “It’s easy for companies to find top-level talent right now.” Consider supporting HuffPost starting at $2 to help us provide free, quality journalism that puts people first.

Europe’s Supply Options Widen as Libya Lifts Oil Embargo - Libya’s eastern government, headquartered in Benghazi, announced it had lifted force majeure on all oil fields, ports, and infrastructure starting from October 3, allowing for a nationwide resumption in oil output and exports. - Europe’s refiners will be breathing a sigh of relief as the almost two-month-long oil embargo curbed Libyan production by an estimated 750,000 b/d, propelling the prices of light sweet grades to multi-year highs. - As Kazakhstan is cutting its production to comply with OPEC+ compensation measures, the Mediterranean’s main light grade CPC Blend started to trade at a premium to Dated Brent, the highest it has been in seven years, whilst Azerbaijan’s Azeri Light was almost 5 per barrel above Brent. - Libya’s rival governments have agreed to appoint Naji Essa as the new head of Libya’s central bank, the key instrument in reallocating oil revenues, replacing Siddiq al-Khabir who fled the country after the oil blockade started. Is Aluminium Set for a Huge Price Squeeze? - The aluminum market is showing signs of extreme tightness as the premium of the LME October contract over November has surged to $18 per metric tonne, a complete reversal of the discounts seen earlier this year. - There is further upside in aluminum prices in case those with bearish positions fail to roll over their exposure and would be confronted with the need to settle on expiry (October 16) by delivering physical material. - Whilst there is no direct indication as to who it might be, LME data is indicating that one trading party is holding a massive long position in October, accounting for more than 40% of market open interest. - Further complicating things for aluminum, the overwhelming majority of LME aluminum inventories are held in warehouses in Port Klang, Malaysia, 74% of total stocks, with most of those volumes being prepared to be delivered out, creating the basis for a perfect storm. Droughts Are Ratcheting Up Pressure on Food Prices - Bloomberg’s Agriculture Spot Index posted a monthly gain of 7% in September, the steepest monthly growth since the early months of the Russia-Ukraine war, as extreme weather is pushing agricultural commodities to record highs. - Severe droughts in Brazil lifted soybean futures to their largest monthly gain in two years, whilst Arabica coffee soared to its highest since 2011 as lack of rain has damaged the crop’s flowering period, too. - Whilst wheat prices have been relatively palatable in recent years, wheat futures shot up in September, too, as Australia’s harvest was damaged by frosts and a protracted lack of rain limited plantings in Russia and Ukraine. - Accounting for about a third of the world’s total coffee and soybean supply, Brazil has been facing the driest weather since 1981, with nearly 60% of the country’s territory affected. China Has An Unlikely New Mining Champion - Starting off in 1982 as a gold-seeking expedition, Zijin Mining Group is set to become China’s foremost metal producer, potentially even matching BHP in terms of copper production as the Chinese firm expands globally. - Becoming the sixth largest copper miner globally on an equity basis, Zijin’s production has tripled over the past five years, mostly thanks to new mines and operations in Africa, the Balkans, and at home. - The company has been increasingly coming under US pressure, being hit with sanctions in August over accusations of forced labor use in Xinjiang, however even that is unlikely to derail the output surge that’s believed to take Zijin’s copper production to 1.6 million tonnes by 2028, up from 1 million tonnes last year. - Unburdened by the regulatory constraints of Western companies, Zijin has outperformed all its peers over the past decade, reaching a market capitalization of $67 billion, less than half of BHP Group’s. China’s Stimulus Package Is Still Yet to Lift Bearish Steel Sentiment - Global steel production has marked its second consecutive year-on-year decline as output totaled 144.8 million tonnes in August, down 6.5% from a year ago as China slammed the brakes on its steel ambition. - The decline in Chinese steel output is even steeper than the global average, down 10.4% year-on-year to 77.9 million tonnes, effectively defying the usual seasonality in China’s steel demand that tends to peak in September. - Whilst Beijing’s economic stimulus might boost the property market into 2025, the physical effects of that recovery will only surface in Q1/Q2 next year as the property market continues to plunge ever lower, with sales currently trending 22% below year-ago levels. - Iron ore futures jumped by more than 10% after China unveiled its stimulus measures, with the Dalian contract now up at $117 per metric tonne, although prices of hot-rolled coil steel only added 3% in September. The Future of Europe’s Carmakers Hangs by a Thread - As Europe’s carmakers pioneered the energy transition and a swift proliferation of EVs, they’re now facing increasing headwinds as the specter of economic recession and plunging sales jeopardize their profitability. - Sales of electric vehicles have plunged a whopping 36% across Europe in August, with the region’s largest car market in Germany declining much more, posting a staggering 69% drop in sales compared to a year ago. - Germany scrapped its $5,000 subsidy for the purchase of new EV sales at the end of 2023 as the fiscal brunt of the subsidy exceeded $11 billion, prompting an almost immediate loss of interest in EVs. - Carmakers reacted by shutting down factories that were previously retrofitted to produce electric vehicles, with the potential closure of Audi’s Brussels plant already prompting nationwide protests in Belgium.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / OCTOBER 04 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love.

SAP pre-announced earnings with a beat and a raise, which acted as a heat shield for the surprise news that long-time CEO Bill McDermott is not renewing his contract. SAP is moving back to a dual-CEO model with a separate customer-facing and product/ops focus for each exec. SAP is strong financially but we believe faces significant technical integration challenges over the next decade, which may have played into McDermott’s and SAP’s decisions. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave Vellante shares recent spending data from ETR and lays out some of the challenges SAP faces going forward. Watch the full video analysis.

In this Breaking Analysis, Dave Vellante digs into Oracle’s business and lays out his expectation for the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 6 – Spending data from ETR shows that robotic process automation is gaining steam in mid-to-large enterprises – A race to improve productivity is driving companies to implement automation in the form of software robots. UiPath and Automation Anywhere show strong customer spending momentum. Blue Prism and other major players, while not showing the same growth, appear to be well-positioned. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave Vellante explains how this market is beginning to re-shape automation for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 5 – Spending data shows that cloud native databases are disrupting traditional analytic data stores. Snowflake and AWS RedShift stand out as having spending momentum based on ETR survey data – Some cloud native databases have been architected to enable storage and compute resources to be scaled independently. This not only improves economics but also drives increased agility and flexibility for many use cases. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave Vellante explains how this dynamic is eating into traditional enterprise data warehouse markets. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 4 – Storage Spending Outlook 2H ’19 – Pure Leads the Pack – The on-prem storage business has been hurt by: 1) the cloud siphoning away demand; and 2) a massive injection of flash storage that has given data center managers enough performance headroom to minimize the need to buy for performance reasons. Pure Storage is growing faster than the marketshare leaders but from a much smaller installed base. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / OCTOBER 04 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand.

Title: How Mining For National Security Will Help Salmon In Central Idaho

How frustrating to be a Chinook salmon. You exit the Pacific Ocean into the Columbia River, then migrate up the Snake River to the Salmon River, where hundreds of miles from the ocean in central Idaho you finally reach your ancestral stream, the East Fork of the South Fork of the Salmon River – only for the journey to end in an abandoned mine pit called the “Glory Hole,” where your path upstream is blocked by a million tons of mine tailings leaching a ton of arsenic a year into your river. During World War II the Stibnite mine near Yellow Pine, Idaho (pop: 32) produced 50% of the tungsten and 90% of the antimony vital to the war effort. Antimony, a soft, shiny metalloid, is used in explosives, ammunition and now in semiconductors, solar panels and night vision gear. Mine operators back in the day weren’t too worried about the plight of migrating salmon or even the gold ore they produced, much of which they left behind in tailings piles. After being mothballed in 1997, the site became somewhat of an obsession for geologists and entrepreneurs who recognized how much valuable ore remained. “We didn't make this mess, but we are willing to be part of the solution,” says Laurel Sayer, CEO of publicly traded Perpetua Resources Idaho (market cap $600 million) who was working as a conservationist, running the Idaho Land Trust a decade ago when she learned about the Stibnite mine and caught the bug. “I was so drawn to the opportunity to marry the responsible production of gold and antimony and leave it better than it is today.” (Stibnite is the mineral form of the element antimony, often found in ore containing gold.) Why care so much? The mine, in the Payette National Forest, could not be in a more remote or rugged location. But its contents are unique to North America, and uniquely vital for national security. That’s because in recent decades China has cornered the antimony market, controlling some 90% of global supplies with mines in China and Tajikistan. Perpetua Resources CEO Laurel Sayer used her experience as a conservationist to navigate eight years of environmental permitting. “When we don’t control the resource, they can manipulate the price,” says Sayer, 67. In the eight years since she started guiding Perpetua (formerly Midas Gold) through the federal permitting process, antimony prices have nearly doubled – to a record $22,000 a ton after China’s announcement in August that it would restrict exports. It was already evident that the U.S. was in vital need of diversifying supply; now getting access to 75,000 tons of antimony reserves at the mine has become a low-key emergency. But although the U.S. Department of Defense is a big backer of Perpetua’s efforts, with $70 million in grants so far, not even the Pentagon can simply order the mine reopened. For eight years Perpetua has labored under the auspices of the National Environmental Policy Act to detail how its new mining operation would clean up the mess of the old one. Sayer relied on her background working on Capitol Hill to acquire the adequate “social license”, mostly by utilizing the good neighbor approach. “In developing the plan we worked backwards,” she says. “What do we want it to look like and what do we have to do to get there?” The vision involved 450 acres of restored wetlands, forests replanted with 65,000 trees and 20 miles of stream reopened to the salmon. In 2020 the Forest Service released a draft environmental statement for the project, which inspired more than 8,000 public comments, inspiring Perpetua to re-engineer for lower arsenic levels and cooler salmon-friendly temperatures in the river. That led to a supplemental environmental statement in 2022, and another couple years of comments and reconsiderations. This September, Perpetua celebrated receipt of a final environmental statement. Meanwhile, a year ago the Nez Perce tribe settled its Clean Water Act lawsuit against Perpetua for $5 million in payments. And even before receiving official greenlights (expected by yearend) Perpetua has spent $17 million on conservation work, including moving 325,000 tons of old mine tailings away from waterways. Naturally, groups like the Save The South Fork Salmon still object to any plan involving open pits and cyanide-based ore leaching. But it’s unlikely now for any heckler’s veto to block a Pentagon pet project. “I’m a mom of a veteran soldier in Iraq,” says Sayer. “I know what it means to have our soldiers prepared.” Another force propelling Perpetua is the surge in the price of gold since the pandemic. Even at a record $2,660 per ounce, demand is strong. Costco, which sells 1 oz gold bars via its website, reports that customers have been buying the bars at a rate of $100 million per month. “Antimony is the enabler, but gold drives the economics,”says Sayer. Over the 15 year initial life of the mine, Perpetua expects to produce an average 300,000 ounces of gold per year at an average all-in cost of $650/oz and eventually generate hundreds of millions of dollars in annual profits. For goldbugs, this makes Perpetua an alluring long-term, out-of-the-money option on the yellow metal, with a lot more appreciation potential than buying shares in a physical gold ETF, or top miners like Barrick Gold or Franco-Nevada. Investing in micro-cap Perpetua is not risk-free. Its stock has tripled since February to more than $9, but it has been extremely volatile. From its peak at $15 in August 2020, it fell to under $2 by the end of October 2022. The company has posted cumulative losses of $600 million going back more than a decade, with $400 million spent just getting through the eight-year-long NEPA process. Despite an annual cash-burn of about $20 million, Perpetua has just $10 million in long-term debts. To build out the mine, Perpetua has tapped RBC Capital Markets and Endeavor Financial to arrange financing and is already eyeing a potential $1.8 billion in loans from the U.S. Export-Import Bank. Tax credits for critical materials enshrined in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act promise to offset 10% of antimony production costs. There’s naturally some execution risk here. With the permitting phase nearly complete, Sayer has turned over the reins to new CEO John Cherry who previously ran PolyMet Mining after years at Rio Tinto. He’ll oversee a construction phase featuring 650 workers who will be transported in for two-week work stints – like rig hands on a Gulf of Mexico oil platform. Sayer says measuring success will be easy: “All you have to do is to see the salmon come back and spawn again.”

Title: Mark Zuckerberg overtakes Jeff Bezos as world's second-richest person as Meta shares hit all-time high

What just happened? Mark Zuckerberg has achieved a lot during his long career in the tech industry, but yesterday saw the Meta CEO achieve another first: he is now the second richest person in the world, having passed Jeff Bezos after his total net worth reached $206 billion. Things weren't looking rosy for Meta in 2022 as it suffered a downturn following the pandemic boom period. For the first time since its inception 17 years ago, the number of global daily Facebook users declined as the company's shares fell 24%, wiping $200 billion off its market value. But Meta's shares have skyrocketed since then, climbing from $90 in November 2022 to $582.77 today. The price has increased over 64% during the year-to-date period alone. Meta's success has seen Zuckerberg's fortune climb to $206 billion – he has a 13% stake in the company – putting him ahead of third-place Bezos by $1 billion, though the Meta boss is still $50 billion behind leader Elon Musk. Courtesy of Bloomberg One area of the Bloomberg Billionaire's Index where Zuckerberg does lead is the year-to-date change. His wealth has increased an enormous $78.1 billion this year, almost $15 billion more than second-place Jensen Huang, whose fortune has jumped $63.5 billion on the back of Nvidia providing the majority of the advanced AI hardware being used today. As is sadly so often the case, Meta's turnaround was prompted by a streamlining process that saw 21,000 people let go from the firm. Investors welcomed the cost-cutting move, sending the stock in the right direction. Meta stock price over the last five years Meta has reported better-than-expected sales this year, and is pushing hard into the generative AI field with its own Large Language Models and chatbots – the sort of stuff that investors love, even if most of the public isn't as enthusiastic. Meta's stock has reached an all-time high following Meta Connect 2024, which had huge focus on artificial intelligence. The company also revealed several new tech products, including a pair of AR smart glasses capable of projecting holograms directly into a user's field of vision. Jensen Huang called the Project Orion glasses "a big deal." TECHSPOT : Tech Enthusiasts, Power Users, Gamers TechSpot is a registered trademark.

Title: BofA cuts Warner Music stock target by 10%, downgrades to Underperform
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/bofa-cuts-warner-music-stock-target-by-10-downgrades-to-underperform-93CH-3648873
Time Published: 2024-10-04T10:14:54Z
Full Content:
On Friday, BofA Securities revised its stance on Warner Music Group (NASDAQ:WMG), shifting the rating from Neutral to Underperform. The firm also lowered its price target for the company's shares from $33.00 to $30.00. The revision reflects a valuation based on approximately 12 times the projected CY25 OIBDA, a decrease from the previous 13 times estimation. The analyst from BofA Securities cited a combination of factors for the downgrade, including the underperformance of emerging platforms within the industry, such as the TikTok renewal and the loss of Meta (NASDAQ:META)'s premium video. Additionally, the volatility in ad-supported streaming and greater variability in subscription streaming than previously anticipated were noted as concerns. Market share shifts and several one-time items, like the BMG in FY24 and DSP repricing in prior years, were also mentioned as contributing factors. Despite these challenges, Warner Music Group is expected to continue benefiting from secular tailwinds in the music industry, such as pricing and increased penetration, which should drive long-term growth. However, the analyst expressed that the growth potential and visibility for music labels may not be as significant and predictable as initially thought. The report emphasizes that the current premium valuation of music labels does not align with the level of predictability and potential growth when compared to the broader Media & Entertainment coverage universe. This assessment led to the decision to downgrade Warner Music Group's stock to Underperform. In other recent news, Warner Music Group Corp. has made strategic financial moves to optimize its debt portfolio, including an amendment to its senior secured term loan facility. This amendment, involving JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) Bank, introduces a competitive interest rate structure tied to the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR). Meanwhile, Tigress Financial Partners has maintained a Buy rating on Warner Music Group and increased the 12-month price target to $44.00, citing the company's strong positioning in the growth of subscription streaming revenue. On the other hand, Citi has revised its stance on Warner Music Group, reducing the price target from the previous $37.00 to $31.00, while maintaining a Neutral rating on the stock. This adjustment comes in response to Warner Music's fiscal third-quarter 2024 performance, which showed revenue and adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) figures that fell short of market expectations. In the company's third-quarter earnings call, a modest 1% increase in total revenue was reported, with music publishing revenue growing by 9% and recorded music revenue witnessing a slight decline of 1%. Subscription streaming, however, remained a highlight with a robust 14% growth. Despite challenges, Warner Music Group remains optimistic about the streaming market and is focused on long-term growth. Recent data from InvestingPro offers additional context to BofA Securities' downgrade of Warner Music Group (NASDAQ:WMG). Despite the challenges outlined in the analyst report, WMG maintains a market capitalization of $16.5 billion and has demonstrated a strong revenue of $6.38 billion over the last twelve months as of Q3 2024. The company's revenue growth of 7.3% during this period, coupled with an EBITDA growth of 18.63%, suggests resilience in its core business. However, aligning with BofA's concerns about valuation, InvestingPro data indicates that WMG is trading at a high P/E ratio of 30.44 and a notably high Price/Book multiple of 34.16. These metrics support the analyst's view that the current stock price may not reflect the company's growth prospects accurately. InvestingPro Tips highlight that WMG has raised its dividend for 4 consecutive years, which could be attractive to income-focused investors. However, the tip noting that "2 analysts have revised their earnings downwards for the upcoming period" corroborates the cautious stance taken by BofA Securities. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 7 additional tips that could provide further insights into WMG's financial health and market position.

Title: Sony Pictures CEO announces resignation, Striking port workers explain stoppage

Plus, Amazon employees consider weighing quitting following RTO announcement. Plus, Amazon employees consider weighing quitting following RTO announcement. Greetings, comms pros! Let’s take a look at a few news stories from the last week and see what we can learn from them. 1. Sony Pictures Entertainment chief Tony Vinciquerra announces plans to step down A change at the top of Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) is underway, as CEO Tony Vinciquerra is slated to give up the company’s reins at the beginning of next year. SPE’s Chairman of Global Television Studios, President and COO Ravi Ahuja will take over on January 2, 2025, with Vinciquerra staying on in an advisory role until December 2025. Vinciquerra told Deadline that Ahuja will be a great fit for the role and shared a note of gratitude. “He has very good EQ and IQ. He’s much smarter than I am. And much better with people than I am. When I stepped into this role seven and a half years ago, I would’ve never imagined the extraordinary industry disruption and opportunity we’d face,” said Vinciquerra. “I’m filled with immense gratitude for this exceptional company and its profound legacy in Hollywood history. I’m consistently inspired by my brilliant and resolute colleagues.” No matter the company’s size, a change at the top is a big event to contend with. SPE handled this smoothly amid a changing entertainment landscape by making a runway for the change to take place and identifying a transition period for Vinciquerra. By emphasizing continuity, there’s a better chance for a smooth transition that keeps work and culture intact. 2. Longshoremen union speak out about strike Port workers across the country are continuing their strike over compensation and automation concerns, with representatives for the International Longshoreman’s Association claiming that their actions are meant to benefit “future generations.” According to The Guardian: Joe Mosquera, a crane operator and union organizer with ILA, local 1235, said its goals were straightforward. “The action is going to give us a fair contract and we can get back to work to get people the goods they need,” he said. “This is for our future generations. To keep automation out is to keep our jobs for the future. And if anything becomes automated, we want to make sure that there’s a worker to back it up.” The ILA has not had a new contract for six years. “We honored our last contract,” said Mosquera, “even through Covid when we had to work double or triple. We never shut down, so everybody could get their goods. We didn’t ask for a pay raise. We didn’t walk out to try to get leverage when we could have, because we were honoring our agreement.” In a world in which employee experience is becoming a more crucial part of employer communications, these strike actions bear watching. A major part of the strike centers on automation, which recalls memories of the WGA strike from last year. When workers don’t feel like organizations consider them or their needs and push for automation without any regard for their livelihoods, these situations get sticky and can drag out. For comms pros, there are three main things they need to do amid a unionization push or strike: Organizations derive identities from the people who work for them. Being able to relate to workers and provide them with what they need to succeed begins with acknowledging and talking to them. 3. Amazon employees threaten to quit over RTO mandate A few weeks ago, Amazon decided to call its corporate workers back to the office full-time beginning in January 2025. A recent survey from Blind found that Amazon employees aren’t taking the mandatory badge swipe lightly. According to Blind: “Just days after the company’s announcement, some Amazon professionals said they plan to take more drastic steps, including looking for another job. Nearly three out of four Amazon professionals (73%) said they are considering looking for another job because of the in-office work policy.” Returning to the office is totally fine as a policy, but it needs to be rooted in both company culture and sound reasoning. This is much different than calling people back to their desks because a company is falling behind on an ill-timed office lease — it communicates the ‘why’ behind the move through a shared sense of organizational values. In the absence of that “why”, you leave a void that causes people to speculate. In this case, Stanford economist and remote work expert Nicholas Bloom said that requiring employees back five days a week might be a way of conducting layoffs on the sly. Business Insider reports: Bloom told Business Insider that requiring employees to work in the office five days a week could be a “backdoor layoff” strategy — a move sometimes used by employers to reduce head count without facing the consequences of formal layoffs. He said the move would probably succeed on that basis but would “damage areas like AI where it is hard to recruit top employees.” “Amazon presumably took the view they would rather control costs by cutting head count and take the hit of technology and innovation,” he said. Whether true or not, that idea is now out there and detrimental to the company’s employer brand. Though Simon Sinek’s “Start With Why” talk is standard issue thought leadership at this point, his wisdom rings true: people don’t buy what you do, but why you do it. 4. How about some good news?

Title: JPMorgan sees MakeMyTrip stock poised for 20% revenue growth and margin expansion

On Friday, JPMorgan expressed a positive outlook on MakeMyTrip (NASDAQ:MMYT) stock, raising the company's price target from $100.00 to $120.00 while maintaining an Overweight rating. The firm's stance is based on expectations of a 20% revenue increase over the next three years and continued margin expansion. The firm supports their Overweight rating by highlighting the potential for increased online penetration in MakeMyTrip's various segments. This is anticipated to sustain growth exceeding 20% in the medium term. Additionally, they foresee benefits from operating leverage and a competitive environment that could further enhance the company's profit margins. Despite a recent 21% decline in MakeMyTrip's stock over the last ten days, which contrasts with a stable NASDAQ, JPMorgan views this pullback as an opportunity for investors. The firm believes the underlying fundamentals of growth and margin prospects remain intact. They note that the stock had previously experienced a 24% surge in September. JPMorgan also identifies MakeMyTrip as a strategic investment in secular growth trends, driven by its Air (international share) and Corporate business segments. The firm suggests that MakeMyTrip is transitioning into a high-quality investment reflecting aspirational consumption, which could benefit from broader secular trends including rising disposable incomes, increased travel budgets, and a growing inclination to travel. In other recent news, MakeMyTrip Limited has reported impressive financial performance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. The travel company's gross bookings surpassed $2.4 billion, a 22% increase year-on-year. Revenue saw a significant rise, reaching $254.5 million, marking a 31.5% increase from the previous year. The adjusted operating profit also saw a substantial growth, reaching $39.1 million, a 30% year-on-year increase. In addition to these financial developments, MakeMyTrip experienced a shift in stock rating. Axis Capital (NYSE:AXS) Limited downgraded the company from 'Buy' to 'Add', while raising its price target to $110 from the previous $90. The analyst at Axis Capital Limited cited "increasing evidence of demand normalization" as a factor that may impact the company's stock trend. These are just a few of the recent developments at MakeMyTrip. The company attributes its robust results to diversified travel offerings and strategic focus on different segments. The firm's belief in MakeMyTrip's advantageous position to capitalize on industry tailwinds such as rising income, favorable demographics, and growth potential in outbound travel from India continues to shape their outlook. To complement JPMorgan's bullish outlook on MakeMyTrip (NASDAQ:MMYT), recent data from InvestingPro provides additional context to the company's financial performance and market position. MakeMyTrip's revenue growth remains robust, with a 29.87% increase over the last twelve months as of Q1 2023, aligning with JPMorgan's projection of sustained growth. The company's gross profit margin stands at an impressive 53.29%, supporting the firm's expectation of margin expansion. InvestingPro Tips highlight that MMYT holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, indicating financial stability as it pursues growth opportunities. Additionally, the company has seen a strong return over the last year, with a remarkable 128.12% price total return, reflecting investor confidence in its business model and growth prospects. However, it's worth noting that MMYT is trading at high valuation multiples across various metrics, including earnings, EBIT, and revenue. This suggests that investors are pricing in significant future growth, which aligns with JPMorgan's optimistic outlook but also implies higher expectations for the company to meet. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 14 additional tips for MakeMyTrip, providing a deeper dive into the company's financial health and market position.

NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang has revealed that the next-gen Blackwell AI product portfolio is already in production and that demand is "insane." Team Green's Blackwell AI architecture has been a victim of "supposed" delays after it was initially said that the firm had faced an issue with the packaging technology incorporated in the architecture. It was said that NVIDIA would delay Blackwell into Q1 2025, but later on, Jensen revealed that Blackwell is on track, shipping by Q4 2024, but in small quantities. In an interview with CNBC, here is what NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang had to say: The thing that we have done with Blackwell, and what we have announced, this new AI infrastructure generation every single year, and so we're going to update our platform every single year. And, the reason for that is if we can increase the performance as we've done with Hopper to Blackwell by 2-3x each year we're effectively increasing the revenues or the throughput of our customers on these infrastructures by a couple (2-3x) each year, decrease, or how you can think about it decreasing cost every 2 or 3 years. - NVIDIA's CEO via CNBC Another interesting point announced by NVIDIA's CEO in the interview is that the firm is working towards reducing energy consumption by its AI products. However, given the vigorous innovation cycle the firm is currently in, they have faced difficulties in this matter. Jensen claims that everything is on track, and NVIDIA is spot-on regarding following product roadmaps. However, there are inconsistencies present, which we'll talk about next. It was recently reported by the prominent analyst Ming-Chi Kuo that NVIDIA plans to halt the development of its GB200 NVL36*2 AI server racks and will instead only offer NVL36 and NVL72 servers to its clients. It was said that Team Green is facing manufacturing complexities and that moving with three different AI server configurations is difficult for the firm. While this certainly doesn't mean that the future of Blackwell is at stake, it does show that even a firm as large as NVIDIA is facing manufacturing and supply troubles. Nvidia $NVDA CEO just said the demand for Nvidia’s next chip Blackwell is “insane” pic.twitter.com/B7IoVnLwwQ — Evan (@StockMKTNewz) October 2, 2024 NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture is right on its way to being the firm's "most successful" product in its history, and based on the initial impression shown by the likes of Jensen, Blackwell is going to be explosive for the markets.

Title: AI bubble or 'revolution'? OpenAI's big payday fuels debate

Fear of missing out has rocketed the value of artificial intelligence companies, despite few signs as to when the technology will turn a profit, raising talk of AI overenthusiasm. The mystery deepens when it comes to predicting which generative AI firms will prevail. ChatGPT-maker OpenAI secured $6.6 billion in a funding round that propelled its valuation to an eye-popping $157 billion, sparking new worries there is an AI bubble poised to burst. "We are in the bubble where all the vendors are running around saying you have to deploy it as the latest digital transformation move," Rob Enderle of Enderle Group said of generative AI. "I expect this ugly phase for the next two to three years, but then things should settle." To the critics, buyers don't really understand the technology, and the market needed for it to thrive is not mature yet. Enderle also contended that investors are pouring money into generative AI companies with the mistaken notion we are close to technology that has computers thinking the way humans do, called general artificial intelligence. That "holy grail" won't show up until 2030 at the earliest, he said. Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft have thrown their weight behind the technology, entering into partnerships and pushing out products to accelerate adoption. But the tech giants are spending big to provide sometimes flawed features that for now cost them more than they take in from users. The huge investments in OpenAI shows that Big Tech is willing to sink "substantial cash into a company that's dealing with significant operation losses," Emarketer analyst Grace Harmon said of the OpenAI funding round. There's a "lingering fear of underinvesting in AI and losing out...even if investments are not guaranteed to provide returns," she said. Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst, is one of Wall Street's biggest believers in generative AI's importance and compared ChatGPT's emergence to an "iPhone moment" that will see one trillion dollars in spending during the next three years. An "AI Revolution is not just at our doorstep, but is actively shaping the future of the tech world," he said after OpenAI's historic fund-raise. Wall Street for now stands firmly with Ives and has sent the stock price of AI-chasing tech giants to record levels since ChatGPT burst on the scene in late 2022. Nvidia, the AI-chip juggernaut, in June briefly became the world's biggest company by market valuation amid the frenzy. But according to media reports, OpenAI will lose $5 billion this year on sales of $3.7 billion. The company told investors the pain will be short-lived and that revenue will rise exponentially, hitting a whopping $100 billion in 2029. The question is whether people will pay for generative AI services such as Microsoft's CoPilot that depends on OpenAI technology, said Creative Strategies analyst Carolina Milanesi. "Investors are not sure what the destination is, but everybody is jumping on the boat and they don't want to be left behind," Enderle said. "That typically ends badly," he said. China has requested for consultations with Türkiye at the World Trade Organization (WTO) over additional tariffs Ankara imposed on imported electric vehicles and other vehicles from China. Treasury and Finance Minister Mehmet Şimşek will pay a visit to Qatar and Kuwait to hold talks with officials and meet with investors, state-run Anadolu Agency has reported. Two Turkish clubs launch their Europa League league stage campaigns on Sept. 26, when Beşiktaş travels to Ajax and Fenerbahçe hosts Union SG.

IronNet, a cybersecurity startup, had promised it would combat hackers using a unique blend of expertise and software WASHINGTON -- The future was once dazzling for IronNet. Founded by a former director of the National Security Agency and stacked with elite members of the U.S. intelligence establishment, IronNet promised it was going to revolutionize the way governments and corporations combat cyberattacks. Its pitch — combining the prowess of ex-government hackers with cutting-edge software – was initially a hit. Shortly after going public in 2021, the company’s value shot past $3 billion. Yet, as blazing as IronNet started, it burned out. Last September the never-profitable company announced it was shutting down and firing its employees after running out of money, providing yet another example of a tech firm that faltered after failing to deliver on overhyped promises. The firm’s crash has left behind a trail of bitter investors and former employees who remain angry at the company and believe it misled them about its financial health. IronNet’s rise and fall also raises questions about the judgment of its well-credentialed leaders, a who’s who of the national security establishment. National security experts, former employees and analysts told The Associated Press that the firm collapsed, in part, because it engaged in questionable business practices, produced subpar products and services, and entered into associations that could have left the firm vulnerable to meddling by the Kremlin. “I’m honestly ashamed that I was ever an executive at that company,” said Mark Berly, a former IronNet vice president. He said the company’s top leaders cultivated a culture of deceit “just like Theranos,” the once highly touted blood-testing firm that became a symbol of corporate fraud. IronNet’s collapse ranks as one of the most high-profile flameouts in the history of cybersecurity, said Richard Stiennon, a longtime industry analyst. The main reason for its fall, he said: “hubris.” “The company got what was coming to” it, Stiennon said. IronNet and top former company officials either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment. IronNet’s founder and former CEO Keith Alexander is a West Point graduate who retired as a four-star Army general and was once one of the most powerful figures in U.S. intelligence. He oversaw an unprecedented expansion of the NSA’s digital spying around the world when he led the U.S.’s largest intelligence agency for nearly a decade. Alexander, who retired from the government in 2014, remains a prominent voice on cybersecurity and intelligence matters and sits on the board of the tech giant Amazon. Alexander did not respond to requests for comment. IronNet’s board has included Mike McConnell, a former director of both the NSA and national intelligence; Jack Keane, a retired four-star general and Army vice chief of staff, and Mike Rogers, the former Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee who is running for the U.S. Senate in Michigan. One of IronNet’s first presidents and co-founders was Matt Olsen, who left the company in 2018 and leads the Justice Department’s National Security Division. Alexander’s reputation and the company’s all-star lineup ensured IronNet stood out in a competitive market as it sought contracts in the finance and energy sectors, as well as with the U.S. government and others in Asia and the Middle East. IronNet marketed itself as a kind of private version of the NSA. By scanning the networks of multiple customers, the company claimed, IronNet’s advanced software and skilled staff could spot signals and patterns of sophisticated hackers that a single company couldn’t do alone. The company dubbed the approach the “Collective Defense Platform.” Venture capital firms were eager to invest. Among IronNet’s biggest early boosters was C5 Capital, an investment firm started and run by Andre Pienaar, a South African who had spent years serving the needs of the ultra-rich while cultivating business relationships with former top national security officials. C5’s operating partners – essentially expert advisers — include former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen and Sir Iain Lobban, who used to lead the U.K.’s signals intelligence agency equivalent to the NSA. Former C5 operating partners include National Cyber Director Harry Coker Jr. and Ronald Moultrie, who resigned earlier this year as undersecretary of defense for intelligence and security. Prior to going into venture capital, Pienaar was a private investigator and started a firm called G3 Good Governance Group whose clients included blue chip companies, wealthy individuals and the British royal family. Pienaar also worked at the time to help Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg cement relationships with London’s rich and famous, according to William Lofgren, a former CIA officer and G3 co-founder. “The relationship was steady and frequent because both Andre and Vekselberg saw merit in it,” said Lofgren. Pienaar also helped Vekselberg win a share of a South African manganese mine in 2005 and then later served as one of the oligarch’s representatives on the mine’s board of directors until early 2018, internal G3 records and South African business records show. Vekselberg has been sanctioned twice by the U.S. government, first in April 2018 and again in March 2022. The U.S. Treasury Department has accused him of taking part in “soft power activities on behalf of the Kremlin.” In 2014, the FBI publicly warned in an op-ed that a Vekselberg-led foundation may be “a means for the Russian government to access our nation’s sensitive or classified research.” Pienaar’s long association with Vekselberg should have disqualified him from investing in IronNet, which was seeking highly sensitive U.S. defense contracts, former intelligence officials said. The company’s leaders “absolutely should have known better,” said Bob Baer, a former CIA officer. He added that Russian intelligence services would have had a strong interest in a company like IronNet and have a history of using oligarchs like Vekselberg to do their bidding, either directly or through witting or unwitting proxies. Pienaar also sponsored a swanky Russian music festival that Vekselberg and a close associate, Vladimir Kuznetsov, put on in Switzerland. Kuznetsov, who served as a key investment adviser to Vekselberg, was also an investor in Pienaar’s investment firm. Alexander and others at IronNet either did not know the details of Pienaar’s relationships with Vekselberg or did not find them troubling: A month after Vekselberg was first sanctioned in 2018, Pienaar joined IronNet’s board and C5 announced it was putting in a $35 million investment. C5’s investment would grow to $60 million by the time IronNet went public, giving the investment firm around a 7% stake in the company. Vekselberg did not respond to requests for comment. Kuznetsov told the AP he stopped speaking to Pienaar about five years ago but did not say why. “I’m not commenting on that,” Kuznetsov said. Pienaar’s attorneys said he has never had a relationship with Vekselberg. The lawyers said the mine’s filings with the South African government’s regulatory agency that listed Pienaar as a director were incorrect and should be “viewed as suspect” because news reports indicated the agency has been hacked. Pienaar filed a defamation lawsuit last year against an Associated Press reporter who sought interviews with Pienaar’s former associates. The AP said the suit, which remains pending, was meritless and an attempt to stifle legitimate reporting. Not long after Alexander rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange in September 2021, IronNet’s stock price soared, making its founders and early investors extremely wealthy on paper. Top officials were prohibited from unloading their stock for several months, but Alexander was allowed to sell a small amount of his shares. He made about $5 million in early stock sales and bought a Florida mansion worth the same amount. IronNet was projecting exponential growth that required the company to land a handful of major contracts, according to confidential board documents obtained by the AP. Those prospective deals included one valued at up to $10 million to provide cybersecurity for the U.S. Navy’s contractors and a more than $22 million deal with the government of Kuwait. It did not take long for IronNet’s promises to slam into a tough reality as it failed to land large deals and meet revenue projections. Its products simply didn’t live up to the hype, according to former employees, experts and analysts. Stiennon, the cybersecurity investing expert, said IronNet’s ideas about gathering threat data from multiple clients were not unique and the company’s biggest draw was Alexander’s “aura” as a former NSA director. The AP interviewed several former IronNet employees who said the company hired well-qualified technicians to design products that showed promise, but executives did not invest the time or resources to fully develop the technology. When IronNet tried to land contracts with the NSA, officials dismissed the company’s offerings as unserious, according to a former member of U.S. Cyber Command who was at the meeting but not authorized to discuss government procurement proceedings publicly. The failure to win large contracts quickly derailed IronNet’s growth plans. In December 2021, just a few months after going public, IronNet downgraded its annual recurring revenue projections by 60%. Another sign that things were not well: IronNet and C5 were engaging in a questionable business practice in an apparent effort to juice the cybersecurity firm’s revenues, according to C5 records and interviews with former employees at both firms. In addition to being a major investor, C5 was also one of IronNet’s biggest customers, accounting for a significant part of the cybersecurity firm’s revenue when it went public. C5 had signed two multi-year customer contracts with IronNet for $5.2 million, according to internal C5 records. Contracts of that size were typical for large clients with thousands of employees, not a small investment firm like C5 that had a couple dozen employees and partners, former IronNet employees said. “That’s an inflated number,” said Eddie Potter, a former top sales executive at IronNet, when told by the AP of the size of C5’s contracts with IronNet. He added there was “no way” that C5 required services “worth $5 million.” Indeed, one C5 internal record obtained by the AP shows it budgeted only about $50,000 a year for IronNet’s services. Pienaar’s attorneys said C5’s contracts with IronNet were to help protect the U.K. government’s hospitals and other entities against “escalating cyberattacks during the COVID-19 pandemic.” His attorneys said the work was coordinated through a charity Pienaar and C5 created in 2020. Securities and Exchange Commission filings and C5 records show C5’s contracts with IronNet were signed in the summer and fall of 2019 — several months before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. Pienaar’s attorneys said Alexander and Pienaar were “briefed on the shocking scale of hostile nation-state cyberattacks on hospitals" in 2019, which created the “foundation” for IronNet’s work with C5. Pienaar’s charity never registered with the IRS, as one of Pienaar’s companies claimed in U.K. business filings, and former C5 and IronNet officials said they did not see it do any substantive work. “It was marketing, fluffy crap,” said Rob Mathieson, a former IronNet vice president. Pienaar’s attorneys said his charity was successful but there was “insufficient time” for it to register with the IRS. After reporting millions in revenue from C5 from 2020 to 2023, IronNet wrote off $1.3 million from C5 in what the cybersecurity firm claimed was “bad debt,” IronNet’s filings with the SEC show. Pienaar’s attorneys said the write-off represented a reduction in the cost of providing services to his charity and denied that C5 had not fulfilled its financial obligations to IronNet. IronNet was not alone in having trouble getting money from Pienaar and his firms. A group of nuns sued C5 in 2022, court records show, alleging it failed to return their $2.5 million investment in a tech incubator that Pienaar had promoted as a way to boost socially conscious start-ups. C5 agreed to refund the nuns’ investment, plus attorney fees and expenses, to settle the lawsuit, records show. The nuns’ financial adviser, Carolyn LaRocco, told the AP that Pienaar used the nuns’ investment to pay expenses she believed were unwarranted. An affiliate of the United States Institute of Peace, a nonprofit established by Congress, sued Pienaar in 2020 after he failed to pay a promised $1.5 million personal donation, federal court records show. The nonprofit’s affiliate then took Pienaar back to court after he failed to make payments on time as part of a settlement. Pienaar used $500,000 from a C5 bank account to meet a court-ordered deadline for payment, court records show. C5 staff were concerned about Pienaar’s use of the firm’s funds to cover his personal debt, according to C5 records. In the last year, Pienaar-controlled entities have been sued by a top former CIA executive who alleged C5 owed him back wages and a Washington landlord who accused Pienaar’s firms of failing to pay more than $140,000 in rent and associated costs. The suits were dismissed soon after they were filed, indicating the parties likely settled, court records show. A lawsuit recently filed by a financial services firm alleges C5 owes it more than $1 million in unpaid debts. After slashing revenue projections in December 2021, Alexander tried to project confidence and said IronNet was still on track to see its revenue rise. It didn’t work. IronNet’s stock went into a prolonged skid and the company underwent multiple rounds of layoffs. In April 2022, the company was hit with a class-action lawsuit from investors who alleged IronNet had fraudulently inflated its revenue projections to boost its stock price. The company has denied any wrongdoing but recently agreed to pay $6.6 million to settle the lawsuit, according to a proposed settlement filed in federal court. Alexander told Bloomberg News this past January that IronNet’s troubles stemmed in part from his naivety about how the business world worked. C5 began loaning money to IronNet to keep it afloat starting at the end of 2022 while Pienaar continued to try and boost the company’s brand. In September of last year, IronNet announced it had run out of money and was closing its doors. A Pienaar-controlled entity stepped in shortly afterwards with $10 million in loans to allow the company to restructure via bankruptcy. A dramatically scaled-down version of IronNet led by Pienaar’s allies went private in February and announced Alexander had stepped down as chairman of the board. Pienaar remains bullish on the company, which he said continues to successfully protect clients in the U.S. and Europe from cyber threats. IronNet’s more recent activities have included looking to partner with the government of Ukraine. “Any accusation that IronNet has been anything other than successful is categorically false,” his attorneys told the AP. Many of C5’s investors and former employees are baffled by Pienaar’s continued heavy bets on IronNet after it has been soundly rejected by the market. During bankruptcy proceedings earlier this year, an investment bank approached 114 prospective buyers for IronNet, federal court records show. None of them made an offer. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

The company’s leaders “absolutely should have known better,” said Bob Baer, a former CIA officer. He added that Russian intelligence services would have had a strong interest in a company like IronNet and have a history of using oligarchs like Vekselberg to do their bidding, either directly or through witting or unwitting proxies. Pienaar also sponsored a swanky Russian music festival that Vekselberg and a close associate, Vladimir Kuznetsov, put on in Switzerland. Kuznetsov, who served as a key investment adviser to Vekselberg, was also an investor in Pienaar’s investment firm. Alexander and others at IronNet either did not know the details of Pienaar’s relationships with Vekselberg or did not find them troubling: A month after Vekselberg was first sanctioned in 2018, Pienaar joined IronNet’s board and C5 announced it was putting in a $35 million investment. C5’s investment would grow to $60 million by the time IronNet went public, giving the investment firm around a 7% stake in the company. Vekselberg did not respond to requests for comment. Kuznetsov told the AP he stopped speaking to Pienaar about five years ago but did not say why. “I’m not commenting on that,” Kuznetsov said. Pienaar’s attorneys said he has never had a relationship with Vekselberg. The lawyers said the mine’s filings with the South African government’s regulatory agency that listed Pienaar as a director were incorrect and should be “viewed as suspect” because news reports indicated the agency has been hacked. Pienaar filed a defamation lawsuit last year against an Associated Press reporter who sought interviews with Pienaar’s former associates. The AP said the suit, which remains pending, was meritless and an attempt to stifle legitimate reporting. Not long after Alexander rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange in September 2021, IronNet’s stock price soared, making its founders and early investors extremely wealthy on paper. Top officials were prohibited from unloading their stock for several months, but Alexander was allowed to sell a small amount of his shares. He made about $5 million in early stock sales and bought a Florida mansion worth the same amount. IronNet was projecting exponential growth that required the company to land a handful of major contracts, according to confidential board documents obtained by the AP. Those prospective deals included one valued at up to $10 million to provide cybersecurity for the U.S. Navy’s contractors and a more than $22 million deal with the government of Kuwait. It did not take long for IronNet’s promises to slam into a tough reality as it failed to land large deals and meet revenue projections. Its products simply didn’t live up to the hype, according to former employees, experts and analysts. Stiennon, the cybersecurity investing expert, said IronNet’s ideas about gathering threat data from multiple clients were not unique and the company’s biggest draw was Alexander’s “aura” as a former NSA director. The AP interviewed several former IronNet employees who said the company hired well-qualified technicians to design products that showed promise, but executives did not invest the time or resources to fully develop the technology. When IronNet tried to land contracts with the NSA, officials dismissed the company’s offerings as unserious, according to a former member of U.S. Cyber Command who was at the meeting but not authorized to discuss government procurement proceedings publicly. The failure to win large contracts quickly derailed IronNet’s growth plans. In December 2021, just a few months after going public, IronNet downgraded its annual recurring revenue projections by 60%. Another sign that things were not well: IronNet and C5 were engaging in a questionable business practice in an apparent effort to juice the cybersecurity firm’s revenues, according to C5 records and interviews with former employees at both firms. In addition to being a major investor, C5 was also one of IronNet’s biggest customers, accounting for a significant part of the cybersecurity firm’s revenue when it went public. C5 had signed two multi-year customer contracts with IronNet for $5.2 million, according to internal C5 records. Contracts of that size were typical for large clients with thousands of employees, not a small investment firm like C5 that had a couple dozen employees and partners, former IronNet employees said. “That’s an inflated number,” said Eddie Potter, a former top sales executive at IronNet, when told by the AP of the size of C5’s contracts with IronNet. He added there was “no way” that C5 required services “worth $5 million.” Indeed, one C5 internal record obtained by the AP shows it budgeted only about $50,000 a year for IronNet’s services. Pienaar’s attorneys said C5’s contracts with IronNet were to help protect the U.K. government’s hospitals and other entities against “escalating cyberattacks during the COVID-19 pandemic.” His attorneys said the work was coordinated through a charity Pienaar and C5 created in 2020. Securities and Exchange Commission filings and C5 records show C5’s contracts with IronNet were signed in the summer and fall of 2019 — several months before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. Pienaar’s attorneys said Alexander and Pienaar were “briefed on the shocking scale of hostile nation-state cyberattacks on hospitals" in 2019, which created the “foundation” for IronNet’s work with C5. Pienaar’s charity never registered with the IRS, as one of Pienaar’s companies claimed in U.K. business filings, and former C5 and IronNet officials said they did not see it do any substantive work. “It was marketing, fluffy crap,” said Rob Mathieson, a former IronNet vice president. Pienaar’s attorneys said his charity was successful but there was “insufficient time” for it to register with the IRS. After reporting millions in revenue from C5 from 2020 to 2023, IronNet wrote off $1.3 million from C5 in what the cybersecurity firm claimed was “bad debt,” IronNet’s filings with the SEC show. Pienaar’s attorneys said the write-off represented a reduction in the cost of providing services to his charity and denied that C5 had not fulfilled its financial obligations to IronNet. IronNet was not alone in having trouble getting money from Pienaar and his firms. A group of nuns sued C5 in 2022, court records show, alleging it failed to return their $2.5 million investment in a tech incubator that Pienaar had promoted as a way to boost socially conscious start-ups. C5 agreed to refund the nuns’ investment, plus attorney fees and expenses, to settle the lawsuit, records show. The nuns’ financial adviser, Carolyn LaRocco, told the AP that Pienaar used the nuns’ investment to pay expenses she believed were unwarranted. An affiliate of the United States Institute of Peace, a nonprofit established by Congress, sued Pienaar in 2020 after he failed to pay a promised $1.5 million personal donation, federal court records show. The nonprofit’s affiliate then took Pienaar back to court after he failed to make payments on time as part of a settlement. Pienaar used $500,000 from a C5 bank account to meet a court-ordered deadline for payment, court records show. C5 staff were concerned about Pienaar’s use of the firm’s funds to cover his personal debt, according to C5 records. In the last year, Pienaar-controlled entities have been sued by a top former CIA executive who alleged C5 owed him back wages and a Washington landlord who accused Pienaar’s firms of failing to pay more than $140,000 in rent and associated costs. The suits were dismissed soon after they were filed, indicating the parties likely settled, court records show. A lawsuit recently filed by a financial services firm alleges C5 owes it more than $1 million in unpaid debts. After slashing revenue projections in December 2021, Alexander tried to project confidence and said IronNet was still on track to see its revenue rise. It didn’t work. IronNet’s stock went into a prolonged skid and the company underwent multiple rounds of layoffs. In April 2022, the company was hit with a class-action lawsuit from investors who alleged IronNet had fraudulently inflated its revenue projections to boost its stock price. The company has denied any wrongdoing but recently agreed to pay $6.6 million to settle the lawsuit, according to a proposed settlement filed in federal court. Alexander told Bloomberg News this past January that IronNet’s troubles stemmed in part from his naivety about how the business world worked. C5 began loaning money to IronNet to keep it afloat starting at the end of 2022 while Pienaar continued to try and boost the company’s brand. In September of last year, IronNet announced it had run out of money and was closing its doors. A Pienaar-controlled entity stepped in shortly afterwards with $10 million in loans to allow the company to restructure via bankruptcy. A dramatically scaled-down version of IronNet led by Pienaar’s allies went private in February and announced Alexander had stepped down as chairman of the board. Pienaar remains bullish on the company, which he said continues to successfully protect clients in the U.S. and Europe from cyber threats. IronNet’s more recent activities have included looking to partner with the government of Ukraine. “Any accusation that IronNet has been anything other than successful is categorically false,” his attorneys told the AP. Many of C5’s investors and former employees are baffled by Pienaar’s continued heavy bets on IronNet after it has been soundly rejected by the market. During bankruptcy proceedings earlier this year, an investment bank approached 114 prospective buyers for IronNet, federal court records show. None of them made an offer. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Collapse of national security elites' cyber firm leaves bitter wake

IronNet, a cybersecurity startup, had promised it would combat hackers using a unique blend of expertise and software WASHINGTON -- The future was once dazzling for IronNet. Founded by a former director of the National Security Agency and stacked with elite members of the U.S. intelligence establishment, IronNet promised it was going to revolutionize the way governments and corporations combat cyberattacks. Its pitch — combining the prowess of ex-government hackers with cutting-edge software – was initially a hit. Shortly after going public in 2021, the company’s value shot past $3 billion. Yet, as blazing as IronNet started, it burned out. Last September the never-profitable company announced it was shutting down and firing its employees after running out of money, providing yet another example of a tech firm that faltered after failing to deliver on overhyped promises. The firm’s crash has left behind a trail of bitter investors and former employees who remain angry at the company and believe it misled them about its financial health. IronNet’s rise and fall also raises questions about the judgment of its well-credentialed leaders, a who’s who of the national security establishment. National security experts, former employees and analysts told The Associated Press that the firm collapsed, in part, because it engaged in questionable business practices, produced subpar products and services, and entered into associations that could have left the firm vulnerable to meddling by the Kremlin. “I’m honestly ashamed that I was ever an executive at that company,” said Mark Berly, a former IronNet vice president. He said the company’s top leaders cultivated a culture of deceit “just like Theranos,” the once highly touted blood-testing firm that became a symbol of corporate fraud. IronNet’s collapse ranks as one of the most high-profile flameouts in the history of cybersecurity, said Richard Stiennon, a longtime industry analyst. The main reason for its fall, he said: “hubris.” “The company got what was coming to” it, Stiennon said. IronNet and top former company officials either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment. IronNet’s founder and former CEO Keith Alexander is a West Point graduate who retired as a four-star Army general and was once one of the most powerful figures in U.S. intelligence. He oversaw an unprecedented expansion of the NSA’s digital spying around the world when he led the U.S.’s largest intelligence agency for nearly a decade. Alexander, who retired from the government in 2014, remains a prominent voice on cybersecurity and intelligence matters and sits on the board of the tech giant Amazon. Alexander did not respond to requests for comment. IronNet’s board has included Mike McConnell, a former director of both the NSA and national intelligence; Jack Keane, a retired four-star general and Army vice chief of staff, and Mike Rogers, the former Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee who is running for the U.S. Senate in Michigan. One of IronNet’s first presidents and co-founders was Matt Olsen, who left the company in 2018 and leads the Justice Department’s National Security Division. Alexander’s reputation and the company’s all-star lineup ensured IronNet stood out in a competitive market as it sought contracts in the finance and energy sectors, as well as with the U.S. government and others in Asia and the Middle East. IronNet marketed itself as a kind of private version of the NSA. By scanning the networks of multiple customers, the company claimed, IronNet’s advanced software and skilled staff could spot signals and patterns of sophisticated hackers that a single company couldn’t do alone. The company dubbed the approach the “Collective Defense Platform.” Venture capital firms were eager to invest. Among IronNet’s biggest early boosters was C5 Capital, an investment firm started and run by Andre Pienaar, a South African who had spent years serving the needs of the ultra-rich while cultivating business relationships with former top national security officials. C5’s operating partners – essentially expert advisers — include former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen and Sir Iain Lobban, who used to lead the U.K.’s signals intelligence agency equivalent to the NSA. Former C5 operating partners include National Cyber Director Harry Coker Jr. and Ronald Moultrie, who resigned earlier this year as undersecretary of defense for intelligence and security. Prior to going into venture capital, Pienaar was a private investigator and started a firm called G3 Good Governance Group whose clients included blue chip companies, wealthy individuals and the British royal family. Pienaar also worked at the time to help Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg cement relationships with London’s rich and famous, according to William Lofgren, a former CIA officer and G3 co-founder. “The relationship was steady and frequent because both Andre and Vekselberg saw merit in it,” said Lofgren. Pienaar also helped Vekselberg win a share of a South African manganese mine in 2005 and then later served as one of the oligarch’s representatives on the mine’s board of directors until early 2018, internal G3 records and South African business records show. Vekselberg has been sanctioned twice by the U.S. government, first in April 2018 and again in March 2022. The U.S. Treasury Department has accused him of taking part in “soft power activities on behalf of the Kremlin.” In 2014, the FBI publicly warned in an op-ed that a Vekselberg-led foundation may be “a means for the Russian government to access our nation’s sensitive or classified research.” Pienaar’s long association with Vekselberg should have disqualified him from investing in IronNet, which was seeking highly sensitive U.S. defense contracts, former intelligence officials said.

Title: TikTok Search, But It’s Going For Amazon; Can CTV Supply Outpace Demand?

Here’s today’s AdExchanger.com news round-up… Want it by email? Sign up here. Search High And Low TikTok announced this week that it would allow search advertising to be targeted by keyword. Previously, advertisers targeted specific audiences or types of audiences, but not actual search terms. TikTok’s growing search ad business is often framed as part of the overall threat to Google’s dominance. But TikTok search is part of a much sharper rivalry between the social media network and Amazon, according to Eric Seufert at Mobile Dev Memo. It is hard to square the heated rivalry between Amazon and TikTok with the companies’ recent advertising partnership. They’re often direct competitors, not complementary, and each is fighting hard to be the place for product discovery. Amazon and TikTok may be reluctant to give the other a leg up, but both want what the other has. Amazon needs targeted shopping supply and social media engagement; TikTok needs users to habituate themselves to purchasing on the platform. Amazon derives a huge advantage from the TikTok integration, since Amazon owns the customer and purchase data. TikTok gets another demand source, but as Amazon gets better and better at converting TikTok ad impressions to sales, TikTok earns no cut of the sales growth. As Seen On CTV Once upon a time, streaming was the shiny object of the ad industry. Now, ad supply outpaces demand, Ad Age reports. Part of that mismatch is due to media companies creating ad inventory seemingly out of thin air. Amazon will increase the rate of ads on Prime Video, while new placements like pause ads and home screen ads are spawning across streaming and smart TV services. Perhaps more importantly, media buyers remain disgruntled with the lack of pricing and measurement consistency. While the cost of cable TV is fairly consistent across the board (dayparts aside), streaming services launch ads with sky-high CPMs, then seemingly roll back prices at random. Plus, measurement is out of whack. Publishers still can’t agree on whether to sell and measure media based on GRPs or impressions, or what counts as premium inventory. Paired with the chronic lack of transparency in streaming buys, advertisers don’t necessarily see streaming as worth the cost and effort compared to cross-platform buys, one agency exec says. Considering CTV’s growing pains, it’s no wonder why buyers plan to spend more on social video than streaming this year. Going DEI-Free Pushy right-wingers aren’t the reason DEI programs are disappearing – or at least, not the only reason, Adweek reports. Shortly after the George Floyd protests in 2020, diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives became a popular way for brands, agencies and vendors to address concerns from consumers and employees about racial inequality (and to look good in the process, a more cynical onlooker might say). Although DEI-related job postings increased a whopping 123% that year (per Indeed), not even two years later those jobs were already getting slashed in layoffs, NBC News reported. And now several major companies – including Tractor Supply, John Deere, and Harley-Davidson – have publicly downscaled or even dropped their DEI initiatives. Conservative activists online would seem to be the most obvious instigating force here. But Adweek posits that last year’s Supreme Court decision against affirmative action had a more chilling effect, even though it only technically pertained to college admissions. Regardless, one thing seems pretty clear to both pro- and anti-DEI onlookers: None of these companies was that committed to the idea in the first place, if they were willing to flip so quickly. But Wait, There’s More! Apple Search Ads expands to Turkey and 20 additional countries. [9to5Mac] Amazon’s new shopping chatbot refuses to suggest “dupes,” aka off-brand facsimiles of luxury products. [Business Insider] The EU Commission has issued formal information requests to YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat about their content recommendation algos.

Title: AI bubble or ‘revolution’? OpenAI’s big payday fuels debate

Friday, 04 Oct 2024 OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, has closed a massive funding round, an investor said on Oct 2, 2024, as the company led by CEO Sam Altman seals its place as the world leader on artificial intelligence. — AFP SAN FRANCISCO: Fear of missing out has rocketed the value of artificial intelligence companies, despite few signs as to when the technology will turn a profit, raising talk of AI overenthusiasm. The mystery deepens when it comes to predicting which generative AI firms will prevail, according to analysts interviewed by AFP. ChatGPT-maker OpenAI secured US$6.6bil (RM27.95bil) in a funding round that propelled its valuation to an eye-popping US$157bil (RM664.94bil), sparking new worries there is an AI bubble poised to burst. "We are in the bubble where all the vendors are running around saying you have to deploy it as the latest digital transformation move," independent tech analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group said of generative AI. "I expect this ugly phase for the next two to three years, but then things should settle." To the critics, buyers don't really understand the technology, and the market needed for it to thrive is not mature yet. Enderle also contended that investors are pouring money into generative AI companies with the mistaken notion we are close to technology that has computers thinking the way humans do, called general artificial intelligence. That "holy grail" won't show up until 2030 at the earliest, he said. 'Revolution' is here Industry titans Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft have thrown their weight behind the technology, entering into partnerships and pushing out products to accelerate adoption. But the tech giants are spending big to provide sometimes flawed features that for now cost them more than they take in from users. The huge investments in OpenAI shows that Big Tech is willing to sink "substantial cash into a company that's dealing with significant operation losses", Emarketer analyst Grace Harmon said of the OpenAI funding round. There's a "lingering fear of underinvesting in AI and losing out...even if investments are not guaranteed to provide returns", she said. Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst, is one of Wall Street's biggest believers in generative AI's importance and compared ChatGPT's emergence to an "iPhone moment" that will see one trillion dollars in spending during the next three years. An "AI Revolution is not just at our doorstep, but is actively shaping the future of the tech world," he said after OpenAI's historic fund-raise. Wall Street for now stands firmly with Ives and has sent the stock price of AI-chasing tech giants to record levels since ChatGPT burst on the scene in late 2022. Nvidia, the AI-chip juggernaut, in June briefly became the world's biggest company by market valuation amid the frenzy. But according to media reports, OpenAI will lose US$5bil (RM21.17bil) this year on sales of US$3.7bil (RM15.67bil). The company told investors the pain will be short-lived and that revenue will rise exponentially, hitting a whopping US$100bil (RM423.50bil) in 2029. More than poems? The question is whether people will pay for generative AI services such as Microsoft's CoPilot that depends on OpenAI technology, said Creative Strategies analyst Carolina Milanesi, who pushed back against the idea of an AI bubble. "Consumers are going to start going beyond the write-the-poem-for-me stuff," Milanesi said. "It will become part of our lives and we will depend on it, because we will be forced to." But for now, the generative AI business model is tough, since data center and computing power costs dwarf revenue, according to analysts. Still, Milanesi doesn't think the tech industry is getting carried away with generative AI. "How this shakes out is the way to think about it, not so much the bubble bursting and everyone losing out," Milanesi said. "It's a bit of a Darwin situation where the survival of the fittest is happening," she said. And while there is more excitement about generative AI than real proof of its success, the technology is moving exceptionally fast. "Investors are not sure what the destination is, but everybody is jumping on the boat and they don't want to be left behind," Enderle said. "That typically ends badly," he said. – AFP Topic: Report it to us. Thank you for your report! Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad [197101000523 (10894-D)] Best viewed on Chrome browsers.
