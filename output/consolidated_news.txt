Investment activity in digital assets surged almost throughout October, as crypto investment products, especially that of Bitcoin, experienced substantial inflows, according to the latest data released by CoinShares. Last week alone, global crypto funds attracted $901 million in net inflows, pushing the total for the month to $3.4 billion. According to CoinShares, out of the total fund flows recorded, Bitcoin-centric investment products captured the lion’s share of inflows, with $920 million in net additions over the past week. US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded $997.6 million in net inflows, led largely by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Bitcoin’s dominance was notable, with blockchain equities and Solana-based products also seeing inflows of $12.2 million and $10.8 million, respectively. However, other Bitcoin-based products, including those outside US markets, faced some net outflows. While Bitcoin maintained strong inflows, Ethereum-based funds recorded net outflows of $34.7 million last week, signaling a decrease in investor interest. CoinShares reported that Ethereum’s price ratio to Bitcoin had fallen to its lowest point since April 2021, which could be contributing to this outflow trend. The data suggests that while Ethereum has seen gains in the past, investors are now focusing more on Bitcoin, possibly anticipating future regulatory clarity and further mainstream adoption with developments like spot ETFs. Geographically, US-based crypto funds attracted a substantial $906 million in net inflows last week. In contrast, other regions saw mixed results, with funds based in Sweden, Canada, Brazil, and Hong Kong collectively experiencing $29.1 million in net outflows. This difference highlights the United States’ growing role in shaping the global crypto investment market, especially as American firms like BlackRock and Fidelity expand their crypto offerings. According to CoinShares’ Head of Research, James Butterfill reveals that the we political climate likely influences the recent Bitcoin price movements and increase in inflows. He noted that Republican gains in the polls correlate with increased interest in Bitcoin investments. This suggests that market participants may see a shift in political power as favourable to digital assets, potentially driving anticipation of regulatory reforms or even greater crypto acceptance. CoinShares report shows that the October influx represents roughly 12% of assets under management (AUM) in digital asset funds and marks the fourth-largest month for inflows on record. This brings the year-to-date total to $27 billion, almost tripling the previous high of $10.5 billion set in 2021.

Meet Samuel Edyme, Nickname - HIM-buktu. A web3 content writer, journalist, and aspiring trader, Edyme is as versatile as they come. With a knack for words and a nose for trends, he has penned pieces for numerous industry player, including AMBCrypto, Blockchain.News, and Blockchain Reporter, among others. Edyme’s foray into the crypto universe is nothing short of cinematic. His journey began not with a triumphant investment, but with a scam. Yes, a Ponzi scheme that used crypto as payment roped him in. Rather than retreating, he emerged wiser and more determined, channeling his experience into over three years of insightful market analysis. Before becoming the voice of reason in the crypto space, Edyme was the quintessential crypto degen. He aped into anything that promised a quick buck, anything ape-able, learning the ropes the hard way. These hands-on experience through major market events—like the Terra Luna crash, the wave of bankruptcies in crypto firms, the notorious FTX collapse, and even CZ’s arrest—has honed his keen sense of market dynamics. When he isn’t crafting engaging crypto content, you’ll find Edyme backtesting charts, studying both forex and synthetic indices. His dedication to mastering the art of trading is as relentless as his pursuit of the next big story. Away from his screens, he can be found in the gym, airpods in, working out and listening to his favorite artist, NF. Or maybe he’s catching some Z’s or scrolling through Elon Musk’s very own X platform—(oops, another screen activity, my bad…) Well, being an introvert, Edyme thrives in the digital realm, preferring online interaction over offline encounters—(don’t judge, that’s just how he is built). His determination is quite unwavering to be honest, and he embodies the philosophy of continuous improvement, or “kaizen,” striving to be 1% better every day. His mantras, “God knows best” and “Everything is still on track,” reflect his resilient outlook and how he lives his life. In a nutshell, Samuel Edyme was born efficient, driven by ambition, and perhaps a touch fierce. He’s neither artistic nor unrealistic, and certainly not chauvinistic. Think of him as Bruce Willis in a train wreck—unflappable. Edyme is like trading in your car for a jet—bold. He’s the guy who’d ask his boss for a pay cut just to prove a point—(uhhh…). He is like watching your kid take his first steps. Imagine Bill Gates struggling with rent—okay, maybe that’s a stretch, but you get the idea, yeah. Unbelievable? Yes. Inconceivable? Perhaps. Edyme sees himself as a fairly reasonable guy, albeit a bit stubborn. Normal to you is not to him. He is not the one to take the easy road, and why would he? That’s just not the way he roll. He has these favorite lyrics from NF’s “Clouds” that resonate deeply with him: “What you think's probably unfeasible, I've done already a hundredfold.” PS—Edyme is HIM. HIM-buktu. Him-mulation. Him-Kardashian. Himon and Pumba. He even had his DNA tested, and guess what? He’s 100% Him-alayan. Screw it, he ate the opp. Disclaimer: The information found on NewsBTC is for educational purposes only.

Title: Stock market today: Asian shares mostly rise after Wall Street climbs on Big Tech gains

Rising technology stocks sent the Nasdaq composite to a record, but trading was mixed along the rest of Wall Street NEW YORK -- Rallying technology stocks sent the Nasdaq composite to a record on Tuesday, but trading was mixed along the rest of Wall Street as homebuilders and Ford Motor sank following the latest profit reports. The S&P 500 rose 0.2% to inch closer to its all-time high set earlier this month, even though most of the stocks in the index fell for the day. Gains for influential Big Tech stocks helped mask weakness elsewhere, and they pushed the Nasdaq composite up 0.8% to top its last all-time high set in July. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, fell 154 points, or 0.4%. Alphabet rose 1.8% ahead of its profit report that arrived after trading ended for the day. The parent company of Google is the latest member of the group of stocks known as the “Magnificent Seven” to report its quarterly results, and each will have to deliver big growth to justify their high prices. Other market heavyweight like Microsoft and Meta Platforms were among the strongest forces pushing the S&P 500 upward. They helped offset an 8.4% drop for Ford Motor, which said an underlying measure of profit for the full year will likely come in at the bottom end of its forecasted range. The automaker said stubbornly high warranty expenses and other costs are holding back its profits, though its results for the third quarter were better than analysts expected. JetBlue Airways lost 17.1% even though its results for the latest quarter were better than analysts expected. The carrier said its revenue could fall between 3% and 7% in the last three months of 2024 from a year earlier, hurt by this month’s Hurricane Milton and the upcoming U.S. presidential election. D.R. Horton tumbled 7.2% after the homebuilder reported weaker profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Executive Chairman David Auld said some potential home buyers are waiting for mortgage rates to become more affordable and are sitting on the sidelines. All told, the S&P 500 rose 9.40 points to 5,832.92. The Dow fell 154.52 to 42,233.05, and the Nasdaq composite rose 145.56 to 18,712.75. Mortgage rates have been climbing recently because the 10-year Treasury yield has been charging higher. Yields have rallied as report after report has shown the U.S. economy remains stronger than expected. On Tuesday, reports said confidence among U.S. consumers jumped more economists expected, while the number of job openings edged lower in September, but the number of hires remained relatively steady. Such numbers have forced traders to ratchet back expectations for how much the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, now that it’s just as focused on keeping the economy humming as getting inflation down. Traders are even betting on a slim chance the Fed will keep its main interest rate steady at its meeting next week, according to data from CME Group. That’s after the Fed kicked off its rate-cutting campaign in September with a larger-than-usual reduction. Just a month ago, many traders were thinking just the Fed would follow up in November with another bigger-than-usual cut. Yields have also climbed as investors have seen former President Donald Trump’s chances of re-election improving. Economists say a Trump win could help push inflation higher in the long term, and worsening inflation could lead to higher interest rates. Trump Media & Technology Group, the company that tends to move more with Trump’s re-election odds than on its own profit prospects, climbed another 8.8% to $51.51 Tuesday. It moved so sharply during the day that trading of its stock was briefly halted several times. The parent company of Trump’s Truth Social platform has been rallying since hitting a bottom of roughly $12 in late September. Treasury yields eased a bit after paring gains from earlier in the day. The 10-year yield slipped to 4.25% from 4.28% late Monday, but it’s still well above the 3.60% level it was sitting at in the middle of last month. Treasury yields, like stocks, have historically tended to be shaky heading into an Election Day, only to calm afterward regardless of which party wins. In stock markets abroad, indexes dipped in Europe after rising in much of Asia outside of a 1.1% drop for stocks in Shanghai. Crude oil prices slipped after erasing earlier gains to compound their sharp 6.1% drop from the prior day. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 0.4%. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Bitcoin spikes to $71,500, 4% away from all-time high

Share this article Bitcoin has rallied over 5% to $71,500 and is now within striking distance of its all-time high of $73,700. The surge comes as the US presidential election is just days away. According to data from CoinGecko, the largest crypto asset by market cap broke the $70,000 price level on Monday after a minor correction last week, mostly driven by the escalating conflict in the Middle East and alleged regulatory scrutiny over Tether. Despite a sudden drop below $66,000, Bitcoin bounced back and consolidated within the $67,000-$68,000 range over the weekend. It ultimately broke out and soared to $70,000 for the first time in over four months. According to seasoned trader Peter Brandt, the post-halving advance may have started and Bitcoin may be entering a bullish phase. “The 5-month inverted expanding triangle has now been completed. Follow through will be important. The post-halving advance may have begun. The series of lower highs and lower lows since March has come to an end,” Brandt said in a recent post on X. As Crypto Briefing previously reported, certain key metrics pointed to a potential upward trend in the price of Bitcoin. The Bollinger Bands, an indicator used to assess price volatility, are at one of their tightest points in history. This “Bollinger Squeeze” often precedes periods of low volatility, which can lead to powerful price breakouts. In addition, the Miner Position Index (MPI), which measures the flow of Bitcoin from miners to exchanges, shows that Bitcoin miners are currently in an accumulation phase, while block rewards are on the rise. The combination of a low MPI and rising block rewards suggests a bullish outlook for Bitcoin. Demand for Bitcoin ETFs remains strong. According to data tracked by Farside Investors, US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded approximately $3 billion in net inflows in the last two weeks. These ETFs started this week on a high note, collectively drawing around $479 million in net capital with no outflows reported. BlackRock continued its Bitcoin buying spree, logging over $315 million in net buying on Monday. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan sees reaccelerating Bitcoin ETF inflows among key factors that could propel Bitcoin to six-figure prices, together with the upcoming presidential election, increasing whale accumulation, reduced Bitcoin supply post-halving, and global monetary adjustments. Analysts at Standard Chartered project that Bitcoin could reach approximately $73,000 by Election Day on November 5. Plus, the analysts suggest that if former President Donald Trump wins the election, Bitcoin may surge to around $80,000, with a potential increase of up to $125,000 by the end of the year if Republicans secure control of Congress. Analysts at Bitfinex also anticipate that the US presidential election could serve as a catalyst for Bitcoin’s rally, potentially pushing its price beyond $73,666 due to heightened market activity and volatility surrounding the election. Meanwhile, several other experts believe that Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory remains intact regardless of the electoral outcome. Steven Lubka, head of private clients at Swan Bitcoin, anticipates that Bitcoin will hit six-figure prices due to its strong correlation with fiscal and monetary conditions rather than political leadership.

Title: FET: a pathway to endless opportunities for students
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/education/2024/10/29/fet-a-pathway-that-provides-opportunities/
Time Published: 2024-10-29T03:15:00Z

It gets less fanfare than the CAO, but further education and training (FET) offers a range of career-focused options for school-leavers – and it would be a mistake not to explore them. Over the past few years, I’ve spoken with countless students who thrived in apprenticeships, post-Leaving Cert (PLC) courses and traineeships. Some were high achievers who fell short of the points needed for their degree programme, and did a year-long PLC in a local college of further education, which opened the door to their CAO course of choice. Others wanted a vocational, work-ready qualification and found it in an apprenticeship, allowing them to earn as they learned. One student got great results in his Leaving Cert, but decided that a year in a PLC would serve as a bridge between school and college. “One in 10 adults in Ireland – around 423,000 people – were engaged in FET courses and apprenticeships last year,” says Maria Walshe, director of branding, communications and FET strategy implementation at Solas. “Fast becoming a prime destination for school-leavers, increasing numbers of students are now choosing the FET route. Last year, for example, course enrolments were up 11 per cent year on year for QQI level five and six courses, also known as PLCs.” Walshe says that not only is FET a smart choice for school-leavers in its own right, but also a pathway that provides opportunities that can take learners directly into careers, as well as offering progression routes to higher education. “For those unsure of their next step after school, FET can provide students with the option to set their own pace and to explore a subject or interest before applying to a four-year degree.” Paige Tomlin, a 19-year-old school-leaver, is doing a PLC course in computer science at Blackrock College of Further Education. “I was one of the fortunate students to be offered computer science as a Leaving Cert subject, and I really enjoyed it,” she says. “I loved the coding aspect and knew that this was an area I would like to work in. But I didn’t do well enough in my Leaving Cert to get the points. In my research, I learned that the PLC could be a gateway for computer science in TU Dublin or DCU, so I went for it. “The course involves five days a week of classes, but it’s not too intense as there are gaps between some of the lectures. It also includes work experience hours, and there’s even an opportunity to go on an eight-day course in Portugal. “There’s coding, maths, web development, databases, spreadsheets and communications – where we have had a chance to work on our CVs – on the course so, although I do want to go to college, there are also opportunities for us to go straight into the workforce.” Unlike third level, the fees are minimal, and this year Tomlin only had to pay a €50 registration fee. (It should be noted that some PLCs, particularly in art and design, may require students to buy equipment or supplies, and so can end up costing more). Tomlin says that she has really enjoyed the course. “We’ve done collaborative work in group projects, and we’ve worked solo. I’ve made friends on the course and am really glad I took it on.” The possibilities are endless with FET, says Walshe. “They take students into a diverse range of exciting careers, through courses in areas as diverse as commis chef, animal care, games production, cyber security, personal training and applied science. “The beauty of FET is that it is for everyone. Available in every county and delivered by the FET colleges under the provision of the 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs) across the country, FET can take students into a world of careers, all without the need to travel far from home. FET courses are available in every county and delivered by the FET colleges under the provision of the 16 education and training boards (ETBs) across the country. “FET can take students into a world of careers, all without the need to travel far from home,” says Walshe. “There are many opportunities for students to discover FET courses on offer in their local community, as well as pathways from FET to university. Open days are run by FET colleges on an ongoing basis and are definitely worth checking out.” Your regular guide to the latest education news, analysis and opinion, as well as classroom resources, posters and lots more © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Watch These Ford Price Levels as Stock Drops After Automaker Issues Soft Outlook

Shares in Ford (F) fell sharply in extended trading on Monday after the automaker posted third-quarter profit below Wall Street expectations and trimmed its full-year outlook amid ongoing high warranty costs, supply chain issues, and intensifying competition. CEO Jim Farley told analysts on the earnings call that the auto industry is in a global price war, driven by overcapacity and a flood of new electric vehicle (EV) companies. The Detroit-based automaker said its EV business lost $1.2 billion in the third quarter on sales of about 32,000 vehicles and booked a $1 billion charge to write down several EV-related manufacturing assets. Prior to Monday’s post-market fall, Ford shares had tumbled around 7% year-to-date Below, we break down the technicals on Ford’s weekly chart and discuss important post-earnings price levels to watch out for. Since bottoming out in early August, Ford shares have consolidated within an ascending triangle, a chart pattern that can signal a move lower if formed within an established downtrend, which is the case on the automaker’s chart. Indeed, the stock sits poised to test the pattern’s lower trendline after the company’s soft quarterly results, potentially opening the door for further post-earnings selling. The stock dropped 6% to $10.69 in after-hours trading Monday. Let’s analyze Ford’s chart to identify three key support levels that investors will likely be watching and point out a major overhead area worth monitoring. Upon a decisive breakdown below the ascending triangle, investors should monitor the $9.50 level. This location could attract buying interest near a trendline connecting a range of price action on the chart between August 2019 and this year’s early August low. A move lower could see the shares fall to around $8.70, an area where investors may seek entry points near a period of narrow consolidation in the second half of 2019, which also corresponds with the April 2021 pullback low. Ongoing selling could drive a bearish move down to the $7.50 region, where the stock would likely encounter support near the top trendline of a prior ascending triangle that formed on Ford’s chart in the months after the March 2020 pandemic low. If the stock makes a recovery, investors should keep a close eye on the $11.30 area, a level where shares may run into considerable overhead selling pressure near a trendline connecting multiple troughs dating back to January 2021. A volume-backed breakout above this major resistance could act as a catalyst for a bullish trend reversal.

The bank has consistently beaten street estimates on one or the other metric, even as the macro environment changed considerably over the years. The short-term outlook is bullish for Rainbow Children’s Medicare. The stock has begun the week by surging over 5 per cent on Monday breaking above the ₹1,450-₹1,470 resistance zone. Indeed, the stock has been moving up well since the middle of last week itself when the broader markets were falling. The region around ₹1,470 will now act as a very good resistance-turned-support. Intermediate dips are likely to get fresh buyers at lower levels. Comments BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences. They cannot be abusive or personal.

The company reported about 3.8 per cent volume growth in Q2-FY25 and expects healthy growth (15 per cent+) in H2FY25, driven by both W&C businesses with focused approach to capture demand from infrastructure and emerging sectors. ICICI Bank has reported six glorious years of performance since Sandeep Bakhshi took charge as MD & CEO on October 15, 2018. The bank has consistently beaten street estimates on one or the other metric, even as the macro environment changed considerably over the years. The short-term outlook is bullish for Rainbow Children’s Medicare. The stock has begun the week by surging over 5 per cent on Monday breaking above the ₹1,450-₹1,470 resistance zone. Indeed, the stock has been moving up well since the middle of last week itself when the broader markets were falling. The region around ₹1,470 will now act as a very good resistance-turned-support. Intermediate dips are likely to get fresh buyers at lower levels. Comments BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences. They cannot be abusive or personal.

Title: Starbucks threatens to fire staff who do not go back to office

CHICAGO - Starbucks is telling its corporate staff they could be fired if they do not go to work at the office three days a week. Starting in January, Starbucks will implement a “standardised process” to hold workers accountable if they do not abide by the coffee chain’s return-to-office (RTO) policy, according to a memo sent to one of the company’s divisions that was seen by Bloomberg News. Consequences are “up to, and including, separation”, the e-mail said. The message marks an escalation in enforcement of the company’s hybrid work rules less than two months after Mr Brian Niccol took over as chief executive. He told employees in September that they should work wherever they need to in order to get their jobs done, but that he thought that place was usually the office. Starbucks said its expectations for hybrid workers had not changed and that holiday, sick time and business travel are excluded from the calculation. Workers can request an exemption from the mandate due to physical, mental, sensory impairment or another disability, the company said. The policy applies to about 3,500 corporate employees. Most of them are employed at its stores. “We are continuing to support our leaders as they hold their teams accountable to our existing hybrid work policy,” the company said in a statement on Oct 28. Starbucks is the latest company to shift from carrots to sticks in the ongoing return-to-office battle that has been playing out at workplaces. In September, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy surprised employees with a memo ordering them to start reporting to their desks five days a week, beginning in January. Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman said staff who do not support the five-day-per-week in-office policy can leave for another company. Earlier in 2024, Dell Technologies told workers who chose to remain remote that they would not be eligible for promotion, and Wall Street banks have also warned that working from home could jeopardise career prospects. Still, offices in the biggest US cities remain half empty compared with pre-pandemic levels, according to security firm Kastle Systems. At the same time, some firms have realised that an RTO mandate can serve as layoffs in disguise. In a survey from BambooHR, one in four executives admitted they hoped for some voluntary turnover in the wake of an RTO push. Research has shown, though, that the workers who quit due to the policies are often the more experienced staff that companies can least afford to lose. Early in 2023, when Starbucks tried to enforce its hybrid-work mandate, dozens of corporate workers signed an open letter pushing back. Mr Niccol’s own work arrangement, which lets him live in California and travel 1,600km to Seattle on the company’s corporate jet, sparked backlash from some workers and outside critics. Starbucks has said that Mr Niccol will spend most of his time in Seattle or visiting stores. Some staff had said they did not care where the CEO was based, as long as he did not crack down on in-office requirements.

Title: Jeff Bezos addresses Washington Post endorsement fiasco, cites distrust in media led to 'principled decision'
URL: https://www.foxnews.com/media/jeff-bezos-addresses-washington-post-endorsement-fiasco-cites-distrust-media-led-principled-decision
Time Published: 2024-10-29T00:17:36Z
Full Content:
‘MediaBuzz’ host Howard Kurtz reports on how The Washington Post is refraining from making a presidential endorsement for the first time in decades on ‘Special Report.’ Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos penned an op-ed defending the paper's "principled decision" in not endorsing a presidential candidate in the 2024 race. Bezos began the piece Monday by citing a Gallup poll showing Americans losing trust in the media, even falling below Congress, telling readers "Our profession is now the least trusted of all. Something we are doing is clearly not working." "We must be accurate, and we must be believed to be accurate. It’s a bitter pill to swallow, but we are failing on the second requirement," Bezos wrote. "Most people believe the media is biased. Anyone who doesn’t see this is paying scant attention to reality, and those who fight reality lose. Reality is an undefeated champion. It would be easy to blame others for our long and continuing fall in credibility (and, therefore, decline in impact), but a victim mentality will not help. Complaining is not a strategy. We must work harder to control what we can control to increase our credibility." WASHINGTON POST REPORTS LIBERALS ARE CANCELING SUBSCRIPTIONS OVER PAPER'S DECISION NOT TO ENDORSE VP HARRIS Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos defended the decision to stop presidential endorsements in an op-ed published on the paper's website. ((Photo by Karwai Tang/WireImage) ERIC BARADAT/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON POST OWNER JEFF BEZOS WANTS MORE CONSERVATIVE OPINION WRITERS AT PAPER: REPORT The billionaire Amazon founder, who bought The Post in 2013, insisted that newspaper endorsements "do nothing to tip the scales of an election" but instead "create a perception of bias." He doubled down on The Post's decision to end its presidential endorsements by saying it's "principled decision, and it’s the right one." "By itself, declining to endorse presidential candidates is not enough to move us very far up the trust scale, but it’s a meaningful step in the right direction. I wish we had made the change earlier than we did, in a moment further from the election and the emotions around it. That was inadequate planning, and not some intentional strategy," Bezos conceded. Bezos denied there was any "quid pro quo" that motivated the decision and insisted the meeting the boss of his company Blue Origin had with former President Trump, which occurred the day of the announcement, was a regretful coincidence, flatly saying "There is no connection between it and our decision on presidential endorsements, and any suggestion otherwise is false." WASHINGTON POST UNION, STAFFERS REVOLT OVER DECISION NOT TO ENDORSE A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, BLAME BEZOS The Washington Post was set to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris before the move was quashed by the paper's leadership. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) He went on to suggest that his paper and other members of the legacy media are out of touch with most Americans. "The Washington Post and the New York Times win prizes, but increasingly we talk only to a certain elite. More and more, we talk to ourselves," Bezos wrote. "While I do not and will not push my personal interest, I will also not allow this paper to stay on autopilot and fade into irrelevance — overtaken by unresearched podcasts and social media barbs — not without a fight. It’s too important. The stakes are too high. Now more than ever the world needs a credible, trusted, independent voice, and where better for that voice to originate than the capital city of the most important country in the world?" "To win this fight, we will have to exercise new muscles. Some changes will be a return to the past, and some will be new inventions. Criticism will be part and parcel of anything new, of course. This is the way of the world. None of this will be easy, but it will be worth it. I am so grateful to be part of this endeavor. Many of the finest journalists you’ll find anywhere work at The Washington Post, and they work painstakingly every day to get to the truth. They deserve to be believed," Bezos added. BEFORE NON-ENDORSEMENT DECISION, WASHINGTON POST CALLED TRUMP 'DREADFUL' AND 'WORST PRESIDENT OF MODERN TIMES' Bezos cited growing distrust in the media as the reason behind the "principled decision" for The Washington Post to end presidential endorsements. ( SAUL LOEB / AFP) (Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Bezos' op-ed comes after The Post itself reported that the billionaire was behind the decision as the paper's CEO and publisher Will Lewis had "sought to tamp down speculation" had made the decision to help former President Trump. Meanwhile, the fallout over the decision is apparently leading The Post to pay a heavy price as NPR reported that the "Democracy Dies in Darkness" paper has lost more than a whopping 200,000 subscribers since Friday as liberal readers remain outraged that The Post is not endorsing Harris. Multiple members of the paper's editorial staff have also resigned. The Washington Post has been struggling the past several years. Subscriptions and revenue were in decline prior to the paper's announcement about not endorsing the presidential race, which has led to buyouts and layoffs of employees.

Starbucks Corp. is telling its corporate staff they could be fired if they don’t come to work at the office three days a week. Starting in January, Starbucks will implement a “standardized process” to hold workers accountable if they don’t abide by the coffee chain’s return-to-office policy, according to a memo sent to one of the company’s divisions that was seen by Bloomberg News. Consequences are “up to, and including, separation,” the email said. The message marks an escalation in enforcement of the company’s hybrid work rules less than two months since Brian Niccol took over as chief executive officer. He told employees last month that they should work wherever they need to in order to get their jobs done, but that he thought that place was usually the office. Starbucks said its expectations for hybrid workers hadn’t changed and that vacation, sick time and business travel are excluded from the calculation. Workers can request an exemption from the mandate due to physical, mental, sensory impairment or another disability, the company said. The policy applies to about 3,500 corporate employees. Most of the company’s workers are employed at its stores. “We are continuing to support our leaders as they hold their teams accountable to our existing hybrid work policy,” the company said in a statement on Monday. Starbucks is the latest company to shift from carrots to sticks in the ongoing return-to-office battle that has been playing out at workplaces. Last month, Amazon.com Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy surprised employees with a memo ordering them to start reporting to their desks five days a week, beginning in January. Amazon currently lets many of them work from home two days a week. Earlier this year, Dell Technologies told workers who chose to remain remote that they wouldn’t be eligible for promotion, and Wall Street banks have also warned that working from home could jeopardize employees’ career prospects. Still, offices in the biggest US cities remain half empty compared to pre-pandemic levels, according to security firm Kastle Systems. At the same time, some firms have realized that a return-to-office mandate can serve as layoffs in disguise. In a survey from BambooHR, one in four executives admitted they hoped for some voluntary turnover in the wake of an RTO push. Research has shown, though, that the workers who quit due to the policies are often the more experienced staffers that companies can least afford to lose. Early last year, when Starbucks tried to enforce its hybrid-work mandate, dozens of corporate workers signed an open letter pushing back. Niccol’s own work arrangement, which allows him to live in California and travel 1,000 miles to Seattle on the company’s corporate jet, sparked backlash by some workers and outside critics. Starbucks has said that Niccol will spend most of his time in Seattle or visiting stores. Several staffers had said they didn’t care where the CEO was based, as long as he didn’t crack down on in-office requirements. Starbucks is also moving away from requiring Tuesday as a common attendance day for all workers at headquarters, instead setting the expectations at a team level, according to the memo. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Are ‘ETF Paper Bitcoins’ Suppressing BTC Prices? Analyst Provides Answers

Time Published: 2024-10-28T22:30:17Z
Full Content:
In a new YouTube video titled “There Is No ETF Paper Bitcoin,” Fred Krueger, an investor at the crypto hedge fund 2718.fund, delved into the growing concerns surrounding US spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and their impact on the cryptocurrency’s price. Krueger aimed to dispel the fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) that have been circulating about “paper Bitcoin”—the notion that ETFs might be selling Bitcoin they do not actually possess—and to explain why Bitcoin’s price has not surged as dramatically as some might expect, despite significant ETF purchases. Krueger began his analysis by acknowledging the prevalent skepticism in the market. “There’s all this paper Bitcoin, and ETFs don’t really have the Bitcoin, and if they were buying all this Bitcoin, how come Bitcoin price is not higher?” he stated, encapsulating the core concerns of many investors. Historically, the concept of “paper Bitcoin” has been associated with exchanges that sold Bitcoin to customers without actually possessing the underlying assets. Krueger highlighted several high-profile instances where this practice led to significant losses for investors. He cited the case of Mt. Gox. Another example he provided was QuadrigaCX, a Canadian exchange that collapsed under mysterious circumstances. Founder Gerald Cotten allegedly died in India, taking with him the private keys to the exchange’s cold wallets, effectively locking away customer funds. “A lot of Canadians lost all their Bitcoin on this Quad exchange,” Krueger noted. These historical events have contributed to the current apprehension about ETFs and the possibility that they might be engaging in similar practices—selling Bitcoin they do not actually hold, thereby suppressing BTC’s price through artificial supply. However, Krueger argued that ETFs, particularly those managed by established financial institutions, operate under a fundamentally different framework compared to unregulated exchanges. Focusing on two leading ETFs—IBIT, the BlackRock ETF, and FBTC, the Fidelity ETF—Krueger emphasized the stringent regulatory oversight governing these entities. “Both of these ETFs are subject to very strict regulatory oversight, including the SEC but also other agencies in the US,” he stated. This comprehensive oversight includes requirements for complete transparency, regular audits, and the use of third-party custodians for asset verification. “They literally have to get a receipt of an asset from a third-party custodian,” Krueger added. In the case of IBIT, Coinbase serves as the third-party custodian. “Coinbase is itself a public company that is audited,” Krueger pointed out, noting that the public nature of Coinbase adds an additional layer of scrutiny and accountability. IBIT conducts audits of Coinbase, and both entities are subject to audits by the SEC and other regulatory bodies. For FBTC, custody is handled by Fidelity Digital Assets, a separate entity within Fidelity that specializes in the custody of digital assets, thereby ensuring specialized oversight and management. “The issuers of IBIT and FBTC are BlackRock and Fidelity, two of the largest and oldest financial institutions, and they have a vested interest in maintaining their reputation,” Krueger asserted. “Their reputation is at stake, and this is a big deal,” he emphasized, suggesting that these institutions would not risk their credibility by engaging in the sale of non-existent Bitcoin. Krueger contrasted BlackRock with entities like QuadrigaCX to underscore the disparity in regulatory compliance and operational scale. “BlackRock is highly regulated […] BlackRock has a robust corporate governance structure with committees for audit, risk, and compliance and very extensive internal controls,” Krueger added. Addressing the core concern about ETFs holding “paper Bitcoin,” Krueger provided specific data to refute this notion. “The reality is the ETFs have zero pure paper Bitcoin,” he stated unequivocally. He highlighted that IBIT holds approximately 403,000 actual Bitcoins, while FBTC holds about 185,000 actual Bitcoins. “Together, these two ETFs hold almost 3% of the world’s total Bitcoin, or 588,000 Bitcoins—I think it’s 2.9%,” he calculated. Krueger acknowledged that some skeptics have attempted to analyze Bitcoin movement between specific dates to challenge these holdings. However, he emphasized that the facts are clear and verifiable. “We know how much Bitcoin these ETFs have; we know that it’s accounted for, and that’s a reality,” he insisted. Turning to the question of why Bitcoin’s price has not increased more dramatically despite significant ETF inflows, Krueger offered a nuanced explanation. He noted that Bitcoin is, in fact, up by 60% since the introduction of the ETFs, translating to a $600 billion increase in market capitalization. This growth has been fueled by approximately $20 billion in net inflows into the ETFs, resulting in a price multiplier effect of about 30x. “That’s historically about normal, maybe a little on the low side but not terribly so,” he assessed. Krueger attributed the moderation in Bitcoin’s price growth to substantial selling pressures from various sources. “There’s been a bunch of selling,” he explained. He detailed that Germany sold $3 billion worth of Bitcoin as well as Mt. Gox holdings. Additionally, FTX sold its GBTC (Grayscale Bitcoin Trust) stake earlier in the year, and the Digital Currency Group (DCG) sold assets to resolve lawsuits. “We had a lot of selling,” Krueger summarized. Speculating on the potential impact absent these selling pressures, Krueger suggested that Bitcoin’s price could have been significantly higher. “We probably would be at $90k if there wasn’t any selling,” he posited.

Title: Poll: One in Three Say Migration Should Be Top Priority for the President's First 100 Days in 2025
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/10/28/poll-one-three-say-migration-top-priority-presidents-first-100-days-2025/
Time Published: 2024-10-28T21:54:26Z
Full Content:
Thirty-five percent of Americans say the top priority for the first 100 days of the next presidency should be migration, according to an Ipsos survey for Reuters. That one-on-three score is more than three times the 11 percent share of the second-ranked “First 100 Days” priority — income inequality. Taxes — and health care — score only a 10 percent share. The priority rankings are very different from what voters say when they are asked about the most important issues, Ipsos noted: The economy is the seen as the most important problem [for Washington, DC] for 27% of registered voters, followed by political extremism or threats to democracy (22%), and then immigration (16%). The First 100 Days answer suggests that President Kalama Harris might quickly press Congress to pass a law that would raise immigration levels under the guise of improving border security. But those survey results also suggest that a reelected President Donald Trump will face pressure to focus on curbing migration. That focus would be different from his first term when he quickly pivoted away from migration and pushed a large tax cut through Congress. That 2017 shift followed pressure from Trump’s business allies, many who still demand that government invite more economic migrants. “The U.S. economy needs immigration, and the ebb and flow of humans [across the border] is the market responding to demand,” the Wall Street Journal declared Sunday. “The Biden administration’s decision to use legal parole to accept 30,000 migrants a month from Venezuela, Cuba, Haiti, and Nicaragua is a common-sense and humane approach to managing migration,” it declared. If Trump is in the Oval Office, Democrats — and some Republicans — will resist his promise of mass deportations. But many Republicans recognize they need to fulfill campaign promises. “There’s about 4.5 million who would be the first priority for that, people who’ve already committed crimes,” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) said on October 24. “They’re in the system now [for] shoplifting, or whatever it is … or [having] done things that are untoward or unlawful.” “We’ve got 20, 25 million illegal aliens who are here in the country. What do we do with them?” Sen. JD Vance said in his October 1 Vice Presidential debate. “I think the first thing that we do is we start with the criminal migrants. About a million of those people have committed some form of crime, in addition to crossing the border illegally.” Any debate about migration levels will likely include a debate over the damage caused to ordinary Americans’ workplace productivity and their declining family fertility. In Canada and the United Kingdom, birth rates have crashed amid wage cuts and housing spikes caused by advocates for more migration. Bloomberg reported Monday: The fertility rate in England Wales fell to a record low in 2023, as financial pressures and wider societal shifts put young people off starting a family. Women had an average of 1.44 children, the lowest figure since records began in 1938 and down sharply since 2010 when the rate was 1.94, data from the Office for National Statistics showed on Monday. In London the rate was even lower at 1.35. The figures will set off alarm bells over a worsening demographic crisis that is set to ramp up the pressure on the workforce and the public finances. The national level is well below the natural replacement rate of 2.1 In contrast, Larry Fink, the head of the $10 trillion Blackrock investment group, has urged governments to reduce the migration that is used to inflate their consumer economies and to instead raise the productivity of their nation’s citizens. “We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth,” Fink said at a pro-globalist event in April hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations. Canada’s government has recently trimmed its massive immigration inflow, boosting bankers’ hopes that Canadian companies will redirect funds to raise the nation’s stalled productivity. “We need to dispel the narrative that slower population growth will be bad for the economy,” said an October 24 report by Robert Kavcic, the senior economist at BMO, a major bank based in Montreal. “Real GDP per capita has been stagnant on balance since 2016 … One can argue that the surge in [migrants] has diverted resources to housing and allowed firms to lean on low-cost labour, at the expense of productivity,” Kavcic wrote.

US stock indexes rose Monday as gains for Big Tech made up for slides in oil-and-gas stocks after the price of crude tumbled sharply. The S&P 500 rose 15.40 points, or 0.3%, to 5,823.52. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 273.17 points, or 0.6%, to 42,387.57. The Nasdaq composite rose 48.58 points, or 0.3%, to 18,567.19 to approach its all-time high set in July. Apple and other Big Tech stocks rose ahead of their profit reports that are scheduled to come later in the week. Oil prices tumbled more than 6% after an Israeli retaliation against Iran for earlier missile attacks proved to be more restrained than some investors had feared. Five of the behemoths known as the "Magnificent Seven" are on this week's schedule to report their latest profits, the AP reports. These high-flying stocks have been at the forefront of Wall Street for years and have grown so big that their movements can singlehandedly shift the S&P 500. After suffering a summertime swoon on worries that their stock prices had risen too quickly when compared with their profits, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon are under pressure to deliver more big growth. Another member of the Magnificent Seven, Tesla, soared to one of the best days in its history last week after reporting a better profit than analysts expected.

Title: Ford Stock Drops After Automaker Misses Profit Estimates, Trims Guidance

Ford (F) reported third-quarter profit that missed analysts' expectations and trimmed its full-year outlook, sending shares lower in extended trading Monday. The automaker posted third-quarter revenue of $46.2 billion, up more than 5% year-over-year and above the analyst consensus from Visible Alpha. However, net income of $900 million or 22 cents per share declined from the $1.2 billion or 30 cents per share Ford posted a year earlier, missing estimates. Ford said it now expects full-year adjusted earnings of about $10 billion, compared to its previous estimate of $10 billion to $12 billion. The results come after Ford's second-quarter earnings missed Street estimates and analysts at Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock last month citing increased competition from China, weighing on Ford's stock price. Shares of Ford fell over 4% in extended trading following the release. They were down about 7% for the year through Monday's close.

Title: What You Need To Know Ahead of Eli Lilly's Earnings Wednesday

Time Published: 2024-10-28T20:29:09Z
Full Content:
As pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly (LLY) plans to report third-quarter earnings Wednesday morning, analysts are focused on the production and sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound—two popular weight-loss drugs that have boosted the company's results. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha expect a 28% year-over-year revenue jump to $12.2 billion. Eli Lilly is projected to swing to $1.7 billion in net income from a $57.4 million net loss last year, when it reported a charge of nearly $3 billion related to "in progress research and development" (IPR&D) as it closed a number of acquisitions. Ahead of Wednesday's earnings announcement, Eli Lilly said it expects to report an IPR&D charge of about $2.83 billion for the quarter, well above the $154 million and $111 million, respectively, the company reported for the first two quarters of the year. In each of its first two quarters this year, Eli Lilly lifted its full-year outlook on the strength of sales for its weight loss drugs. Deutsche Bank analysts wrote last week that they believe the drugmaker will affirm its outlook rather than raise it again. The analysts cited a shifting production environment for Eli Lilly's weight loss drugs, and said sales may have slowed in parts of the U.S. because of the impact of Hurricane Helene on some pharmacies in the Southeast U.S in the quarter. The company's weight loss drugs were dropped from the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) shortage list during the quarter, as the agency currently notes the shortage of Mounjaro and Zepbound's active ingredient tirzepatide as "resolved." Both Eli Lilly and Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk (NVO) have seen their sales surge over the last several quarters as demand has spiked for their weight loss drugs, with each company spending billions to increase production to meet demand. Eli Lilly said in its second quarter earnings call that its supply of the drugs should improve through the back half of 2024, but said it could still face "periodic supply tightness" as demand remained high. The company also launched a lower-cost and easier-to-produce version of Zepbound in the quarter. Eli Lilly shares edged higher Monday, finishing just under $896. The stock is up more than 50% this year.

Title: Alternative Assets Shine Amid Pre-Election Market Uncertainty

Investmments and asset allocation concept. Where to Invest? Newspaper and direction sign with ... [+] investment options. 3d illustration With only one week remaining before the U.S. presidential election, there’s a growing sense of uncertainty in the air. Investors are wondering how to position their money, bracing for the possibility of significant volatility and market shifts. While some hedge funds are making bold moves on so-called “Trump trades,” we at U.S. Global Investors see things differently. In fact, I share billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones’ recent outlook on gold and Bitcoin (which validates what I have been writing about for many years). Like him, we currently favor alternative assets as the smart play going forward. It’s not that we’re betting against stocks or the economy, which we believe will do well over time no matter who wins the White House next month. Nevertheless, the writing is clearly on the wall: Ballooning U.S. debt and geopolitical tensions all point to the need for a strong hedge. You won’t be surprised to read that the U.S. debt situation has spiraled out of control. Just 25 years ago, the national debt was a little under 60% of GDP. Today, that rate has doubled to 120%. According to Paul Tudor Jones, founder and CEO of Tudor Investment Corp., this puts the U.S. in a precarious position—one that’s unsustainable in the long run unless serious action is taken to rein in government spending. We all know that politicians have a knack for promising more spending (in the Democrats’ case) or tax cuts (in the Republicans’ case) to keep voters happy. It’s easy to see why Jones is concerned that either approach will only exacerbate the debt problem. As he pointed out, the U.S. is “going to be broke really quick unless we get serious about dealing with our spending issues.” That’s not just a dramatic soundbite—it’s a reality check. The federal deficit for 2024 soared above $1.8 trillion, up 8% from the previous year. Meanwhile, the debt burden, which is rapidly nearing $36 trillion, shows no signs of easing. U.S. deficit spending continues to spiral out of control When the government keeps printing money to finance its spending, the inevitable result is inflation. And in times of inflation, the purchasing power of traditional assets like bonds erodes. That’s why Jones favors assets that perform well in inflationary environments such as gold, silver, commodities and Bitcoin. I agree wholeheartedly with this assessment. Think about it: Why would you want to own fixed-income assets when interest rates are being adjusted and are likely to be lower than the inflation rate? Long-dated bonds are particularly vulnerable. U.S. banks, remember, are still dealing with billions of dollars in unrealized losses on their fixed-income positions. According to Florida Atlantic University’s bank screener, Bank of America’s unrealized losses on held-to-maturity investments in the first quarter were a staggering $110 billion, more than any other U.S. institution by far. The Fed will likely try to “inflate” its way out of this mess, meaning it will keep nominal interest rates lower than inflation to support economic growth. For investors, this means that preserving wealth will require smart positioning in alternative assets. Jones is already betting against the bond market— “I am clearly not going to own any fixed-income,” he told CNBC last week—and I believe many investors would be wise to take a similar approach. Let’s start with gold and silver. Both have been go-to haven assets for centuries, and for good reason. When geopolitical tensions have risen, when inflation has reared its ugly head and/or when there’s been uncertainty in the markets, investors have flocked to gold and silver. This year is no exception. We’ve seen gold shatter records multiple times in 2024, with prices rising more than 32% year-to-date, the metal’s best annual growth since 1979. According to data from the World Gold Council, gold has consistently outperformed both inflation and the growth rate of the world economy. From 1971 to 2023, gold’s compound annual growth rate (CAGR) was 8%, compared to 4% for the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) and 7.8% for global GDP growth. Gold has kept pace with global GDP and exceeded inflation Silver, often dubbed the “poor man’s gold,” is another asset that deserves attention. With its industrial applications, especially in the green energy sector, silver has strong potential for future growth. According to one projection, the clean energy transition could dramatically increase the demand for silver in photovoltaic (PV) technology, potentially consuming between 85% and a jaw-dropping 98% of current global silver reserves by 2050. Now, let’s talk about Bitcoin. The world’s largest digital asset has quickly become a preferred store of value for many investors, especially those looking to hedge against fiat currency depreciation. Nearly half of all traditional hedge funds currently maintain exposure to cryptos, including Bitcoin. Institutions are also backing Bitcoin with the same enthusiasm. Just look at BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF. It’s one of the fastest-growing ETFs in financial history, with assets under management now over $26 billion. That’s no small feat. Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, capped supply and growing institutional acceptance make it an attractive asset in times of uncertainty. Like gold, it’s a hedge against inflation, but it also offers the potential for significant upside as more investors and institutions recognize its value. Now, I know many of you are wondering: “What about the election? What if Trump wins? What if Harris wins?” Here’s a news flash for you: Over the long run, it may not matter as much as you think. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, made a great point recently when he said that he’s “tired of hearing this is the biggest election in your lifetime. The reality is over time, it doesn’t matter.” While hedge funds are taking positions in “Trump trades” like private prisons and fossil fuels, we believe that trying to time the market based on election outcomes is a risky game. Yes, the election will cause short-term volatility, but if you’re in the right assets—like gold, silver and Bitcoin—I believe you’ll be well-positioned to weather the storm. One Community.

The Future Of Work Is At A “Stall Or Soar” Decision Point As 2025 approaches, businesses stand at a critical crossroads: Will they soar to new heights by embracing the future of work or stall in the face of emerging challenges? The last few years have been a roller-coaster ride, with a turbulent ascent into a seemingly bright future of work only to take a deep dive into the icy waters of layoffs, burnout, and disillusionment. And just when many thought the bottom had dropped out, we’re seeing faint signs of recovery — a bounce that will either propel companies forward or drag them further down. The fate of your organization depends on how you handle the critical choices coming your way. We predict big risks and opportunities for the future of working including: Whether our predictions for 2025 come true for you is up to you. As we saw in 2024, even as the EX winter got colder, companies that zigged while the rest zagged emerged far ahead of their counterparts. We know one financial services company that has the highest employee satisfaction scores it has ever seen, despite the general chilly work climate, because it invested in employees and addressed organizational concerns. Conversely, we’re working with many firms — in media, consumer products, and more — who are dealing with stagnant work cultures, general distrust in executives, and lower confidence in organizational strategy due to letting EX slide for the past year. That’s why we say that the future of work doesn’t have to be your future of work. Whether you stall or soar is up to you.

Title: Should You Pick Caterpillar Stock Ahead Of Q3?

Close-up of CAT (Caterpillar Inc) logo on construction equipment, Lafayette, California, August 20, ... [+] 2024. (Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) will report its Q3 2024 results on Wednesday, October 30. We expect the company’s revenues to come in at $16.2 billion and adjusted earnings of $5.36 per share, broadly aligning with the consensus estimates. The company should see a decline in sales amid lower dealer inventory levels and overall weakness in demand. Our interactive dashboard analysis of Caterpillar’s FY 2024Q3 Earnings Preview has more details on the company’s revenues and earnings for the quarter. Caterpillar will have a tough comparison with the prior-year-quarter, which benefited from strong pricing growth and a robust demand environment. Pricing growth is expected to moderate in the near term. Caterpillar expects a slight decline in dealer inventory levels in 2024, compared to a $700 million rise in 2023, and this may have pulled its sales down in Q3. We forecast sales of around $16.1 billion, reflecting a 4% y-o-y decline. We don’t expect any meaningful improvement in operating margin, and its earnings to fall in the low single-digits y-o-y to $5.36 per share in Q3. Caterpillar’s revenue of $16.7 billion in Q2 was down 4% y-o-y. Looking at segments, the Construction Industries revenue was down 7%, Resource Industries sales were down 10%, while Energy & Transportation revenue was up 2%. Caterpillar saw its adjusted operating margin expand by 110 bps to 22.4% in Q2’24. The company’s bottom line stood at $5.99, compared to $5.55 in the prior-year quarter. We think CAT stock is appropriately priced. We estimate Caterpillar’s valuation to be $357 per share, slightly lower than its current market price of around $385. Our forecast is based on a little over 16x P/E multiple for CAT and expected earnings of $22.14 on a per-share and adjusted basis for the full year 2024. The 16x P/E multiple aligns with the stock’s average P/E ratio over the last five years. Despite the company facing headwinds, CAT stock has outperformed the broader markets, with 33% gains this year, vis-à-vis a 22% rise for the S&P 500 index. This can partly be attributed to the company’s upbeat earnings reported in Q1 and Q2. Notably, CAT is one of a handful of stocks that have increased their value in each of the last three years. Still, that wasn’t enough for it to consistently beat the market. Returns for the CAT stock were 16% in 2021, 19% in 2022, and 26% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. While CAT stock appears fully valued, it is helpful to see how Caterpillar’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

Title: It's a make-or-break week for the stock market

Time Published: 2024-10-28T17:21:29Z

Traders are bracing themselves for a big week for the stock market. Investors will be watching key data releases — including third-quarter GDP, an inflation update from the personal consumption expenditures index, and the October jobs report — for clues about the state of the economy heading into the end of the year. The data points will be key inputs for the Federal Reserve's interest-rate cuts. If the economy stays hot, the Fed could slow or even pause its easing cycle and spark a recalibration in markets that causes fresh volatility for stocks. Meanwhile, five mega-cap tech firms worth a combined $12 trillion — Meta, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet — are set to report third-quarter earnings this week. Here are the key inputs for markets to keep an eye on this week. Earnings season is peaking this week. More than 90 S&P 500 companies are set to report, including the mega-cap giants Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet. Together, those five companies are worth about $12 trillion. Investors will be looking for signs of AI growth — and with it, signals that the tech bull run will continue into 2025. Alphabet reports on Tuesday, followed by Microsoft and Meta on Wednesday. For Meta, analysts expect to see strong growth and a stable core business. In a note last week, analysts at Bernstein described Meta as the new "set it and forget it" blue-chip stock. They raised their price target to $675 a share from $600, representing potential upside of 16% from the price of the stock at midday on Monday. Apple has an especially big week ahead. The iPhone maker reports on Thursday and is expected to unveil software and hardware updates this week, including access to highly anticipated Apple Intelligence features with the iOS 18.1 update. In a note last Wednesday, the supply-chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TF International Securities warned of weak demand for Apple's iPhone 16 models and argued there was no sign that Apple's coming AI capabilities had boosted demand for its devices. Amazon will also report on Thursday. Deutsche Bank analysts expect strong results driven by operating income at the high end of guidance and higher operating income for next year. The analysts see several sources of upside, including faster growth of total ad revenue in its Prime Video segment; lower operating expenses for Amazon Web Services; and slow growth of other operating expenses. Investors will also be watching for clues about the strength of the AI trade. Except for Apple, the tech giants reporting this week are among Nvidia's biggest customers. As Nvidia's earnings aren't for another month, the third-quarter results and executive commentary will be gauges of demand from the so-called hyperscalers driving the bulk of GPU sales. The Wedbush Securities analyst and tech bull Dan Ives described this week as the "world series for big tech." He predicted that earnings results would come in strong and send tech stocks higher into the end of the year. "Investors need to see the monetization of AI spreading to the rest of the tech landscape and the next few weeks will be the linchpin to confirmation that the AI 'use case phase' have now begun within the enterprise world," Ives wrote in a note on Sunday. The flurry of key data releases starts with third-quarter GDP on Wednesday. Last week, stocks took a hit as the bond market sold off based on expectations for interest rates to remain higher; cautious comments from Fed officials; and rising odds of another Donald Trump presidency, which is widely seen as an inflationary event given his promises of high tariffs. Depending on the data this week, the bond market could reprice and send shocks through the stock market as investors adjust rate expectations. The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tracker on Friday showed an expectation of 3.3% economic growth for the quarter. That would mark significant growth from last quarter's 3% growth. A hot economy is a hurdle to aggressive rate cuts from the Fed and could cause markets to reprice expectations for interest rates through the rest of this year and into 2025. Personal consumption expenditures, due Thursday, will be another input for the Fed as it nears its goal of 2% inflation. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge is expected to show that prices rose by 2.1% year over year in September after coming in at 2.2% in August. After a blockbuster September jobs report, the stakes are high for October's jobs data on Friday. The data has become a double-edged sword for the market. If job growth remains high, that could reduce the need for more rate cuts. If the data is weaker than expected, that could prompt more rapid easing but also hint at a weakening economy. Economists expect to see that 110,000 jobs were added in the month, far fewer than the 254,000 added in September. JPMorgan analysts forecast a slightly milder increase of 100,000. They said recent storms and strikes could weigh on job growth, making the report difficult to interpret. "A decline in the unemployment rate would likely increase chatter around a Fed 'skip' in November, but barring an unexpectedly and remarkably strong set of data next week, we think it would take more months of good data before that possibility gets onto the Fed's radar," the analysts said in a note. According to the CME FedWatch tool, markets expect the Fed to deliver 25-basis-point cuts at the November and December meetings. Correction: October 28, 2024 — An earlier version of this story misstated the number of jobs the US added in September. It was 254,000, not 245,000. Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks Jump to

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. AMD (AMD) will report its fiscal third quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday, in what will serve as a temperature check on the health of the artificial intelligence market. AI continues to drive shares of tech giants ranging from AMD rival Nvidia (NVDA) to customers like Microsoft (MSFT), and investors and analysts are hoping to see their big bets pay off. AMD’s earnings come less than a month after the company detailed three of its upcoming chips including its 5th Gen AMD EPYC central processing unit (CPU) for servers, its Instinct MI325X AI chip, and the Ryzen AI Pro 300 for AI PCs for enterprise users. Shares of the chip company are up 65% in the last 12 months, beating out the broader S&P 500 (GSPC), which is up 36%, and clobbering struggling Intel (INTC), whose stock price is down a staggering 34%. Nvidia, meanwhile, continues to surge, climbing an eye-watering 246% in the last year. AMD is Nvidia’s biggest rival in the AI chip space. Of course, with Nvidia estimated to have between 75% and 90% of the market, that’s not saying much. For the quarter, AMD is expected to bring in adjusted earnings per share of $0.92 on revenue of $6.7 billion, based on analyst consensus estimates from Bloomberg. That’s up from $0.70 per share and $5.8 billion in the same quarter last year. AMD’s data center business segment — its most important — is set to bring in $3.46 billion, up from $1.59 billion in Q3 2023. Analysts are expecting $1.39 billion from its AI/GPU revenue alone. The company’s second-largest segment, its Client business, which involves sales of CPUs for desktops and laptops, is set to bring in $1.71 billion, versus $1.45 billion last year. AMD’s gaming segment, however, is projected to drop in a big way. Analysts anticipate the business will bring in $572 million in the quarter. That’s nearly a $1 billion decline from the same period last year. The gaming segment includes sales of AMD’s Radeon graphics cards for laptops and desktops and custom chips for consoles like the Xbox and PlayStation. Graphics cards for gaming PCs and console sales have fallen since their peak during the pandemic, which saw consumers buying up devices to help them fill their nights and days when they were stuck inside on the couches. AMD’s earnings report will give investors and analysts a look at what to expect from Nvidia when it announces its own earnings on Nov. 20. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Title: Kamala Harris Has More Billionaires Prominently Backing Her Than Trump—Bloomberg Reportedly Gives Another $50 Million To Help Harris (Updated)

Time Published: 2024-10-28T16:46:13Z
Full Content:
Forbes found at least 100 billionaires in the corners of either former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris—with many more backing Harris—but unlike the world’s richest man Elon Musk, who stumps extensively on Trump’s behalf, many have elected to watch from the sidelines, like Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg. Trump and Harris during their September presidential debate. Our breakdown records 82 billionaires supporting Harris and 52 backing Trump so far (see the lists for both below). Many more billionaires may still financially back a candidate, but their donations won’t be learned until after the election, when final Federal Election Commission reports are issued in December. Billionaires leaning toward Harris may seem incongruous, since she often criticizes Trump for advocating for policies favorable toward billionaires—but there are practical reasons why the ultra wealthy may favor Harris. A letter signed by more than a dozen billionaires last month endorsing Harris explained their belief Harris “will continue to advance fair and predictable policies that support the rule of law, stability, and a sound business environment,” indicating the support for the status quo as the U.S. economy and stock market exhibit strength, while a recent survey of millionaire investors—which found a 57% to 43% split in Harris’s favor—identified technology, healthcare and sustainability stocks as the sectors most poised to benefit from a Harris win, a mix friendly to many of her billionaire backers from Silicon Valley, who grew familiar with Harris during her time as a California prosecutor. Forbes will update this list through Election Day. Jeff Bezos, left, Larry Page, second from left, Sheryl Sandberg, former chief operating officer of ... [+] Facebook, then-Vice President-elect Mike Pence and then-President-elect Donald Trump meet in 2016. Jeff Bezos: The Amazon founder and world’s fourth-richest man wrote Trump “showed tremendous grace and courage under literal fire” following the assassination attempt at a July 13 rally, but Bezos has not endorsed or financially backed, even though he has publicly warred with Trump during his presidency. He celebrated Biden’s election in 2020 with an Instagram post noting the Biden win indicated “unity, empathy, and decency are not characteristics of a bygone era.” UPDATE (Oct. 29): In a strongly worded editorial in the Bezos-owned Washington Post, the centibillionaire explained his decision to reportedly strike down the newspaper’s endorsement of Harris amid a storm of controversy, explaining he believed it would help restore the public’s faith in the paper’s journalism. “Presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election,” wrote Bezos. Ken Griffin: Griffin (Citadel) confirmed he has not financially backed Trump, adding he’s “torn” and won’t vote with a “smile on my face” as both candidates aren’t “going to receive an award for the quality of their policies” or “the quality of their leadership.” UPDATE (Oct. 29): Griffin, one of the wealthiest hedge fund managers in the world and one of the deepest-pocketed Republican donors in prior election years, told Bloomberg financial markets’ “expectation today is that Donald Trump will win the White House,” echoing a chorus of Wall Street money flows seemingly pricing in such a scenario. But regardless of who wins, “the reduction of uncertainty is almost positive for asset prices and we’re at that moment of peak uncertainty,” offering a positive prognostication for investors. Bill Gates: Though his ex-wife French Gates is among Harris’ deepest backers—her reported $13 million donation to Harris groups would place her among the top individual donors this cycle—the Microsoft cofounder Gates has not officially endorsed a candidate, but appeared to offer positive words toward Harris in a July interview, saying it is “great to have somebody who's younger, who can think about things like AI and how we shape that in the right way.” But “I don’t tell other people how to vote” due to his work with his nonprofit Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Gates added. UPDATE (Oct. 22): Gates told allies he donated $50 million to the non-profit wing of a Democratic political action committee supporting Harris, The New York Times reported Tuesday, citing three sources familiar with the situation. The bombshell report goes against Gates’ history of public nonpartisanship. Though Gates did not confirm the donation to the Times, he hinted at his Harris backing in a statement, saying he supports “candidates who demonstrate a clear commitment to improving health care, reducing poverty and fighting climate change” and “this election is different” than those of the past. Jamie Dimon: Trump shared a false social media post touting Dimon’s endorsement, but the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, did not endorse any candidate, according to his spokesperson. Still, some see hints in Dimon’s words. He’s been outspoken about the election, penning an opinion in The Washington Post calling on voters “to elect a president who is dedicated to the ideals that define and unite us.” UPDATE (Oct. 22): The Times reported Dimon has privately endorsed Harris and has indicated he’s open to a role in her administration, including the top economic role of Treasury secretary. Dimon spokesman Joe Evangelisti told the Times the banker “has never publicly endorsed a presidential candidate.” Dimon’s wife, Judith Kent, has donated more than $250,000 to Democratic causes in 2024 through the couple’s joint The James and Judith K Dimon Foundation, according to Federal Election Commission filings. A source close to Dimon told Forbes that the JPMorgan chief is not considering a role in either a Harris or Trump administration. Steve Ballmer, UPDATE (Oct. 22): Ballmer, the owner of the NBA’s Los Angeles Clippers and former chief executive of Microsoft, made clear in an interview with Forbes last week he will not endorse a candidate, though he has shelled out more than $40 million to his not-for-profit company USAFacts to arm the public with easily accessible government data. “At some point all the money does is help bid up the price of ads on Facebook,” Ballmer bemoaned to Forbes about the impact traditional political spending can have. Connie Ballmer, the wife of the world’s 10th-richest person, has donated more than $300,000 to Democratic causes this year, according to government records, but “I don't control my wife and would never want to,” Steve Ballmer added about what that indicates about his own leanings. Warren Buffett: Though Berkshire Hathaway CEO Buffett said in 2020 he’s a Democrat and clapped back at Trump in 2016 for an income tax jab, Buffett, the world’s sixth-richest person, has also stayed quiet this cycle. UPDATE (Oct. 23): Berkshire released a statement Wednesday that Buffett won’t publicly “endorse and support political candidates.” Buffett explained to CNBC he’s “worried about people impersonating” him and “nobody should believe anybody saying I’m telling them how to...vote.” Mark Zuckerberg: Trump told New York Magazine that Zuckerberg said to him he can’t “vote for a Democrat in this election” after the assassination attempt. But a Meta spokesperson said Zuckerberg, the third-wealthiest person on the planet, is “not endorsing anybody in this race and has not communicated to anybody how he intends to vote.” In 2020, Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan donated $419 million toward organizations supporting in-person voting during the pandemics. The Meta CEO and Facebook cofounder called Trump’s response to the assassination attempt “badass” in a July interview. Ray Dalio: Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, told CNBC last month it’s the “most consequential” election of his, but he won’t endorse Harris or Trump as he desires a more moderate candidate. Sergey Brin: The Google cofounder and eighth-wealthiest person in the world Brin said following the 2016 election he found Trump’s election “deeply offensive” as an immigrant, according to an internal video leaked in 2018, but has not made public any feelings during this cycle. Larry Ellison: Ellison is one of the most surprising billionaires who has stayed quiet in the final months of the presidential election cycle considering he has donated millions to Republican causes in the past. Ellison (Oracle), the second-richest person on earth, had backed Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), in the primaries. A total of 82 billionaires (or more) are backing Harris. Forbes identified these 28 billionaires who donated $1 million toward groups supporting Harris through August: Michael Bloomberg, left, and Harris appear together in 2023. The following 36 billionaires made between $50,000 and $999,999 in donations to groups supporting Harris through August, according to Forbes’ analysis of FEC data: The news outlet Bloomberg reported these additional four billionaires have donated to Harris’ election funds or groups supporting Harris’ election: These six billionaires signed a Sept. 6 open letter supporting Harris: (Updated Oct. 16): And these three billionaires donated to a Harris committee during the third quarter, according to FEC filings analyzed by The New York Times: And there's music stars Bruce Springsteen, who backed Harris Oct. 3, and Taylor Swift, who endorsed Harris Sept. 10. (Updated Oct. 28): Bloomberg donated another $50 million to the same non-profit organization backing Harris, the Times reported Monday. Bloomberg was already the most prolific individual donor to Harris groups this cycle, and his total financial commitment toward Democratic causes now reportedly approaches nearly $100 million. Also, Duolingo founder Luis von Ahn endorsed Harris, declaring the Democratic candidate is “the better option for the US economy.” A total of 52 billionaires have been identified as Trump backers. Forbes identified in August these 26 billionaires who had donated at least $1 million toward Trump election efforts: Musk, right, jumps on stage as he joins Trump at a Saturday rally. Another 16 billionaires gave between $50,000 and $999,999 to groups supporting Trump through that period: (Updated Oct. 16) The New York Times named the following three billionaires as donating at least $100,000 to Trump groups last quarter: And of course there’s Elon Musk (Tesla and SpaceX CEO), who gave $75 million last quarter to his pro-Trump America PAC, according to filings. He gave another $43.6 million to a pro-Trump committee from Oct. 1 to Oct. 16, becoming the second-most prolific donor in Trump’s camp this year, trailing only Adelson. Other known Trump supporters include Jeff Hildebrand (Hilcorp), Isaac Perlmutter (Marvel Entertainment), Thomas Peterffy (Interactive Brokers) and Gary Rollins (Rollins Inc.), according to media reports and Bloomberg’s analysis of public election records last month. (Updated Oct. 22): The New Yorker recently reported activist investor Nelson Peltz hosted a February fundraiser for Trump, where Peltz reportedly quipped Trump is “a terrible human being, but our country’s in a bad place, and we can’t afford Joe Biden.” Peltz has not made public comment since Biden ceded way to Harris, and his Trian Partners asset manager did not return a request for comment. A pair of other Wall Street billionaires have said the stock market is heavily leaning toward Trump in Daniel Loeb and Stanley Druckenmiller, though neither have publicly endorsed or made major donations toward a candidate. Fellow hedge fund billionaire Leon Cooperman told Fox Business he doesn’t plan to vote for either major candidate. Kyle Khan-Mullins and Leo Kalmin contributed reporting. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Tesla short sellers lose more than $4 billion on EV maker's post-earnings stock rally

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Tesla's (TSLA) post-earnings stock rally has cost short sellers billions. Tesla short sellers lost $4.2 billion in the two days following the EV maker’s third quarter earnings last Wednesday, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla reported a higher-than-expected third quarter profit and improved margins after the bell on Oct. 23. Those beats helped Tesla stock notch its biggest single-day gain in a decade. The stock jumped 22% last Thursday, its best day since 2013, and shares rose another 3.3% Friday. Tesla stock was up roughly 1% on Monday before reversing direction, ending the day down 2.5%. This isn’t the first time this year that short sellers paid dearly for betting against the Elon Musk-helmed company. In the week following Tesla’s better-than-feared fiscal first quarter earnings report in April, short sellers lost more than $5 billion. Tesla’s stock performance has been volatile over the past month. Shares sank in early October as the automaker missed Wall Street estimates on its third quarter deliveries, issued a recall, and discontinued a lower-priced model. Then, the stock rose in anticipation of Tesla’s robotaxi unveiling, only to fall sharply when the event failed to live up to the hype. Tesla’s most recent rally last week comes despite mixed third quarter results. While Tesla beat Wall Street’s forecasts on its adjusted earnings per share and gross margin, its quarterly revenue of $25.18 billion was lower than the $25.4 billion expected, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. A slew of Wall Street analysts from Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America (BAC), and Deustche Bank (DB) to Wedbush, Canaccord Genuity, and William Blair have reiterated their Buy ratings on Tesla stock following the report. Bank of America also raised its price target on the stock to $265 from $255. The firm's senior auto analyst John Murphy said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above) he is eyeing another price target hike on Tesla. While Tesla’s recent focus on its AI ambitions had left investors feeling skittish, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said he was encouraged by Tesla's emphasis in its third quarter earnings call on revving up its auto business, which accounts for 80% of Tesla's revenue. Jonas pointed to CEO Elon Musk's comments about targeting 20% to 30% growth in electric vehicle deliveries in 2025 while focusing on lowering production costs. "As investors struggle with the business model shift from auto to AI, this print reminds us growing the auto business profitably remains a high priority," Jonas wrote in a note to investors. Meanwhile, 20 of the 60 analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg have a Hold rating on the stock and 15 analysts recommend selling shares. On average, they see shares falling to $228 over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X @LauraBratton5.

October 28, 2024 12:15 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, Oct. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a reverse share split for one of its ETFs. The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of the transaction. Reverse split will be executed on GraniteShares 2x Short NVDA Daily ETF. After the close of the markets on November 01, 2024 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: Please note the CUSIP change, effective November 04, 2024: As a result of the reverse split, every twenty-five shares of the Fund will be exchanged for one share of the Fund. Accordingly, the total number of the issued and outstanding shares for the Fund will decrease by the approximate percentage indicated above. In addition, the per share net asset value (“NAV”) and next day’s opening market price will be approximately twenty-five-times higher for the Fund. Shares of the Fund will begin trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market. (the “NASDAQ”) on a split-adjusted basis on November 04, 2024. The next day’s opening market value of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the reverse split. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical one-for- twenty-five reverse split anticipated for the Fund: 1-for-25 Reverse Split Redemption of Fractional Shares and Tax Consequences of the Reverse Split As a result of the reverse split, a shareholder of the Fund’s shares potentially could hold a fractional share. However, fractional shares cannot trade on the NASDAQ. Thus, the Fund will redeem for cash a shareholder’s fractional shares at the Fund’s split-adjusted NAV as of the Effective Date. Such redemption may have tax implications for those shareholders and a shareholder could recognize a gain or loss in connection with the redemption of the shareholder’s fractional shares. Otherwise, the reverse split will not result in a taxable transaction for holders of Fund shares. No transaction fee will be imposed on shareholders for such redemption. The GraniteShares ETF Trust’s transfer agent will notify the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) of the reverse split and instruct DTC to adjust each shareholder’s investment(s) accordingly. DTC is the registered owner of the Fund’s shares and maintains a record of the Fund’s record owners.

Title: College basketball rankings: Top 100 And 1 transfers to know entering the 2024-25 season

If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Transfer rankings go out the door once everyone steps onto campus, but it's clear as day that the hits (and misses) from the bonkers 2024 portal cycle will make or break numerous clubs that have championship expectations. Let's dive into 100 and 1 transfers to know this season. Factors like talent (duh), fit into the new roster and the scheme that they will be playing were heavily weighed. Transfer from: Seton Hall Richmond might never be a knockdown catch-and-shoot sniper, but his positional size is a cheat card on both ends of the floor. St. John's has the bones of an excellent defensive club with Richmond's nastiness and versatility at the forefront. Richmond, a 6-foot-6, 205-pound bowling ball, put up enormous numbers (15.7 ppg, 7.0 rpg, 5.1 apg) in a slow-paced, Seton Hall system last season. Rick Pitino is going to ramp up the tempo to lightning-strike levels, so Richmond is in an eruption spot. Transfer from: Florida Atlantic From Derrick Rose to Rob Dillingham and numerous ballers in between, John Calipari annually hands the keys to a lead guard and lets 'em cook. That formula won't change in Arkansas. Davis is poised to be the Razorbacks' new alpha. The Florida Atlantic transfer is armed to score with every tool in the shed. Ball screens, post-ups, transition, drives or handoffs? You name it, Davis can get buckets with it. Transfer from: Drake The 6-7, 210-pound forward is an elite three-level scorer. DeVries is truly a big guard. He makes high-difficulty shots look way too easy from the midrange and downtown. DeVries' off-movement shooting sets up everything about his game. He's so big and can create space so effortlessly. But he can also use his frame as a bootyball weapon in post-ups. He didn't get to the rim a ton, but he shot over 67% when he got there. DeVries is just an all-around star who passes it well, rebounds well, plays defense and gets to the free throw line religiously. He was a star for his dad, Darian, at Drake. He'll be a star for his dad at West Virginia. Transfer from: Wisconsin Storr would carry Wisconsin and occasionally, shoot the Badgers out of games. He'd terrify both coaching staffs. But his strengths are so obvious. The big, explosive wing is a brutally tough cover when he gets the rock on an empty side, rips it and gets downhill. Storr can put anybody on a poster, even Mount Edey. Storr has the most juice of anybody in Kansas' wing corps. If Storr embraces cutting with a purpose, Bill Self could spoon-feed him four points a game with brilliant halfcourt sets. If he embraces running the floor hard in transition, that's another easy six points a game with Dajuan Harris or Hunter Dickinson whipping bullet, look-ahead passes. Storr could saunter to 20-point nights in this scheme without breaking a sweat. If it coalesces properly, Storr could be Kansas' best player and an All-American candidate. Transfer from: Duke Roach-to-Baylor is one of the rare high-floor, high-ceiling additions in the 2024 portal cycle. The Duke transfer will waltz into Baylor's starting lineup and give Scott Drew a veteran who has played a variety of roles over the years. He can be a go-to scorer. He can be an initiating point guard. He can be a spot-up shooter. Baylor is also getting the best version of Roach. He shot 43% from 3-point range, 40% on midrange jumpers and 56% at the rim last season. Baylor can lean on Roach to go create a bucket for himself or others in late-clock situations. Maybe most importantly, Roach doesn't block any of Baylor's talented freshmen. If intriguing freshman point guard Rob Wright III is ready to go, Roach can slide to an off-ball role. If five-star VJ Edgecombe is ready to be a freshman sensation, Roach can shift to a secondary role, but Roach is a sleeper Big 12 Player of the Year candidate in this scheme. Transfer from: Indiana State Few bigs are as skilled as Avila. The former Indiana State star smartly stuck with his guy, Josh Schertz, who took the Saint Louis job. Schertz helped turn Avila into a star, and the duo should be up to their old tricks again in the Atlantic 10. Avila has established himself as one of the best small-ball bigs in the country. His skill is off the charts, both as a passer, low-post threat and a true floor-stretching big man. Saint Louis smartly added athletic forwards like Kalu Anya and AJ Casey to cover up some of Avila's deficiencies on the defensive end. He's not a shot-blocker, but Avila is a cheat code offensively, so that makes up for it. Cue the Cream Abdul-Jabbar or Larry Nerd jokes. Transfer from: Miami Playing with a ridiculous motor can make up for a lot. Omier, a 6-7, 240-pound forward, doesn't have elite height, but he plays so hard. Omier has turned himself into one of the best players in the country. Omier eats rebounds for breakfast, lunch and dinner. He will sprint the floor whether he's getting the ball or not. He sets good screens and plays with toughness and physicality. The little stuff is a constant. The intangibles are glorious. But Omier added an extra layer to his game with his 3-ball. Omier shot 35% on 68 attempts from downtown last season. Omier at the 5 will be a cheat code for a Baylor offense that didn't need much help. Five-shooter lineups will be a staple and the paint will be cleared for Baylor's guards to get to the tin. Baylor's offense has been awesome without a five-out option. Now it has one. Look out. Transfer from: Illinois Kansas State paid up to win the Coleman Hawkins sweepstakes, and Jerome Tang's next priority is getting the Dug McDaniel-Hawkins, pick-and-pop game humming right away. McDaniels' speed and Hawkins' deep range should open the floor up for Kansas State's offense, but Hawkins, the creator, might be more important than Hawkins, the shooter. His ability to carve up defenses as a passer and a handler will be a wrinkle that few other big men possess. Tang is also one of the best defensive coaches in the sport, and a now-healthy Hawkins gives Tang so much lineup versatility because he can switch onto guards and pester big wings. Hawkins has some of the best hands in the country. He should be a deflection machine for a K-State defense that usually wants to take the ball away. Transfer from: Utah State Danny Sprinkle is bringing Osobor with him again to a new job. This time with way more fanfare and a whole lot more NIL money. Osobor is one of the best small-ball centers in the portal who may have to downshift to the 4 if Franck Kepnang can ever get healthy. You would feel that duo. Osobor can play with anybody thanks to his rim pressure and playmaking. He flirted with some triple-doubles last season at Utah State, and Washington will need him to make great decisions if it wants to compete in a gauntlet of a Big Ten. There's optimism that Osobor can expand his jumper out to the perimeter but that hasn't happened yet. He's a career 64% free throw shooter. Sprinkle would be overjoyed if he can crack the 70% range because he could lead the Big Ten in free throw attempts next season. Transfer from: Washington State Indiana's pitiful pick-and-roll offense needed a life raft, and Rice will team up with Stanford transfer Kanaan Carlyle to be the solution. The vibrant point guard waltzes into a new-look backcourt with a real chance to be The Man. Rice is a jitterbug with the ball in his hands. An explosive first step helps Rice navigate into the paint left and right. Washington State played two non-shooting bigs so often last season, so IU's crowded paint won't be anything new to Rice. He's a capable shooter but he wasn't efficient last season because he was often Washington State's late-clock, bail-out guy. He makes up for it with a barrage of finishes and proficient reads in the ball-screen game. Rice is also an awesome point-of-attack defender who more than held his own for a Washington State defense that finished second in the Pac-12 in league play. Rice, simply, refuses to get screened. That's a skill. Rice can be a first-team, All-Big Ten player next season. Transfer from: Tennessee Aidoo was one of the few no-brainers in the portal. Aidoo is a plug-and-play big man who can do it all. He can protect the rim, uncork soft-touch jumpers, post up, run the floor, pass a little bit and convert his free throws. There's just so much to like about his game, and the table is set for Aidoo to be a top-two option at Arkansas. He'll be the outlet for Arkansas' electric backcourt. If his engine is revving non-stop, Aidoo can be one of the best big men in the country. Transfer from: Rutgers Alabama's rim defense went from a major strength in 2022-23 to a major weakness last season. Omoruyi's presence should single-handedly make Alabama a vicious rim defense again. The Rutgers transfer is an excellent drop-coverage defender who has an insane wingspan that he uses on both ends. The offensive ecosystem at Alabama is so much better than it was last season at Rutgers. Omoruyi as a legit lob threat who can loom in the dunker spot will be more effective than heavy post-up reps. Omoruyi is also one of the best raw athletes in the country. His dunks will shake the rim for days. Transfer from: USC Johnson is expected to be a massive piece of this UCLA team. He's one of the best all-around defenders in the country, and under Mick Cronin's guidance, he could transform into a Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year frontrunner. Playing with a point guard like Isaiah Collier was supposed to help Johnson's offensive game, but he regressed big-time as a shooter. There's still plenty of reason for cautious optimism of a bounceback in that regard. Johnson's slashing and defense give him such a high floor. He doesn't have to be a star for the Bruins, but fresh scenery could unlock his full bag. Johnson-to-UCLA is pound-for-pound as good a fit as anyone in the portal. Transfer from: Duke Mitchell was a piece for Duke, but he will be the piece for Mizzou. It's an excellent bet by both sides. Mitchell could give Dennis Gates a Kobe Brown-like, jumbo initiator who can be the centerpiece of an offense. His drives can be nasty, especially when an opposing center is guarding him. A top dawg role at Missouri should help him play with more confidence and assertiveness, two attributes that started to dissipate at Duke down the stretch. Mitchell can be a terrific two-way piece for the Tigers, and he's positioned to put up career-best numbers in his new home. Transfer from: BYU A hint of familiarity is just so huge for a new coach. Robinson had a breakout season under Mark Pope at BYU, and he smartly chose to run it back. This time he'll don the Kentucky threads. Robinson demands so much attention because he's a legit 6-7 shooter who never stops moving and can elevate over just about every defender. Robinson was also one of the top transition scorers in college basketball last season, despite only shooting 28% on his transition 3s. Some positive regression is coming in that department. As he continues to grow as an on-ball creator, Robinson's game will reach new heights. But he's a darn good college basketball player right now and could lead the SEC in 3-point shooting. .@Robinsonjaxx starting off HOT 🔥🥵19 PTS (7-12 FG, 5-9 3FG) | 3 REB pic.twitter.com/5l5Z9dGPFn Transfer from: Saint Mary's Mahaney is the only player on this UConn roster who has been the No. 1 option on the scouting report in college. That'll be invaluable. The 6-foot-3 junior guard has all the qualities that Hurley wants. He's tough. He's a winner. He's reliable. He's smart. Oh, and he can shoot it. Mahaney shot 38% on his catch-and-shoot 3-pointers as a sophomore and 46% as a freshman. Per Synergy, no high-major team generated a higher percentage of open catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season than … UConn. Mahaney should fit like a glove in this backcourt, and he's a killer in late-clock scenarios. UConn should maximize his strengths and cover up the warts in his game. Transfer from: East Carolina Small and DeVries give West Virginia a 1-2 punch that can play with anybody. Small was one of the top pick-and-roll scorers in the portal, but playing next to a stud scorer like DeVries should open up more spot-up opportunities for Small. That should be money in the bank. Small was a bad catch-and-shoot weapon at East Carolina, but he worked tirelessly to make it a strength. He splashed 47% of his catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season at Oklahoma State. Small was a good No. 1 option for Oklahoma State last season. He should be a great No. 2 option for WVU in 2024-25. Transfer from: Indiana State Xavier scored the fifth-most points off handoffs last season, per Synergy. It added one of the best shooters in the portal who excelled on … handoffs. Only 15 players in the country made more 3-pointers off handoffs than Conwell last season. Conwell's shot profile is all 3-pointers or stuff at the rim. Conwell splashed over 42% of his catch-and-shoot triples and also shot over 62% at the rim. He was one of the best shooting guards in the country last season, and he's going to a scheme that excels at letting snipers cook. Conwell only has one season under his belt where he was a plus-shooter, but if that sticks (as expected), he can be one of the best players in the Big East. Transfer from: FAU New Michigan coach Dusty May did not get his entire FAU band to follow him to Michigan, but he did land maybe the most important one. Goldin can be one of the Big Ten's best big men next season. He's a complete load in the paint, but his improved mobility and touch around the basket has helped him become a much better target in the ball-screen game. Goldin isn't super fluid but he's so powerful. When he stays under control, he's a monster. Goldin is not some Nikola Jokic-like distributor, but he'll make the simple reads if he's doubled or on the short roll. He has real high-major size, so Michigan can play him one-on-one against just about anybody defensively. Goldin should be highly productive at Michigan. Transfer from: Arizona Indiana's rebounding was not a strength last season, but Ballo can single-handedly raise that floor significantly. The 7-foot, 260-pound center is impossible to move, and he's become one of the best rebounders in the sport, period. Ballo is an outstanding play-finisher in pick-and-rolls and should set bone-crushing screens for IU's ball-handlers. Ballo will seal his man and finish in the paint efficiently with post-ups. He also offers a solid interior defense. Arizona's top-10 defense was fantastic with Ballo on the floor, but he's pretty much limited to just drop coverage and teams will try to exploit that. Big men like Ballo are usually a cheat code for regular-season success, but he needs to get fully healthy. THE POWER. 😤@OumarBallo32 | #IUBB pic.twitter.com/oRjMj5nEgH Transfer from: Michigan No one scored more points in pick-and-rolls last season than McDaniel. Now, he's headed to the Octagon of Doom where short kings like Markquis Nowell (and Tylor Perry to a lesser extent) have put up numbers. McDaniel has legit defensive questions, but he's such a tough cover due to his speed, deep jumper and nifty floater. Kansas State's funkily-built roster is dependent on McDaniel being a superstar. His usage rate should be ridiculously high. He will put up numbers. Will it impact winning? Transfer from: Utah Smith's speed, competitiveness, defense and court vision should be everything Pitino craves from his point guards. The fit between Richmond and Smith has been questioned from the start. Both high-usage guards aren't high-volume, 3-point shooters. But Richmond is more of a halfcourt hub and Smith is awesome in transition. That push-pull should add some diversity to St. John's profile. Smith's ability to bend defenses and create long closeouts for Richmond to attack is the way for this duo to thrive together. Transfer from: Virginia Tech Pedulla is just an all-around great player. The 6-1 guard is a flamethrower shooter who gets to the free-throw line and is very unselfish. His efficiency numbers might have been better without numerous late-clock heaves that litter his Virginia Tech tape, but Pedulla is a real three-level scorer. He quickly assimilated to various roles at Virginia Tech, and that should pop up in a more-talented Ole Miss roster. If Ole Miss needs Pedulla to score, he will. If Ole Miss needs Pedulla to be a pass-first guy on some night, he'll do that, too. Pedulla's ability to play on or off the ball gives Chris Beard real flexibility with his lineup construction blueprints. Transfer from: New Mexico Texas Tech is a haven for former Mountain West Freshman of the Year winners. Last season, it was Darrion Williams. This year, it's Toppin. The 6-foot-9, 210-pound big man should slot in as Texas Tech's starting 4-man, and he can be one of the most impactful defenders on the roster. Toppin can slide those puppies on the perimeter while offering legitimate rim protection. Toppin was a stocks (steals and blocks) machine last season at New Mexico, and he's a junkyard dawg on the glass. Toppin has to grow as a shooter, both from downtown and from the free throw line, but Elijah Hawkins should generate so many open looks for Toppin to eat around the rim. Transfer from: Xavier Claude is the best addition for new USC coach Eric Musselman. The 6-foot-6, 207-pound guard will be the No. 1 option for this Trojans' club. Claude will be an impact defender from the jump, but USC will rely on him to be a late-game closer, too. Claude has outstanding positional size, and Xavier put him in a ton of ball screens. Expect more of the same at USC. Claude should take another step as a shooter which could help him become a true three-level scorer. If that happens, he can be one of the best players in the Big Ten. Don't be stunned if he flirts with some triple-doubles eventually. Jumbo-sized initiators have thrived under Musselman in the past. Claude is up next. Transfer from: South Florida The fifth-year senior is an utter deadeye on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers. Youngblood drained 40% of his treys for three straight years. Why would that change next year in one of the best offensive systems in the country? But Youngblood shouldn't be painted as just a specialist. The South Florida transfer was well-coached into a well-rounded hooper. He's a broad-shouldered, thick veteran who isn't afraid to post up against smaller guards and rack up fouls. It's a good strategy when you're a career 82% free throw shooter. His pull-up jumper is so, so silky. Youngblood-to-Alabama is one of the best fits in the transfer portal. Transfer from: Harvard Mack is a shifty point guard who can break down defenses left and right and uncork two-handed, frozen ropes or one-handed, live-dribble whips to shooters. The sophomore's playmaking is why he's the jewel of this Georgetown transfer haul. Mack has all the physical tools to be one of the better point guards in the Big East. Transfer from: North Florida Lanier was one of the coveted guards in this transfer cycle because of his silky-smooth jumper that he can get to off the catch or off the bounce. His mechanics are a little funky. Sometimes his knees nearly touch the basketball on his gather and load, but he's able to get it off. Tennessee will likely play him off the ball and run him off a ton of floppy actions for 3-pointers, similar to what it did with Dalton Knecht. Tennessee's horde of nasty defenders should cover up some of Lanier's perceived deficiencies on that end. Transfer from: Oklahoma Uzan is a plug-and-play starting point guard for Kelvin Sampson who will provide an outstanding feel for the game and get the ball where it needs to go. Uzan finished with a two-to-one, assist-to-turnover ratio last season, but it can be way better at Houston. Uzan has loads of outstanding play-finishers that he can find along with two absolute net-shredders like LJ Cryer and Emanuel Sharp to keep the floor spaced properly. Uzan can manipulate the defense and find cutters or shooters at the very last second, and he's a willing, active defender. The jumper will be the swing skill set. Uzan can shoot it. He proved that as a freshman when he shot over 38% from downtown in Big 12 play. But he regressed last season. If he can get back to the mid-to-high 30s to go along with his fabulous floater, terrific court-mapping and well-rounded defense, Uzan can be a massive piece for a Houston club that has its sights set on a national championship run. Transfer from: Belmont Tyson was such a necessary addition to a UNC offense that so badly needed a big, rangy shooter. Tyson does not create much offense for himself off the bounce, but that could be another wrinkle to add to his game this offseason. Being able to attack smaller matchups with post-ups (similar to what Harrison Ingram did) would be a huge boost for Tyson's NBA stock. At minimum, Tyson is a plug-and-play sniper who was efficient from downtown, the midrange and at the rim, but Tyson is far from a finished product. Transfer from: James Madison Edwards should make everything easier for Louisville's rebuild. The James Madison veteran transfer is a true two-way player who was asked to do a little bit of everything. Edwards owned one of the highest pick-and-roll usages last season, and he's got lots of counters in his bag. He owns a tight spin move to get to the rim or to his soft-touch floater. Edwards has grown a ton as a shooter, but he's still at his best when he hits attack mode and seeks out the creases. Edwards is slated to earn a heavy usage rate when he's on the floor, and Louisville's decision to load up on big men who can stretch the floor should open the paint for Edwards' defense-bending drives. Transfer from: Ohio State Gayle has a real shot at being the jewel of Michigan's transfer haul. Gayle has all the qualities of a pass-dribble-shoot guard who also happens to be hellacious defensively. Being able to attack space off the bounce is essential in May's drive-and-kick offense. Gayle does all of that. He shot over 60% at the rim on enormous volume. Nearly 43% of Gayle's shot attempts were at the rim last season. He is a walking paint touch, and Gayle should continue to be a staple at the free throw line. Gayle's 3-point jumper is streaky and the mechanics are a bit iffy at times. But it's not unsolvable. There's All-Big Ten upside here one day with room for even more. 🪣🪣 pic.twitter.com/5L00SQVAnV Transfer from: Arizona Boswell, a Champaign native, is coming home to adopt the biggest role of his career. Boswell had an 18% usage rate last season at Arizona. He could sniff the 25% range at Illinois. Underwood pitched Boswell on an expanded offensive role, but Illinois certainly needs Boswell to buff up its perimeter defense. When dialed in, Boswell can be a difference-maker at the point of attack. Illinois landed prized international freshman Kasparas Jakucionis to handle most of the true point guard reps, which should allow Boswell to slide into a score-first, off-ball role. Boswell is a knockdown 3-point sniper, but he did not get to the rim often last season and barely shot any free throws. Attacking the rim is a massive priority for Underwood. It has to be a point of emphasis for Boswell. Transfer from: Alabama Griffen shot over 39% on 146 catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season at Alabama. He's exactly the type of sidekick this Kansas roster needed to accentuate Hunter Dickinson and Dajuan Harris. But he's so much more than just a shooter. Griffen is a comfortable secondary handler who flashed pockets of nifty decision-making. Griffen could be an elite 3-and-D wing once the D catches up to the 3-point shooting. He's shown flashes on that end, but it's time to level up. Kansas is banking on it. Transfer from: Oklahoma McCollum is a stud. He was one of the top pick-and-roll scorers in the country last season for an undermanned Oklahoma club. McCollum is so dynamic off the bounce, and he can operate as Georgia Tech's lead guard or as a spot-up assassin next to emerging sophomore Nait George. McCollum's 31% 3-point mark is a bit deceiving. McCollum often had to operate as Oklahoma's late-clock, bail-us-out option. He shot just 4-for-24 on 3-pointers with less than four seconds left on the shot clock. McCollum can be one of the best offensive guards in the ACC with a few subtle tweaks in his game. Transfer from: Texas Tech Greg McDermott has a long history of maximizing his best offensive players. Isaacs should be up next to jump on Creighton's jetpack joy ride. Isaacs' jumper last season was hit-or-miss, partially due to a hip injury and some iffy shot selection. But he's fearless and hard to contain off the bounce. Isaacs shot just 43% at the rim as a freshman, but that improved slightly to 48% last season. Is another spike coming? Isaacs will be Creighton's best late-clock option and his pick-and-roll chemistry with Kalkbrenner should be on full display. Isaacs is an easy pick to lead this Bluejays team in scoring. Transfer from: Oregon State Bilodeau is a huge get for a UCLA offense that needed fixin' in the worst way. UCLA was one of the worst layup-shooting teams in the country last season. Bilodeau was automatic around the rim. He finished with the sixth-highest offensive efficiency rating in Pac-12 play, per KenPom. He shot over 71% at the rim, and he's a legitimate floor-spacer. Bilodeau should give point guard Dylan Andrews his first real pick-and-pop threat. He's such a big offensive upgrade over what UCLA trotted out last season in its frontcourt, but Cronin will demand more out of him defensively. Transfer from: Kentucky Wagner was outshined by Reed Sheppard and Rob Dillingham at Kentucky, but his freshman year wasn't nearly as bad as some would lead you to believe. Wagner is good, and he can put opposing perimeter defenders in hell with his drives. Wagner is excellent at attacking the top foot and getting his defender off balance. The drives were impactful but Wagner has to improve finishing around the rim. That's arguably more important than continuing to progress as a shooter. Arkansas should give Wagner the runway to be a huge piece of this backcourt, but there are questions about his fit next to ball-dominant guards like Davis and freshman Boogie Fland. Maybe last season's experience next to Sheppard, Dillingham and Antonio Reeves will help Wagner find the sweet spot at Arkansas. Transfer from: Miami Poplar is really good at what he does. The 6-5 guard is a proven, high-level shooter who splashed over 37% of his treys in each of the past two seasons. He's also capable of attacking the rack with a vengeance for some monster posters, and Poplar will stick his face in the fan on the glass. He's been a productive role player, but Poplar transferred to Villanova to show he can be more than just a spot-up guard. Poplar wants the ball in his hands as a primary initiator, and Villanova's backcourt needs a star. Poplar believes it's his turn to prove that he can be that alpha once and for all. Transfer from: Texas It's been a struggle for Hunter to stay consistent offensively, but at his best, he's still one of the premier on-ball defenders in the game. Hunter is the closest thing to a true, set-the-table point guard of this new-look Tigers bunch, but his experience playing both on and off the ball at Texas should pay off next to new running mate PJ Haggerty. Memphis certainly needs Hunter's 3-point jumper to stick to open up extra space for Haggerty's drives. Hunter has shot over 36% from downtown in conference play in back-to-back seasons. Hunter should be unleashed to be in the hunt for First Team All-AAC honors. Transfer from: Wisconsin Hepburn is so much better when he doesn't have to be a go-to scorer. When Hepburn can unleash extra energy on defense, his value elevates. The Wisconsin transfer was well-schooled on the defensive end under Greg Gard, and he projects to be one of the best on-ball defenders in the ACC while giving Louisville's offense a steady hand. Hepburn is a career 36% 3-point shooter who makes great decisions and can go for 20 on nights when he has the right matchup. But the veteran point guard hits the floor trying to make others better. Pat Kelsey's high-tempo system could unlock the best version of Hepburn. Transfer from: Minnesota Hawkins is one of the top initiator point guards in the country, and this was a fantastic coup for Texas Tech's new-look backcourt. The Minnesota transfer will be the table-setter for Toppin's buckets around the rim and the 3s from Chance McMillian and Kerwin Walton. He will have the keys to this Texas Tech offense, and Hawkins deserves that opportunity. Hawkins throws exceptional lobs and he's so easy to play with. Hawkins also shot over 38% from downtown on over four attempts per game during Big Ten play, so you can't go under every screen. That opens up more space in the ball-screen game. Hawkins is only 5-foot-11 and 165 pounds, so he's an easy target for opposing offenses, but Texas Tech has insulated him with sturdy perimeter defenders to cover up some of his weaknesses on that end. Transfer from: Furman Pegues is a killer. He will take and make tough shots, and that type of guard is exactly what Auburn needed in the portal. Pegues played a variety of roles at Furman, first as a spot-up guy playing off Mike Bothwell and Jalen Slawson and then as a lead guard who had to initiate everything. That experience and variety should pay off right away for the Tigers. His nifty drives, pure jumper and smart playmaking give Pegues a chance to be Auburn's No. 2 option behind Johni Broome from the jump. Big fan of defense ➡️ offense plays pic.twitter.com/w7FMzFDSxU Transfer from: Georgia Tech Auburn's offense could bog down in late-clock situations last season, but it addressed that issue with Pegues and Kelly. At Georgia Tech, Kelly had to be a high-usage scorer who took tough shots. At Auburn, he'll have to embrace a lower-usage role with the benefit of much cleaner looks. Don't be fooled by the percentages, Kelly is a dynamic shooter and he can hit some tough stepbacks against even the best defense. Auburn coach Bruce Pearl has raved about Kelly often this season, often describing him as one of the best shooters he's ever had. Transfer from: South Carolina Johnson was a top-of-the-scouting report killer for South Carolina last season. He had a ton of responsibilities on his plate offensively. That experience should reap benefits in Round II at Ohio State. Johnson should slide right next to Bruce Thornton and form one of the top bucket-getting guard duos in the league next season. Johnson was the best version of himself at South Carolina with a pick-and-pop big man like BJ Mack. That's still an unproven question for Ohio State's frontcourt. But there's no doubt Johnson's drives are impactful. That first step is nasty. He'll be productive in his return to Ohio State. Transfer from: Eastern Washington Remember when Great Osobor followed his coach, Danny Sprinkle, from Montana State to Utah State and became a household name? Something similar could happen with Coward who followed David Riley from Eastern Washington to Washington State. The 6-foot-6, 205-pound wing is on NBA radars thanks to his versatility. Riley smartly uses Coward like the queen on the chess board, posting him up against smaller matchups or letting him stretch the floor and bend defenses with his drives. Coward shot 75% at the rim and 40% on his catch-and-shoot 3-pointers. That'll play. He's a two-way player, too. Coward should get way more exposure in the WCC. Transfer from: Belmont All of Gillespie's advanced offensive stats last season at Belmont were terrific. Gillespie was extremely efficient from 3-point range, and he shot nearly 70% at the rim in halfcourt settings. That's nuts for a 6-foot-1 point guard. The question is whether all of that efficiency will translate against high-major opponents. Maryland is banking on it. Gillespie does not have to be Jahmir Young 2.0, but he'll get the first crack at replacing the Terps' All-Big Ten guard. Gillespie's dribble-handoff game with skilled five-star big man Derik Queen should be terrific. Transfer from: UNC Wilmington TCU coach Jamie Dixon has leaned into a heavy-transition offense the last few years, and White can help keep that train rolling. The slashing wing is a good, low-volume shooter, but he's just an awesome driver who constantly breaks down defenses and gets to the paint. He's so wiry and tough to stay in front of. History says you can find productive transfer-up targets from the CAA ranks, and White is up next. He's one of the best wing-handlers in the portal, and White can be one of TCU's better defenders from the jump. He doesn't check off quite as many boxes as Emanuel Miller, but White should replace a bunch of that production. Transfer from: Arkansas Mark was one of the top isolation scorers in the country last season. Mark shot over 70% at the rim and drew nearly five fouls per 40 minutes. He's constantly putting pressure on the defense with his drives and a midrange jumper he can comfortably get to whenever. He shot a career-best 36% from 3-point range for Arkansas, but it was on a bit lower volume (3.2 attempts per game). Mark should be one of Texas' best two-way players, and he might earn that closer role. Transfer from: Evansville Humrichous was one of the most impactful players in the country last season. Evansville was competent with Humrichous on the floor (+3.6 net rating) and a complete dumpster fire without him (-16.8 net rating). Illinois wants at least four shooters on the floor at all times, and that's Humrichous' game. Humrichous shot 42% on 142 catch-and-shoot 3-pointers. The 6-foot-9 forward can fire over just about anybody. Humrichous also owns real wiggle off the bounce. If the right matchup presents itself, Illinois will be comfortable giving Humrichous the green light to go to work one-on-one to get to his fadeaway, midrange jumper. Humrichous is easily one of the top stretch forwards in the portal, and there weren't many of them in the free agency pool. Transfer from: Saint Mary's Saint Mary's defense was impenetrable when Jefferson was on the floor. Now, he heads to Iowa State to be a key cog for another elite defense. He'll guard those rangy forwards in the Big 12 that Milan Momcilovic would've had issues with. Jefferson's playmaking, defense and rebounding give him such a high floor. Iowa State can use him to back down good matchups from the slot, and he's a willing passer who can spray it and create advantages for drivers like Keshon Gilbert or shooters like Momcilovic, Tamin Lipsey or Curtis Jones. Jefferson is easily one of the most talented forwards T.J. Otzelberger has coached at Iowa State, and if the jumper continues to improve, he will leap into a new tier. Transfer from: Ohio State Richmond and Smith are the big-name gets for St. John's, but Scott is such a stud. There was a real shortage of stretch 4s in the portal, but St. John's landed one of the best out there. Scott shot over 37% on 115 catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season, and he is very comfortable getting into his post-ups from the slot. Plus, Scott projects to be an outstanding multi-positional defender. His floor spacing will be invaluable for St. John's. He might never sit. Transfer from: Pepperdine Everyone is looking for forwards as well-rounded as Ajayi. Gonzaga scooped him up quickly, and it was super familiar with his game after he tangled with the Zags often during his Pepperdine days. Ajayi should get the first crack at replacing versatile stud Anton Watson. Ajayi is more of a wing-handler who can play on the perimeter thanks to his gorgeous stroke and ability to attack long closeouts, but he's got a proven knack for rebounding. Gonzaga can use him in post-ups, as a popper in pick-and-rolls or even as the initiator for some ball-screen reps. Ajayi should be a high-level connector for a Gonzaga squad that has National Championship aspirations. Transfer from: Northern Colorado Saint Thomas balled out in the Dalton Knecht role at Northern Colorado. He's a big, physical wing who shot over 67% at the rim last season. That efficiency might come down in the Big Ten, but that aggressiveness has to be maintained. Thomas should settle right into a No. 1B option behind Claude. He'll have a high usage rate, and USC can use him as a post-up weapon or in ball screens. Thomas could also be featured as USC's pseudo-point guard, but his growth as a catch-and-shoot weapon is key. Transfer from: Virginia Tech The 6-10 big man should give Miami's defense some much-needed size on the back line. Kidd's best asset is his low-post dominance. Kidd was one of the top post-up scorers in college basketball last season and he has great hands in the pick-and-roll. Miami smartly added East Carolina transfer sniper Brandon Johnson to this frontcourt to make it even harder to send another big to double-team Kidd. Miami just has a cavalry of shooting surrounding Kidd. Transfer from: Drexel Skilled size is everything for Mark Pope's offense, and a center who can be a playmaker on the perimeter is vital. Williams is not a 3-point shooter, but he can clear open space with screens and dribble hand-offs. He's also an adept passer who had a 17% assist rate this past season at Drexel. Kentucky will also rely heavily on Williams to protect the rim and scoop up boards. The 6-foot-10, 265-pound big man has enough bricks in his britches to handle one-on-one coverage against just about any big man, so Kentucky won't have to send double teams. Playing with incoming sophomore Brandon Garrison might be a blessing in disguise for Williams. Kentucky can keep him fresh, out of foul trouble and his motor should be revving for the 20-to-25 minutes he's on the floor. Seven foot playmaker 🦄12 PTS (5-6 FG) | 6 AST | 5 REB pic.twitter.com/QH3oEW0oR7 Transfer from: Louisville \Huntley-Hatfield is the jewel of the NC State transfer haul. Huntley-Hatfield's tape was impressive amidst a rocky Louisville campaign. He became a double-double threat every night and played with outstanding effort. He's 6-foot-10 and 240 pounds with the ability to play multiple defensive coverages, and Huntley-Hatfield should continue to grow as a floor-stretcher. There's no reason to think he won't be a productive monster for NC State who knows how to feature its big men. Transfer from: Kentucky Bradshaw might make or break Ohio State. If his production matches his potential, the Buckeyes could be one of the best teams in the Big Ten. Bradshaw's ability to stretch the floor would open up the paint for Johnson and Thornton to get to the rack. The former five-star, 7-1 center was also regarded as a big-time rim protector during his high school days. Ohio State is banking on a Kel'el Ware-like bounceback season in a new place with a full bill of health. Transfer from: Tulsa Haggerty is a lean, mean, foul-drawing machine. The Tulsa transfer can put a ton of pressure on the rim, and his floater is a real weapon. And he pitches a tent, starts a fire and calls the free throw line home. Haggerty shot double-digit free throws in 15 games last season. That's a skill. Penny Hardaway needs Haggerty to shoot it better from downtown and find a way to impact winning without super high volume. Haggerty owned a 30% usage rate last season at Tulsa. It was his team. Memphis is loaded with talent. Haggerty's usage might not sniff 30% with Tyrese Hunter, Dain Dainja and Colby Rogers all needing to get theirs. But Haggerty's a heckuva talent who can be one of the engines of this club. Transfer from: FAU Martin is a big, physical 2-guard who will hunt his jumper and is a menace in transition. Martin struggled with injuries a bit last season, but if he's back to full strength, Florida was a smart landing spot for both sides. Florida coach Todd Golden is likely banking on Martin being the Gators' best perimeter defender. Martin gets in some trouble when he tries to create his own offense, but he's awesome in transition, an area that Florida heavily prioritizes. Transfer from: Michigan State Hoggard's strengths are obvious. Hoggard is a very good defender who can lock down just about any perimeter option. He's a terrific playmaker who nearly racked up a 3-to-1, assist-to-turnover ratio this past season. Hoggard shot a serviceable 35% from 3-point range last season, but his issues offensively came inside the arc. For a big, strong guard, Hoggard struggled mightily to finish around the rim and his pull-up jumper went off the rails. Hoggard shot just 5-for-42 on those pull-ups. That almost feels too bad to replicate. Positive regression seems inevitable. Transfer from: South Dakota State Mayo is just a bucket, but his shots will come in different spots at Kansas than they did at South Dakota State. Mayo is expected to move into more of an off-ball role which should unlock more catch-and-shoot opportunities. Mayo drilled 43% of his 96 catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season. Oh, and Mayo is a midrange maestro. That ability to go get a bucket should be a huge stress reliever for a KU offense that needed an extra jolt. Mayo is probably closer to a two-level scorer than a true three-level scorer, but his comfort as a primary scorer/creator at South Dakota State should help him ace a slightly scaled-down role for Kansas. We could get used to this 🎯#Payheed x @zekexmayo pic.twitter.com/RI8yundO7m Transfer from: Villanova Oregon crushed it in the portal and it starts with Bamba. The Villanova transfer is good at a little bit of everything. He shot over 43% on his catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season and he can smartly attack long closeouts. Bamba is capable of handling some on-ball responsibilities as well, and he'll be an impactful defender for the Ducks. Bamba is a plug-and-play, two-way starter who should be a double-digit performer, at minimum. Transfer from: Stanford Stojakovic has excellent bloodlines and needed a fresh start after a rough freshman-year showing at Stanford. The flashes of brilliance were there as an off-ball sniper who is an excellent cutter and can smoothly drive it. When he played with confidence (check the USC film), Stojakovic was a baller. But the dark days were grim. The odds are strong that Stojakovic is going to be a really, really good player one day, but he has to clean up the mechanics on his jumper and continue to improve his body. Similar to Jaylon Tyson, Stojakovic made a wise choice in the portal to go somewhere where he can earn a high usage rate and have the ball in his hands from the jump. Transfer from: Oakland Good things happen when you pair a smart player like Townsend with a smart coach like Tommy Lloyd. The 6-6, 228-pound forward isn't a stretch 4 (he's made 50 3-pointers in 126 games), but he's closer to a wing handler who can constantly create advantages. He's in that Jaime Jaquez-lite mold as an excellent post-up weapon, good cutter, smart decision-maker who will not hurt you. Arizona ranked outside the top-60 nationally in points per possession in halfcourt settings, per Synergy. Not bad, but not great, either. An elite transition offense helped Arizona finish No. 11 overall in offensive efficiency, but there were real pockets when Arizona's offense could get bogged down. Townsend might be part of the solution. Townsend provides another halfcourt hub who can win one-on-one matchups and get to the free throw line. Transfer from: Ohio State Opponents shot just 54% at the rim against Ohio State when Okpara was on the floor. His length, court coverage and rim presence are extremely valuable. Okpara is a willing role player who is an excellent lob threat in pick-and-rolls, but he's not a center you want to run your offense through. Okpara still has work to do to become a reliable post-up scorer, but he should team up well with Zakai Zeigler's pinpoint lobs. Transfer from: Iowa Perkins has been a staple in Iowa's rotation for three years but the leap into being a legitimate First Team, All-Big Ten guy never truly materialized. But the 6-4, 205-pound guard is the most proven piece on this Mizzou roster. He's a very good scorer at two levels. Perkins loves to get to the middle of the floor for a midrange jumper. He's also constantly putting pressure on the rim and getting to the free throw line. Nearly 40% of his shots last season came at the rim, per Synergy, and he averaged over five free throw attempts per game in Big Ten play. His decision-making overall really grew which is encouraging. Perkins finished with a 2.4-to-1, assist-to-turnover ratio. That'll work every single day of the week and twice on Sundays. Transfer from: Kansas State When Kaluma keeps it simple, he can be effective. Kaluma shot a career-best 36% on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season at Kansas State. The 6-foot-7, 225-pound wing is a willing rebounder and has been part of good defenses both at Kansas State and Creighton. Kaluma can be an impactful piece when he attacks straight-line drives, drills spot-up 3s and hunts buckets in transition before the defense gets set. But he gets in so much trouble when he tries to be a top of the scouting report creator. Kaluma had a dreadful, negative assist-to-turnover ratio. He takes tough shots off the dribble and doesn't make 'em. He's yet to record an above-average offensive rating in conference play in each of the last three years. The flashes are there, but eliminating the negative plays will be so important. Transfer from: North Texas Edwards is a bucket. He was the high-usage engine of North Texas' offense, and Edwards finished with fantastic efficiency from downtown and the midrange despite his tape being filled with a ton of tough shots. The 6-foot guard just knows how to score, and a lightning-quick first step makes him such a tough cover. Vanderbilt's decision to pair a defensive-first playmaker like Hoggard with a score-first guard like Edwards looks like smart roster-building. Transfer from: Kentucky The powerful, 6-8 wing will be one of Arkansas' best multi-positional defenders. Thiero has pogo-stick bounce and can be an excellent secondary rim protector. He's probably best-suited guarding bigger wings or forwards, but Thiero can definitely hang on the perimeter and he'll always chip in on the glass. Offensively, he's a connector and a high-energy role player. Thiero is an outstanding cutter and offensive rebounder, but he can also attack long closeouts. Trying to hide your center on Thiero was not a great idea because of his fluid drives. But he needs to finish better at the rim and continue to expand his perimeter game. Thiero is rapidly getting better. He's a good bet to be in Arkansas' closing lineup because of his defense. Transfer from: Texas Cincinnati was an outstanding offensive-rebounding team while also being one of the best rim defenses. Mitchell will fortify those areas even more. The 6-8, 205-pound forward is one of the best athletes in the country. He covers so much ground defensively and racked up a block or a steal in 31 of 34 games last season. Cincinnati can play Mitchell at the 4 next to Aziz Bandaogo and build an iron wall around the rim. Cincinnati will dominate the glass with those two guys on the floor together, even if the floor-spacing is a real question. Mitchell has not made a jump as a shooter yet, but he's a phenomenal play-finisher. Mitchell shot over 77% at the rim and threw down a whopping 55 dunks last season. Mitchell is a legitimate lob threat and an excellent cutter who never stops moving. Maybe most importantly, Cincinnati had a way higher transition rate than Texas. That's money in the bank for Mitchell who can put on a show in the open floor. Transfer from: Dayton One of the best 3-point shooters in the country is joining one of the best offensive schemes for 3-point shooters. Is there truly anything else to say? .@kobybrea is just getting started 😮‍💨13 PTS (5-7 FG, 3-5 3FG) | 2 AST pic.twitter.com/dumTubh5aY Transfer from: Arkansas Gonzaga doesn't have many holes on the roster, but the Zags' staff hit the portal looking for one more get out of jail free card. Insert Battle. The Arkansas transfer won't be asked to shoulder a monster, alpha role, but he can slide into any lineup, whether off the bench or in the starting lineup, and just go get buckets. This is the best ecosystem of Battle's career. He'll give Gonzaga that rim pressure that it certainly needs from its backcourt. Transfer from: Florida Last offseason, Kugel was regarded as one of the top NBA prospects in the SEC, but his sophomore season at Florida was a major disappointment culminating with multiple "DNPs" in the SEC Tournament. Kugel's body language was ... not great. Mississippi State is hopeful a fresh scene can unlock his sky-high potential. The 6-foot-5, 205-pound guard just floats off the ground. He's a fantastic athlete, and that comes alive in transition. But his decision-making has to markedly improve and quickly. While the turnovers were harmful, the shot selection might have been even more detrimental. Kugel can make every shot in the book but that can be a blessing and a curse. This is an upside play by Chris Jans. If it clicks, Kugel can be the best overall player on the team, even better than stud sophomore guard Josh Hubbard. Transfer from: Stanford Angel shot over 43% on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers and over 70% at the rim. That will play all day, every day. The 6-8, 240-pound, fifth-year senior just plays winning basketball. You can post him up against smaller defenders and he'll drag slower-footed bigs onto the perimeter. He's not overly dynamic but the Stanford transfer can knife to the rim and he's a heady cutter. Angel is only additive to everything else Oregon has cooking. Dana Altman found a gem. Transfer from: Tulane James is an elite role player who Jon Scheyer smartly added to this rotation. James is a warrior who rarely came off the floor at Tulane. He's not some high-volume sharpshooter, but 39% on 81 catch-and-shoot 3-pointers will play. He makes defenses pay for leaving him open. But it's all the little things that make James a stud. He's an excellent defender who is absolutely chiseled. He can hound shooters, big wings or lead guards while providing a little secondary rim protection, too. James might not start but he's going to carve out a major role for Duke. Transfer from: Stanford Carlyle was a former prized prospect but his freshman year at Stanford was filled with extreme highs (31 points against Washington State) and gut-wrenching lows (4-for-17 shooting against Colorado). He gives IU a second dynamic lead guard who can go get buckets in pick-and-rolls. He took more off-the-dribble 2-point jumpers (55) than catch-and-shoot 3-pointers (53). Get to the middle of the floor, and make something happen. That's his game. Refining his decision-making is paramount because the turnovers and shot selection were rough last season. Carlyle has a chance to be an excellent player down the road if the jumper sticks and he improves his meager 19% rim rate. He's too fast to let defenses off the hook by settling for pull-ups that often. A sixth-man role could make sense, but Carlyle can earn a spot in the starting (and closing) lineup if he guards his tail off. Transfer from: Toledo Xavier's floor spacing should be immaculate with Maddox and Conwell on the floor together. The Toledo transfer shot over 40% from 3-point range in three of his four seasons at the college ranks. The 6-foot-2, 195-pound guard is just a flamethrower, and he has sneaky bounce when he attacks the rack. Transfer from: Duke Power was buried at Duke, but he will get every opportunity to be a featured piece for Virginia. Power, a former five-star prospect, is a big-time shooter who showed real playmaking abilities in high school. Off-movement shooting is so valuable in Virginia's blocker-mover offense, and Power can do all of that. He's poised to be a productive ACC starter next season, but if Virginia can keep him around for multiple years, he has a chance to be a real star. Transfer from: Oregon State Texas has so many guys who are used to being the featured scorer. There's only one ball, so that could force Pope to change his game to help everyone else. Pope had to be a scorer first for an undermanned Oregon State club, and he did it well. Pope has a phenomenal jumper. He'll give Texas' offense real gravity, but he can be a bit jumper-reliant. He had a very low rim rate last season, but Pope was a sniper both off the catch (38%) and off the bounce (36%). IPope's jumper seems legit. That gives him a high floor. Transfer from: Minnesota Payne is a complete handful. Texas A&M is one of the elite offensive rebounding programs in the country, and the Minnesota transfer had the third-highest offensive rebound rate during Big Ten play. That'll work. He's so powerful and explosive. Payne is an awesome target in pick-and-rolls, and his physicality shows up on the defensive end. Payne plays really, really hard, and there's some intriguing skill starting to develop here too. Payne can occasionally run into problems when he faces up at the elbow and tries to create, but that freelancing ability is fun. He'll make some decent reads, too. He's not just an awesome screen-setting big man who will be a play-finisher, glass-cleaner and rim protector. There's more coming to his game in time. Transfer from: Chicago State Cardet is going to be a big part of the Devin Carter Replacement Plan. The 6-6, Chicago State transfer wing just wants to get to the rack. Over 50% of his shots last season came at the rim and he had a sky-high free throw rate. Playing off two feet will be essential to finish off his drives a bit better. Cardet is capable of getting going from all three levels, but simplifying his game will be key to finding success in a Big East that is so well-scouted If healthy, Bryce Hopkins is Providence's alpha, but Cardet is another capable double-digit scorer who can be the engine of the offense. He's a better shooter than the numbers suggest. He shot over 35% on his catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season, but he rarely played off the ball at Chicago State. Getting freed up for more spot-up opportunities should help Cardet's efficiency rise. Cardet should be an exceptional defender under Kim English who is one of the rising defensive coaches in the game. Transfer from: Omaha Michigan State needed a bucket-getting wing, and Fidler should get the first crack at earning that job. Fidler doesn't beat you with loads of athleticism, but he does a ton of his work before he gets the rock and the jumper is pure. Fidler was much more effective playing off the ball, and Michigan State will continue that trend. Improving as an on-the-move shooter would be huge. Fidler can use his size to rise over smaller defenders, and he uses shot fakes to clear space well and draw fouls. Fidler should be an efficient play-finisher for MSU who could be the answer in late-clock scenarios. Transfer from: Boston College Zackery is only additive and doesn't detract from anything else Clemson has cooking. He's thickly built and should be solid in so many areas. He's a career 40% 3-point shooter on just under three attempts per game. He guards. He takes good shots. Zackery developed into a nice ball-screen initiator with a pick-and-pop big man like Quintin Post at Boston College. Clemson can do some of the same things with Zackery and Ian Schieffelin or Chauncey Wiggins. Transfer from: Vanderbilt Lubin does not have elite length or size, but he will outwork you. The Vanderbilt transfer has a ridiculous motor and attacks the rim with a vengeance. His second-jump burst is real. Lubin grew significantly as a roller, and he'll be a rock-solid, ball-screen partner for UNC's elite backcourt. UNC needed a reliable play-finisher offensively, and Lubin can do all that and then some. He's not some elite back-line defensive anchor, but Lubin should be able to play multiple coverages defensively and hold serve against some bigger 4s and smaller 5s. Transfer from: South Florida Pryor could be the X-Factor for this Louisville offense. Pat Kelsey just desperately needs the South Florida transfer to keep making 3-pointers at a high clip to pull centers away from the rim. Pryor is very comfortable playing in space and attacking long closeouts, but he gets very hard to guard in transition after he grabs-and-goes and attacks defenses who can't get set yet. His playmaking and unselfishness is something. Transfer from: Virginia Milicic is a sharp stretch 4. He shot 38% from 3-point range and that's his path to playing time. But he's not just roaming around the perimeter. Milicic is comfortable handling it and attacking open spaces off the bounce. He finished everything around the rim, and he's a tough cover off the ball. He'll dart in and out of screens, cut baseline, 45-cut and everything in between. Milicic's nose for the ball on the defensive glass should translate. Tennessee will have to adjust some things personnel-wise for Milicic's defense, but he's not a stiff. He should be just fine guarding 4s. Transfer from: Vanderbilt Lawrence is a streaky shooter, but he's best when he's slashing to the tin. Two seasons ago, he shot over 64% at the rim at ridiculously high volume. Everything kinda cratered last season for a Vanderbilt team that splintered, but Lawrence's talent is still obvious. Lawrence is easily the most proven, high-major scorer on this much-improved Georgia roster. For the Dawgs to reach their goals, Lawrence has to regain his form and play like one of the best two-way guards in the SEC again. Transfer from: Michigan UConn has made the big-man platoon a huge part of their roster-construction gameplans, and it's not going anywhere in 2024-25. Samson Johnson and Reed will form a two-headed monster. Johnson is bouncy, athletic and extremely fast. Reed will bring more power. The 6-10, 265-pound big man has been watching plenty of Adama Sanogo tape. That type of physical, low-post monster is such a different archetype compared to Johnson. Reed is an elite rebounder, and he's going to draw fouls because of his activity and pure, raw power. UConn's proven player-development chops should be a huge boon. Transfer from: Ohio State Everything looks better when you shoot 46% from 3-point range on just 62 attempts, but Middleton should head into his sophomore season at Seton Hall with plenty of confidence. the former prized recruit was utilized as an off-ball wing at Ohio State who only had a 15% usage rate. Seton Hall can bump that up a bit, but we'll see just how ready Middleton is to be one of the top guys on the scouting report. If the 3-point stroke is real, Middleton will be a massive piece of this club. Seton Hall coach Shaheen Holloway needs him to stretch the floor, attack long closeouts and be a nasty wing defender. Middleton left Ohio State looking for more. Seton Hall gives him the chance at a huge role. Transfer from: Princeton This is one of the best fits in the portal. Allocco is a pure hooper. The Princeton transfer is so comfortable playing mismatch-hunting basketball, which is a staple of Micah Shrewsberry's game plan. He shot over 40% from downtown on both off-the-dribble 3-pointers and catch-and-shoot treys. He's also super comfortable getting to his midrange jumper or slicing his way to the rim. The decision-making is a nice benefit, too. Allocco has to get stronger to make his drives more impactful. He's also not the most explosive dude on the floor, but the wiggle is real. Allocco is a needle-mover, and Shrewsberry should have some fun cooking up some open looks for him to feast. Transfer from: Yale Wolf's tape is so fun. The Yale product can drop dimes from the middle of the floor, and he shot 35% on 83 3-pointers last season, so you have to respect the jumper. Michigan will likely try to play Wolf next to Goldin. Multiple 7-footers on the floor at the same time could be a little clunky, but both guys are so smart and Wolf's playmaking and shooting might make it work. Wolf isn't quite as intimidating a rim protector as Goldin, but his hands in drop coverage are sticky. He forced numerous deflections at Yale. Wolf is going to be a useful piece next year. He could be a terror in 2025-26 when Goldin exhausts his eligibility. 🐺🐺 pic.twitter.com/6VJAWxmCzA Transfer from: Syracuse Brown is an outstanding multi-positional defender who will help this unit compete to be the best defensive team in the country. Brown was an All-ACC defensive team selection in 2023-24, but he might be even better at Duke now that he doesn't have to bang with centers every single play. Everyone wants to be a switch-everything defender, but Brown actually is one. The Syracuse transfer will help douse so many fires, and his cutting and playmaking off the short roll will be a massive asset to Duke's offensive attack. Brown is another elite role player. Don't be surprised if Brown is a staple of Duke's closing lineup. Transfer from: Tennessee What an addition for Mike Rhoades in Happy Valley. Dilione was expected to have a bigger role at Tennessee last season, but Dalton Knecht stole all the headlines. Dilione now lands at Penn State and could be a phenomenal buy-low spot to get his career back on track. Dilione provides a huge jumbo playmaker who can stuff the stat sheet. On paper, the fit next to Ace Baldwin could be very fun if Dilione's jumper is legit. Baldwin is already a terrific on-ball defender and Dilione can grow into one too. This one has a chance to be a Hunter Sallis-like explosion spot for Penn State. Transfer from: Hofstra Carlos was a two-year starter for a very good Hofstra program, and he'll help fill the Judah Mintz void in Syracuse's backcourt. Carlos was one of the top pass-first, initiator point guards in the portal, and this has every opportunity to be a strong match for both sides. Carlos' ability to stretch the floor should free up the paint for JJ Starling to get more traction on his drives. Carlos is very jump-shot reliant (just 22% of his shots last season came at the rim), but the stroke is pure. Transfer from: Iowa State Well would you look at that, another five-star is transferring to Wake Forest after a disappointing first stop. It's up to Steve Forbes, aka the Transfer Portal Whisperer, to unlock the version of Biliew that never came to fruition at Iowa State. Biliew's freshman-year tape wasn't anything to write home about . He looked completely out of sorts and struggled to find any sort of footing for an Iowa State club that wanted to win big right away. Forbes is betting on the pedigree and a new scene. The former five-star recruit has athletic tools galore, and buffing up the frontcourt athleticism was one of the huge objectives for Wake Forest. Biliew doesn't need to be an offensive star right away, but he can have a huge impact on this team as a highly-active defensive whiz who can douse fires. If Wake Forest wants to win the ACC, it has to get through Duke. Who is the best bet to guard Cooper Flagg? Biliew. Transfer from: Arkansas DePaul has added so much shooting on the perimeter, but it needs someone to break down the defense and get into the paint. Insert Blocker. The Arkansas transfer is the most natural point guard on this roster and he punctured opposing defenses at will last season. He should lead this team in free throw attempts while offering nasty perimeter defense. The former prized recruit has a runway to a major role at DePaul and the roster construction is set up to best maximize his skills and keep the paint clear for his drives. This could end up being a diamond in the rough for DePaul. Transfer from: High Point Learn the name. This one has a chance to be a gem. Miles was one of the top pick-and-roll, bucket-getters in the country last season at High Point, and Porter Moser has a proven hit rate of getting plenty out of transfer-up guards from the lower levels. Miles was efficient in every area. He shot over 65% at the rim, 36% from 3-point range and 50% on his pull-up jumpers. Miles is also a terrific decision-maker. Transfer from: UMass The well-traveled Cross has turned into a heckuva player. He's a good bet to shoot around 35% from 3-point range on over two attempts per game. He's a great cutter, rebounder and playmaker. Cross finds mismatches and knows what to do with 'em. SMU dropped a bag to land Cross (who had a ton of interest from good teams galore), and the fifth-year senior will be worth it. Transfer from: Northern Iowa Born gets the first crack at replacing Colorado State legend Isaiah Stevens. Born isn't the distributor that Stevens was, but he can score that thing. The Northern Iowa transfer is on the doorstep of eclipsing 1,500 career points. Colorado State coach Niko Medved should be able to utilize the lefty sharpshooter in creative ways in the Rams' Princeton-style offense. Born will be one of the Mountain West's best scorers. Transfer from: Ohio State Dayton needed a post-up hub and found it in Key, an Ohio State transfer who was a bucket on the block. Key eats up one-on-one coverage and rapidly improved at finding open shooters when the double-team came his way. Key, a low-post beast, teaming up with Nate Santos, a stretch 4 deadeye, should be a fabulous match for a Dayton squad that intends to chase an A-10 crown. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

Title: Companies Have a Major Challenge Enforcing RTO Mandates

Time Published: 2024-10-28T15:51:56Z
Full Content:
Despite more companies issuing return-to-office (RTO) mandates, the latest challenge those companies face is enforcing them. Companies large and small have issued RTO mandates, with three days in the office becoming the accepted norm. A few, such as Amazon, have issued far stricter policies, requiring employees to be in the office five days a week. According to CBRE’s 2024 Americas Office Occupier Sentiment Survey, the vast majority of companies are failing in their efforts to enforce their office mandates. Approximately 80% of organizations have a return-to-office policy, but only 17% actively enforce these policies. This disconnect between policy and enforcement contributes to the gap between employer expectations and employee behavior: 60% want employees to work in the office three or more days per week, but only 51% of employees are in the office that frequently. Thirty-four percent of respondents anticipate closing this gap by increasing attendance. Space sharing remains top of mind to align with new utilization patterns and optimize portfolios. Interestingly, the number of companies with an RTO policy increased only slightly from 2023, going from 78% to the current 80%. Even more telling, barely more than half of companies measure compliance with their mandates, and very few enforce it. For the companies with an office attendance policy, measurement and enforcement strategies vary. Fifty-one percent of respondents with a policy report that they mandate attendance, but only about 45% measure it, and only 17% consistently enforce it. This disconnect is a factor in the continued gap between employer expectations and employee behavior. While policies are important for clarification and guidance, they are not guaranteed to drive compliance, especially without enforcement. CBRE’s findings indicate that trying to force compliance without understanding the underlying opposition will only lead to negative outcomes. At the same time, holding employees accountable to mandates can create negative outcomes if employers don’t strive to understand, and remedy, the barriers blocking more frequent office utilization. Employers who remain frustrated with lack of office utilization should explore the underlying challenge in order to deploy the right lever for change. Despite some companies’ insistence on returning to pre-pandemic norms, data increasingly shows that hybrid work is the future and RTO mandates are often disastrous. Some governments, such as the UK, are even endorsing remote work, saying companies need to stop being obsessed with a “culture of presenteeism.” Amazon is already learning this, with a recent Blind survey of 2,585 Amazon employees showing that 73% of them were considering looking for another job. Some 80% of those surveyed said they already knew of peers who were looking for another job, while 32% knew of someone who had already quit. Some Amazon employees have stated they have no intention of complying with the RTO mandate, opting to be fired instead. Trust is at the heart of the issue, and companies are reaping what they’ve sown over the last few years, beginning with the mass layoffs that hit the tech industry during the waning days of the pandemic. As we wrote then, companies were destroying the trust of their employees, something that would eventually come back to haunt them. We quoted an article by Business Insider’s Sawdah Bhaimiya. “Every time I see a notice in the news that such and such technology company has cut X percentage of their workforce, I don’t forget that,” Danny Allen, chief technology officer at software firm Veeam, told Bhaimiya at the time. “So you’re sending a message that also has a brand impact that you don’t necessarily want to be associated with. “Employees remember and people looking for jobs remember how organizations acted during the economic downturn.” Allen went on to explain exactly how the layoffs would hurt companies, with the second way being the most important in this context. “One is simply the loss of innovation, cutting resources,” said Allen. “You’re cutting your investment in future technology, that’s number one. Number two, when you cut 10% of your workforce, you’re sending the message to your employees that we care more about money than we do about you. “And employees have a long memory, so if you’re cutting people that uncertainty is very disconcerting.” Amazon is a good example of exactly the phenomenon Allen described, with many of those reluctant to return to the office citing a lack of trust in the company’s leadership, a lack of trust exacerbated by broken promises about the future of remote work. “I was not complying,” an employee named Ben said about the company’s previous three-day-a-week mandate, citing the three-hour commute he faced as the reason. “I decided not to make life choices as Amazon can fire me at will anyway, and I do not want to make long-term life changes because some manager decided I should start going to the office when I was hired virtual and promised I could work from wherever I want,” he added. That last part of Ben’s statement is critical, as doesn’t trust any sacrifice made for his job will pay off over the long haul. His sentiments were echoed by others. “My months of struggling to make three days a week are over, and I know that my time at Amazon has to end,” an employee named Laura said after the five-day mandate. “Honestly, I’ve lost so much trust in Amazon leadership at this point,” she adds. “I’ve been updating my resume and portfolio, and rage applying to new jobs on LinkedIn.” As Ben and Laura’s statements illustrate, Amazon’s leadership has lost the trust of its employees, first with mass layoffs that underscored the transience of jobs in the tech industry. Trust was further eroded by promising that some roles would remain remote or hybrid, only to then renege on those promises and demand employees return to the office, even requiring them to relocate if necessary to comply. As long as companies continue to ignore the data—which shows that remote/hybrid employees work harder and are more productive—companies will continue to struggle with efforts to force compliance with RTO mandates. Companies that do enforce them will reap the results, losing top employees and struggling to attract new talent.

AbbVie (ABBV-0.11%) announced Monday that it is buying Aliada Therapeutics for $1.4 billion. The deal includes Aliada’s lead drug candidate ALIA-1758, an experimental antibody being tested for treating Alzheimer’s disease. The pharma giant said the move is part of its strategy to strengthen its neuroscience pipeline. Earlier this year, AbbVie halted development on its own Alzheimer’s treatment as a standalone therapy. “Neuroscience is one of our key growth areas and we are committed to driving innovation in this field to address critical unmet needs for patients living with seriously debilitating neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease,” said AbbVie chief scientific officer Roopal Thakkar in a press release. ALIA-1758 targets amyloid beta, a brain protein believed to be a cause of Alzheimer’s. The drug will also use make use of Aliada’s drug delivery technology, which helps move molecules across the blood-brain barrier for better efficacy. “Many promising CNS-targeted [central nervous system] therapies fail to reach late-stage trials due to their inability to cross the blood-brain barrier,” Aliada chief medical officer Michael Ryan said in the release. “Our MODEL platform addresses this challenge directly, efficiently delivering targeted drugs and potentially transforming how we treat neurological diseases.” The deal comes as the other pharma companies are working on their own new Alzheimer’s medications. Both Eli Lilly and Biogen have recently launched new Alzheimer’s drugs. Eli Lilly (LLY+0.76%) is also conducting a phase 3 clinical trial on another drug targeting amyloid beta. Recent studies have also found that GLP-1 treatments, the class of diabetes and weight loss drugs that includes Novo Nordisk’s (NVO-0.35%) Ozempic and Wegovy, are linked to a lower risk of Alzheimer’s. Novo Nordisk is currently conducting two clinical trials testing semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, to see if the drug has an effect on early Alzheimer’s disease.

Title: Dragon Age: The Veilguard Review – BioWare’s Back
URL: https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/
Time Published: 2024-10-28T15:00:45Z
Full Content:
It would be the euphemism of the year to say that for BioWare, a lot is riding on Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The once revered maker of roleplaying games like Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Jade Empire, Mass Effect, and Dragon Age has stumbled severely with its last two games, Mass Effect Andromeda and Anthem. The latest installment in the sci-fi franchise wasn't bad, but it wasn't great, either, and it didn't sell as well as BioWare's parent company, Electronic Arts, wanted. The real catastrophe was Anthem, though. The new intellectual property was designed as a live service game that would be updated for ten years post-launch, but it ended up getting only a couple of patches before the overwhelmingly negative reception from critics and fans alike essentially halted that content roadmap. For a while, BioWare attempted to concoct a major overhaul (dubbed Anthem Next) that could resurrect Anthem, but EA ultimately chose to abandon the project and let the studio focus on its core franchises: Dragon Age and Mass Effect. Anthem also had a big influence on the fourth Dragon Age game. At some point, the idea was to make another live service game with coop, and reporter Jason Schreier even said the developers internally referred to it as 'Anthem with dragons.' Luckily, the magnitude of Anthem's failure, combined with the success of Respawn's Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, proved to Electronic Arts that single player games could still be financially successful, convincing the publisher to allow BioWare to focus solely on the campaign and drop multiplayer altogether. By mere syllogism, one could say that Respawn's Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order has effectively saved the beloved Canadian studio. Many fans feared a third unsuccessful game could persuade Electronic Arts to either sell BioWare or shut it down altogether, and with 2024 proving a terrible year for layoffs and studio closures, this was a concrete possibility. Of course, what Respawn's game actually did was give BioWare a chance, which they could still have squandered. I'm happy to share, though, that they did not. Dragon Age: The Veilguard is a great ride that any fan of the studio's games will be able to enjoy. The key part is that the developers successfully invested in their own strengths rather than trying to follow the latest trends even if they were out of their expertise. I'm referring specifically to the decision to abandon the open world-like zones of Dragon Age: Inquisition (and Mass Effect Andromeda) in favor of a more old-school approach, reminiscent of the earlier installments in those franchises. Nowadays, it's getting harder and harder to find games that do not offer open world design. Even indie developers, thanks to game-making tools like Epic's Unreal Engine, can do it relatively easily, and many publishers think of it as a definite plus for any upcoming game. It must have taken BioWare a considerable amount of convincing to get EA to approve the idea, but they did it, and Dragon Age: The Veilguard is definitely better off like this. I have to admit I was skeptical at first, as I am a big advocate of open-world games in general; however, this game proved to me that there's a place for mission-based Western RPGs going forward. For one thing, it goes a long way toward ensuring the game does not overstay its welcome, as everything is more or less connected to the story and the characters. It was not so in Inquisition, and content bloat is indeed an issue in many open world games save for the very best ones (and even those do have some side content that is just not on the same level as the rest, which developers are forced to add just to populate all the world). That is not to say Dragon Age: The Veilguard doesn't have relatively straightforward quests, but they are still grounded in the same narrative tissue, making them feel like part of one cohesive story. Following the few initial missions, the player navigates Thedas by accessing the world map and traveling with the Eluvians, the magical mirrors made by ancient elves that allow long-distance travel. Access to the Eluvians may come and go depending on progress (you'll have to unlock some) and story (in some cases, you must head to a specific area just for one mission, and the game will unlock the Eluvian for you). Still, some options remain available for most of the game, allowing players to revisit the same zone multiple times. It's a good thing, too, because there's actually a fair amount of exploration in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Make no mistake, this is no Elder Scrolls, and you won't find NPCs going on about their lives as in an open world game that simulates real life. Rather, BioWare chose the old-school approach first popularized by the Metroidvania genre: there's a ton of loot and secrets hidden behind puzzles and companion abilities, so you will have plenty of reason to return to exploration regions like the Arlathan Forest, Minrathous, Rivain, the Necropolis Halls, Treviso, the Hossberg Wetlands, and the Crossroads beyond just quests. If you want to make the most out of that exploration feeling, it might be a good idea to remove the mini-map, which is one of several tweaks allowed within the accessibility options. Would I have preferred more expansive zones? Sure, but they may have come at the cost of something else. Given the quality of the final game, I'm happy with the tradeoff. By the way, prepare yourselves to open countless chests and collect innumerable resources lying around, even in the most linear missions, up to the very final one. And remember: break any box or vase you see in the environments, because they will yield resources that can be used or sold to vendors. Those elements may be a bit trite, but there's a reason they have worked for decades: they make the player feel good, and that's still true to this day. Pretty much the same happens in some of the most acclaimed games of the recent past, such as Sony Santa Monica's God of War Norse saga. Overall, I finished all the missions in the game (save for two particularly challenging puzzles) in 78 and a half hours, not far at all from the 80-hour mark BioWare promised in the review guide. I would say it's almost perfect for a mission-based RPG: quite meaty but about half as long as the gargantuan Baldur's Gate 3, which perhaps will make it more replayable. Granted, if you wish to complete it quicker, you can absolutely do it - the main path is said to be around 35 to 40 hours. One of the main areas of innovation for Dragon Age: The Veilguard is in its combat system. Whereas the previous titles featured a larger party of four companions and allowed players to take direct control of the companions, this one sticks to a party of three and only lets you move around as the player character, just like in the Mass Effect series. Moreover, players have to choose three active abilities and an ultimate for their character plus three abilities per companion, whereas Inquisition featured way more selectable abilities in combat. This caused concerns among fans that the franchise's trademark tactical element would be lost or diminished. However, that's not the case at all. First and foremost, as the developers had already disclosed prior to launch, several abilities have been baked into the core moveset of each class (Warrior, Mage, and Rogue) and do not count toward that same pool of abilities. For example, the Mage can side-step attacks or Fade-step for a longer dodge by double tapping the same button; they can perform a sprint attack or a jump attack with both light and heavy attack buttons; they can charge light attacks, heavy attacks, and ranged attacks by holding the respective buttons. There are also different mechanics based on the weapon you're using, which can be switched at all times in combat: while the staff lets you create a defensive shield that is maintained as long as you have mana, the dagger and orb are more geared toward a melee type of character who must parry at the right time to be effective. Dagger and orb also have unique mechanics called Arcane Marks, which are applied to the enemy with light attacks; once you get to three hits, you apply an Arcane Bomb, which can be triggered with a heavy attack for heavy damage. This is just the very basics. Most of these attacks and moves can be augmented through gear and talents; for example, the Greater Passive downfall turns every jump attack on knocked-down foes into a critical hit. The Trait Fade Strike lets you perform a powerful follow-up attack after Fade-stepping; Imbued Defense provides the Shocking Weapons buff (+25% weapon damage) after performing a Perfect Defense, while Return Fire lets you perform a quick counterattack after the aforementioned Perfect Defense. And this is just for the core moveset; there are as many traits and passives that work on the active abilities and other aspects of your build. On that note, did I say there are also Runes? You can equip three of those at a time (though activating one sets off a shared cooldown) and they can be extremely useful depending on the situation. Examples include freezing or knocking down all nearby enemies, losing all mana to get a big heal, instantly refreshing your or your companion's ability cooldowns, greatly enhancing the efficacy of your next ability, and more. I unlocked twenty-four runes during my time with the game, and each comes with a passive and an active effect to trigger at the right time. As someone whose favorite genre is RPGs (and MMORPGs), I can safely state that Dragon Age: The Veilguard offers an impressive amount of depth in its build creation. Best of all, skill points can be refunded for free whenever outside of combat, allowing users free reign to tinker around and create their favorite build synergies with a great many options at their disposal. That includes companions, by the way, who are still very important - far more than in any Mass Effect game, I'd say, when it comes to combat. While their skill trees are not as extensive, they still offer several options that players would be wise to carefully evaluate depending on their play style. There are so many buffs and debuffs to consider, not to mention each enemy's vulnerability and resistances, which you can check at any time in combat by pausing the action and bringing up the ability wheel. That's where you can tell each companion what to do against which target, largely preserving the core tactical element of Dragon Age. It may be different on the lower difficulties, but when playing on Underdog (the second-toughest difficulty after Nightmare, which, however, locks you into that difficulty when beginning a playthrough), pausing the action to think about what to do and properly order the companions around was instrumental to say the least, especially to set up the detonation combos, which work by applying and then triggering an effect like Weakened, Sundered, or Overwhelmed on a target. Dragon Age: The Veilguard is no Dark Souls, but its encounter design is excellent and it offers a worthy challenge even to experienced action and RPG players. There are some fantastic boss fights in the game, both in terms of spectacle and mechanics, forcing you to grow your character and perhaps change your build a bit, as well as learn how to counter the boss's moves as in any great action game. There is a bit of a catch in that companions do not actually take damage - they are effectively invulnerable in combat. That said, enemies do attack them from time to time, and two of them offer specific taunt abilities to get the attention off you (there's also a Rune that diverts enemies to the rest of the party for a short while). This may irk those who yearn for realistic fights, but in practice, it did not bother me at all. The game was clearly designed around this limitation (probably because they wanted to avoid the issue where they died all the time and forced the player to revive them over and over again) and I did not feel it negatively impacted Veilguard. In fact, the changes made compared to Inquisition's middling combat are almost entirely for the better. Dragon Age: The Veilguard has an outstanding combat system that finds the perfect balance between action and tactics, giving it a unique identity in the RPG genre. BioWare's games have always been narrative-driven, and this one is no exception. The game follows directly on the events seen in Inquisition and its Trespasser DLC with a ten-year gap (just like in real life), and it can be considered the culmination of storylines that have been in motion for a long time in the series. Dragon Age lore aficionados will find several earth-shattering revelations that answer some long-standing questions. Effectively, this game closes one chapter of the overarching world narrative, and the next installment will inevitably have to be centered around different themes and characters. For this reason, those who played previous installments and know about the lore will get the most enjoyment, although it is not a barrier to newcomers. While creating the player character (the character creator is very robust, although not the most complex I've seen in a game), the game also lets you create the Inquisitor, the protagonist of the previous game, and choose how a few key events from Inquisition unfolded. Having choices and consequences reverberate throughout their games has also characterized the studio's previous work, especially in Mass Effect and Dragon Age. Again, Veilguard does not disappoint in this area, either. Early on, there will be a major decision to make: the villains are attacking two cities at once, and you cannot be there for both. Each city is tied to one of the companions, and the 'forgotten' city and companion will be transformed in a way. The companion will become ineligible for some time as they deal with the fallout, and when they come back, they will be 'hardened', empowering their damage abilities while closing down their healing ones as they are now hellbent on vengeance. This is an interesting system, both narratively and mechanically, so it's a shame that it does not seem to apply to the other companions as well. Other than that, you will guide the companions in their personal quests through harrowing times of acceptance and personal struggles, with companion quests ranging from relaxed hangouts to sprawling missions that lead to complex boss fights. Seeing a companion through the entire personal quest is not only fulfilling from a storyline perspective, it will also allow you to maximize the bond with them, level them up, and elevate them to Hero of the Veilguard, a status that empowers their abilities and makes them more likely to survive the final fight. That's really where most of the choices and efforts made throughout the whole game come to fruition. Allowing each of the companions to solve their conflicts and each of the factions to be as strong as possible is a big factor in attaining the best possible ending, although there are some choices to make even in the final fight, such as sending the right companion to accomplish a certain task. Overall, the writing in Dragon Age: The Veilguard is great, and the voiceover and tech improvements (mainly facial animations, eyes, and the amazing hair) also help a great deal with the presentation. Just do not expect to act as a villain or even just drive away companions. While in some instances a certain dialogue option led to a companion disapproving, those were so far and few between to not actually matter. This is not that kind of RPG - you're supposed to be a hero. Companions can be befriended and romanced, as in most previous BioWare titles. In my experience, the romance was a slow but steady buildup, though that may depend on the character, and it's fine by itself since it felt good when it finally happened. There's practically no nudity to speak of, anyway, so if you were hoping for steamy sex scenes like in Baldur's Gate 3, you're out of luck. Also, a minor criticism regarding cutscenes is that most of the time, companions do not intervene when talking to other NPCs, even when it would be entirely appropriate for them to do so (for instance, when talking with the leaders of the resistance of their city of provenance). Baldur's Gate 3 and Starfield, on the other hand, featured a lot of instances where companions interjected, making conversations feel more lively and realistic. Granted, there's still a lot of great banter between companions themselves, and you won't miss on any of that just because you've suddenly entered combat - they are now smart enough to resume that talk once things have settled down. Dragon Age: The Veilguard runs on the Frostbite engine, just like the last three games made by the studio. Much has been written on the hardships encountered by the BioWare developers as they attempted to tame an engine originally made for shooter games. In the lead-up to the release, the developers mentioned that they had finally learned how to best use Frostbite. That may be the case, but the performance is honestly underwhelming. I played on a PC with nearly the best combination of CPU and GPU one money can buy (an AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090), and yet I had to deal with considerable stuttering throughout it all. That's even with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance mode (upscaling from 1080p to 4K) and DLSS Frame Generation enabled, not to mention the optimized Game Ready driver installed. The only way to reduce those stutters was to essentially remove ray tracing, or rather, switch to the 'RT Selective' option, which only applies ray traced reflections and ambient occlusion to specific areas of the game that best showcase the respective effects. Even so, they were not eliminated and occurred regularly. Those were not shader stutters, by the way. The game compiles shaders the first time you launch it, recompiles them if you change drivers, and verifies them anyway each time before loading the menu. They had to be traversal stutters, as we're used to seeing with Unreal Engine games. However, while Dragon Age: The Veilguard looks good, it doesn't compare to the latest triple-A Unreal Engine releases. Honestly, it might be worth it for EA to allow BioWare to use Unreal Engine, just like Respawn, going forward. I also had to contend with a bug for my whole playthrough: when launching the game with HDR enabled and DLSS Frame Generation enabled, there were flickering skies until I turned off and then on again DLSS FG. On the upside, HDR was well implemented, which is unfortunately rare. From a visual standpoint, the game succeeds in providing many different biomes to explore as the party treks across Northern Thedas, fulfilling BioWare's promise to bring players to more locations than ever before. The environments generally look great, while the characters are a bit more of a hit-and-miss in that some are almost photorealistic and others look more stylized. In that regard, more uniformity would have been ideal. Reviewed on PC (code provided by the publisher). With Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has largely returned to its roots, casting aside the temptations of open world and/or live service games. Instead, Veilguard is a great mission-based RPGs with a memorable story that will leave Dragon Age fans enthralled by the revelations, an awesome combat system that perfectly blends action and tactics, and lots of loot and secrets to uncover through its 80-hour playthrough.

Title: S&P 500's era of hot stock market returns is over, Goldman Sachs says
URL: https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/4273999/posts

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/28/2024 7:51:55 AM PDT by SeekAndFind For the last 15 years, all you've needed to do to achieve double-digit returns on your money was park it in an S&P 500 index fund, reinvest dividends, and forget about it. That happy ride may be over, according to a new note from Goldman Sachs that has Wall Street abuzz.The big picture: The S&P is on track to return only about 3% a year in the coming decade, Goldman's portfolio strategy group estimates. Compare that to 13% average annual returns over the last ten years.Goldman's forecast implies the S&P — the benchmark index tracked by many of the world's most popular investment vehicles — is more likely than not to have lower returns than U.S. Treasury securities (72% odds) and could even deliver returns lower than inflation (33% odds) through 2034.State of play: The forecast incorporates some of the standard variables portfolio strategists look at to project future returns — price-to-earnings-ratios and interest rates, primarily.

"As sales growth and profitability for the largest stocks in an index decelerate, earnings growth and therefore returns for the overall index will also decelerate."Data: Yahoo Finance; Chart: Axios VisualsWhile the Goldman note has received lots of attention, the core idea — that subpar returns are likely ahead for the biggest U.S. stocks — is so widespread as to be practically conventional wisdom among those who analyze asset allocation.For example, Vanguard routinely updates its projected returns on different asset classes and currently only anticipates 3% to 5% returns for large-cap U.S. stocks (i.e., the S&P 500) over the coming decade.Vanguard sees substantially better returns ahead on value stocks, small caps, Real Estate Investment Trusts, and international stocks.Between the lines: The flip side of the explosive growth in valuations of U.S. mega-caps over the last 15 years is that pretty much everything else, with more modest returns in that time, still has valuations that offer meaningful upside.Those of us who studied our Modern Portfolio Theory and built a portfolio strategically diversified based on factors like geography and company size have suffered subpar returns over the last 15 years relative to people who just piled everything into the S&P.In effect, the Goldman and similar forecasts are a prediction that the worm has turned, and the decade ahead will reward that diversification.Yes, but: Maybe the AI revolution will involve winner-take-all effects and such massive capital spending needs that the winners of the last decade will also be the winners of the next decade, propelling the S&P much higher despite historical warning signs.The bottom line: In deciding whether to go all-in on the S&P or diversify your stock investment more among value-oriented, smaller, and international companies, you are implicitly betting on one of those narratives.

If you extend the index backward to 1930 (which market analysts often do), the average is even better, around 11%. And the index is up 23% this year with two months to go. How Goldman's Prediction Compares to Other Decades - Distribution of S&P 500 annualized 10-year returns since 1930 So an anemic average return of 3% over the next 10 years would be a kind of lost decade for equities. Historically, we've only seen extended periods of such low returns after crises like the Great Depression and the 1970s oil shocks. If Goldman is right, investors would be better off parking their entire portfolio in risk-free Treasuries. Right now the 10-year Treasury yield is hovering around 4.2%. How did Goldman produce such a lousy prediction? Goldman Sachs Chief Equity Strategist David Kostin, who authored the dour report, included many factors in his calculations - ranging from interest rates to return on equity to potential future recessions. But his two major problems for equities over the next decade are market concentration and valuations. He says the stock market is too concentrated in a few stocks, and stocks are too expensive overall. He's not totally wrong about that... For valuations, Kostin's team uses the cyclically adjusted PE multiple, which is 38 times earnings, one of the highest valuations of the last century. As for concentration, the report points out that the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 comprise 36% of its entire market capitalization. In other words, 2% of the companies in the index account for more than a third of the index's market cap. (Think of the Magnificent Sevens stocks here). Historically, when the market has a very high valuation and is narrowly concentrated, it underperforms over the next decade. So Kostin has a point. Yet there are many factors that would suggest his forecast could be off the mark... by a lot. So, the question is, should investors run for the hills yet? Let's start with earnings. S&P 500 earnings are predicted to rise by double digits in 2025 and 2026. And as Chief Investment Strategist Alexander Green of the Oxford Group periodically reminds us, earnings are the best indicator of where share prices will go in the medium to long term, certainly over a decade. I would also point to rising productivity in the economy. The United States leads the world in productivity growth. In fact, U.S. labor productivity is up a whopping 70% since 1990. That means that every year U.S. companies are generating more output with less labor (typically their biggest expense). Those numbers only look to accelerate as a host of new technologies - and artificial intelligence in particular - are likely to raise productivity growth even more in the years ahead. And productivity is the key to rising living standards, lower inflation, higher corporate profits, and, ultimately, rising share prices. Not to mention... there's a fundamental problem with long-term predictions like the one Goldman produced last week... They require far too many assumptions to be taken seriously. And they don't account for other factors - oil shocks and wars and other unforeseeable events, as well as inflationary policies. The way to wealth is through identifying companies that are poised to grow revenue and earnings, capture market share, and become more profitable over time. And in the most immediate future, the coming election could have a huge effect on your wealth. 3 posted on 10/28/2024 7:59:23 AM PDT by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind You can read as many “predictions” on the stock market as you have time to read.

"As sales growth and profitability for the largest stocks in an index decelerate, earnings growth and therefore returns for the overall index will also decelerate."Data: Yahoo Finance; Chart: Axios VisualsWhile the Goldman note has received lots of attention, the core idea — that subpar returns are likely ahead for the biggest U.S. stocks — is so widespread as to be practically conventional wisdom among those who analyze asset allocation.For example, Vanguard routinely updates its projected returns on different asset classes and currently only anticipates 3% to 5% returns for large-cap U.S. stocks (i.e., the S&P 500) over the coming decade.Vanguard sees substantially better returns ahead on value stocks, small caps, Real Estate Investment Trusts, and international stocks.Between the lines: The flip side of the explosive growth in valuations of U.S. mega-caps over the last 15 years is that pretty much everything else, with more modest returns in that time, still has valuations that offer meaningful upside.Those of us who studied our Modern Portfolio Theory and built a portfolio strategically diversified based on factors like geography and company size have suffered subpar returns over the last 15 years relative to people who just piled everything into the S&P.In effect, the Goldman and similar forecasts are a prediction that the worm has turned, and the decade ahead will reward that diversification.Yes, but: Maybe the AI revolution will involve winner-take-all effects and such massive capital spending needs that the winners of the last decade will also be the winners of the next decade, propelling the S&P much higher despite historical warning signs.The bottom line: In deciding whether to go all-in on the S&P or diversify your stock investment more among value-oriented, smaller, and international companies, you are implicitly betting on one of those narratives.

If you extend the index backward to 1930 (which market analysts often do), the average is even better, around 11%. And the index is up 23% this year with two months to go. How Goldman's Prediction Compares to Other Decades - Distribution of S&P 500 annualized 10-year returns since 1930 So an anemic average return of 3% over the next 10 years would be a kind of lost decade for equities. Historically, we've only seen extended periods of such low returns after crises like the Great Depression and the 1970s oil shocks. If Goldman is right, investors would be better off parking their entire portfolio in risk-free Treasuries. Right now the 10-year Treasury yield is hovering around 4.2%. How did Goldman produce such a lousy prediction? Goldman Sachs Chief Equity Strategist David Kostin, who authored the dour report, included many factors in his calculations - ranging from interest rates to return on equity to potential future recessions. But his two major problems for equities over the next decade are market concentration and valuations. He says the stock market is too concentrated in a few stocks, and stocks are too expensive overall. He's not totally wrong about that... For valuations, Kostin's team uses the cyclically adjusted PE multiple, which is 38 times earnings, one of the highest valuations of the last century. As for concentration, the report points out that the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 comprise 36% of its entire market capitalization. In other words, 2% of the companies in the index account for more than a third of the index's market cap. (Think of the Magnificent Sevens stocks here). Historically, when the market has a very high valuation and is narrowly concentrated, it underperforms over the next decade. So Kostin has a point. Yet there are many factors that would suggest his forecast could be off the mark... by a lot. So, the question is, should investors run for the hills yet? Let's start with earnings. S&P 500 earnings are predicted to rise by double digits in 2025 and 2026. And as Chief Investment Strategist Alexander Green of the Oxford Group periodically reminds us, earnings are the best indicator of where share prices will go in the medium to long term, certainly over a decade. I would also point to rising productivity in the economy. The United States leads the world in productivity growth. In fact, U.S. labor productivity is up a whopping 70% since 1990. That means that every year U.S. companies are generating more output with less labor (typically their biggest expense). Those numbers only look to accelerate as a host of new technologies - and artificial intelligence in particular - are likely to raise productivity growth even more in the years ahead. And productivity is the key to rising living standards, lower inflation, higher corporate profits, and, ultimately, rising share prices. Not to mention... there's a fundamental problem with long-term predictions like the one Goldman produced last week... They require far too many assumptions to be taken seriously. And they don't account for other factors - oil shocks and wars and other unforeseeable events, as well as inflationary policies. The way to wealth is through identifying companies that are poised to grow revenue and earnings, capture market share, and become more profitable over time. And in the most immediate future, the coming election could have a huge effect on your wealth. 3 posted on 10/28/2024 7:59:23 AM PDT by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind You can read as many “predictions” on the stock market as you have time to read.

If Goldman is right, investors would be better off parking their entire portfolio in risk-free Treasuries. Right now the 10-year Treasury yield is hovering around 4.2%. How did Goldman produce such a lousy prediction? Goldman Sachs Chief Equity Strategist David Kostin, who authored the dour report, included many factors in his calculations - ranging from interest rates to return on equity to potential future recessions. But his two major problems for equities over the next decade are market concentration and valuations. He says the stock market is too concentrated in a few stocks, and stocks are too expensive overall. He's not totally wrong about that... For valuations, Kostin's team uses the cyclically adjusted PE multiple, which is 38 times earnings, one of the highest valuations of the last century. As for concentration, the report points out that the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 comprise 36% of its entire market capitalization. In other words, 2% of the companies in the index account for more than a third of the index's market cap. (Think of the Magnificent Sevens stocks here). Historically, when the market has a very high valuation and is narrowly concentrated, it underperforms over the next decade. So Kostin has a point. Yet there are many factors that would suggest his forecast could be off the mark... by a lot. So, the question is, should investors run for the hills yet? Let's start with earnings. S&P 500 earnings are predicted to rise by double digits in 2025 and 2026. And as Chief Investment Strategist Alexander Green of the Oxford Group periodically reminds us, earnings are the best indicator of where share prices will go in the medium to long term, certainly over a decade. I would also point to rising productivity in the economy. The United States leads the world in productivity growth. In fact, U.S. labor productivity is up a whopping 70% since 1990. That means that every year U.S. companies are generating more output with less labor (typically their biggest expense). Those numbers only look to accelerate as a host of new technologies - and artificial intelligence in particular - are likely to raise productivity growth even more in the years ahead. And productivity is the key to rising living standards, lower inflation, higher corporate profits, and, ultimately, rising share prices. Not to mention... there's a fundamental problem with long-term predictions like the one Goldman produced last week... They require far too many assumptions to be taken seriously. And they don't account for other factors - oil shocks and wars and other unforeseeable events, as well as inflationary policies. The way to wealth is through identifying companies that are poised to grow revenue and earnings, capture market share, and become more profitable over time. And in the most immediate future, the coming election could have a huge effect on your wealth. 3 posted on 10/28/2024 7:59:23 AM PDT by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind You can read as many “predictions” on the stock market as you have time to read.

If you extend the index backward to 1930 (which market analysts often do), the average is even better, around 11%. And the index is up 23% this year with two months to go. How Goldman's Prediction Compares to Other Decades - Distribution of S&P 500 annualized 10-year returns since 1930 So an anemic average return of 3% over the next 10 years would be a kind of lost decade for equities. Historically, we've only seen extended periods of such low returns after crises like the Great Depression and the 1970s oil shocks. If Goldman is right, investors would be better off parking their entire portfolio in risk-free Treasuries. Right now the 10-year Treasury yield is hovering around 4.2%. How did Goldman produce such a lousy prediction? Goldman Sachs Chief Equity Strategist David Kostin, who authored the dour report, included many factors in his calculations - ranging from interest rates to return on equity to potential future recessions. But his two major problems for equities over the next decade are market concentration and valuations. He says the stock market is too concentrated in a few stocks, and stocks are too expensive overall. He's not totally wrong about that... For valuations, Kostin's team uses the cyclically adjusted PE multiple, which is 38 times earnings, one of the highest valuations of the last century. As for concentration, the report points out that the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 comprise 36% of its entire market capitalization. In other words, 2% of the companies in the index account for more than a third of the index's market cap. (Think of the Magnificent Sevens stocks here). Historically, when the market has a very high valuation and is narrowly concentrated, it underperforms over the next decade. So Kostin has a point. Yet there are many factors that would suggest his forecast could be off the mark... by a lot. So, the question is, should investors run for the hills yet? Let's start with earnings. S&P 500 earnings are predicted to rise by double digits in 2025 and 2026. And as Chief Investment Strategist Alexander Green of the Oxford Group periodically reminds us, earnings are the best indicator of where share prices will go in the medium to long term, certainly over a decade. I would also point to rising productivity in the economy. The United States leads the world in productivity growth. In fact, U.S. labor productivity is up a whopping 70% since 1990. That means that every year U.S. companies are generating more output with less labor (typically their biggest expense). Those numbers only look to accelerate as a host of new technologies - and artificial intelligence in particular - are likely to raise productivity growth even more in the years ahead. And productivity is the key to rising living standards, lower inflation, higher corporate profits, and, ultimately, rising share prices. Not to mention... there's a fundamental problem with long-term predictions like the one Goldman produced last week... They require far too many assumptions to be taken seriously. And they don't account for other factors - oil shocks and wars and other unforeseeable events, as well as inflationary policies. The way to wealth is through identifying companies that are poised to grow revenue and earnings, capture market share, and become more profitable over time. And in the most immediate future, the coming election could have a huge effect on your wealth. 3 posted on 10/28/2024 7:59:23 AM PDT by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind You can read as many “predictions” on the stock market as you have time to read.

Title: S&P 500's era of hot stock market returns is over, Goldman Sachs says

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/28/2024 7:51:55 AM PDT by SeekAndFind For the last 15 years, all you've needed to do to achieve double-digit returns on your money was park it in an S&P 500 index fund, reinvest dividends, and forget about it. That happy ride may be over, according to a new note from Goldman Sachs that has Wall Street abuzz.The big picture: The S&P is on track to return only about 3% a year in the coming decade, Goldman's portfolio strategy group estimates. Compare that to 13% average annual returns over the last ten years.Goldman's forecast implies the S&P — the benchmark index tracked by many of the world's most popular investment vehicles — is more likely than not to have lower returns than U.S. Treasury securities (72% odds) and could even deliver returns lower than inflation (33% odds) through 2034.State of play: The forecast incorporates some of the standard variables portfolio strategists look at to project future returns — price-to-earnings-ratios and interest rates, primarily. But much of the subpar projection is rooted in the extraordinary concentration of the recent stock market runup.Stocks of a handful of fast-growing, highly profitable tech giants that are investing heavily in artificial intelligence — Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Meta — increasingly are the S&P.The index may be meant to contain 500 stocks, but those plus Berkshire Hathaway, Tesla, and a couple of others have accounted for around a third of the total market-cap weighted index in recent months.Flashback: The Goldman team notes that in past episodes in which the market became highly concentrated, the megafirms that drove gains weren't able to continue achieving the outsized growth in sales and profit margins that would have propelled further gains.In the 1960 and early 1970s, the "Nifty Fifty" were large cap superstar companies, including names like IBM, Eastman Kodak, and Xerox. The 1970s ended up being a lost decade for stock market returns.The late 1990s tech boom sent shares of Microsoft, General Electric, Cisco Systems, and Intel to the moon, but the 2000s were also a deflating time of weak returns.What they're saying: "Our historical analyses show that it is extremely difficult for any firm to maintain high levels of sales growth and profit margins over sustained periods of time," write David Kostin, Goldman's chief U.S. equity strategist, and four colleagues."The same issue plagues a highly concentrated index," they write. "As sales growth and profitability for the largest stocks in an index decelerate, earnings growth and therefore returns for the overall index will also decelerate."Data: Yahoo Finance; Chart: Axios VisualsWhile the Goldman note has received lots of attention, the core idea — that subpar returns are likely ahead for the biggest U.S. stocks — is so widespread as to be practically conventional wisdom among those who analyze asset allocation.For example, Vanguard routinely updates its projected returns on different asset classes and currently only anticipates 3% to 5% returns for large-cap U.S. stocks (i.e., the S&P 500) over the coming decade.Vanguard sees substantially better returns ahead on value stocks, small caps, Real Estate Investment Trusts, and international stocks.Between the lines: The flip side of the explosive growth in valuations of U.S. mega-caps over the last 15 years is that pretty much everything else, with more modest returns in that time, still has valuations that offer meaningful upside.Those of us who studied our Modern Portfolio Theory and built a portfolio strategically diversified based on factors like geography and company size have suffered subpar returns over the last 15 years relative to people who just piled everything into the S&P.In effect, the Goldman and similar forecasts are a prediction that the worm has turned, and the decade ahead will reward that diversification.Yes, but: Maybe the AI revolution will involve winner-take-all effects and such massive capital spending needs that the winners of the last decade will also be the winners of the next decade, propelling the S&P much higher despite historical warning signs.The bottom line: In deciding whether to go all-in on the S&P or diversify your stock investment more among value-oriented, smaller, and international companies, you are implicitly betting on one of those narratives.

Compare that to 13% average annual returns over the last ten years.Goldman's forecast implies the S&P — the benchmark index tracked by many of the world's most popular investment vehicles — is more likely than not to have lower returns than U.S. Treasury securities (72% odds) and could even deliver returns lower than inflation (33% odds) through 2034.State of play: The forecast incorporates some of the standard variables portfolio strategists look at to project future returns — price-to-earnings-ratios and interest rates, primarily. But much of the subpar projection is rooted in the extraordinary concentration of the recent stock market runup.Stocks of a handful of fast-growing, highly profitable tech giants that are investing heavily in artificial intelligence — Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Meta — increasingly are the S&P.The index may be meant to contain 500 stocks, but those plus Berkshire Hathaway, Tesla, and a couple of others have accounted for around a third of the total market-cap weighted index in recent months.Flashback: The Goldman team notes that in past episodes in which the market became highly concentrated, the megafirms that drove gains weren't able to continue achieving the outsized growth in sales and profit margins that would have propelled further gains.In the 1960 and early 1970s, the "Nifty Fifty" were large cap superstar companies, including names like IBM, Eastman Kodak, and Xerox. The 1970s ended up being a lost decade for stock market returns.The late 1990s tech boom sent shares of Microsoft, General Electric, Cisco Systems, and Intel to the moon, but the 2000s were also a deflating time of weak returns.What they're saying: "Our historical analyses show that it is extremely difficult for any firm to maintain high levels of sales growth and profit margins over sustained periods of time," write David Kostin, Goldman's chief U.S. equity strategist, and four colleagues."The same issue plagues a highly concentrated index," they write. "As sales growth and profitability for the largest stocks in an index decelerate, earnings growth and therefore returns for the overall index will also decelerate."Data: Yahoo Finance; Chart: Axios VisualsWhile the Goldman note has received lots of attention, the core idea — that subpar returns are likely ahead for the biggest U.S. stocks — is so widespread as to be practically conventional wisdom among those who analyze asset allocation.For example, Vanguard routinely updates its projected returns on different asset classes and currently only anticipates 3% to 5% returns for large-cap U.S. stocks (i.e., the S&P 500) over the coming decade.Vanguard sees substantially better returns ahead on value stocks, small caps, Real Estate Investment Trusts, and international stocks.Between the lines: The flip side of the explosive growth in valuations of U.S. mega-caps over the last 15 years is that pretty much everything else, with more modest returns in that time, still has valuations that offer meaningful upside.Those of us who studied our Modern Portfolio Theory and built a portfolio strategically diversified based on factors like geography and company size have suffered subpar returns over the last 15 years relative to people who just piled everything into the S&P.In effect, the Goldman and similar forecasts are a prediction that the worm has turned, and the decade ahead will reward that diversification.Yes, but: Maybe the AI revolution will involve winner-take-all effects and such massive capital spending needs that the winners of the last decade will also be the winners of the next decade, propelling the S&P much higher despite historical warning signs.The bottom line: In deciding whether to go all-in on the S&P or diversify your stock investment more among value-oriented, smaller, and international companies, you are implicitly betting on one of those narratives.

If you extend the index backward to 1930 (which market analysts often do), the average is even better, around 11%. And the index is up 23% this year with two months to go. How Goldman's Prediction Compares to Other Decades - Distribution of S&P 500 annualized 10-year returns since 1930 So an anemic average return of 3% over the next 10 years would be a kind of lost decade for equities. Historically, we've only seen extended periods of such low returns after crises like the Great Depression and the 1970s oil shocks. If Goldman is right, investors would be better off parking their entire portfolio in risk-free Treasuries. Right now the 10-year Treasury yield is hovering around 4.2%. How did Goldman produce such a lousy prediction? Goldman Sachs Chief Equity Strategist David Kostin, who authored the dour report, included many factors in his calculations - ranging from interest rates to return on equity to potential future recessions. But his two major problems for equities over the next decade are market concentration and valuations. He says the stock market is too concentrated in a few stocks, and stocks are too expensive overall. He's not totally wrong about that... For valuations, Kostin's team uses the cyclically adjusted PE multiple, which is 38 times earnings, one of the highest valuations of the last century. As for concentration, the report points out that the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 comprise 36% of its entire market capitalization. In other words, 2% of the companies in the index account for more than a third of the index's market cap. (Think of the Magnificent Sevens stocks here). Historically, when the market has a very high valuation and is narrowly concentrated, it underperforms over the next decade. So Kostin has a point. Yet there are many factors that would suggest his forecast could be off the mark... by a lot. So, the question is, should investors run for the hills yet? Let's start with earnings. S&P 500 earnings are predicted to rise by double digits in 2025 and 2026. And as Chief Investment Strategist Alexander Green of the Oxford Group periodically reminds us, earnings are the best indicator of where share prices will go in the medium to long term, certainly over a decade. I would also point to rising productivity in the economy. The United States leads the world in productivity growth. In fact, U.S. labor productivity is up a whopping 70% since 1990. That means that every year U.S. companies are generating more output with less labor (typically their biggest expense). Those numbers only look to accelerate as a host of new technologies - and artificial intelligence in particular - are likely to raise productivity growth even more in the years ahead. And productivity is the key to rising living standards, lower inflation, higher corporate profits, and, ultimately, rising share prices. Not to mention... there's a fundamental problem with long-term predictions like the one Goldman produced last week... They require far too many assumptions to be taken seriously. And they don't account for other factors - oil shocks and wars and other unforeseeable events, as well as inflationary policies. The way to wealth is through identifying companies that are poised to grow revenue and earnings, capture market share, and become more profitable over time. And in the most immediate future, the coming election could have a huge effect on your wealth. 3 posted on 10/28/2024 7:59:23 AM PDT by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind You can read as many “predictions” on the stock market as you have time to read.

The 1970s ended up being a lost decade for stock market returns.The late 1990s tech boom sent shares of Microsoft, General Electric, Cisco Systems, and Intel to the moon, but the 2000s were also a deflating time of weak returns.What they're saying: "Our historical analyses show that it is extremely difficult for any firm to maintain high levels of sales growth and profit margins over sustained periods of time," write David Kostin, Goldman's chief U.S. equity strategist, and four colleagues."The same issue plagues a highly concentrated index," they write. "As sales growth and profitability for the largest stocks in an index decelerate, earnings growth and therefore returns for the overall index will also decelerate."Data: Yahoo Finance; Chart: Axios VisualsWhile the Goldman note has received lots of attention, the core idea — that subpar returns are likely ahead for the biggest U.S. stocks — is so widespread as to be practically conventional wisdom among those who analyze asset allocation.For example, Vanguard routinely updates its projected returns on different asset classes and currently only anticipates 3% to 5% returns for large-cap U.S. stocks (i.e., the S&P 500) over the coming decade.Vanguard sees substantially better returns ahead on value stocks, small caps, Real Estate Investment Trusts, and international stocks.Between the lines: The flip side of the explosive growth in valuations of U.S. mega-caps over the last 15 years is that pretty much everything else, with more modest returns in that time, still has valuations that offer meaningful upside.Those of us who studied our Modern Portfolio Theory and built a portfolio strategically diversified based on factors like geography and company size have suffered subpar returns over the last 15 years relative to people who just piled everything into the S&P.In effect, the Goldman and similar forecasts are a prediction that the worm has turned, and the decade ahead will reward that diversification.Yes, but: Maybe the AI revolution will involve winner-take-all effects and such massive capital spending needs that the winners of the last decade will also be the winners of the next decade, propelling the S&P much higher despite historical warning signs.The bottom line: In deciding whether to go all-in on the S&P or diversify your stock investment more among value-oriented, smaller, and international companies, you are implicitly betting on one of those narratives.

If you extend the index backward to 1930 (which market analysts often do), the average is even better, around 11%. And the index is up 23% this year with two months to go. How Goldman's Prediction Compares to Other Decades - Distribution of S&P 500 annualized 10-year returns since 1930 So an anemic average return of 3% over the next 10 years would be a kind of lost decade for equities. Historically, we've only seen extended periods of such low returns after crises like the Great Depression and the 1970s oil shocks. If Goldman is right, investors would be better off parking their entire portfolio in risk-free Treasuries. Right now the 10-year Treasury yield is hovering around 4.2%. How did Goldman produce such a lousy prediction? Goldman Sachs Chief Equity Strategist David Kostin, who authored the dour report, included many factors in his calculations - ranging from interest rates to return on equity to potential future recessions. But his two major problems for equities over the next decade are market concentration and valuations. He says the stock market is too concentrated in a few stocks, and stocks are too expensive overall. He's not totally wrong about that... For valuations, Kostin's team uses the cyclically adjusted PE multiple, which is 38 times earnings, one of the highest valuations of the last century. As for concentration, the report points out that the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 comprise 36% of its entire market capitalization. In other words, 2% of the companies in the index account for more than a third of the index's market cap. (Think of the Magnificent Sevens stocks here). Historically, when the market has a very high valuation and is narrowly concentrated, it underperforms over the next decade. So Kostin has a point. Yet there are many factors that would suggest his forecast could be off the mark... by a lot. So, the question is, should investors run for the hills yet? Let's start with earnings. S&P 500 earnings are predicted to rise by double digits in 2025 and 2026. And as Chief Investment Strategist Alexander Green of the Oxford Group periodically reminds us, earnings are the best indicator of where share prices will go in the medium to long term, certainly over a decade. I would also point to rising productivity in the economy. The United States leads the world in productivity growth. In fact, U.S. labor productivity is up a whopping 70% since 1990. That means that every year U.S. companies are generating more output with less labor (typically their biggest expense). Those numbers only look to accelerate as a host of new technologies - and artificial intelligence in particular - are likely to raise productivity growth even more in the years ahead. And productivity is the key to rising living standards, lower inflation, higher corporate profits, and, ultimately, rising share prices. Not to mention... there's a fundamental problem with long-term predictions like the one Goldman produced last week... They require far too many assumptions to be taken seriously. And they don't account for other factors - oil shocks and wars and other unforeseeable events, as well as inflationary policies. The way to wealth is through identifying companies that are poised to grow revenue and earnings, capture market share, and become more profitable over time. And in the most immediate future, the coming election could have a huge effect on your wealth. 3 posted on 10/28/2024 7:59:23 AM PDT by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind You can read as many “predictions” on the stock market as you have time to read.

If you extend the index backward to 1930 (which market analysts often do), the average is even better, around 11%. And the index is up 23% this year with two months to go. How Goldman's Prediction Compares to Other Decades - Distribution of S&P 500 annualized 10-year returns since 1930 So an anemic average return of 3% over the next 10 years would be a kind of lost decade for equities. Historically, we've only seen extended periods of such low returns after crises like the Great Depression and the 1970s oil shocks. If Goldman is right, investors would be better off parking their entire portfolio in risk-free Treasuries. Right now the 10-year Treasury yield is hovering around 4.2%. How did Goldman produce such a lousy prediction? Goldman Sachs Chief Equity Strategist David Kostin, who authored the dour report, included many factors in his calculations - ranging from interest rates to return on equity to potential future recessions. But his two major problems for equities over the next decade are market concentration and valuations. He says the stock market is too concentrated in a few stocks, and stocks are too expensive overall. He's not totally wrong about that... For valuations, Kostin's team uses the cyclically adjusted PE multiple, which is 38 times earnings, one of the highest valuations of the last century. As for concentration, the report points out that the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 comprise 36% of its entire market capitalization. In other words, 2% of the companies in the index account for more than a third of the index's market cap. (Think of the Magnificent Sevens stocks here). Historically, when the market has a very high valuation and is narrowly concentrated, it underperforms over the next decade. So Kostin has a point. Yet there are many factors that would suggest his forecast could be off the mark... by a lot. So, the question is, should investors run for the hills yet? Let's start with earnings. S&P 500 earnings are predicted to rise by double digits in 2025 and 2026. And as Chief Investment Strategist Alexander Green of the Oxford Group periodically reminds us, earnings are the best indicator of where share prices will go in the medium to long term, certainly over a decade. I would also point to rising productivity in the economy. The United States leads the world in productivity growth. In fact, U.S. labor productivity is up a whopping 70% since 1990. That means that every year U.S. companies are generating more output with less labor (typically their biggest expense). Those numbers only look to accelerate as a host of new technologies - and artificial intelligence in particular - are likely to raise productivity growth even more in the years ahead. And productivity is the key to rising living standards, lower inflation, higher corporate profits, and, ultimately, rising share prices. Not to mention... there's a fundamental problem with long-term predictions like the one Goldman produced last week... They require far too many assumptions to be taken seriously. And they don't account for other factors - oil shocks and wars and other unforeseeable events, as well as inflationary policies. The way to wealth is through identifying companies that are poised to grow revenue and earnings, capture market share, and become more profitable over time. And in the most immediate future, the coming election could have a huge effect on your wealth. 3 posted on 10/28/2024 7:59:23 AM PDT by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind You can read as many “predictions” on the stock market as you have time to read.

Title: Reddit’s High-Flying Run Faces AI-Training Data Test in Earnings

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Reddit Inc. shares have been on a tear since going public earlier this year, and the social-media company’s unique place in the artificial intelligence landscape will dictate whether the rally continues. Most Read from Bloomberg NY Transit Agency Takes Next Step on Brooklyn-Queens Rail Link There Will Soon Be No Meatpackers Left in NYC’s Historic Meatpacking District Inside NYC’s Playbook for Getting Federal Grant Funds A Courtyard Apartment Building Designed for Southwest Sprawl A South Korean City Plays Matchmaker to Tackle a Fertility Crisis The stock is up 139% since it began trading in March, the best performance among this year’s IPOs to raise at least $310 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The next test of that rally will come with the Tuesday release of its third-quarter results. Wall Street expects the company to report revenue growth of about 50% from the year-ago period. The analyst consensus for revenue has risen by 11% over the past three months. Reddit is expected to be profitable on an adjusted basis, though not in terms of net earnings per share. A key focus of the report will be how much money Reddit expects to make by licensing its data to train AI models. It has signed data licensing agreements worth more than $200 million over the coming years, including with Alphabet Inc.’s Google and OpenAI. The company made nearly all — 98.1% — of its 2023 revenue from advertising, and that continues to be its central business. However, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mandeep Singh expects licensing deals with AI companies that train their large language models on Reddit’s content to “further accelerate top-line gains.” The company also “may continue to see a boost in its Google-driven LLM traffic,” Singh wrote last week. Reddit shares were up 0.3% on Monday, having briefly touched an intraday high of $82.53 earlier in the day. Reddit captured interest from investors looking for companies tied to AI. Its shares climbed 48% in its first day as a public company after raising $860 million. The gains for Reddit have only accelerated in the months since going public as it powered higher after restrictions preventing long-time investors from selling were lifted. Reddit’s rise places it alongside other AI darlings like ARM Holdings Plc and Astera Labs Inc., which are among the top performing companies to debut since 2021. Shares of each have more than doubled since their IPOs. AI platform Cerebras and AI hyperscaler CoreWeave are among companies considering going public in the coming months. Reddit’s second-quarter revenue topped expectations, contributing to the stock’s strong performance. Over the past six months, its gains have been roughly triple those of Meta Platforms Inc., the Facebook parent that is investing heavily in AI to improve ad targeting, among other functions. Meta is scheduled to report on Wednesday. Other social stocks, including Snap Inc. and Pinterest Inc., have declined over the past six months because of weaker growth trends and forecasts. The strength in Reddit has taken it above the average analyst price target, suggesting Wall Street isn’t betting on additional gains over the coming 12 months. It has also contributed to a swollen valuation. It trades at nearly 140 times estimated earnings and 9.4 times estimated revenue, compared with Meta’s earnings multiple near 24. However, many analysts expect the company to improve its profitability and expand margins going forward, which would tamp down the multiple. Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham, wrote that “most institutional investors we speak with expect Reddit to triple Ebitda margins from 16% in 2024 to >40% by 2030, and many wonder if their models are still too conservative.” Analysts at Jefferies estimate Ebitda will more than double in the next two years. Around 62% of analysts recommend buying the stock, while a third have the equivalent of a hold rating. Meta and Pinterest are viewed much more favorably by analysts. --With assistance from Bailey Lipschultz.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks climbed on Monday as Middle East war fears cooled, ahead of a pivotal week packed with Big Tech earnings, an inflation update, and a crucial monthly jobs report. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped roughly 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also moved up about 0.5%. The market was bolstered by relief that Israel limited its retaliatory strikes on Iran to military targets, and not oil or nuclear facilities as feared. Oil futures tumbled nearly 6%, taking Brent (BZ=F) down to almost $71 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) to near $67. The focus is on tech stocks with five of the "Magnificent Seven" megacaps due to release earnings this week, after the Nasdaq Composite bucked Friday's losing trend to close near a record. Investors are looking to Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) results to help boost the S&P 500 to new heights, too. But questions remain as to whether Big Tech's investments in AI are paying off in profits. Some on Wall Street are anticipating the slowest growth in earnings for tech megacaps in six quarters. The reports are the highlight in a very busy week of results, with 169 of the S&P 500's members expected to release updates. Philips (PHG) shares sank 16% after the medical device maker cut its full-year sales outlook, citing a strong decline in Chinese demand. Ford (F) is on Monday's docket after the bell. At the same time, investors are bracing for a rush of economic data that could put bets on a "soft landing" to the test. In the forefront are the latest reading on the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge and the October jobs report — both seen as crucial to policymakers' decision on whether to cut interest rates at their November meeting. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Elsewhere, stocks in Japan rallied after the country's ruling party failed to hold onto its majority in elections on Sunday — underscoring political risks to markets with the US presidential vote just days away. Spotify (SPOT) shares rose nearly 1% in morning trading after Wells Fargo (WFC) named the stock a top pick, maintaining its Overweight rating and raising its price target from $420 to $470. Spotify has soared over 120% as the company has made good on its turnaround plan. After weak performance in late 2022, Spotify has announced layoffs, enacted price hikes, changed its royalty model, and picked up big podcast deals. The music streaming giant reported a record profit in its most recent quarterly earnings report this summer. Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall said in his note to investors Monday that Spotify "continues to demonstrate success on long-term margin expansion." Spotify reports third quarter earnings on Nov. 12, and analysts expect adjusted earnings per share to rise over 400% to $1.82 and revenue to jump 19% to $4.4 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Wall Street analysts covering the stock, on average, see shares rising to $410 over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg data. Stocks opened higher on Monday to start a pivotal week packed with Big Tech earnings, an inflation update, and a crucial monthly jobs report. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped roughly 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also moved up about 0.5%. Oil slid nearly 6% after Israel's retaliatory strikes on Iran spared the country's crude infrastructure. Brent (BZ=F) hovered near $71 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) traded near $67 in early trading. Investors await earnings from Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) this week. The monthly inflation print and jobs report for September are also due out this week. Boeing (BA) shares ticked slightly lower in premarket after the plane maker launched an almost $19 billion share sale in a move to shore up its liquidity and avoid a credit downgrade. The company plans to sell about 90 million common shares and about $5 billion of depositary shares. Wall Street analysts had widely expected a large offering after a difficult year for the plane maker. S&P Global recently placed Boeing on CreditWatch Negative, which increased the likelihood of a downgrade if the machinist union strike at the company continues until the end of the year. Last week, a majority of workers rejected the latest labor contract proposal from Boeing. Earlier this month, the jet manufacturer said it would cut about 17,000 jobs, or 10% of its workforce. As of Sept. 30, Boeing had $56.9 billion of outstanding senior unsecured indebtedness, according to a company filing.

West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) tumbled to hover below $68 while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, slid to trade below $72 a barrel. Tel Aviv’s attack against Iranian military facilities early Saturday were in response to Tehran’s missile strikes on October 1. Oil was volatile in the weeks preceding the retaliation with Brent touching $80 per barrel as traders speculated whether Israel would strike against Iran’s oil infrastructure. The White House advised against targeting the country's oil or nuclear facilities. Sign in to access your portfolio

US stocks climbed on Monday as Middle East war fears cooled, ahead of a pivotal week packed with Big Tech earnings, an inflation update, and a crucial monthly jobs report. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped roughly 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also moved up about 0.5%. The market was bolstered by relief that Israel limited its retaliatory strikes on Iran to military targets, and not oil or nuclear facilities as feared.

Investors are looking to Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) results to help boost the S&P 500 to new heights, too. But questions remain as to whether Big Tech's investments in AI are paying off in profits. Some on Wall Street are anticipating the slowest growth in earnings for tech megacaps in six quarters. The reports are the highlight in a very busy week of results, with 169 of the S&P 500's members expected to release updates. Philips (PHG) shares sank 16% after the medical device maker cut its full-year sales outlook, citing a strong decline in Chinese demand. Ford (F) is on Monday's docket after the bell. At the same time, investors are bracing for a rush of economic data that could put bets on a "soft landing" to the test.

Title: New 400-mile 2024 Chevy Silverado EV Work Trucks now cost same as used
URL: http://electrek.co/2024/10/28/new-400-mile-2024-chevy-silverado-ev-work-trucks-now-cost-same-as-used/
Time Published: 2024-10-28T13:24:05Z
Full Content:
A number of Chevrolet dealers across the nation are advertising a new 2024 Silverado EV in 3WT trim at around $60K, which is close to where Hertz is pricing year-old low-mileage examples of the fully electric pickup that are being culled from its rental fleet. At $74,900, including destination, the Silverado EV 3WT is perhaps a bit pricey. Fortunately, Chevrolet is offering its $7500 Ultium Promise Bonus Cash on all 2024 Silverado EV work trucks. That incentive cuts the cost of the 3WT down to $67,400 before tax and license, which seems reasonable considering it has a 393-mile range that bests other $70K electric pickups and is equipped with a host of comfort and safety features that contradict the bare-bones implication of its “work truck” moniker. We’ve been tracking dealer discounts on the Silverado EV in our Electric Vehicle Price Guide ever since the work truck first popped up in dealer inventories on the east coast a couple of months ago. Deep discounts and broadening availability are now making the Silverado EV 3WT much more attractive to shoppers. At the top of our list of discounts is Victorville Chevrolet, a dealership eighty miles northeast of Los Angeles that is advertising $19,500 off MSRP on its Silverado EV work trucks, pricing the 3WT at just $55,400. That’s two to three grand less than a previous rental with over 5000 miles on the odo. For buyers hoping to spend less than $50K, Victorville has a couple of Silverado EV 3WT work trucks with the 1FL Fleet Option priced at $49,400. The 1FL Fleet Option swaps the ruggedly attractive gloss-black aluminum rims for utilitarian-looking steel wheels. It also deletes the side steps, dual-level charge cord, and soft-top tonneau that come with the 3WT trim level. If these prices appeal to you, act quickly. Victorville Chevy’s Silverado EV inventory seems to be depleting fast as they’ve systematically increased their discount over the past several weeks. When we updated Silverado EV discounts on our Electric Vehicle Price Guide at the beginning of this month, Victorville’s online inventory showed a total of 35 electric work trucks in stock. As of this writing, less than a dozen remain, including one in 4WT trim that boasts an impressive 450-mile range. Angelenos that can’t make the trek to Victorville Chevy in time to grab one of their remaining Silverado EVs may want to consider contacting Penke Chevrolet in Cerritos about their in-stock electric work trucks listed at $15,500 off MSRP. If that doesn’t pan out, other LA-area Chevy dealers are showing 2024 Silverado EV work trucks in-transit, some already with modest discounts applied, so an increased supply may drive in-town prices lower in the near future. Outside of southern California, dealers with Silverado EV work truck discounts worth considering include Koons Chevrolet in Maryland ($15,395 off MSRP), Bomnin Chevrolet in Florida ($14,000 off MSRP), Raymond Chevrolet in Illinois and Platinum Chevrolet in northern California ($13,500 off MSRP), Capitol Chevrolet in Texas ($12,900 off MSRP), Parks Chevrolet in Virginia ($12,777 off MSRP), McLoughlin Chevrolet in Oregon ($12,743 off MSRP), and Hendrick Chevrolet in Georgia ($12,500 off MSRP). Look for discounts on a Chevrolet Silverado EV in your area. Dealer discounts on the 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning are starting to turn heads, especially those that qualify for the $7500 Federal EV Tax Credit. For example, Al Packer Ford in Florida has an F-150 Lightning XLT with a standard battery (240-mile range, MSRP $60,090) discounted by a whopping $8602. Stacking the $7500 Federal EV tax credit on top of that discount results in a net cost of just $43,988 before tax and license. For those that need more range, Ford of San Leandro in California is advertising an F-150 Lightning Flash (MSRP $71,185) at a $6500 discount, resulting in a $57,774 net cost after applying the $7500 Federal EV tax credit. The Flash trim includes an extended range battery that’s good for 320 miles on a full charge. Find a great deal on a Ford F-150 Lightning near you.

Title: These Five Stocks Are Hedge-Fund Favorites

Toyota employees assembling a car during the pandemic. Toyota is among the stocks held by notable ... [+] hedge funds. (Photo by FRANCOIS LO PRESTI/AFP via Getty Images) Many of the United States’ most talented stock pickers choose to work at hedge funds, where salaries and bonuses are often more attractive than at bank trust departments or mutual funds. Gurufocus.com publishes a screen of stocks that are popular with leading hedge funds. For this column, I took that screen and added two modifications. First, to pass my modified screen, a stock had to be cheap, selling for less than 15 times earnings. Second, the company had to show earnings growth of at least 5% a year for the past ten years, five years, three years and one year – in other words, some consistency to growth. Five stocks that made it through this gauntlet look particularly appealing to me. Toyota Motor Corp. (TM) sold 11.2 million vehicles last year, making the Japanese company the world’s largest car maker for four years in a row. The runner-up, Volkswagen Group, sold 9.2 million vehicles. Toyota’s American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) sell for about seven times earnings. That’s cheap compared to most stocks, but about par for the course for an automaker. Over the past ten years, Toyota has increased its earnings by an average of more than 7% per year. Its return on stockholders equity lately has been 15%, compared to a ten-year average of about 11%. Homebuilders have one big tailwind and one big headwind at the moment. The tailwind is that there’s pent-up demand for houses. The headwind is that mortgage rates are onerous. Now that the Federal Reserve has switched from raising interest rates to cutting them, I hope that mortgage rates will come down a peg or two. That should help the homebuilders, who are already making pretty good money. D.R. Horton is the largest U.S. homebuilder by sales, and builds homes at a variety of price points. Over the past ten years, it has increased its revenue by 18% a year, and profits even faster. The stock seems reasonably priced to me at 12 times earnings. Loews Corp. is a conglomerate controlled by the Tisch family. Jonathan Tish is chairman, and James Tisch (his cousin) is president and chief executive officer. Insiders, including the Tisches, own 25% of the stock; the public owns the rest. The Tisches like to buy and sell major assets. In the past, Loews owned a big stake in CBS television, all of Lorillard Tobacco Co., Bulova Watch Co., and the Loews movie theatre chain. Nowadays, Loews has four major parts: CNA Financial Corp. (a property & casualty insurer that is 92% owned), Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc., Boardwalk Pipeline Partners LP, and Loews hotels. Wall Street analysts don’t much care for Loews stock. But I think there’s real value in this collection of assets. Do you need a crane? Some earthmoving equipment? A lift truck? These are the sorts of things you can rent or buy from H&E Equipment Services Inc. (HEES), based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The stock began trading publicly in 2006, and has about 2,300 employees. It has posted a profit in 11 of the past 12 years. The only exception was the pandemic year of 2020. H&E’s return on stockholders’ equity lately has been about 31%. On that measure of profitability, I consider anything north of 15% to be good. H&E has exceeded that mark in (again) 11 of the past 12 years. Only five Wall Street analysts follow the company. Four of them rate it a “buy.” The stock sells for about 13 times earnings. Customers Bancorp (CUBI), based in Reading, Pennsylvania, is parent of Customers Bank, which has branches in Pennsylvania, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Washington D.C. Jay Sidhu, the bank’s chairman, wrote a book titled “Never Ever, Ever Give Up.” His Son, Sid Sidhu, is the bank’s chief executive officer. Return on assets is my go-to measure for banks. I like to see it above 1.00%. Customers Bancorp has done that for the past three years in a row. In August, the Federal Reserve charged the bank with deficiencies in its anti-money-laundering and risk-management procedures. That helped to knock the stock down from a high near $66 in June to a recent price of about $44. The stock is now quite cheap, at six times earnings. I normally report the results of past recommendations, but this is the first time I’ve written about stocks that are hedge-fund favorites. I’ll detail the results of today’s recommendations in a future column. Disclosure: I own D.R. Horton shares for one client. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best-Performing S&P 500 Stocks in the Last 3 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best performing S&P 500 stocks in the last year. The past three years have been a bit of a roller coaster ride for the stock market. We saw how the pandemic wrecked several industries’ balance sheets and supply chains. Following the global vaccination drive, economies around the world and in the US opened up with a vengeance, resulting in huge stimulus checks. This, along with the energy and food-price shock and disrupted supply chains, was blamed for the persistently high inflation, which peaked at 9.1% in June 2022. The Fed had already started hiking interest rates to ease inflation and work towards a soft landing, with the first hike coming in March 2022. By July 2023, the central bank had raised it to 5.25-5.50%, making borrowing all the more challenging. The tech industry had kept the momentum from 2020 lockdowns well into 2021. The largest tech companies out of the 500 biggest companies trading in the US grew by an average of 33% from the start of 2021 to the end. However, the tech industry was heavily impacted by the rate hikes that followed in 2022. This resulted in the large-cap aggregate tech indices losing nearly 29% of the gains made in the year prior, as prospects for growth became bleak. The upper percentiles of the energy industry in market cap had a similar run in 2021 but remained immune to the economic downturn that followed in 2022, posting gains of 59% for the year. The aggressive rally in the energy industry resulted from a combination of supply-chain disruptions, OPEC production cuts, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the revision of energy sourcing in Europe, directing much of the energy capital inflow to the US from the continent. Coming back to tech – the industry wouldn’t stay on the sidelines for long. The start of 2023 to the end saw the large-cap US-traded tech equity grow by 38.6%. At the core of the resurgence was the AI-led boom combined with semiconductor supply chains that had recovered substantially by then. Other factors included CHIPS and Science Act, improved efficiency in the industry, and a rate-hike slowdown. The US economy looks to be on schedule for a soft landing, according to a Financial Times’ survey of economists. This is on the back of the Fed’s rate reduction of 50 basis points in September 2024, which, as noted by the CFO of a large US bank Denis Colman, is a signal towards a soft landing. This is not a sure shot, however, since some experts remain wary and continue worrying about a recession. For instance, Piper Sandler’s Chief Global Economist Nancy Lazar noted that the “jumbo” rate cut by the Fed is reminiscent of the similar Fed policy easing of 2001 and 2007, which couldn’t avert the problem. However, according to analysts, the case for a soft landing appears to be justified given the September jobs report and other improving indicators. The September report by BLS shows that the non-farm payrolls grew by 254,000 for the month, exceeding economists’ estimates by 41%. Moreover, the July and August reports, which had spooked some economists, were also revised by a combined 72,000 new hires, which wasn’t without historical precedent. Further, grocery prices, adjusted for growth in real wages, are back to the pre-pandemic levels. It took 3.59 hours of work to afford a week’s worth of groceries in November 2019 and took 3.57 hours of work to afford them in September 2024. Moving ahead, Rob Rowe, Regional Research Director and Head of Global Strategy at a large US bank is ‘tactically bullish’ on the back of continuing tech recovery and the markets “pricing in a soft landing”. They expect at-least 25 basis-point rate cuts at each Fed meeting through year-end. With regards to tech industry, their outlook suggests selectivity. In response to a question about their outlook on the tech industry, they said: “I think we have to be selective here. We like Semis as a recovery play but we’re kind of underweight on software.” Rowe has a bearish outlook on oil, given geopolitical variables don’t change in a way that leads to oil prices shooting up. For our list, we have picked stocks from the index in question that have had the highest 3-year annualized returns and we ranked them as such, in order of their 3-year CAGR. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. 3Y CAGR: 82.08% NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), for all intents and purposes, is considered the driving force behind the AI boom, especially on the hardware side. Nvidia’s core business revolves around designing Graphic Processing Units (GPUs). The company’s biggest market is the gaming industry since GPUs are almost essential for high-performance rendering due to their parallel processing capabilities. As it turns out, GPUs are also incredibly useful for training AI models for the same reason, since AI models require a lot of matrix calculations simultaneously. It goes without saying that Nvidia isn’t the sole GPU designer but what put it at an advantage over its competitors is its proprietary parallel computing platform – CUDA. Having a GPU market share of 70.5% as of 2016, Nvidia recognized the need for a programmable architecture very early since programming parallel processing is recognized as notoriously difficult. The CUDA platform is now supported by a library of thousands of specific applications, which makes it hard to compete with Nvidia in the space of parallel programming platforms. This, coupled with the explosive demand for GPUs for training AI models, resulted in NVDA becoming the most valuable company in the world in June 2024 before Apple regained the top spot for itself. NVDA grew at an annualized rate of 82% over the past three years, and has gained nearly 212% over the past year and 184% year-to-date. Nvidia’s highly anticipated GPU – Blackwell – is expected to offer substantial inference performance gains over its previous GPUs, and is already experiencing a high level of demand from hyperscalers. The GPU will be rolled out in Q4, 2024, but has already been booked out for 12 months. This is what Stacy Rasgon, a Bernstein senior analyst, had to say about NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in one of the latest CNBC programs: “People are getting excited about the story again as we approach earnings, year-end, and next year when the new platform with Blackwell starts to ramp up. By all indications—based on supply chain checks and everything else—demand for this product looks off the charts.” The analyst believes the stock is trading at a discount: “It’s much cheaper today than it was before the run started a year and a half ago. The stock has risen significantly, but earnings have increased even more than the stock.” Overall, NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of best performing S&P 500 stocks in the last year. While we acknowledge the potential of the best-performing S&P500 stocks in the Last 3 Years, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: How To Earn $500 A Month From Ford Stock Ahead Of Q3 Earnings

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) will release earnings results for its third quarter, after the closing bell on Monday, Oct. 28. Analysts expect the Dearborn, Michigan-based company to report quarterly earnings at 47 cents per share. That’s up from 36 cents per share in the year-ago period. Ford projects to report revenue of $41.88 billion for the recent quarter, compared to $41.22 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro. In the meantime, investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. Ford currently offers an annual dividend yield of 5.42%. That’s a quarterly dividend of 15 cents per share (60 cents a year). So, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly? To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $110,700 or around 10,000 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $22,140 per year, you would need $41,805 or around 2,000 shares. To Calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($0.60 in this case). So, $6,000 / $0.60 = 10,000 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $0.60 = 2,000 shares ($100 per month). Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time. View more earnings on F How That works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40). Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield. Ford Outlook, Price Action: Ford CEO Jim Farley recently explained his intent behind driving the Xiaomi SU7 EV over the past six months in a post on social media on Wednesday. "I try to drive everything we compete against," Farley said. "Specs can tell part of a story, but you’ve got to get behind the wheel to truly understand and beat the competition." Ford shares fell 1.5% to close at $11.07 on Friday.

Title: European stocks mostly lower; Philips cuts sales forecast

Time Published: 2024-10-28T12:22:33Z

Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher Monday, benefiting from increased risk sentiment as crude prices fell, at the start of a week packed with event risks. At 11:05 ET (15:05 GMT), the DAX index in Germany traded 0.3% higher, the FTSE 100 in the U.K. climbed 0.4%, and the CAC 40 in France rose 0.7%. Sentiment has received a boost Monday from the cooling geopolitical situation in the Middle East after weekend airstrikes by Israel against Iran did not target oil or nuclear facilities as feared. “The more targeted response from Israel leaves the door open for de-escalation,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “While it is still unclear if or how Iran may retaliate, the government has downplayed the damage caused by Israel’s response.” Elsewhere, Monday has been thin on economic data releases, but investors will looking forward to the release of eurozone third-quarter GDP and inflation later in the week to guide how aggressively the European Central Bank will cut interest rates going forward. The European Central Bank has cut interest rates three times already this year, all by 25 basis points, but speculation is growing that ECB policymakers will agree to a larger rate cut at the next meeting. Data released earlier Monday showed that Ifo's indicator for German export expectations fell to minus 6.7 points in October from minus 6.5 points the prior month, with the automotive and metal sectors anticipating the heaviest losses in international trade. Britain's new Labour government also unveils its first budget on Wednesday, while Friday sees the release of the widely-watched monthly official jobs report in the US. There are more quarterly corporate earnings to digest in Europe this week, with results from Philips (AS:PHG) Monday’s highlight. The Dutch medical devices maker's stock slumped 17% after the company lowered its sales forecast for the year due to declining demand in China, which pushed its order intake down 2% in the third quarter. Philips now expects comparable sales to grow by 0.5% to 1.5% in 2024, down from a previous expectation of 3% to 5%. A lot of the week’s attention, however, will be on the results from five of the "Magnificent Seven" US tech stocks that have played an outsize role in driving market gains over the past couple of years. Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is due to report on Tuesday, followed by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Facebook parent Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) on Wednesday and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Thursday. Oil prices fell sharply Monday after Israel's retaliatory strike on Iran over the weekend avoided Tehran's oil and nuclear facilities, easing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. By 11:05 ET, the Brent contract dropped 5.1% to $71.78 per barrel, while U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 5.2% lower at $68.03 per barrel. Traders had feared that any attacks on Iran’s oil and nuclear infrastructure would mark a dire escalation in the conflict, potentially disrupting oil supplies from the crude-rich region. Iran downplayed the impact of the attack, but still threatened retaliation. The strike saw traders price out a risk premium from crude prices, and put focus back squarely on demand, which is expected to weaken in the coming months.

U.S. stock futures are higher as investors prepare for big tech earnings this week; McDonald's (MCD) is bringing its Quarter Pounders back to more than 900 restaurants following an E. coli outbreak; Boeing (BA) announces a $19 billion capital raise amid a costly strike; U.S.-listed shares of Philips (PHG) are plunging as the Dutch conglomerate lowers its full-year sales outlook on a "significant deterioration" in Chinese demand; and crude futures are sinking after an Israeli strike on Iran spared the country's oil facilities. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing higher as investors prepare for a busy week of earnings and economic data. Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN) all report quarterly earnings this week, and the tech giants have helped the Nasdaq post gains for seven straight weeks and advance 0.7% in premarket trading Monday. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are up 0.3% after delivering losses in each session last week, while S&P 500 futures also are higher, by 0.5%. Gold is trading lower, while bitcoin is up about 1%. McDonald's (MCD) will bring its Quarter Pounders back to the menu in more than 900 restaurants in Colorado, Kansas, and Wyoming, as well as portions of nine other states, after an E. coli outbreak last week. Company officials identified slivered onions from distributor Taylor Farms' Colorado Springs facility as the likely source, and won't be serving them on the burger when sales resume there. The news comes ahead of McDonald's third-quarter earnings Tuesday, with analysts expecting revenue to rise but profits to drop slightly. Shares of McDonald's are up by 1% in premarket trading. Boeing (BA) announced it will seek to raise more than $19 billion in capital through public offerings of common stock and depositary shares. The aircraft maker will offer 90 million shares of common stock, which at its most recent closing price of $155.01 would be valued at $13.95 billion, as well as $5 billion in depositary shares. Boeing will use the funding for general corporate purposes including repayment of debt it said. The move comes as Boeing has been struggling with a strike by its union machinists that has lasted more than six weeks. Shares of Boeing initially rose on the news but are now 1% lower in premarket trading. American depositary receipts (ADRs) of Koninklijke Philips (PHG) are 17% lower in premarket trading after the Dutch conglomerate cut its 2024 sales outlook amid a "significant deterioration" in Chinese demand. Philips said it now expects 2024 comparable sales growth between 0.5% and 1.5%, down from its previous forecast of between 3% and 5%. The company's third-quarter revenue, net income, and earnings per share (EPS) all came in lower than estimates from analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha. Oil prices are sinking after Israel avoided hitting energy facilities in its latest strike on Iran. Israel struck several Iranian military facilities Saturday in retaliation for an earlier attack by Iran, but did not disrupt its oil operations. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures are falling by almost 6% to trade at around $67.60 a barrel, while Brent crude is down more than 5% at $71.40 a barrel. Iran makes up about 4% of the global oil trade, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Title: BlackRock Now Holding 403,725 Bitcoin (BTC) Worth $26,980,000,000 After Accumulation Spree

BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, is now holding tens of billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin (BTC), the firm’s data shows. According to the asset management’s disclosures, BlackRock holds 403,725 BTC worth $26.98 billion in its iShares Bitcoin Trust exchange-traded fund (ETF). Blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain says that in the last two weeks alone, BlackRock has gobbled up 34,085 BTC worth $2.3 billion. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) went live on January 5th of this year and has since delivered 44.80% returns as of September 30th. In a recent report, BlackRock, a firm with over $10 trillion in assets under management, said that Bitcoin could act as a hedge against the United States’ mounting debt and other macroeconomic concerns. “While Bitcoin has shown instances of short-term co-movements with equities and other ‘risk assets,’ over the longer term its fundamental drivers are starkly different, and in many cases inverted versus most traditional investment assets. As the global investment community grapples with rising geopolitical tensions, concerns over the state of US debt and deficits and increased political instability around the world, Bitcoin may be seen as an increasingly unique diversifier against some of these fiscal, monetary and geopolitical risk factors investors may face elsewhere in their portfolio.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $67,735.

Monday Tee Up: Mag 7, Jobs, Inflation This week and next are perhaps the biggest two weeks of the year for Wall Street. This week, five of the Magnificent 7 companies report earnings and there is important data on jobs and inflation. Next week features the U.S. presidential election and a Federal Reserve rate decision. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was lower by 2.7%, the S&P 500 lost 1.0%, and the Nasdaq gained 0.2%. For the year, the Dow is higher by 12%, the S&P is up 22%, and the Nasdaq has popped 23%. The earnings calendar is packed this week. On Monday, Ford and V.F. Corp. report results. On Tuesday, Alphabet, Advanced Micro Devices, McDonald's, Pfizer, Visa, and Electronic Arts. On Wednesday, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Starbucks, Booking Holdings, MGM Resorts, Eli Lilly, and Amgen. On Thursday, Apple, Amazon, Merck, Comcast, Uber, MasterCard, Altria, and Bristol-Myers Squibb. And on Friday, Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and Charter Communications. So far, 181 (36%) of the S&P 500 companies have reported. Earnings are coming in 4.4% higher than in the prior-year quarter. That follows a strong 13% rise in earnings for 2Q. Argus forecasts about 5%-7% growth in earnings this quarter. For full year, we forecast roughly a 7%-9% gain. For 3Q, we expect Information Technology, Communication Services, and Healthcare to be the sectors that shine. On the economic calendar, the October jobs report comes out on Friday. For September, Nonfarm Payrolls were a strong 254,000. Inflation indicator PCE is due on Thursday. PCE came in at 2.2% in August and Core PCE printed at 2.7%. Argus forecasts PCE at 2.1% for September and Core PCE at 2.6%. Elsewhere, Tuesday brings updates on Job Openings, Consumer Confidence, and the Case-Shiller Home Price Index. On Wednesday, the ADP private payrolls report and GDP hit the tape. On Thursday, Personal Income and Personal Spending are due out. And on Friday, Construction Spending, ISM Manufacturing, and Auto Sales will be released. Argus Chief Economist Chris Graja, CFA, is making his call of the week the October jobs report. For October, Chris sees that payrolls slipping to 60,000 -- but that needs some explaining. Chris says this indicator will be hard to read because of the two recent devastating hurricanes and the strike at Boeing. Chris sees the Unemployment Rate sticking at 4.1% for October, close to the Fed's longer-run project BLK, TRGP, GOOGL, AMAT, AAPL, ANET, JPM, ADI, AXON, URI, COST, V, LLY, SPGI, PANW, META, NVDA, SYK, BSX, ORCL, PWR, LEN, NOW, ADBE, SCHW, RCL, ISRG, AMZN, ODFL, CRM LLY, CBOE ROST F HAS

Title: Watch These CrowdStrike Price Levels After Delta Files Lawsuit Over July IT Outage

CrowdStrike (CRWD) shares are in the spotlight after Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Friday filed a lawsuit against the cybersecurity provider following a faulty software update in July that brought its operations to a standstill and caused mass flight cancellations. The Atlanta-based airline alleges that the incident, which also disrupted industries including banks, health care, and media outlets, cost it more than $500 million, along with loss of future revenue and reputational damage. Despite ongoing concerns of further litigation linked to the software update, CrowdStrike shares have gained around 50% from their early-August low as of Friday’s close amid growing consensus among analysts that the firm sits poised to move past the incident in a strong position. Below, we analyze the technicals on CrowdStrike’s chart and point out key price levels to watch out for. Since bottoming out in early August, CrowdStrike shares have oscillated within a rising wedge, a chart pattern featuring two upward sloping converging trendlines that signals weakening price momentum. More recently, the stock has broken below the pattern’s lower trendline, potentially setting the stage for a continuation of the downtrend that started in early July, just weeks before the company’s erroneous software update. The stock was little changed at around $300 in premarket trading Monday. Let’s identify four important lower price levels on CrowdStrike’s chart that may come into play if the shares continue their move lower from current levels. Upon an initial move lower, investors should monitor the $285 level, an area just above the 50-day moving average where the shares could encounter support near a trendline joining multiple peaks and troughs on the chart from January to August. A close below this level could see the shares decline to around $262. Investors may view this location on the chart as a buying opportunity, given it sits near a horizontal line linking a series of simar trading levels between December and September. Further selling in the stock opens the door for a bearish move down to the $244 region, where the price could attract support near the January pullback low and prominent early September trough. Finally, a longer-term downtrend could see the shares revisit lower support at $172, where bargain hunters may look to place buy limit orders around the September 2023 swing high and October 2023 swing low. This area on the chart also roughly aligns with a bars pattern downside price target that takes the stock’s sharp trend lower from July to August and repositions it from this month’s swing high.

Title: BlackRock’s Bitcoin holdings near Satoshi’s – Is a BTC battle brewing?

BlackRock’s Bitcoin accumulation signals a bullish trend for Bitcoin. Amid growing speculation that Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs may soon surpass the holdings of Satoshi Nakamoto, BlackRock has hit a significant milestone in its BTC accumulation. According to a recent update from Lookonchain, the asset management giant now holds over 400,000 Bitcoin. At press time, it was valued at approximately $26.98 billion. Source: Lookonchain/X Over the past two weeks alone, BlackRock has added 34,085 BTC to its portfolio, worth roughly $2.3 billion. This latest acquisition highlighted BlackRock’s dominance in the cryptocurrency space as it continues to expand its Bitcoin holdings. On the flip side, BlackRock’s BTC ETF (IBIT) has seen remarkable growth, surpassing the $23 billion mark, according to Farside Investors. Notably, IBIT has been on a consistent inflow streak since the 14th of October. Between the 14th and 25th October, IBIT recorded inflows nearing $400 million on some days, reflecting strong investor interest and confidence in BlackRock’s BTC strategy. This underscored BlackRock’s strategic approach to Bitcoin amid its growing adoption. Seeing this the crypto community has responded with optimism. Source: X As of the latest update, Bitcoin was trading at $67,773.35, marking a rise of over 1% within the past 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap. Additioanlly, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) was also lying above the neutral threshold, signaling that bullish momentum was overtaking bearish forces. Source: Trading View For Bitcoin’s roadmap ahead, an analysis by IntoTheBlock, cited by AMBCrypto, revealed that approximately 92.88% of BTC holders were “in the money,” meaning their holdings were valued higher than their initial purchase price. Meanwhile, only 2.45% of holders were “out of the money,” reflecting a robust market sentiment and suggesting potential for further price gains. Source: IntoTheBlock Speculation about future “Bitcoin wars” is already circulating, with some predicting that giants like BlackRock could eventually seek to fork the original Bitcoin chain and promote their own version as the legitimate one. While such a scenario may currently seem like a conspiracy theory, the rapid accumulation of BTC by BlackRock has raised concerns about its growing influence over the market. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025 However, they are not alone—other major players such as MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, as well as Tesla, Binance, and SpaceX, have also been steadily amassing Bitcoin. Therefore, whether MicroStrategy and other institutions will be able to challenge BlackRock’s dominance remains an open question.

OpenAI and its biggest backer, Microsoft (MSFT), are discussing how to divide up the spoils of the artificial intelligence upstart when OpenAI becomes a for-profit company, but agreeing on a fair market value for those assets will be a tall task. It all depends on who is doing the math, according to legal experts. "The issue is that there are probably six to 10 different ways to value a company," said Columbia University Business School professor Angela Lee. "And depending on who you ask, and my guess is, depending on which model you use, you could be off by a factor of like 3x to 5x." Arriving at a precise valuation for the startup responsible for ChatGPT will be nearly impossible, added Case Western Reserve University corporate law professor Anat Alon-Beck. "I suggest that any valuation in this context should be treated as a range rather than a definitive figure, given the inherent uncertainties," Alon-Beck said. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that OpenAI and Microsoft hired Wall Street investment banks Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) to advise them on these discussions after OpenAI closed a $6.6 billion funding round valuing it at $157 billion. Microsoft, among the investors in the latest funding round, has now devoted a total of nearly $14 billion to OpenAI since 2019. The question is how much equity Microsoft should receive in a new for-profit OpenAI in exchange for that $14 billion. There are also other thorny questions about rights to future profits that need to be ironed out. These issues are being debated while the bonds between the two companies start to show signs of wear, according to reporting in The New York Times, as financial pressures, executive exits, and disagreements among employees take their toll. OpenAI expects to lose $5 billion this year, according to the Times. OpenAI’s current implied valuation of $157 billion would put it on par with the market caps of some of America’s largest and best-known companies, including Goldman, the Wall Street giant offering OpenAI advice during the talks with Microsoft. Goldman is currently valued just north of $160 billion. Lee said there are understandable justifications for OpenAI's $157 billion valuation, but critics could reasonably argue the figure is off base. "When talking about hyper-growth companies like Open AI, we are basing it off what it could be valued in five to 10 years," Lee said. "So you don't have performance. You're basing it off potential, and that's why this is so difficult." Arguments can be made for or against a higher or lower number. On one hand, OpenAI’s in-demand industry of artificial intelligence and its meteoric pace of growth both justify pushing up its valuation, according to Lee. On the other hand, she said, its business model hasn’t shown a path to profitability, losing roughly $1 billion per year. That, coupled with a market that’s been slow for dealmaking, should drive down the price, Lee added. Alon-Beck said "information asymmetry" and legal compliance requirements to switch from a nonprofit to a for-profit entity also make traditional valuation techniques less reliable. "The organization’s proprietary models, algorithms, and decision-making processes are not fully transparent to potential investors," Alon-Beck said, and that could cause investors to overestimate or underestimate the value. The reclassification to a for-profit structure would be yet another seismic shift for OpenAI, upending the way it was established nearly a decade ago. It began in 2015 as a nonprofit under the name OpenAI Inc., a nod to its mission of advancing humanity instead of pursuing profits. Things got more complicated in 2019 when OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and his team created a for-profit subsidiary to raise outside venture capital — including the billions from Microsoft. It was structured in such a way that the for-profit subsidiary, technically owned by a holding company owned by OpenAI employees and investors, remained under the control of the nonprofit and its board of directors while giving its biggest backer (Microsoft) no board seats and no voting power. The inherent tension between these two parts of the enterprise is what contributed to a dramatic boardroom clash in 2023 when Altman was ousted by the board and then brought back five days later. In the aftermath, Microsoft took a non-voting observer position on OpenAI’s board, only to relinquish that seat this year as both OpenAI and Microsoft came under more regulatory scrutiny. What could make these negotiations even more challenging for OpenAI is that unfair compensation to the nonprofit could expose OpenAI to legal challenges, according to Rose Chan Loui, founding executive director of the University of California Los Angeles's Lowell Milken Center for Philanthropy and Nonprofits. State attorney generals, particularly in Delaware where the nonprofit is registered, could file suit against parties that violate that legal requirement. "One question the investment bankers have to ask is how realistic people are about the valuation … even the negotiation," she said. "I'm wondering who's going to speak for the nonprofit because the other side might have incentive to devalue it." On top of that, Chan Loui said, fair market value would typically include a premium to the nonprofit for giving up future participation and majority control. Microsoft, legal experts said, should be prepared for significant ongoing outlays to transition away from a nonprofit model, as more money will be needed for the valuation work, legal compliance, and operational integration. OpenAI has said it would seek to become a public benefit corporation (PBC), which is required to balance shareholder interests with broader societal benefits. "Microsoft’s financial exposure is not limited to its initial investment," Alon-Beck said. Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow Alexis on X @alexiskweed.

Title: Bitcoin Headed to All-Time High – MicroStrategy Stock Hits $234 and $BTC ETFs Could Hit 1M

We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy is once again in the news, this time with an ATH stock price of $234. Bitcoin ETFs are also nearing 1M $BTC as the last two weeks alone registered $3B inflows. This dual stunner news could be just what Bitcoin needs to shoot through its previous ATH of $73K. The coin recently passed $68K, and it doesn’t seem to be slowing down. MicroStrategy is the biggest corporate Bitcoin holder in the world. As of September 2024, the company owns 252,220 $BTC ($17B), and it keeps buying. According to Scott Melker (crypto investor and author), MicroStrategy ‘has also outperformed all companies in the S&P 500 over the past five years.’ Its stock ($MSTR) is currently $234, an 85.15% increase in the last year and a 271% year-to-date increase. In a recent shareholders proposal, MicroStrategy underlines that $MSTR has outperformed Microsoft stock by 313% this year. They attribute this achievement primarily to the large Bitcoin holding, similar to BlackRock, Microsoft’s second-largest shareholder. $MSTR’s next target is $245, according to Mark Palmer and other stock analysts. It’s far from an impossible task for a company with a 17.8% yield since adopting Bitcoin. US ETF issuers currently hold 976,892 $BTC (over $66.2B), almost 5% of Bitcoin’s total market cap. If it happens this week, we need to see $301M daily net inflows. This should be easy, as Bitcoin ETFs received $3B inflows in the past two weeks alone. Nate Geraci, co-founder of the ETF Institute, posted a chart of spot Bitcoin ETFs since inception. And the increase in holdings speaks for itself. From a zero-dollar industry in January 2024, $BTC ETFs pushed past 600K $BTC in February, nearing 1M $BTC today. Remember, it hasn’t even been a year since $BTC ETFs appeared. And we’re already talking about nearly $67B in total holdings. If we also consider the excellent timing (Russia lifting the Bitcoin mining ban, the Fed potentially cutting interest rates again, and the upcoming US elections), a Bitcoin bull rush might be coming. We know the Bitcoin halving typically leads to a price surge after several months. But we’ve rarely had such great tailwinds accompanying a halving before. Hendrik Andersson (Apollo Capital’s chief investment officer) said a Donald Trump victory would be the ‘biggest deciding factor’ of a crypto market rally. Bitcoin is currently $68.1K, a 1.64% increase in the last 24 hours. Its 24-hour volume also pumped by 41.62%, reaching $21.55B. It’s not every day we say this, but Bitcoin might have one of the best periods in its history. Many puzzle pieces need to fall in place, but the foundation is there. MicroStrategy’s stock price reaching an ATH, $BTC ETFs nearing 1M $BTC, and all the November action should be reasons enough for an epic pump, perhaps one to $172K.

Title: Alphabet's Q3 revenue growth likely to slow as competition pressures Search, YouTube

Business Alphabet will likely post its slowest revenue growth in four quarters on Tuesday, hurt by competition that weighed on its core Google Search business and dented YouTube ad spending. The slowdown in its core business is expected to overshadow AI-driven gains at its cloud-computing business in the third quarter. This quarter was also the company's first since Anat Ashkenazi took over as finance chief from Ruth Porat. Alphabet's long-established dominance of the digital ad market is under threat from the likes of Amazon and TikTok that have become popular with advertisers looking to tap a ready pool of buyers. The other risk Alphabet faces is from regulators who are considering breaking up Google to loosen what they call its "illegal monopoly" on online search. Analysts expect Google Search and other related revenue to grow 11.6 per cent in the third quarter, slower than the 13.8 per cent increase in the second quarter, according to Visible Alpha. "New entrants like Perplexity and ChatGPT are raising billions of dollars on the premise that search can now be disrupted; Google has been seen as slow, unprepared ... to the development of GenAI," MoffettNathanson analysts said. "Some of this negative narrative will be hard to disprove in the coming year," the analysts said, adding that they expect significant changes in Google's ability to maintain its exclusive search advantage on Apple and Android phones in the United States. In a report earlier this month that raised alarm bells among investors, research firm eMarketer said Google's share of U.S. search advertising revenue was set to fall below 50 per cent next year for the first time in at least 18 years. Amazon's search advertising revenue share in the U.S. is expected to grow to 24 per cent next year, while generative AI rivals such as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos-backed Perplexity AI are also snatching some ad dollars from Google. Google is working to improve the effectiveness of its tools. It has started showing ads in the AI-generated summaries it has begun placing at the top of search results, a move that analysts believe may help stave off competition. Alphabet's shares fell nearly 9 per cent in the three months to September, marking their largest quarterly drop since the third quarter of 2022. But they have risen 17 per cent so far this year. Overall, Alphabet's revenue is expected to have increased 12.6 per cent in the third quarter to $86.31 billion, slower than the 13.6 per cent growth in the second quarter, according to analysts' estimates compiled by LSEG. YouTube is also expected to have suffered from some marketers shifting spending to ad-supported tiers of streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. YouTube revenue likely rose 11.5 per cent, compared with a 13 per cent increase in the second quarter. Despite the deceleration, analysts from Truist expect YouTube, especially YouTube TV, to have benefited from a boost in political ad spending in the third quarter. Google Cloud, a bright spot, is set to record faster growth of 29.2 per cent, the biggest jump in seven quarters, as customers increased their spending on its AI services, including the Vertex AI platform that allows businesses to use the company's models as well as develop their own custom models. Alphabet warned in July that capital expenses would remain high this year as it invested in AI to keep up with rivals. Google's cloud peers have also flagged higher capital expenditures as they too rush to enhance their offerings with AI. Amazon's cloud business revenue likely rose 19.3 per cent in the September quarter, while revenue from Microsoft's cloud unit is expected to have risen around 11 per cent. Investors will look for what Chief Financial Officer Ashkenazi does to keep other costs in check. BofA analysts said with her appointment, there was "potential for the company to 'surprise' with further self-help cost cutting actions after limited layoffs in 2024."

Our Products Free Tools Best Of How Tos WPBeginner»Blog»Showcase»6 Best Online Order Form Plugins for WordPress (Expert Picks) By Editorial Staff | Reviewed by Syed Balkhi | October 28, 2024 | Reader Disclosure Creating an efficient online ordering system is important for every eCommerce store. It helps streamline the purchasing process and boost the customer experience. However, WordPress doesn’t offer order form features by default. You’ll need an eCommerce plugin to get them.

So, we further investigated our favorite form builder alongside other popular order form tools to share a list of the best options with you. Each plugin has unique features that cater to different types of businesses. Whether you’re selling products, services, or digital downloads, there’s a solution for you. Now, let’s go over some of the best order form plugins for WordPress! Are you in a hurry?

WPForms is the best online order form builder on the market, and it’s trusted by more than 6 million websites, including us! Our hands-on experience gives us confidence in recommending this tool, as we know its strengths and limitations firsthand. To learn more about this plugin, you can read our full WPForms review. If you’re a non-tech-savvy restaurant owner or local entrepreneur, don’t worry. WPForms makes creating an online order form in WordPress easy with its drag-and-drop builder, a feature that allows you to customize forms without coding. What’s more, the plugin offers ready-made templates like the ‘Billing / Order Form,’ which includes fields for customer details. Speaking of order form templates, we were particularly impressed by the tool’s 141 ready-made templates in the ‘Order’ subcategory. In our opinion, this shows WPForms’ commitment to user-friendliness, especially with specific forms for takeout orders, t-shirt sales, and various service bookings. For more information, feel free to check out our guide on how to make an online order form. When it comes to eCommerce integration, WPForms goes the extra mile. Whether you’re offering memberships, online courses, or digital products, it works really well with 12 powerful eCommerce tools. They include WooCommerce, Easy Digital Downloads, Shopify, and MemberPress. If you want, you can also integrate WPForms with Constant Contact for email marketing automation and Advanced Coupons to manage discount codes and promotions. On top of that, you can connect it to payment processors like PayPal and Stripe. This allows customers to pay directly through the form, making it easy to manage orders and payments for your business. For more details, you might want to see our guide on how to create a WordPress form with payment options. Another great feature that WPForms offers is customizable email notifications. These let you alert your team of new orders and send automatic receipts to customers for confirmation. Pros: Cons: Why we chose the WPForms plugin: WPForms is the best online form builder with over 2000 templates, flexible customization, and built-in spam protection. It also has advanced features like automated workflows. Pricing: WPForms lets you start for free with WPForms Lite, which includes basic templates and integrations. To access more features, you will need to upgrade to the premium version starting at $39.60 per year. If you want to sell just one product on your site, then you don’t need a full-fledged online store or a fancy shopping cart. Instead, you can create a simple order form for customers to fill out. WP Simple Pay, a top Stripe plugin for WordPress, lets you set all this up. Feel free to get more information about the platform in our complete WP Simple Pay review. Unlike many Stripe plugins, WP Simple Pay doesn’t charge an extra 3% fee on transactions, which we think is a huge plus! Also, while it has a strong reputation for its integration with Stripe, it also supports more than 10 payment gateways. After installing, you’ll follow a simple setup wizard to connect your Stripe account. You’ll then easily find a template to fit your needs. This lets you create a form that matches your business without starting from scratch. Then, we found WP Simple Pay’s Stripe automatic tax calculation to be very handy. It’s based on where your customers are, which helps you save time and stay compliant so you can focus more on your business. When it comes to inventory management, this plugin also makes it easy. During our research, we discovered that WP Simple Pay automatically shows or hides forms based on stock levels, which helps you maintain customer trust by preventing sales of out-of-stock items. Pros: Cons: Why we chose the WP Simple Pay plugin: Based on our findings, WP Simple Pay’s user-friendly templates, automatic features, and easy integration with Stripe make it a great choice for anyone looking to sell products online. That said, it can also be a streamlined option if you only want to sell a single product. Pricing: Stripe Payment Forms by WP Simple Pay offers a free option, but it charges a 3% transaction fee. To remove this fee and unlock more features, you can upgrade to a premium plan starting at $49.50 per year for the Personal plan. Formidable Forms, in general, is a great choice for creating advanced forms like quizzes, calculators, and custom designs. We were pleasantly surprised to find that it’s also great for building online order forms, which is why we included it on our list. We have tested it thoroughly to learn about all its features. You can learn more in our complete review of Formidable Forms. During setup, we found that Formidable Forms offers 16 online order form templates for creating simple payment forms. Then, it lets users collect payments through popular gateways like PayPal, Stripe, and Authorize.net. When creating the order form, you might want to include a ‘Summary’ field. We like how it provides an automatic overview of the order, which can help boost user experience. Plus, we appreciate Formidable Forms’ compatibility with WooCommerce. It also supports extra integrations with Zapier and Mailchimp. Pros: Cons: Why we chose the Formidable Forms plugin: Overall, Formidable Forms is a great tool for creating professional online order forms. The automatic order summary feature significantly enhances the user experience. Plus, its compatibility with WooCommerce opens up even more eCommerce possibilities. Pricing: Formidable Forms Lite is free and lets you create unlimited forms. For advanced features like lead collection, you’ll need a premium plan, which starts at $39.50 per year. It’s a solid choice for those on a budget who need professional online forms for their small business or blog. Ninja Forms is one of the best plugins for handling complex calculations, making it perfect for managing online orders. It also integrates with many different CRM platforms, so it’s ideal for customer management. While we don’t use it on our site, we have researched and tested this plugin to see if it lives up to its reputation. For more details, you can read our complete Ninja Forms review. When exploring its features, we were surprised to find only 2 ready-made form templates for accepting online payments. Even though it can be more time-consuming, there’s also a blank canvas option to create your online order form from scratch. The good news is that we discovered that you can activate various payment add-ons for PayPal, Stripe, Authorize.net, and Elavon. Then, depending on your chosen gateway, you can also offer options like ‘buy now, pay later‘ and accept payments through popular services like Google Pay, Apple Pay, and Venmo. When it comes to simplifying your workflow, Ninja Forms offers automation integrations with Webhooks and Zapier. We also found that it excels in CRM platform integration, allowing you to manage customer data effectively. Based on our findings, it looks like Ninja Forms works well with Salesforce CRM, HubSpot CRM, Zoho CRM, and more. Pros: Cons: Why we chose the Ninja Forms plugins: Our overall impression was that Ninja Forms is a solid choice for anyone looking to streamline their online order process. It has flexible payment options and works great with different CRM platforms. Plus, its automation features with Webhooks and Zapier make it super easy to manage customer data. Pricing: You can download the free Ninja Forms plugin from WordPress, which is ideal for multiple websites. The pro plan starts at $99 per year, allowing unlimited forms and submissions, plus access to more add-ons and integrations with popular email services like ConvertKit and Constant Contact. Like Formidable Forms, Gravity Forms is a popular choice for building complex WordPress order forms. However, the main difference is that Gravity Forms has a much higher number of CRM integrations for managing customer data. Although we don’t use it on our website, we downloaded and thoroughly tested Gravity Forms to check if it deserves the hype. Here’s our full Gravity Forms review if you want to learn more about this plugin. During setup, we found 3 pre-made templates you can use to create an online order form. They are ‘Ecommerce PayPal Form Template,’ ‘Ecommerce Stripe Form Template,’ and ‘Ecommerce Form Template.’ Gravity Forms works with popular payment gateways like Stripe, PayPal, Authorize.net, and Mollie. With its Payment add-ons, you can sell digital downloads or physical products easily. We also discovered that you can handle one-time and recurring payments. When testing Gravity Forms, one feature that stood out was its ‘Dynamic Population’ field. This lets customers pre-fill fields like a phone number or email if they already have that info. It makes filling out forms easier and helps reduce the chances of people abandoning their orders. Now, do note that Gravity Forms’ Pro plan costs $159 a year, and it includes eCommerce add-ons you might need for all these to work. If you’re already using CRMs like Zoho or Capsule, this plan has just what you need to keep things running smoothly. Pros: Cons: Why we chose the Gravity Forms plugin: Overall, Gravity Forms is a powerful choice for managing payments and making it easier for customers to shop on your WordPress site. Pricing: Gravity Forms is a premium plugin that doesn’t offer a free version or trial, but you can try it through an online demo. It has three pricing plans designed for various business needs. The ‘Basic’ plan costs $59 per year, allowing unlimited forms and submissions. For a completely free order order form plugin, Quick/Bulk Order Form for WooCommerce could be your best bet. This plugin is exclusive to WooCommerce users only. So if you’re not using the platform, then this tool won’t work for you. We also don’t use it on our blog or brand websites. But we tested it extensively to see all its features, and we believe it’s a great option for adding an online order form to a WooCommerce store. During testing, we learned that Quick/Bulk Order Form for WooCommerce allows you to set up bulk order forms using a simple questionnaire: In this section, you can set the maximum number of items for customers to bulk order. Then, if there are products you don’t want to be available for bulk orders, you can easily exclude these products using their IDs. What’s more, you can also display specific product categories that are relevant for bulk ordering. We really like these features, as they help prevent lost profits. There’s also an Ajax-based product search to help users find what they need faster. If you want, you can display or hide the price on the bulk order form. When it comes to embedding the bulk order form, just use the shortcode [wcbulkorder] on a WordPress page, and you’re good to go. Pros: Cons: Why we chose the Quick/Bulk Order Form for WooCommerce plugin: After testing this plugin, we think it’s a great free option for WooCommerce users wanting to simplify their ordering process. You can tailor forms and exclude specific products to maximize profits. Pricing: Free to download and use from the WordPress plugin directory. When it comes to online order forms, our top choices are WPForms, WP Simple Pay, and Formidable Forms. WPForms is hands-down the best form builder we’ve used on WPBeginner. It’s user-friendly and offers 141 ready-made order form templates. Also, it integrates smoothly with 12 eCommerce tools, such as WooCommerce and Shopify, and supports payment processors like PayPal and Stripe. Plus, customizable email notifications help keep everyone updated. If you’re looking to sell just one product, WP Simple Pay is a fantastic option. It lets you create simple order forms without a full online store and doesn’t charge an extra 3% transaction fee. The plugin also automatically calculates taxes based on customer location and manages inventory by showing or hiding forms as needed. Lastly, Formidable Forms is ideal for advanced users. It provides 16 order form templates and supports popular payment gateways like PayPal and Stripe.

Title: Nike’s CEO climbed from intern to the corner office. Here are 11 Fortune 500 CEOs who did the same—and how long it took
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/10/28/ceos-climb-entry-level-corner-office-entire-career/
Time Published: 2024-10-28T09:45:00Z
Full Content:
Employees stay at the same company for just under four years on average. That number shrinks considerably for millennials, who, by some estimates, remain with an employer for just under three years on average. There are arguments in favor of and against job-hopping. On the one hand, job-hopping allows professionals to pick up new skills, expand their responsibilities, and more quickly propel them to executive positions. Starbucks’ new CEO Brian Niccol, for instance, held jobs at Procter & Gamble, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell before reaching the corner office at Chipotle. On the other hand, moving up within a company allows leaders to gain a deeper understanding of the organization, develop strong internal networks, and capitalize on their reputation. Although it’s increasingly become rare among younger professionals, staying at the same company for one’s entire career does still occur. Nike CEO Elliott Hill is among the latest Fortune 500 chief executives to climb his way from an entry-level role to the corner office. Fortune compiled a list of current Fortune 500 executives who’ve spent their careers at the same company. It took these CEOs, on average, a little over 33 years to climb from the most junior position to CEO. Many held strategy and operations roles along the way, as well as tech roles. Many also led high-visibility projects, oversaw company-wide transformations and M&A deals, and sought out new ways to streamline business processes. Several large companies that are not on the Fortune 500 also boast chief executives or presidents who spent their entire careers there. EY CEO Janet Truncale began her 33-year career at the consulting firm as an intern in 1991 and was elevated to the corner office in July 2024. Similarly, Roger Goodell joined the NFL in 1982 as an administrative intern. He became NFL commissioner in 2006. Bob Iger, Walt Disney CEO How long it took to become CEO: 31 years Disney deems itself “the greatest place on earth.” Iger seems to agree based on his 50-year tenure at the company. Iger kicked off his career at the Mouse House in 1974 as a self-described “not very good” weatherman for ABC in Ithaca, N.Y. After Disney acquired ABC in 1996, it appointed Iger to its senior management team as chairman of the broadcast company. Four years later, he became Disney’s president and chief operating officer and took the helm as CEO in 2005. Iger briefly retired in 2020 but returned to the corner office in Nov. 2022 after the ouster of his hand-picked heir, Bob Chapek. Iger credits his success at Disney to three things: hard work, great mentors, and great luck. He also stated that it’s more important to be respected as a boss than to be popular. “If you try to run a popularity contest, then you don’t make the tough decisions. I think you have to be fair, accessible, and communicative—but popularity is not one of them,” he said at Bloomberg’s Global Business Forum in 2019. Rodney McMullen, Kroger CEO How long it took to become CEO: 36 years McMullen’s adventures at Kroger began in 1978 as a part-time stock clerk in Lexington, Ky., while in college. He jokes that he had a Kroger scholarship. “I just had to work 32 hours a week to get it.” Before his CEO appointment in 2014, he was named the supermarket chain’s CFO in 1995, where he led the $13 billion Fred Meyer merger. He took on the role of executive vice president of strategy, planning, and finance in 2000, was elected to the board of directors in 2003, and became president and COO in 2009. Former Kroger CEO David Dillon said in the announcement of McMullen’s appointment that the incoming CEO “played a leadership role in every major decision Kroger has made in the past 25 years,” which included the implementation of the Kroger Customer First and Associate First strategy, an effort for the supermarket to better connect with its customers. When hiring, McMullen told The Wall Street Journal that he looks for people who are high energy and eager to learn. They must also be values-driven. Mary Barra, General Motors CEO How long it took to become CEO: 34 years In 1980, Barra joined General Motors at 18 years old as a co-op student on the Pontiac assembly line. She served in numerous director roles, including executive vice president of global product development, where she oversaw all of GM’s suppliers and subsidiaries. GM named her CEO in 2014, the first female CEO in the car industry. Barra has held on to the corner office for more than double the average amount of time for a female Fortune 500 CEO of 4½ years. “You just got to do the right thing and move forward. That’s something I learned very early in my tenure as CEO going through the ignition switch crisis,” Barra told Fortune at the 2024 Most Powerful Women Summit. She noted that the best time to solve a problem is immediately because it rarely gets smaller. Doug McMillon, Walmart CEO How long it took to become CEO: 30 years Walmart hasn’t strayed from the No. 1 spot on the Fortune 500 ranking since McMillon’s CEO appointment in 2014. McMillion joined Walmart in 1984 as an associate, making $6.50 an hour. He held an assistant manager role in Oklahoma while completing his MBA at the University of Tulsa. His career trajectory has seen him serve as the general merchandise manager of Sam’s Club, a subsidiary of Walmart, where he oversaw several divisions. In 2006, he was appointed CEO and president of Sam’s Club. Four years later, he became CEO of Walmart International until his promotion to Walmart CEO in 2014. In his 10 years leading the company, McMillon has grown revenue by $162 billion. The 58-year-old credits his rise at Walmart to constantly raising his hand and volunteering for new projects. “People saw me handling responsibility one level up, which made it easy for them to promote me,” he said at the Duke University Fuqua School of Business distinguished speaker series in 2017. Enrique Lores, HP CEO How long it took to become CEO: 30 years During Lores’s final year of his MBA program in 1989, Hewlett-Packard recruiters visited the school to promote an electrical engineering internship. “[They] were talking about printers like they were the best thing in life,” he joked in 2021. He scored the electrical engineering internship and has been with the company since. Lores has held many leadership roles across functions at the computer company. He’s worked in printing, imaging, sales, system operations roles, and customer support. In 2015, he led HP’s separation from Hewlett-Packard, one of the biggest splits in corporate America’s history. Post-split, he became EMEA president, overseeing sales and performance of these regions. He was tapped for the corner office in late 2019. The true sign of a good leader, he said in a conversation at Santa Clara University, is one with strong values and who knows what they stand for and what their limitations are. John Stankey, AT&T CEO How long it took to become CEO: 35 years Stankey began his career in 1985, immediately after undergrad, at the phone company Pacific Bell. As the phone carrier consolidated, Stankey rose through the ranks and ran parts of SBC Southwestern Bell. He was promoted to chief information officer of the carrier after it merged with AT&T in 2005 and chief technology officer in 2008. Much of Stankey’s pre-CEO experience was in strategy and operations roles. He was named chief strategy officer in 2012, became CEO of AT&T Entertainment Group in 2015, and CEO of WarnerMedia in 2018. In 2019, he was appointed COO and president, a role he held for 10 months before stepping into the corner office. He told Fortune in August that luck and timing, neither of which people have much control over, helped him advance to senior levels. “Do your job and do it well, but don’t let the variables that are related to luck and timing dominate or impact your state of mind … try to be thoughtful and correct as many of the fundamental decisions as you can, but don’t let it paralyze you,” he said. Arvind Krishna, IBM CEO How long it took to become CEO: 30 years Krishna began his career at IBM in 1990 on the Watson research team, now focused on AI technology research, where he remained for 18 years. In 2009, he became general manager of information management software, followed by leadership roles like senior vice president of hybrid cloud in IBM’s research department. He was appointed senior vice president of cloud and cognitive software in 2020, where he was the principal architect in IBM’s acquisition of Red Hat, one of the largest acquisitions in the company’s history. Before his CEO appointment in 2023, Krishna played a key role in developing the company’s key technologies, including AI, cloud, quantum computing, and blockchain, said former IBM chairman Ginni Rometty. Speaking at the Duke University Fuqua School of Business in 2023, Krishna said good leadership is about conviction and making decisions that empower others around a shared goal. “Merit and the right idea do carry a lot of weight. But you’ve got to be persistent, and it’s got to be clear to the organization you are in that you’re not doing it for personal gain … it’s for the betterment of the organization.” Bob Jordan, Southwest Airlines CEO How long it took to become CEO: 34 years When Jordan arrived in Dallas in 1988 to interview for a Southwest Airlines programmer analyst role, he didn’t know much about the company. But during his interview, an employee had an issue with the airline’s computer system that he was able to fix. The company offered him a job the next day. In his first 20 years at the airline, Jordan held several director and vice president roles, including executive vice president of strategy and technology and senior vice president of enterprise spend management, before being promoted to executive vice president of strategy and planning in 2008. In 2011, Jordan was tapped as Southwest’s chief commercial officer, spearheading its 2014 acquisition of AirTrain, a low-cost airline, and the launch of AirTran’s e-commerce platform and reward program. He was named executive vice president of corporate services in 2017 and served in this role until 2022 when he stepped into the corner office. Jordan sat down with Fortune in 2022 to discuss the airline’s post-pandemic bounceback and how he motivates employees to follow his lead after a tumultuous period for those in the travel industry. “You have to demonstrate that you care. Words only go so far,” he said. “I need to be out there making sure I listen, understand what’s happening, engage with our employees, and just be there for them.” Raj Subramaniam, FedEx CEO How long it took to become CEO: 31 years Subramaniam thought getting a job at FedEx was a long shot when, in 1991, he applied as an associate marketing analyst in its international division. It was the middle of a recession, and he’d only just received his MBA. Still, he figured he’d throw his hat in the ring. He got the job. Early in his tenure at the company, Subramaniam was placed on a project heading the company’s international expansion despite being a junior-level employee. “Here I was at the bottom of the pyramid, but saying, ‘Hey, put me in chief,’” he recently told Time. That opportunity gave him visibility at the company, and he was promoted to vice president of marketing in Asia Pacific in 1996. From there, he served as regional president of Canada from 2003 to 2006 and senior vice president of FedEx Services from 2006 to 2013. Subramaniam also served as president and CEO of FedEx Express for three months before his promotion to COO and president in 2019. After three years, he was appointed CEO, becoming just the second chief executive in FedEx’s 53-year history. Subramaniam believes a leader’s job is to build the right leadership team for execution. Once that’s in place, he said, the leader’s job “becomes being able to remove barriers for execution,” Subramaniam told The Conference Board. Ron Vachris, Costco CEO How long it took to become CEO: 42 years Although less than a year in the corner office, Vachris is a Costco veteran. He began as a forklift driver at Price Club, later purchased by Costco, in 1982 at the age of 17. He worked his way up to a store clerk while a student at Glendale Community College in Arizona and was elevated to assistant general manager and general manager positions in Colorado in 1989. Vachris played a sizable role in Costco’s expansion after the company acquired Price Club in 1993, moving back to Arizona to oversee the expansion. He held multiple leadership positions after the merger, including general manager of the Northwest region, senior vice president of real estate, and executive vice president of merchandising. In February 2022, he became the company’s chief operating officer and president before becoming CEO at the beginning of 2024. Earlier this year, Vachris told Fortune that his leadership philosophy is not only customer-centric but also employee-centric. He listens to his underlings and trusts their insights. “You’ve got to give people room to try new things,” he said. Elliott Hill, Nike CEO How long it took to become CEO: 32 years Hill has followed Nike’s directive to “just do it” and become the sports retailer’s newly-minted CEO. In 1988, Hill joined the company as a 19-year-old intern in apparel sales. He spent much of his early career in this division, though he never held a role for more than four years before getting promoted. In 2000, he was promoted to his first vice president role, overseeing sales and retail in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. After serving as vice president and general manager of North America from 2010 to 2013, he was promoted to president of geographies and sales in 2016 before retiring in 2020. At the time of his retirement, he was president of consumer and marketplace, a $39 billion business. The 60-year-old recently came out of retirement to return to Nike after former CEO John Donahoe stepped down following declining sales. Hill said in a recent Nike press release that his immediate goals to get the company back on track include refocusing on the consumer, understanding areas for improvement, and holding each other accountable for delivering on its promise. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Nvidia has lots riding on this week even as earnings a month out

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. isn’t expected to announce earnings for another month, but results this week from the chipmaker’s biggest customers are about to set the tone for its shares, which are trading near an all-time high on optimism around the AI boom. Most Read from Bloomberg The Tartarian Candidate A Courtyard Apartment Building Designed for Southwest Sprawl Inside NYC’s Playbook for Getting Federal Grant Funds Booming Cambridge Exposes England’s Widening Wealth Gap Robotaxis Are No Friend of Public Transportation Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. all announce earnings in the coming days. Traders will be paying close attention to their capital spending to gauge demand for Nvidia’s chips, which are prized for artificial intelligence computing. The group accounted for more than 40% of Nvidia’s sales in the second quarter, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Wall Street expects the four tech giants to unveil a record amount of capital expenditures, but any disappointment around the pace of outlays stands to rattle Nvidia shares, which have almost tripled this year, adding more than $2 trillion in market value. It’s likely to be a pivotal stretch for the entire stock market. Nvidia has been the biggest contributor to the S&P 500 Index’s gains this year, accounting for about a quarter of its 22% advance. “If these companies come out and broadly say that capex is increasing even at a modest rate, that’s what Nvidia really needs to keep this momentum going,” said Dave Mazza, chief executive officer at Roundhill Investments. “If anything is poor you could see a lot come out of the stock.” The four tech behemoths are projected to have pumped a combined record $56 billion into capital expenditures in the third quarter, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Much of that spending is going to Nvidia and other makers of AI-related gear, and it’s projected to rise further in the coming quarters. All signs point to continued strength in AI-related spending. From chip equipment maker ASML Holding NV to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., AI has been a bright spot this earnings season. That backdrop has helped propel Nvidia shares, along with reassurances from CEO Jensen Huang that production of its new Blackwell chips is on track and in high demand. Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the heavy spending on AI computing equipment. The stock hit a record high last week and its market capitalization is now roughly $3.5 trillion, just shy of Apple Inc., which is still the world’s most valuable company. To be sure, there has been some concern around all the spending on AI by the Big Tech companies, given investors’ perception that the billions of dollars the firms have invested has generated relatively little in revenue. So that will be another focus as the cohort announces earnings this week. “You’ve got to walk that fine line of investment,” said Paul Marino, chief revenue officer at Themes ETFs, so that investors see you’re “not getting too far ahead of yourself.” Nvidia’s revenue is projected to more than double this year to $125.6 billion, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Next year, sales are estimated to increase 44% to $181 billion, in the chipmaker’s fiscal 2026. Of course, there are other beneficiaries of high AI spending for which this week will be important to watch, including Broadcom Inc., Super Micro Computer Inc. and Dell Technologies Inc. Top Tech Stories Indonesia blocked Apple Inc. from selling its latest iPhones in Southeast Asia’s largest economy, saying the company has yet to meet local investment requirements. When Meg Whitman was living in California and running first eBay Inc. and then HP Inc., the idea that Africa had some role to play in her businesses rarely crossed her mind. “I literally thought about Africa 1% of my time,” she says. Olympus Corp. pushed out its chief executive officer after investigating an allegation he purchased illegal drugs, a stunning exit for the German native after less than two years at the helm. Hong Kong outlined its first policy guidelines dedicated to the use of AI in finance and floated a tax break for virtual assets, part of efforts to promote itself as an Asian business center.

Title: How a Trump or Harris presidency could impact your investments
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/market-impact-presidential-election-scenarios-trump-harris-stocks-bonds-crypto-2024-10
Time Published: 2024-10-28T09:00:01Z
Full Content:
With the presidential election just over a week away, and the candidates in a dead heat in the polls, Americans are in suspense about how their lives will change under a new leader. Business Insider has prepared a five-part refresher amid the final stretch to unpack the impacts that either a Donald Trump or a Kamala Harris presidency could have on US consumers. This first installment is focused on the investment landscape. Trump and Harris have each outlined policy proposals that would affect different parts of the stock market. The platform of whoever wins will also be crucial in determining the path of interest rates, which shape the bond market. But they're not expected to have diametrically opposed impacts on everything, with both candidates seen as positive forces for crypto. Detailed below is the latest research and commentary from top Wall Street strategists outlining how the market and investing landscape could shift under a Trump or a Harris administration. The guide covers four asset classes and is divided between the impact Trump or Harris could have on each. For equities, it's helpful to look at how both the micro (specific sectors set to be affected) and the macro (how the broader market will respond) could be influenced. Much of the industry guidance for the stock market under Trump boils down to his proposed tax policies. Bank of America estimates his plan to cut the corporate tax rate to 15% from 21% would boost corporate earnings by 4%. How much it would influence each sector would ultimately depend on sensitivity to changes in the tax rate. To that end, BofA says the consumer-discretionary and communication-services sectors — the areas most sensitive to tax-rate changes — would benefit the most. On the flip side, less exposed areas, such as utilities, real estate, and energy, would get the smallest boost. For energy, specifically, Trump's pro-drilling stance — while supportive of industry activity — would likely lead to oversupply and lower oil prices, BNY Wealth says. That, in turn, would hurt corporate profitability in the sector and drag on stock prices. It's also worth noting that energy was the worst-performing sector during Trump's administration. Another area of the stock market seen as benefiting from a Trump win is financials. Allies of the former president have said he aims to unburden banks from many of the regulations that were imposed following the 2008 financial crisis, something that his first administration tried to do, with limited success. Those looser regulations could also ignite a fresh wave of mergers and acquisitions, which would increase advisory revenue for big banks and help drive up profits from dealmaking. Views on the full equity-market landscape are divided, particularly along partisan lines. Trump's proposed tax and regulatory policies are seen by his supporters as pro-business moves that would be good news for corporate profit growth and deal activity. But Trump critics say his proposal for universal tariffs and steeper levies on Chinese imports — as well as a crackdown on immigration — would be inflationary, which could hold back stock prices. The nonpartisan Tax Foundation says the tariff plan, in particular, could hurt profit margins and put pressure on consumer spending. Bank of America estimates that 60% tariffs on China and 10% on other countries would lower S&P 500 earnings per share by 3.1%. That would be a problem since earnings growth has long been the stock market's primary driver of gains. "The conventional wisdom is wrong: Trump is not going to substantially cut taxes once in office; he is going to raise taxes by jacking up tariffs. To the extent that this dampens economic activity, it is bad news for stocks," BCA Research's chief strategist, Peter Berezin, said. Just like with Trump, much of the guidance around the stock market under Harris involves her tax plan. Her proposal to hike the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% would have an inverse effect on sectors. That means consumer discretionary and communication services — the top beneficiaries under Trump — would be hit the hardest under a Harris administration, BofA says. "Consumer discretionary stocks have underperformed the S&P 500 modestly since Harris' presidential candidacy was announced, perhaps reflecting concerns that a Democratic President could result in higher corporate taxes and employee wages," BNY Wealth said. Financial firms could also feel a negative impact from both higher taxes and Harris' proposed regulatory tightening. But there are bright spots. A Harris victory would likely benefit homebuilder stocks because of her proposal to build 3 million houses. Renewable-energy stocks would also likely see gains because of Democrats' favorable views of wind and solar energy. Both sectors have outperformed in recent months during periods when Harris saw positive momentum in election polls. The stock market has soared to records during Joe Biden's presidency, up more than 50% since his inauguration, and a Harris win would likely continue many of the policies that have supported the market. Those include infrastructure investments and tax incentives to bring manufacturing jobs back to the country, such as in the semiconductor industry via the CHIPS and Science Act. But BofA says Harris' proposed tax hike would also put downward pressure on corporate profits, with an estimated 5% earnings hit. Beyond that, a quadrupling of the stock-buyback tax to 4% could also take 1% off S&P 500 profits, the firm said. With all these crosscurrents swirling, a neutral market outcome must also be assessed. Capital Economics says it believes neither a Trump nor Harris win will mean all that much for stock prices because bigger trends — specifically, artificial intelligence — will shape the market's direction. "Our upbeat projections for the stock market in 2024 and 2025 are predicated on a view that hype over AI will continue to fuel a stock market bubble," the research firm said. Capital Economics has a 2025 year-end target of 7,000 for the S&P 500, regardless of which candidate wins the election. Meanwhile, Bank of America says that as long as corporate profits continue to grow, the stock market will rise regardless of who wins the White House. The performance of the US bond market largely hinges on the direction of interest rates. As interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall, and vice versa. And since presidential actions usually influence rates, the bond market will likely be shaped by what either Trump or Harris ends up doing. A Trump win is seen as a scenario that would usher in higher interest rates, which would push bond prices lower. It ultimately boils down to inflation. Economists see Trump's double-whammy proposals of mass deportation and universal tariffs as inflationary. And since the Federal Reserve's primary tool for fighting inflation is raising interest rates, bond prices would suffer if yields rose. "Our assessment is that a Trump win would lead to higher US yields," Capital Economics said. Forecasts from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget — a nonprofit think tank — say a wider deficit and an increasing pile of debt under a Trump presidency, compared with a Harris presidency, would also put upward pressure on interest rates. That would also hurt the performance of bonds. Capital Economics says it expects interest rates to fall under a Harris win, which would be good news for bonds, as she likely wouldn't pursue certain inflationary policies like tariffs or immigrant deportations, which could fuel wage inflation. Harris' policies, considered to be less inflationary than Trump's, would also likely allow the Federal Reserve to continue cutting interest rates, which would boost bond prices. In a Bloomberg survey of institutional investors last month, 30% of respondents said they would add to their bond exposure if Harris won, while just 17% said they would buy more bonds if Trump won. Additionally, 46% of respondents said they would reduce their bond exposure if Trump won, compared with just 23% under a Harris win. A Trump win is seen as bullish for bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency industry, as Trump has firmly embraced digital assets in recent years. The Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani said bitcoin could hit $90,000 by December if Trump won the election, about 37% above its current level. "Elections remain hard to call, but if you are long crypto here, you are likely taking a Trump trade," Chhugani said. Harris has also embraced the crypto industry in recent months, though she's seen as slightly less bullish than Trump, given his public displays of support, including addressing crypto conferences and launching his own nonfungible tokens. Yet Wall Street seems to think that a big case for bitcoin will remain intact no matter who wins. The US government debt pile is expected to grow regardless of who controls the White House. That scenario is among bitcoin's biggest bull theses. "I'm not sure if either President or other candidate would make a difference. I do believe the utilization of digital assets is going to become more and more of a reality worldwide," BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said during his company's third-quarter earnings call. Trump's tax plan and protectionist trade policies are expected to strengthen the dollar. This is the opposite of what the presidential hopeful has said he wants since a weaker currency makes a nation's exports more competitive in global trade. These policies are expected to be inflationary, which would push interest rates higher and could prompt the Fed to tighten. Those climbing rates would then underpin dollar gains. If Trump retakes the White House, "the dollar would probably rally sharply, at least in the near term, on expectations of higher US tariffs and interest rates," Capital Economics said in a recent research note. A Harris presidency would continue the trends of a weaker dollar because of the "policy continuity" with the Biden administration, Capital Economics said. Since Harris' overall platform is less expansionary, it's expected to drive less inflationary pressure and therefore keep the coast clear for the Fed to cut rates and stimulate the economy as planned. That likelihood of lower interest would, in turn, push the dollar lower. Jump to

Gold prices have soared to new heights, reaching a record $2,733 per ounce, while Bitcoin is thriving, approaching the $70,000 mark. The rally has been fueled by increased investor demand for safe-haven assets amid the Fed’s rate cuts, China’s stimulus plan, and rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. This has reignited the debate over which asset makes for a better investment: gold or Bitcoin. Bitwise Asset Management, a firm specializing in crypto index funds and ETFs, views Bitcoin and gold as assets with distinct advantages. In an interview with Quartz, Matthew Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, explained that while Bitcoin has the potential for higher returns, gold offers greater stability. He emphasized that Bitcoin holds more advantages over gold, particularly in terms of growth potential and long-term utility. Bitcoin is often referred to as “digital gold” because it shares several key characteristics with the precious metal. Like gold, Bitcoin has a finite supply as only 21 million coins will ever be mined, creating a built-in scarcity that many believe will drive its value higher over time. This limited supply introduces a deflationary element, contrasting with traditional fiat currencies that can be printed at will. Additionally, both Bitcoin and gold are decentralized assets. This means they operate independently of central banks or governmental control, making them less susceptible to policy-driven fluctuations. Investors see this as a hedge against economic instability, particularly during times of inflation or market volatility. Consequently, both assets are often viewed as safe havens, providing a store of value when traditional markets experience downturns. Despite the striking similarities between Bitcoin and gold, there are also significant differences, one of which is price volatility. Bitcoin tends to experience far more dramatic price fluctuations than gold, sometimes within a single day. According to Hougan, the role of Bitcoin in an investment portfolio differs fundamentally from that of gold. While both assets can serve as hedges, Bitcoin’s higher volatility means it can amplify gains or losses, making it more suitable for investors willing to take on risk for potentially higher rewards. In contrast, gold’s stability offers a more conservative approach, providing steady protection against economic uncertainties. “When you add Bitcoin to a portfolio, it boosts returns without increasing risk, and when you add gold to a portfolio, you get the same return but less risk,” he told Quartz. Hougan pointed out that, despite their similarities and differences, gold and Bitcoin do not have the same impact on an investment portfolio. He used a vivid analogy to illustrate this, comparing the two assets to ingredients in a soup. Adding gold to a portfolio, he explained, is like adding water to a soup—it doesn’t alter the flavor significantly unless a substantial amount is added. Gold’s stability and gradual influence mean it acts as a steadying force, but its effect is subtle unless it forms a large part of the investment mix. In contrast, Hougan likened adding Bitcoin to a portfolio to adding pepper to a soup; even a small amount can make a noticeable difference. Due to its higher volatility and growth potential, Bitcoin can have a pronounced impact on portfolio performance, amplifying returns but also introducing greater risk. This analogy underscores how Bitcoin, despite its smaller allocation, can play a more dynamic and immediate role in an investor’s strategy. In his analysis, Matthew Hougan referenced data from Bitwise that demonstrated how even a modest allocation of Bitcoin—such as 1.0%, 2.5%, or 5.0%—to a traditional 60/40 stock-and-bond portfolio could significantly enhance returns while only marginally increasing risk. For instance, a 2.5% allocation to Bitcoin was shown to improve overall portfolio returns by as much as 50 percentage points, with only a slight uptick in volatility. This suggests that Bitcoin’s potential for high growth can meaningfully boost portfolio performance, even at low levels of exposure. In contrast, Hougan explained that gold had a more subtle impact on returns. While it did not contribute as much to boosting gains, gold played a key role in reducing overall portfolio risk, acting as a stabilizing asset during periods of economic uncertainty. This distinction highlights the different roles these assets can play within a diversified investment strategy—Bitcoin as a high-growth, higher-risk element, and gold as a steady, risk-mitigating component. Over the past 30 years, more than 5,000 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been launched across various sectors, but Bitcoin ETFs have outpaced them all, including the highly successful gold ETFs. Following SEC approval and their subsequent debut in January 2024, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated over $21 billion in total net flows, a remarkable achievement considering the typical challenges faced by new ETFs. By comparison, it took gold ETFs around five years to reach the same level of net inflows. Hougan agreed, stating that Bitcoin is a more effective addition to a portfolio than gold for achieving the goals most investors seek. This year, in addition to Bitcoin ETFs, Ether ETFs also received approval from the SEC, raising the likelihood that other crypto ETFs, such as those for XRP and Solana, could soon follow. At the launch of Ether ETFs, Hougan predicted that these exchange-traded products would have an even greater impact on Ethereum than they did on Bitcoin. He noted that the introduction of Ether ETFs could drive up the price of Ether, potentially pushing it beyond the $5,000 mark. He told Quartz that if Bitcoin is like digital gold, Ether is like a tech play, and it belongs in the Nasdaq 100 effectively, like Apple (AAPL+0.11%), Nvidia (NVDA+0.55%), Microsoft (MSFT+1.26%), and others. Like these tech giants, Ether is driven by innovation and utility, given its role as the backbone of decentralized applications and smart contracts. “If you’re a tech investor and you don’t have Ethereum, you’re missing out,” he said. “It’d be like a tech investor not owning Nvidia.” Hougan emphasized the significance of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, by noting the recent trends in both Bitcoin and gold prices. He pointed out that Bitcoin is approaching its all-time high, while gold has already reached its peak, signaling growing concerns among investors about the stability of traditional fiat currencies and broader economic uncertainties. According to Hougan, this trend underscores a shift in investor sentiment: Bitcoin offers the potential for higher returns, making it an attractive option for those seeking growth, while gold remains a go-to asset for those prioritizing stability and preservation of wealth. The choice between the two ultimately comes down to an investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Those willing to accept higher volatility for the possibility of greater rewards may lean towards Bitcoin, while more conservative investors might prefer the steady, time-tested security of gold. “Keep your stocks, keep your bonds, but carve out a little space for this new asset [Bitcoin] that provides unique enhancements to your portfolio and has, in our view, significant upside potential,” he added.

Microsoft (MSFT) is set to report fiscal first-quarter earnings results after markets close Wednesday, with investors likely to be watching growth in the company's Azure cloud computing platform. Analysts expect revenue to jump 14% year-over-year to $64.65 billion. Net income is projected to land at $23.2 billion or $3.11 per share, up from $22.29 billion or $2.99 per share a year earlier. In the prior quarter, Microsoft reported cloud revenue of $36.8 billion, up 21% year-over-year, but short of the $37.2 billion analysts expected. Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment, which houses Azure, accounted for $28.5 billion in revenue, driven by a 29% jump in revenue from Azure and other services. Deutsche Bank analysts said they expect Azure to post a percentage in the low-to-mid 30s for the fiscal first quarter, adding Microsoft “needs to deliver Azure outperformance and guidance for little if any deceleration” in order to satisfy investors' lofty expectations. Microsoft told investors when it reported earnings in July that it would raise its investment in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure in order to meet AI demand. Worries about whether Microsoft's higher spending will pay off weighed on the company's stock price in the wake of the report. Goldman Sachs analysts said they view Microsoft's buildout as a "necessary investment ahead of the structural shift to Gen-AI, which is likely to present a vast revenue opportunity across all layers of the AI technology stack." Microsoft announced several new AI-related features and initiatives in recent weeks, including upgrades to its Copilot AI assistant and autonomous AI agents for Copilot. Shares of Microsoft have gained close to 14% since the start of the year, at $428.15 as of Friday's close.

Title: 3 years after turning Facebook into Meta, Mark Zuckerberg's real win is AI
URL: https://qz.com/facebook-meta-rebrand-mark-zuckerberg-metaverse-ai-1851680214
Time Published: 2024-10-28T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
Facebook (META) began as a digital college yearbook, connecting Harvard students face to face. Three years ago on Monday, Mark Zuckerberg rebranded his social media empire as Meta, betting billions on a future where we’d meet in virtual worlds instead. “Today we are seen as a social media company,” Zuckerberg said on Oct. 28, 2021, from the stage at the Facebook Connect augmented and virtual reality conference. “But in our DNA we are a company that builds technology to connect people, and the metaverse is the next frontier just like social networking was when we got started.” Zuckerberg said he hoped the metaverse would reach a billion people and conduct “hundreds of billions” of dollars worth of commerce, employing millions — all within the decade. Since then, Meta has invested more than $63 billion in Reality Labs, its division for virtual and augmented reality technology. The results include updated Quest headsets, which power Horizon Worlds, a virtual universe where customized avatars (initially designed without legs) roam digital spaces, and a partnership with Ray-Ban to develop AR glasses. These efforts drew skepticism from investors and a lukewarm response from consumers. But everything changed when ChatGPT exploded onto the scene in November 2022. Meta was ready: Its AI research division, led by pioneer Yann LeCun, had long been advancing the field. And while Zuckerberg hasn’t given up on his metaverse dreams, his public messaging has increasingly focused on the transformative potential of generative artificial intelligence. Those AI bets are already paying dividends. In July, Meta reported stronger-than-expected sales, crediting AI improvements in ad targeting. The company is now rolling out AI tools to help marketers enhance their listings. “There are all the jokes about how all the tech CEOs get on these earnings calls and just talk about AI the whole time,” Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. “It’s because it’s actually super exciting and it’s going to change all these different things over multiple time horizons.” He added that AI will “end up affecting almost every product that we have in some way.” The pivot proved timely. After losing almost two-thirds of its value in 2022, Meta’s stock price almost tripled last year and is up more than 60% in 2024, hitting an all-time closing high of $595.94 per share earlier this month. For Meta, the metaverse has dimmed and been replaced by all things AI, according to Gene Munster, a managing partner at Deep Water Management. “They haven’t given up on the metaverse,” he said. “They are doing what every big tech company is doing, which is applying AI everywhere.” Reality Labs will likely lose $20 billion this year, but Munster noted that about 70% of that investment is going toward AI-enabled glasses and wearables rather than Quest headsets. Meta has put at least $10 billion into AI glasses development alone, which has helped put the company ahead of competitors in the space. But Munster said that the company’s “drunken sailor” spending on metaverse projects may not be sustainable alongside the growing costs of generative AI development, which has shown clearer financial benefits. While Meta doesn’t need to completely abandon Reality Labs, Munster said the next couple of years are crucial: Either the hardware needs to advance enough to prove the opportunity is real, or the spending needs to be redirected. “One is going to have to give,” he said. Although the name change happened in 2021, Meta’s investment in the metaverse vision began long before. The company had bought VR headset maker Oculus for $2 billion in 2014 — twice what it paid for Instagram in a blockbuster deal two years earlier. By the time of the Meta rebrand, the company had already invested an estimated $32 billion in metaverse-related technologies. But the “metaverse” itself is often misunderstood, according to Matthew Ball, an entrepreneur and author of “The Metaverse: And How It Will Revolutionize Everything.” While many associate it purely with VR headsets and virtual worlds, Meta’s vision is actually about the evolution of the internet itself into a 3D medium spanning virtual reality, augmented reality, and traditional screens. “The metaverse is not limited to and does not even require virtual reality,” Ball said. “Most people now believe we will use no term to describe it whatsoever — we’ll just call it the 3D internet.” But in the meantime, the proto-3D internet suffers. Global shipments of VR and AR headsets have sank roughly 28% since last September, with growth expected in 2025, according to market researcher IDC. But Meta’s Ray-Ban (EL) smart glasses have found success, with more than 730,000 units sold in their first three quarters, according to CNBC. The second generation of the glasses, which came out in September, got updates like better image quality, improved battery life and an AI voice assistant. Meta’s recent triumph with Ray-Ban smart glasses has paved the way for an even more ambitious project: Orion. This cutting-edge eyewear prototype, which Meta has been developing for almost 10 years, represents a significant leap forward in capability. When Zuckerberg unveiled Orion in September, it sparked an unprecedented wave of excitement about Meta’s metaverse technology — a notable shift from the previously tepid response to the company’s metaverse initiatives. The device showcases how AI could power next-generation augmented reality, with features like real-time 3D mapping and advanced scene understanding. “Without AI, it would be impossible to virtualize the real world, or perhaps build the fantastical ones that we’ve imagined,” Ball said. In October 2021, when The Wall Street Journal started publishing The Facebook Files, exposing the company’s knowledge of its platforms’ harmful effects, Zuckerberg unveiled his metaverse rebrand. This was only a few years after election interference claims around Cambridge Analytica’s data collection on American voters that had Zuckerberg making multiple appearances in front of Congress. At the time, Sara M. Watson, a technology critic and independent industry analyst, called the name change a diversion that didn’t address what the company had already built and broken. Now she sees the same playbook at work as Meta pivots to AI amid tepid response to its metaverse projects. Meta has been aggressive in competing to build cutting-edge AI. In July, Meta revealed Llama 3.1, the first openly available model that the company says competes and, in some cases, beats the performance on benchmarks of several closed AI models, including OpeanAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude. When Zuckerberg published a 2,300-word blog post called “Open Source AI Is the Path Forward,” he positioned open models as a public good — while building another ecosystem that could entrench Meta’s power with the same “move fast and break things” approach that led to congressional mea culpas and, ultimately, the name change. If Llama becomes the go-to infrastructure for AI tools, that would give Zuckerberg the same kind of control over generative AI that he once held over social networking, despite Meta’s troubled history with platform power. “You build a thing that everyone needs, and they build on top of that,” Watson said. “Then you become essential no matter how you decide to monetize.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Gold prices have soared to new heights, reaching a record $2,733 per ounce, while Bitcoin is thriving, approaching the $70,000 mark. The rally has been fueled by increased investor demand for safe-haven assets amid the Fed’s rate cuts, China’s stimulus plan, and rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. This has reignited the debate over which asset makes for a better investment: gold or Bitcoin. Bitwise Asset Management, a firm specializing in crypto index funds and ETFs, views Bitcoin and gold as assets with distinct advantages. In an interview with Quartz, Matthew Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, explained that while Bitcoin has the potential for higher returns, gold offers greater stability. He emphasized that Bitcoin holds more advantages over gold, particularly in terms of growth potential and long-term utility. Bitcoin is often referred to as “digital gold” because it shares several key characteristics with the precious metal. Like gold, Bitcoin has a finite supply as only 21 million coins will ever be mined, creating a built-in scarcity that many believe will drive its value higher over time. This limited supply introduces a deflationary element, contrasting with traditional fiat currencies that can be printed at will. Additionally, both Bitcoin and gold are decentralized assets. This means they operate independently of central banks or governmental control, making them less susceptible to policy-driven fluctuations. Investors see this as a hedge against economic instability, particularly during times of inflation or market volatility. Consequently, both assets are often viewed as safe havens, providing a store of value when traditional markets experience downturns. Despite the striking similarities between Bitcoin and gold, there are also significant differences, one of which is price volatility. Bitcoin tends to experience far more dramatic price fluctuations than gold, sometimes within a single day. According to Hougan, the role of Bitcoin in an investment portfolio differs fundamentally from that of gold. While both assets can serve as hedges, Bitcoin’s higher volatility means it can amplify gains or losses, making it more suitable for investors willing to take on risk for potentially higher rewards. In contrast, gold’s stability offers a more conservative approach, providing steady protection against economic uncertainties. “When you add Bitcoin to a portfolio, it boosts returns without increasing risk, and when you add gold to a portfolio, you get the same return but less risk,” he told Quartz. Hougan pointed out that, despite their similarities and differences, gold and Bitcoin do not have the same impact on an investment portfolio. He used a vivid analogy to illustrate this, comparing the two assets to ingredients in a soup. Adding gold to a portfolio, he explained, is like adding water to a soup—it doesn’t alter the flavor significantly unless a substantial amount is added. Gold’s stability and gradual influence mean it acts as a steadying force, but its effect is subtle unless it forms a large part of the investment mix. In contrast, Hougan likened adding Bitcoin to a portfolio to adding pepper to a soup; even a small amount can make a noticeable difference. Due to its higher volatility and growth potential, Bitcoin can have a pronounced impact on portfolio performance, amplifying returns but also introducing greater risk. This analogy underscores how Bitcoin, despite its smaller allocation, can play a more dynamic and immediate role in an investor’s strategy. In his analysis, Matthew Hougan referenced data from Bitwise that demonstrated how even a modest allocation of Bitcoin—such as 1.0%, 2.5%, or 5.0%—to a traditional 60/40 stock-and-bond portfolio could significantly enhance returns while only marginally increasing risk. For instance, a 2.5% allocation to Bitcoin was shown to improve overall portfolio returns by as much as 50 percentage points, with only a slight uptick in volatility. This suggests that Bitcoin’s potential for high growth can meaningfully boost portfolio performance, even at low levels of exposure. In contrast, Hougan explained that gold had a more subtle impact on returns. While it did not contribute as much to boosting gains, gold played a key role in reducing overall portfolio risk, acting as a stabilizing asset during periods of economic uncertainty. This distinction highlights the different roles these assets can play within a diversified investment strategy—Bitcoin as a high-growth, higher-risk element, and gold as a steady, risk-mitigating component. Over the past 30 years, more than 5,000 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been launched across various sectors, but Bitcoin ETFs have outpaced them all, including the highly successful gold ETFs. Following SEC approval and their subsequent debut in January 2024, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated over $21 billion in total net flows, a remarkable achievement considering the typical challenges faced by new ETFs. By comparison, it took gold ETFs around five years to reach the same level of net inflows. Hougan agreed, stating that Bitcoin is a more effective addition to a portfolio than gold for achieving the goals most investors seek. This year, in addition to Bitcoin ETFs, Ether ETFs also received approval from the SEC, raising the likelihood that other crypto ETFs, such as those for XRP and Solana, could soon follow. At the launch of Ether ETFs, Hougan predicted that these exchange-traded products would have an even greater impact on Ethereum than they did on Bitcoin. He noted that the introduction of Ether ETFs could drive up the price of Ether, potentially pushing it beyond the $5,000 mark. He told Quartz that if Bitcoin is like digital gold, Ether is like a tech play, and it belongs in the Nasdaq 100 effectively, like Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and others. Like these tech giants, Ether is driven by innovation and utility, given its role as the backbone of decentralized applications and smart contracts. “If you’re a tech investor and you don’t have Ethereum, you’re missing out,” he said. “It’d be like a tech investor not owning Nvidia.” Hougan emphasized the significance of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, by noting the recent trends in both Bitcoin and gold prices. He pointed out that Bitcoin is approaching its all-time high, while gold has already reached its peak, signaling growing concerns among investors about the stability of traditional fiat currencies and broader economic uncertainties. According to Hougan, this trend underscores a shift in investor sentiment: Bitcoin offers the potential for higher returns, making it an attractive option for those seeking growth, while gold remains a go-to asset for those prioritizing stability and preservation of wealth. The choice between the two ultimately comes down to an investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Those willing to accept higher volatility for the possibility of greater rewards may lean towards Bitcoin, while more conservative investors might prefer the steady, time-tested security of gold. “Keep your stocks, keep your bonds, but carve out a little space for this new asset [Bitcoin] that provides unique enhancements to your portfolio and has, in our view, significant upside potential,” he added.

Title: If you need a reason to stay in bed this bank holiday, here’s what too little sleep is doing to you

In 1946, Randy Gardner participated in a Stanford University study to assess how long humans could go without sleep and whether there were any ill effects. After 11 days and 25 minutes, he finally fell asleep. Waking after a 14-hour nap, he claimed that staying awake for so long had no adverse effects. The researchers, however, thought otherwise, noting that he had suffered from short-term memory loss, paranoia and hallucinations. While it seems clear that depriving yourself of sleep for such an extended period could not be good for you, the question is, are we all depriving ourselves of much-needed sleep on a daily basis? While sleep needs vary, short sleep duration is defined as less than seven hours per night. On average, 35 per cent of adults sleep less than seven hours per night. Beyond feeling less than well-rested, the question is whether it has any other negative consequences. As a cardiologist interested in helping people prevent heart disease and live longer, my view on this is clear. Yes. While Randy Gardner was not trying for a Guinness world record for staying awake, attempts were banned in 1977 because of the inherent dangers. According to Netflix, sleep is its biggest competitor By comparison, though, there are still ongoing record attempts at holding live rattlesnakes in your mouth - it’s 13, in case you were wondering - and how many bees you can cover yourself in, a frightening 637,000. In the eyes of the Guinness World Records committee, these feats hold an “acceptable” risk of being reattempted compared to depriving yourself of sleep for long periods. That should tell you all you need to know. But what about the impacts of shortened sleep on health? Even four nights of shortened sleep can move people closer to becoming insulin resistant, the precursor state to diabetes. Shortened sleep is also linked to higher rates of high blood pressure, plaque build-up in the heart arteries, heart attacks and strokes. Your efforts at dieting can also be seriously thrown off by shortened sleep. People who have shortened sleep routinely eat 270 calories per day more on average. Even those who do manage to reduce their calorie intake are less likely to lose weight, and more of that weight is likely to be muscle and not fat. One of the biggest challenges of shortened sleep is its impact on mood and cognitive wellbeing. Recent evidence suggests that high levels of physical activity are linked to lower rates of dementia, except in those who are routinely sleep-deprived. So, for all of you exercising for the cognitive benefits, you might not be getting the gains you should be getting. The biggest challenge with getting more sleep is that the world incentivises you not to. According to Netflix, sleep is its biggest competitor. With endless competition for our attention, we all know the feeling of staying up that bit later because we want to watch just one more video or extra episode. What’s “just one more episode?” Well, studies of those who had the highest amounts of night-time light exposure show a 20 to 30 per cent increased odds of dying prematurely compared to those with much less night-time light exposure. Most people don’t even realise that they are currently part of the world’s biggest experiment on sleep, and here, I’m not talking about smartphones. Twice a year, the clocks change by one hour, either giving us one additional hour of sleep or taking one away. When we lose one hour of sleep, the rates of heart attacks increase by 24 per cent. When we gain it back, they come back down, but only by 21 per cent. There is even some evidence to suggest that rates of suicide increase and that judges give harsher sentences when daylight savings changes result in an hour less sleep. So even if your phone doesn’t steal your sleep, daylight savings time just might. Some people need very little sleep because they carry certain genes that limit their need for sleep, but these gene defects are rare. Others will claim that some of the greatest figures in history got by on very little sleep: Winston Churchill, Bill Clinton and Margaret Thatcher, to name a few. My response to this claim is simple: Bill Clinton had a triple bypass at age 58, Margaret Thatcher developed dementia in her early 70s, and Winston Churchill had his first of eight strokes in his mid-70s. I’m not saying sleep was the only factor here, but you will need to get some better examples if you are going to try to convince me. To get more sleep, you simply need to stick to the fundamentals. You probably don’t need supplements, and I strongly advise against sleeping tablets. Most people need to go to bed and get up at exactly the same time every single day – yes, that includes weekends. This will train your circadian rhythm to work with you and not against you. Changing time zones interrupts your circadian rhythm, but so does staying up two hours later, which is why we call it social jet lag. Charging your phone in another room, investing in blackout blinds, and keeping your room cool will all help you get a good night’s sleep. These simple changes have the biggest impact on sleep. Do I think that a few nights of shortened sleep will damage your health? No. Do I think a few decades will? Yes. You don’t need to set any world records; you just need about seven to nine hours most nights.

Title: Wall Street, Tech Royalty Head To Saudi Crown Prince's Event Amid War

Saudi Arabia will host the biggest names in finance and technology this coming week in a test of investor appetite for the kingdom's ambitions of transforming itself into a global hub at a time of widening regional conflict. International executives will have to contend with a region rocked by geopolitical tensions, with the threat of further military confrontation between Israel and Iran at the highest levels in decades. And they will land in a country that is increasingly facing up to the fact that even its vast oil wealth has limits. But those arriving at the Future Investment Initiative - often dubbed Davos in the desert - seem undeterred, sensing an opportunity to plug into Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's trillion-dollar Vision 2030 economic remake. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s David Solomon, Citigroup Inc.'s Jane Fraser and BlackRock Inc.'s Larry Fink have become regulars at the Riyadh summit and are set to return this year. Reflecting Saudi Arabia's focus on technology and artificial intelligence, they'll be joined by prominent names in those industries. Alphabet Inc. President Ruth Porat and TikTok Inc. Chief Executive Officer Shou Chew are set to speak at the summit for the first time. Benjamin Horowitz, tech entrepreneur and co-founder of venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz, is also making an appearance. Wall Street and Silicon Valley have increasingly turned to the oil-rich Middle East as liquidity gets tighter in other parts of the world, especially China. Saudi Arabia itself commands nearly $1 trillion in sovereign wealth, though the Crown Prince wants titans of industry to stop deploying that money overseas and instead help support his domestic ambitions. Yet the backdrop is one of increasing uncertainty. Saudi foreign policy has recently focused on lowering regional tensions in the hope that a more stable region will bring in foreign capital and technological know-how. But events of the past year have served as a reminder of how unstable the region can be. "The impact of regional instability on the prospects for foreign investment is completely negative, with the possible exception of the defense industry," said Gregory Gause, Professor of International Affairs at Texas A&M University. Capital is "not attracted to conflict regions, even if the country is not an immediate participant in the conflict." To be sure, Saudi Arabia is still pushing ahead with its big development plans. Deals worth more than $28 billion are likely to be announced over the next week by executives from around the world, according to Richard Attias, CEO of the FII Institute. Some of these will focus on AI, including potentially a new fund with Andreessen Horowitz that could grow to as large as $40 billion. The kingdom is also expected to announce a new company that will invest at least $10 billion in making Saudi Arabia a top global producer of hydrogen - a low carbon fuel that could be key to the world's transition away from burning fossil fuels. Ahead of the event, General Atlantic said it's opening its first office in the Middle East - in Saudi Arabia - to scout for more deals in the region. Two exchange-traded funds will make their trading debuts in Riyadh, giving Saudi investors access to Hong Kong stocks - a reflection of the kingdom's growing ties with China as it looks to boost investment flows with its biggest trading partner. Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan, and the Commissioner for the Belt and Road, Nicholas Ho, will speak at FII as some of the highest profile speakers from Asia. Still, the regional conflict is undoubtedly weighing on global investor sentiment in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia, the biggest Gulf economy, is feeling some of that. The number of actively-managed emerging market funds with Saudi exposure had been rising sharply until earlier this year, but stalled at around 56% as tensions between Israel and Iran escalated, according to Copley Fund Research. The data show that the number of funds invested in the Saudi stock market fell slightly between March and September this year and that the country is the third-biggest underweight after Taiwan and India. Coupled with that, Crown Prince Mohammed has had to come to terms with the limits of even Saudi Arabia's vast financial resources to pay for his ambitions. The government, which is forecasting deficits out to at least 2027, has said some projects will be need to be delayed. At the same time, the Public Investment Fund, the kingdom's powerful sovereign fund that the de-facto ruler chairs, is becoming a tougher place for foreign firms to get money out of. An increased focus on domestic projects like the $1.5 trillion Neom has global asset managers fretting that the PIF will have less cash to spend abroad. "The FII has always been designed as a mechanism for investment into Saudi, however in reality it has been an opportunity for foreign execs to extract financing from the Kingdom," said Zaid Belbagi, managing partner of political risk consultancy Hardcastle Advisory. "Sold-out hotels at $500-1000 per night are indicative of sustained international interest." The organizers of the Riyadh jamboree remain confident, and about 7,000 people have registered to attend this year's event. That's higher than the numbers for last year's summit, which took place days after the current conflict in the region started. When asked what attendees were speaking about ahead of the event, FII Institute's Attias said the US election was front of mind. There are many executives that feel developments in the Middle East hinge on the outcome of the vote, he said on a Bloomberg television interview on Monday. Even so, investors are coming "despite what is happening in the world," Attias said. "The show must go on."

Title: Asset managers roll out new ETFs to tap in to AI buzz

By Suzanne McGee (Reuters) - Exchange-traded funds focused on artificial intelligence are proliferating as asset managers offer investors new ways to tap in to the market enthusiasm for AI, even while it remains unclear which companies will emerge as the long-term winners from the latest technology revolution. More than one-third of the two dozen ETFs that include artificial intelligence or AI in their name have been launched in 2024 alone, according to data from Morningstar. In the past week, three more joined their ranks, including a cloud computing ETF rebranded and revamped to specifically target AI. The AI ETF group now has assets of $4.5 billion, drawing it closer to the $5.5 billion nuclear power-themed ETF universe, and pushing it well above the cannabis sector, with $1.37 billion in assets. "I'm not surprised their ranks are multiplying," said Daniel Sotiroff, senior analyst at Morningstar. "This is a fast-growing, fast-moving industry, and it is easy to hope that you could end up making a lot of money in a short period of time." The 200%-plus stock gain by chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) - AI's poster child - over the last 12 months likely just reaffirms that confidence, Sotiroff said. Beyond Nvidia, AI is likely to produce a larger and broader swath of beneficiaries in the future, said Tony Kim, head of the fundamental equities technology group at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK). Kim is the manager of the two new AI-themed ETFs launched by BlackRock on Tuesday, the iShares A.I. Innovation and Tech Active ETF and the iShares Technology Opportunities Active ETF. The first of the firm's AI products, the $630 million iShares Future AI & Tech ETF, launched in 2018, currently trades just below a 52-week high recorded on Oct. 14. While its initial AI product is linked to an index, the two new funds are actively managed and designed to capture emerging opportunities within AI, according to Jay Jacobs, head of active and thematic ETFs at BlackRock. "The AI market is going to change dramatically," said Kim. "What you think it is today, isn’t going to be what it becomes tomorrow or next year or in a few years." ARMS RACE BofA Securities market analysts Ohsung Kwon and Savita Subramanian said in a recent report they believe there is "an AI arms race" under way among giant technology companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). They calculate that capital spending this year from four megacaps making big AI bets will total $206 billion, up 40% over 2023. Meanwhile, capital spending by the other 496 companies in the S&P 500 will dip slightly, they project. Venture capital firms also are directing as much as $79.2 billion in funding to AI startups by the end of the year, 27% above 2023 levels, according to an estimate from venture firm Accel. That means that 40 cents of every dollar invested by VC firms will go to an AI company. Of course, investing in an AI-themed ETF does not guarantee market outperformance. The largest of the AI funds, the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF, is up about 20% so far this year, against a 22% rise for the benchmark S&P 500. Amplify ETFs earlier this month rebranded an existing cloud-computing ETF to reflect a new focus on the emerging technology, naming it the Amplify Bloomberg AI Value Chain ETF. "Now, we're trying to get exposure to the cloud with a specific AI tilt," said Nathan Miller, vice president of product development at Amplify. The long-term goal, he added, is to be ready to profit if and when all that capital spending on AI starts to show up in earnings, and be ahead of the curve in identifying new opportunities. "Like every ETF firm out there, we are trying to offer investors something differentiated," Miller said.

Title: Michael Saylor's Proposal To Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella: 'If You Want To Make The Next Trillion Dollars For Shareholders, Call Me'

Time Published: 2024-10-28T04:30:56Z
Full Content:
MicroStrategy MSTR executive chairman Michael Saylor humorously reached out to Microsoft MSFT CEO Satya Nadella, suggesting he can help with the company’s Bitcoin BTC/USD strategy. What Happened: In a post on X on Friday, Saylor advised Nadella that if he's interested in creating the next trillion-dollar opportunity, he should reach out. This comes as Microsoft, per an SEC filing, prepares to discuss a possible Bitcoin investment at its December shareholder meeting. MicroStrategy, despite being much smaller, has outperformed Microsoft by 313% largely due to its Bitcoin holdings. The company’s total bitcoin holdings as of Oct. 20 stand at 252,220, worth $9.91 billion. Microsoft's second-largest shareholder, BlackRock BLK, has already shown confidence in Bitcoin, offering its clients a Bitcoin ETF. Also Read: If you invested $100 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here’s how much you’d have today. Why It Matters: Saylor's message highlights MicroStrategy's strong performance amid its heavy Bitcoin investments, with the company's stock up 444% over the past year, including a 244% YTD increase.

Pre listing, we had recommended profit booking if Waaree lists at double of its issue price which was the street expectations. With listing at Rs 2550, we believe the stock can deliver healthy returns post listing as well. We believe the long term investor demand would continue at the counter on the back of sector demand and expansion plans, with an opportunity to play at the largest manufacturer of solar PV modules in India, bolstered by favourable government policies and few incentive (PLI) schemes. Hence, we recommend long term investors to “HOLD” while short term investors can look for a target anywhere between Rs 2750-2800 to book profits. Fresh accumulation can be attempted anywhere between Rs 2200-2300 if the opportunity arises due to market scenario and profits booking attempts.

The stock climbed to as high as 2,624.40 rupees in early trading Monday, from its issue price of 1,503 rupees. Mumbai-based Waaree had seen strong interest for its deal, with the issue getting subscribed by more 70 times. The debut comes on the back of a world-beating rally in India’s renewable-energy stocks this year. The firm’s gain stands in contrast to Hyundai Motor India’s IPO that culminated in a first-day decline last week. The $3.3 billion IPO, the nation’s largest ever, drew poor interest from retail investors — a break from the frenzy seen in some recent IPOs, particularly smaller issues. Waaree’s retail portion of the IPO was subscribed nearly 11 times, according to exchange data, underscoring the appetite for new listings in India remains strong. The appeal of India’s renewable sector, where stocks have rallied this year, is also drawing investors. Waaree sells products such as solar modules and inverters. It posted a profit of more than 4 billion rupees ($47.7 million) on revenue from operations of 34.1 billion rupees for the three months ended June, according to its red-herring prospectus. Its shares attracted investments from prominent Wall Street names, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., BlackRock Inc., and Morgan Stanley. The company’s business prospects align with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s goal to boost renewable-energy production by more than twofold from current levels. The sector may need investments of $2.2 trillion by 2050, according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates. Indian IPOs have raised $13.1 billion so far this year, more than the annual volumes in the past two years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Listings in the nation this year have on average generated a nearly 27% first-day gain. Among IPOs between $500 million and $1 billion, the gain was about 66%.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best-Performing S&P 500 Stocks in the Last 3 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best performing S&P 500 stocks in the last year. The past three years have been a bit of a roller coaster ride for the stock market. We saw how the pandemic wrecked several industries’ balance sheets and supply chains. Following the global vaccination drive, economies around the world and in the US opened up with a vengeance, resulting in huge stimulus checks. This, along with the energy and food-price shock and disrupted supply chains, was blamed for the persistently high inflation, which peaked at 9.1% in June 2022. The Fed had already started hiking interest rates to ease inflation and work towards a soft landing, with the first hike coming in March 2022. By July 2023, the central bank had raised it to 5.25-5.50%, making borrowing all the more challenging. The tech industry had kept the momentum from 2020 lockdowns well into 2021. The largest tech companies out of the 500 biggest companies trading in the US grew by an average of 33% from the start of 2021 to the end. However, the tech industry was heavily impacted by the rate hikes that followed in 2022. This resulted in the large-cap aggregate tech indices losing nearly 29% of the gains made in the year prior, as prospects for growth became bleak. The upper percentiles of the energy industry in market cap had a similar run in 2021 but remained immune to the economic downturn that followed in 2022, posting gains of 59% for the year. The aggressive rally in the energy industry resulted from a combination of supply-chain disruptions, OPEC production cuts, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the revision of energy sourcing in Europe, directing much of the energy capital inflow to the US from the continent. Coming back to tech – the industry wouldn’t stay on the sidelines for long. The start of 2023 to the end saw the large-cap US-traded tech equity grow by 38.6%. At the core of the resurgence was the AI-led boom combined with semiconductor supply chains that had recovered substantially by then. Other factors included CHIPS and Science Act, improved efficiency in the industry, and a rate-hike slowdown. The US economy looks to be on schedule for a soft landing, according to a Financial Times’ survey of economists. This is on the back of the Fed’s rate reduction of 50 basis points in September 2024, which, as noted by the CFO of a large US bank Denis Colman, is a signal towards a soft landing. This is not a sure shot, however, since some experts remain wary and continue worrying about a recession. For instance, Piper Sandler’s Chief Global Economist Nancy Lazar noted that the “jumbo” rate cut by the Fed is reminiscent of the similar Fed policy easing of 2001 and 2007, which couldn’t avert the problem. However, according to analysts, the case for a soft landing appears to be justified given the September jobs report and other improving indicators. The September report by BLS shows that the non-farm payrolls grew by 254,000 for the month, exceeding economists’ estimates by 41%. Moreover, the July and August reports, which had spooked some economists, were also revised by a combined 72,000 new hires, which wasn’t without historical precedent. Further, grocery prices, adjusted for growth in real wages, are back to the pre-pandemic levels. It took 3.59 hours of work to afford a week’s worth of groceries in November 2019 and took 3.57 hours of work to afford them in September 2024. Moving ahead, Rob Rowe, Regional Research Director and Head of Global Strategy at a large US bank is ‘tactically bullish’ on the back of continuing tech recovery and the markets “pricing in a soft landing”. They expect at-least 25 basis-point rate cuts at each Fed meeting through year-end. With regards to tech industry, their outlook suggests selectivity. In response to a question about their outlook on the tech industry, they said: “I think we have to be selective here. We like Semis as a recovery play but we’re kind of underweight on software.” Rowe has a bearish outlook on oil, given geopolitical variables don’t change in a way that leads to oil prices shooting up. For our list, we have picked stocks from the index in question that have had the highest 3-year annualized returns and we ranked them as such, in order of their 3-year CAGR. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. 3Y CAGR: 55.87% Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has been one of the most profitable stocks in the S&P500 index over the past few years. The company has been very successful in its patent portfolio strategy by acquiring other tech companies by leveraged buyouts. Some of its recent acquisitions include CA Technologies and VMware, with VMware being especially prominent. Further, Broadcom is the biggest player in the custom silicon market that lets other companies design their own AI accelerators, which are increasingly opting for specific chips for specific use cases. Following is what Clearbridge Large Cap Value strategy had to say about AVGO in their Q3, 2024 investor letter: “In IT, we bought Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) as we believe the company has a long runway for growth with its custom silicon business, which should be more durable and less volatile than other components within the AI food chain. We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple. We made room for Broadcom by exiting Lam Research, whose shares we believed priced in a full recovery, while we grew increasingly concerned that China exposure might create an air pocket.” Overall, AVGO ranks 7th on our list of best performing S&P 500 stocks in the last year. While we acknowledge the potential of the best-performing S&P500 stocks in the Last 3 Years, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is Intel (INTC) Poised for a Quantum Leap with Silicon Spin Qubits?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stands against other best quantum computing stocks to buy according to analysts. The modern digital world is built with its transistor-based chips on the foundations of Quantum Mechanics, the physics governing the world at the fundamental level. However, the world has barely scratched the surface when it comes to the full potential of Quantum Mechanics, that is, until Quantum computing came to the foray. In the same spirit but in different light to its classical counterpart, quantum-computing technology seeks to exploit particle superpositions for computing operations. It differs from classical computing due to the particle superpositions that occur at the quantum scale, allowing a qubit to be in a state of both 0 and 1 until it interacts with the environment. This exploit would allow Quantum computers to outperform classical computers exponentially in certain computing tasks. This could have huge implications for healthcare, finance, telecom, and energy industries, among others, ushering the world in a new era of accelerated economic growth. Mckinsey estimates that an economic value of $0.9 – $2 trillion can be extracted by 2035 across four industries – chemicals, life sciences, finance and mobility – due to quantum computing. The McKinsey report estimates the Quantum computing market size to be between $45 billion to $131 billion by 2040. Precedence Research appears more conservative and probably more grounded (You’ll see why). According to their report, the market for quantum computing is around $1 billion as of this year and is projected to expand at a CAGR of 30.9% from 2024 to 2034, reaching a size of $16 billion by the end of the forecast period. The US is expected to comprise $7 billion of the projected quantum market pie by the end of 2034. The market in the US is expected to grow at a CAGR of 31.2% from 2024-2034. As of 2023, North America unsurprisingly comprises 61% of the quantum-computing market. As we point out in a similar article from May, analyzing the quantum-computing equity market based on an ETF exposed to it is a bit tricky. Very few companies have core business related to quantum computing and most companies in these ETFs have peripheral Quantum computing projects but are big and high-performing in other industries that are core to their business, so an ETF’s performance wouldn’t be saying much about the quantum computing industry. Therefore, we’ll delve a little deeper to see what actual challenges there are in the industry and whether they can be practically solved for the delivery of a return on investment as far as scalable practical use cases go. Solving Quantum computing is akin to a Herculean labor. It’s hard to argue with the laws of physics, and when it comes to Quantum computing, a major problem yet to be overcome is Decoherence-induced errors. Decoherence is the enabler of transition from Quantum physics to the everyday physics we experience. Qubits (the quantum equivalent of bits) can only remain in a superposition as long as there’s no interaction with the environment. Even the slightest interaction causes them to decohere to classical bits, introducing computing errors. The hard part is to keep them in a superposition long enough for quantum computation to be viable. Further, to scale quantum computing, you have to add more qubits to the system, but adding more qubits, in principle, increases the probability of error. Finally, any approaches to error correction must obey the Quantum no-cloning theorem, which makes these approaches inherently more challenging than their classical counterparts. In 2022, Azure Quantum demonstrated the soundness of physics required to build topological qubits (these qubits are different in that they can maintain coherence for longer and would thereby lead to a reduced error rate through more stability). On the other hand, Researchers at Quantum AI, an arm of another big tech company, made a breakthrough in 2023, demonstrating a reduced error rate even with an increased number of traditional Qubits. However, rare correlated error events that happened roughly every hour limited the exceptionally low error rate required for practical quantum computing, with more research required to tackle them. Despite these steps, the challenges remain to be effectively overcome. It’s anyone’s guess how long it’ll take for quantum computers to scale and become economically viable. If the amount of capital being invested by venture capital firms in the industry is any guide, it certainly doesn’t look good for the industry as of recent. According to IQM’s State-of-Quantum Report of 2024, the venture capital invested in Quantum startups dropped by 50% worldwide in 2023 compared to the year prior, with the US quantum startup ecosystem seeing the greatest decline of capital at 80%. As far as public equity in the quantum computing industry goes, it is overall yet to be profitable. The industry hasn’t experienced any operating leverage in any meaningful sense and is focused on growing revenue in its early stage. The hard problems with regards to practicality and scalability has resulted in many quantum computing stocks trade at price levels that make them non-compliant with stock exchanges, resulting in delisting threats by stock exchanges. Also read why Jim Cramer can’t recommend a particular quantum computing stock here. For our list, we’ve selected companies that have a presence in the quantum computing industry and ranked them on the basis of their 12-month price upside on analysts’ consensus. Please note that we have used the median upside because average upsides can be greatly affected by outlier analysts on either side of the low or high. For some stocks, both mean and median upsides were too low, but since we wanted to limit our list to pure-play stocks as much as we could, we chose them using the high end of the upside, provided that at least 9 analysts had contributed to their average upside. Finally, we ranked the stocks on weighted scores, with median upside having a weight of 0.4 while analyst count having a weight of 0.6. For stocks for which we have used high-end of the upside, the weight for the upside is 0.2, with analyst-count weight reduced to 0.4. For stocks whose upside is based on only one analyst, and if the upside is over 30%, we assigned weights of 0.01 to both the upside and the analyst count. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Median Upside Potential: 20.86% Number of Analysts: 25 Insider Monkey Weighted Score: 23.3 Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has had a bad run in the past few years due to bad management decisions, failure to advance in chip fabrication, and decreased market share due to ARM-based chips. It’s down 53% year-to-date and 60% on a 5-year annualized basis. We have included Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) solely because of the potential of its quantum technology and low competition in this market compared to Intel’s other markets. Intel’s silicon spin qubit approach rather than superconducting qubits has the promise to reduce the complexity associated with quantum hardware since spin qubits can operate at higher temperatures. Spin qubits are also smaller than superconducting qubits, allowing for more complex versions of quantum computers in principle on a chip of the same size. In a paper published by Intel researchers in Nature in May 2024, researchers found that Intel’s approach results in 99.9% gate fidelity, an important milestone. Intel is well-positioned owing to its transistor-manufacturing credentials to create spin qubits through its 300mm CMOS manufacturing techniques. Overall, INTC ranks 6th on our list of best quantum computing stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of INTC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than INTC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Intel Stock Price Levels to Watch as Struggling Chipmaker's Earnings Loom

Time Published: 2024-10-28T02:33:59Z
Full Content:
Intel (INTC) shares will be in focus this week as investors await the beleaguered chipmaker’s third quarter results after Thursday’s closing bell. Analysts expect the company to report a decline in revenue for the period owing to softening demand for both its PC and server chips as it faces intensifying competition from rivals, such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and artificial intelligence (AI) darling Nvidia (NVDA). Investors will look for further updates from executives about the company’s turnaround plans, which has helped underpin a 23% recovery in the chipmaker’s stock from its early-September low. However, the shares still remain more than 50% lower since the start of the year through Friday’s close, as the company’s dominance in the chip market continues to shrink. Below, we take a closer look at the technicals on Intel’s weekly chart and point out important price levels to watch out for as the chipmaker prepares to report its quarterly results. Since breaking above the neckline of a double bottom on above-average volume last month, Intel shares have remained stuck in a sideways drift, with a doji forming last week—a candlestick pattern that indicates indecision. Moreover, the relative strength index (RSI) has flattened out in recent weeks, confirming rangebound conditions in the stock. Amid the potential for earnings-driven volatility, let’s outline several important levels on Intel’s chart that investors will likely be watching. Firstly, it’s worth keep an eye on the $22 level. This area on the chart sits just 3% below Friday’s close and has provided support over the past month near the double bottom pattern’s neckline. A decisive breakdown below this region could see the chipmaker’s stock revisit the $19 level, an area where bargain hunters may look for buying opportunities near the August and September double bottom troughs. A breakout above the recent sideways drift may drive a move up to around $25. Investors who have purchased the stock at lower levels in recent months could seek exit points near three prominent swing lows that formed on the chart between October 2022 and February last year. A rally through this level could see the shares climb to $30, a location where the price may run into overhead selling pressure near major peaks and troughs on the chart from November 2022 through to June this year. Finally, a more bullish move may lead to a retest of the $36 level, an area just above the 50-week moving average where investors could decide to lock in profits near a trendline connecting a range of comparable trading levels on the chart between June 2022 and July this year.

Despite the ongoing subdued market mood, Waaree Energies received the strongest subscription response from all sets of investors and also debuted slightly below our expectations. Pre listing, we had recommended profit booking if Waaree lists at double of its issue price which was the street expectations. With listing at Rs 2550, we believe the stock can deliver healthy returns post listing as well. We believe the long term investor demand would continue at the counter on the back of sector demand and expansion plans, with an opportunity to play at the largest manufacturer of solar PV modules in India, bolstered by favourable government policies and few incentive (PLI) schemes. Hence, we recommend long term investors to “HOLD” while short term investors can look for a target anywhere between Rs 2750-2800 to book profits. Fresh accumulation can be attempted anywhere between Rs 2200-2300 if the opportunity arises due to market scenario and profits booking attempts.

Crude oil futures fell Sunday, after widely-anticipated Israeli airstrikes against Iran did not hit crucial oil facilities. After initially dropping more than 5%, West Texas Intermediate crude was down 4.7%, to $68.39 a barrel, as of 9:30 p.m. Eastern, while Brent crude, the global benchmark, was down 4.5% to $72.21. China’s industrial profits plunged in September, recording the steepest monthly decline of the year, official data showed on Sunday, as policymakers ramp up stimulus to revitalise economic growth. Profits in September fell 27.1% from a year earlier, following a 17.8% fall in August, while earnings slipped 3.5% in the first nine months versus a 0.5% rise in the January-August period Japanese stocks rose strongly on Monday as the yen sank to a three-month low after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s coalition lost its parliamentary majority in a drubbing in Sunday’s election, raising uncertainty over the path for policy and the economy. Other Asian markets were mostly in the green on Monday morning. Nifty ended on a weak note on October 25 near two and half month lows despite the last hour bounce. It fell for the fifth consecutive session. It closed lower for the fourth consecutive week falling 2.71% over the week. Indian markets have fallen on all days of the week reeling under FPI selling pressure, weak Q2 results from most corporates and rising treasury yields in the US. Though a bounce in the markets is overdue, it needs reversal of selling pressure from FPIs and some sentiment stability in the local investor community. Nifty could now take support from 23892 while 24378 could prove to be tough to breach on the up in the near term. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. “A significant market trend during the recent days of market correction is the flight to quality. While the Nifty corrected by 8.3% from the recent peak, the mid and small cap indices corrected by 9.8% and 9.3% respectively from their recent peaks. Actually the index movements conceal the carnage in the mid and smallcaps where the correction has been above 30% in dozens of stocks and even by more than 40% in some momentum stocks. It is important to know that many largecaps are steady in this volatile market. The trend of flight to quality is likely to sustain given the good numbers from banking majors like HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank where valuations continue to be fair. Investors can profit from these polarised valuations. The global market structure may turn favourable after the subdued Israeli strikes against Iran avoiding the Iranian oil fields which has resulted in a sharp drop in crude prices. The imminent US presidential elections and the uncertainty associated with that will continue to weigh on markets.” Anand James, Chief Market Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. Nifty outlook: With Friday’s closing hour managing to push Nifty above the initial two hour’s close when the selling intensity was at its highest, we now have initial signs of a reversal. The August low of 23894 will thus act as a downside marker for all upside attempts. However, we also expect rejection trades to resurface on pull back to 24350. Derivative outlook: Nifty weekly contract has highest open interest at 25000 for Calls and 23000 for Puts while monthly contracts have highest open interest at 25000 for Calls and 23000 for Puts. Highest new OI addition was seen at 25000 for Calls and 23000 for Puts in weekly and at 25000 for Calls and 23000 for Puts in monthly contracts. FIIs increased their future index long position holdings by 4.95%, decreased future index shorts by 2.93% and in index options, 35.88% increase in Call longs, 28.23% increase in Call short, 47.47% increase in Put longs and 29.05% increase in Put shorts HDFC Life Insurance Company has received an Order from the Additional Commissioner Grade ‐ II Appeal, Sector‐1, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh for the period July 2017 to March 2018 and FY 2018‐19.

Guidance revised sharply across metrics The rupee witnessed range-bound trade and appreciated by just 1 paisa to 84.07 against the US dollar in initial deals on Monday, weighed down by significant foreign fund outflows and the strength of the American currency in the overseas market. We zoom in on the prospects of Manappuram Finance, as also the prospects of two other stocks — NHPC,andSBI Cards and Payment Service Crude oil futures traded lower on Monday morning after Israel’s retaliatory attack on Iran over the weekend, which avoided oil and nuclear facilities. This eased the market concerns about possible crude oil supply disruptions in the West Asia region. At 9.17 am on Monday, January Brent oil futures were at $72.40, down by 4.27 per cent, and December crude oil futures on WTI (West Texas Intermediate) were at $68.60, down by 4.43 per cent. November crude oil futures were trading at ₹5782 on Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) during the initial hour of trading on Monday against the previous close of ₹6040, down by 4.27 per cent, and December futures were trading at ₹5776 against the previous close of ₹6023, down by 4.10 per cent. Indian benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty opened positively on Monday, with Sensex up 0.43% at 79,741.46 and Nifty gaining 0.33% at 24,261.15, amid mixed global cues. Despite this, sentiment remains cautious, influenced by sustained FII selling and weak earnings, said Ajit Mishra, SVP at Religare Broking. Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) have sold ₹1,02,931 crore in October, impacting market momentum. The dollar index rallied for the fourth consecutive week and is keeping intact the overall uptrend. The index has risen breaking above the resistance at 104. It closed the week at 104.25, up 0.74 per cent. A strong rise in the US Treasury yields is aiding the greenback to retain its strength. Markets turning slightly cautious ahead of the US Presidential Election next month is also giving the dollar a safe-haven support. The uptrend is strong, and we expect the rally in the dollar to continue for another couple of weeks until the outcome of the US elections is known. Sudarshan Chemical (SCIL) announced a large acquisition of Germany-based Heubach Group at a highly discounted valuation on October 11. The speciality chemicals player manufactures colour pigments and is the largest domestic player. While the leap the company has made is commendable and at the opportune moment, investors may hold the stock till further details emerge. The roadmap in turning around the acquisition, part of which turned insolvent, and incremental growth from the acquisition need to be articulated by the company before investing in the stock. The stock trading at 28 times one-year forward earnings also captures the deal enthusiasm and the company prospects in the long term. Here is what the charts say about the shares of Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals, Inox Wind and Trent Nifty 50 (24,181) and Bank Nifty (50,787) depreciated 2.7 per cent and 2.5 per cent last week. The former posted a weekly loss for the fourth time in a row, indicating strong selling pressure. Here, we analyse derivatives data of both indices. The sharp decline on Friday has changed the outlook to negative for the stock of IndusInd Bank (₹1,041.60). Support levels are at ₹990 and ₹807. A close below the latter will even change the long-term outlook to negative. In the quarter ended September 2024, NTPC’s consolidated revenue from operations and EBITDA dipped around 8 per cent each year on year to ₹44,696.3 crore and ₹11,655.2 crore respectively. After the results announcement last Thursday post-market hours, the stock dropped 3 per cent on Friday. In fact, the shares of NTPC have corrected 11 per cent from its 52-week high of ₹443.2 recorded on September 30, 2024. However, on the back of strong tailwinds, BSE Power had a stellar run during the last 12 months, rising 80 per cent. NTPC too, in line, recorded a 72 per cent rise during the same period. Following Dusshera, the festival season peaks in the coming week, with Dhanteras and Diwali round the corner. As we start celebrating the festival of wealth and prosperity, gold continues to shine as a symbol of tradition. This year, the fireworks started early for gold investors with prices on a steady rise since the beginning of 2024. ‘ Wu ji bi fan’ as Jacki Chan says in Karate Kid, that is, when things reach an extreme, they can only move in the opposite direction. As did the IT stocks and Nifty IT Index after peaking in a frenzy in early 2022. However, in the last one year, they have attempted a strong recovery piggy-backing on the AI theme, and Nifty IT is now 6.5 per cent above the 2022 peak. It is not clear though if this will sustain. While recent Q2 results indicate the slowdown may have bottomed out, the pace of revenue growth still remains underwhelming. The National Stock Exchange (NSE) has relaxed the definition of what constitutes an inactive trading account. The period for marking an account as inactive has been changed from 12 to 24 months.

According to deep discount broker, SAS Online’s breadth analysis, Only 15 per cent of NSE stocks are trading above their 50-day moving average, and just 9 per cent are above their 20-day moving average, suggesting a possible relief but overall, a strong bearish grip. The brokerage said the number of stocks with RSI in the bullish zone has dropped to 20%, indicating exhaustion in upward momentum. Additionally, the Bull Bear Index of trend indicators like MACD also points to muted breadth, it further said.

BlackRock and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) will invest in the $1.4 billion IPO, which will be the country’s second-biggest stock offering this year, the sources told Reuters. Here’s an interesting stock idea: The stock idea that we have for you today is Thermax. The stock has surged about 5 per cent on Friday breaking above key resistance on Friday. The price action indicates that a fresh leg of upmove has begun. The outlook is bullish and the share price can go up in the coming days. Check out the latest episode of bl.Today’s Pick to learn more. Last week we said that #Nifty can bounce back from its support around 24,400. But that view has gone wrong. The fall last week confirms a head and shoulder pattern on the chart. That leaves the danger of seeing more fall in the short-term. A short-lived recovery is also possible before another leg of fall happens. However, from a big picture there are good chances that we could be in the last leg of this correction. So, we expect the broader uptrend to resume after one more leg of fall from here. #Nifty can fall to 23,500-23,000 on a break below 23,900. After this fall, the overall uptrend can resume. #NiftyBank index can fall to 49,700-49,400 and then rise back to 51,000-52,000 again.

Despite the ongoing subdued market mood, Waaree Energies received the strongest subscription response from all sets of investors and also debuted slightly below our expectations. Pre listing, we had recommended profit booking if Waaree lists at double of its issue price which was the street expectations. With listing at Rs 2550, we believe the stock can deliver healthy returns post listing as well. We believe the long term investor demand would continue at the counter on the back of sector demand and expansion plans, with an opportunity to play at the largest manufacturer of solar PV modules in India, bolstered by favourable government policies and few incentive (PLI) schemes. Hence, we recommend long term investors to “HOLD” while short term investors can look for a target anywhere between Rs 2750-2800 to book profits. Fresh accumulation can be attempted anywhere between Rs 2200-2300 if the opportunity arises due to market scenario and profits booking attempts.

In fact, the last time this week ended in the red was eight years ago in 2016. That said, the tactical trend remains down and any bounce on the Nifty will face stiff resistance in the 24,413 - 24,462 area, while support lies at 24,073. Any break below this support will bring the all-important 23,779 into the picture.

Crude oil futures fell Sunday, after widely-anticipated Israeli airstrikes against Iran did not hit crucial oil facilities. After initially dropping more than 5%, West Texas Intermediate crude was down 4.7%, to $68.39 a barrel, as of 9:30 p.m. Eastern, while Brent crude, the global benchmark, was down 4.5% to $72.21. China’s industrial profits plunged in September, recording the steepest monthly decline of the year, official data showed on Sunday, as policymakers ramp up stimulus to revitalise economic growth.

Other Asian markets were mostly in the green on Monday morning. Nifty ended on a weak note on October 25 near two and half month lows despite the last hour bounce. It fell for the fifth consecutive session. It closed lower for the fourth consecutive week falling 2.71% over the week. Indian markets have fallen on all days of the week reeling under FPI selling pressure, weak Q2 results from most corporates and rising treasury yields in the US. Though a bounce in the markets is overdue, it needs reversal of selling pressure from FPIs and some sentiment stability in the local investor community. Nifty could now take support from 23892 while 24378 could prove to be tough to breach on the up in the near term. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. “A significant market trend during the recent days of market correction is the flight to quality. While the Nifty corrected by 8.3% from the recent peak, the mid and small cap indices corrected by 9.8% and 9.3% respectively from their recent peaks. Actually the index movements conceal the carnage in the mid and smallcaps where the correction has been above 30% in dozens of stocks and even by more than 40% in some momentum stocks. It is important to know that many largecaps are steady in this volatile market. The trend of flight to quality is likely to sustain given the good numbers from banking majors like HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank where valuations continue to be fair. Investors can profit from these polarised valuations. The global market structure may turn favourable after the subdued Israeli strikes against Iran avoiding the Iranian oil fields which has resulted in a sharp drop in crude prices. The imminent US presidential elections and the uncertainty associated with that will continue to weigh on markets.” Anand James, Chief Market Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. Nifty outlook: With Friday’s closing hour managing to push Nifty above the initial two hour’s close when the selling intensity was at its highest, we now have initial signs of a reversal. The August low of 23894 will thus act as a downside marker for all upside attempts. However, we also expect rejection trades to resurface on pull back to 24350. Derivative outlook: Nifty weekly contract has highest open interest at 25000 for Calls and 23000 for Puts while monthly contracts have highest open interest at 25000 for Calls and 23000 for Puts. Highest new OI addition was seen at 25000 for Calls and 23000 for Puts in weekly and at 25000 for Calls and 23000 for Puts in monthly contracts.

We zoom in on the prospects of Manappuram Finance, as also the prospects of two other stocks — NHPC,andSBI Cards and Payment Service Crude oil futures traded lower on Monday morning after Israel’s retaliatory attack on Iran over the weekend, which avoided oil and nuclear facilities.

Despite this, sentiment remains cautious, influenced by sustained FII selling and weak earnings, said Ajit Mishra, SVP at Religare Broking. Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) have sold ₹1,02,931 crore in October, impacting market momentum. The dollar index rallied for the fourth consecutive week and is keeping intact the overall uptrend. The index has risen breaking above the resistance at 104. It closed the week at 104.25, up 0.74 per cent. A strong rise in the US Treasury yields is aiding the greenback to retain its strength. Markets turning slightly cautious ahead of the US Presidential Election next month is also giving the dollar a safe-haven support. The uptrend is strong, and we expect the rally in the dollar to continue for another couple of weeks until the outcome of the US elections is known. Sudarshan Chemical (SCIL) announced a large acquisition of Germany-based Heubach Group at a highly discounted valuation on October 11. The speciality chemicals player manufactures colour pigments and is the largest domestic player. While the leap the company has made is commendable and at the opportune moment, investors may hold the stock till further details emerge. The roadmap in turning around the acquisition, part of which turned insolvent, and incremental growth from the acquisition need to be articulated by the company before investing in the stock. The stock trading at 28 times one-year forward earnings also captures the deal enthusiasm and the company prospects in the long term. Here is what the charts say about the shares of Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals, Inox Wind and Trent Nifty 50 (24,181) and Bank Nifty (50,787) depreciated 2.7 per cent and 2.5 per cent last week. The former posted a weekly loss for the fourth time in a row, indicating strong selling pressure. Here, we analyse derivatives data of both indices. The sharp decline on Friday has changed the outlook to negative for the stock of IndusInd Bank (₹1,041.60). Support levels are at ₹990 and ₹807. A close below the latter will even change the long-term outlook to negative. In the quarter ended September 2024, NTPC’s consolidated revenue from operations and EBITDA dipped around 8 per cent each year on year to ₹44,696.3 crore and ₹11,655.2 crore respectively.

As did the IT stocks and Nifty IT Index after peaking in a frenzy in early 2022. However, in the last one year, they have attempted a strong recovery piggy-backing on the AI theme, and Nifty IT is now 6.5 per cent above the 2022 peak. It is not clear though if this will sustain. While recent Q2 results indicate the slowdown may have bottomed out, the pace of revenue growth still remains underwhelming.

BlackRock and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) will invest in the $1.4 billion IPO, which will be the country’s second-biggest stock offering this year, the sources told Reuters. Here’s an interesting stock idea: The stock idea that we have for you today is Thermax. The stock has surged about 5 per cent on Friday breaking above key resistance on Friday. The price action indicates that a fresh leg of upmove has begun. The outlook is bullish and the share price can go up in the coming days. Check out the latest episode of bl.Today’s Pick to learn more. Last week we said that #Nifty can bounce back from its support around 24,400. But that view has gone wrong. The fall last week confirms a head and shoulder pattern on the chart. That leaves the danger of seeing more fall in the short-term. A short-lived recovery is also possible before another leg of fall happens. However, from a big picture there are good chances that we could be in the last leg of this correction. So, we expect the broader uptrend to resume after one more leg of fall from here. #Nifty can fall to 23,500-23,000 on a break below 23,900. After this fall, the overall uptrend can resume. #NiftyBank index can fall to 49,700-49,400 and then rise back to 51,000-52,000 again.

By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK (Reuters) -Global stock indexes rose on Monday as investors awaited earnings reports this week from several of the biggest U.S. tech-related companies, while oil prices dropped 6% after Israel's retaliatory strike against Iran at the weekend bypassed oil and nuclear facilities. The Japanese yen fell to a three-month low against the dollar following an election in Japan thrust the country into political turmoil. U.S. earnings season is in full swing, with a long list of names due to report this week including five of the biggest U.S. companies: Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). The week also brings the U.S. jobs report for October on Friday, while investors are keeping a close eye on political news with the U.S. presidential election just over a week away. Employers are expected to have added 123,000 jobs during October, while the unemployment rate is likely to have stayed steady at 4.1%, according to economists polled by Reuters., The election for U.S. president is expected to be close. Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, was leading Republican Donald Trump nationally by a marginal 46% to 43%, a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll showed. Election Day in the U.S. is Nov. 5. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields hit a three-month high ahead of this week's data and the election. They were last up 4.4 basis points at 4.274% in afternoon U.S. trading. "It's the calm before the storm," said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) in New York. "A lot of investors are a little bit more cautious heading into the elections." Oil prices tumbled as worries about a wider Middle East war eased. Brent futures settled at $71.42 a barrel, down $4.63 or 6.09%. WTI U.S. crude futures settled at $67.38, down $4.40 or 6.13%. Energy shares eased along with oil prices, with the S&P 500 energy sector ending down 0.7%, while the three major U.S. stock indexes closed higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 273.17 points, or 0.65%, to 42,387.57, the S&P 500 rose 15.40 points, or 0.27%, to 5,823.52 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 48.58 points, or 0.26%, to 18,567.19. Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group, parent company of Trump's Truth Social platform, surged 21.6% on Monday, extending a recent rally. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose 2.44 points, or 0.29%, to 847.93. The STOXX 600 index rose 0.41%. The yen remained under pressure as the election loss by Japan's ruling coalition raises political and monetary policy uncertainty. Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party lost its parliamentary majority. The party, with junior coalition partner Komeito, won 215 lower-house seats in Sunday's election, public broadcaster NHK reported, well short of the 233 needed for a majority. Against the yen, the dollar rose by as much as 1% to a high of 153.88, the yen's weakest level since late July. The dollar was last up 0.64% at 153.28. Also, the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, fell 0.08% to 104.30, and the euro was up 0.19% at $1.0813.

Title: With 52% ownership, JB Hi-Fi Limited (ASX:JBH) boasts of strong institutional backing

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Institutions' substantial holdings in JB Hi-Fi implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price 49% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Insiders have sold recently To get a sense of who is truly in control of JB Hi-Fi Limited (ASX:JBH), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 52% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company. Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about JB Hi-Fi. View our latest analysis for JB Hi-Fi Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. We can see that JB Hi-Fi does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at JB Hi-Fi's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in JB Hi-Fi. Australian Super Pty Ltd is currently the company's largest shareholder with 15% of shares outstanding. With 6.0% and 5.8% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority. While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily. The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of JB Hi-Fi Limited. Keep in mind that it's a big company, and the insiders own AU$30m worth of shares. The absolute value might be more important than the proportional share. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 47% stake in JB Hi-Fi. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the 2 warning signs we've spotted with JB Hi-Fi . If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

Title: MicroStrategy Stock Hits All-Time High As Bitcoin Blazes Past $67,000

Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy is back in the news, with its stock trading at a 25-year high. TradingView’s recent data shows that MicroStrategy (MSTR) hit $235.89 in Thursday’s session. The stock’s price increased by more than 7% on October 25th. MicroStrategy’s price action last Thursday continued its 6-week rally and came ahead of its scheduled Q3 earnings report. This week’s stock performance reflected the company’s consistent growth over the past few years. MicroStrategy has outperformed most of its peers in the S&P 500 index and even outpaced Microsoft’s growth since 1999. According to observers, MicroStrategy is bullish, with market analysts listing $245 as the stock’s next target. MicroStrategy, a Virginia-based Bitcoin development company, is currently the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, with 252,222 BTC. With Bitcoin’s current price of $67,392, the company holds more than $17 billion in assets. MicroStrategy Stock Hits New Highs MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR) has soared over 7% to a 25-year high of $236, with a current market cap of $47 billion, overtaking Microsoft in all-time stock gains. Since adopting Bitcoin as a treasury asset in 2020, MicroStrategy’s stock is up… pic.twitter.com/cyXS0KODCD — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) October 25, 2024 Initially, the company developed software to analyze external and internal data to help decision-making, with IBM Cognos, Oracle Corporation’s BI Platform, and SAP AG Business objects as its primary competitors. However, in August 2020, the company changed its business model to focus on Bitcoin. The company has raised $4.25 billion from its equity offerings, the foundation for growing its Bitcoin holdings. As part of its Bitcoin plan, it aims to buy BTC at every opportunity. For the most part, Saylor’s strategy was a hit. However, the business plan to focus on Bitcoin came at a cost, and Saylor earned a few detractors and critics along the way. For example, the company has expanded its convertible note offering to raise funds to buy more Bitcoin. However, the bulk of these notes do not mature until 2032. Some market observers also say that MicroStrategy is in a difficult situation, especially during market downturns. Since the company relies on Bitcoin, the company’s future is dependent on crypto’s extreme volatility. Although most criticisms are valid, Michael Saylor remains defiant and has since doubled its BTC investments. Hey @SatyaNadella, if you want to make the next trillion dollars for $MSFT shareholders, call me. pic.twitter.com/NPnVvL7Wmj — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) October 25, 2024 Market observers are now bullish on Saylor’s company. According to Mark Palmer, the company’s stock has boasted a 17.8% yield since starting its Bitcoin strategy. Palmer and the other analysts now target $245 to address this sudden surge and bullish sentiment. Palmer adds that the company’s share price has increased by 1,600% in the last four years, and more gains are possible. It also helps that Michael Saylor has remained steadfast in his vision and passion for Bitcoin. In a recent Twitter/X post, MicroStrategy’s executive chairman hinted at the company’s next move and made a pitch to Microsoft’s Satya Nadella. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

A cooling geopolitical situation also aided risk sentiment. The S&P 500 gained 0.27% to close at 5,823.52. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 273.17 points, or 0.65%, to end at 42,387.57. The Nasdaq rose 0.26%, closing at 18,567.19. Weekend airstrikes by Israel against Iran did not target oil or nuclear facilities as was feared, and oil futures sold off on the day. U.S. crude futures were down 6%, along with international benchmark Brent. This week is the busiest one in the third-quarter earnings reporting season. It's also the last week before the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election and the Federal Reserve policy decision on Nov. 7. Five of the Magnificent Seven companies — Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon and Apple — are scheduled to report their latest financial results. Shares of Apple and Alphabet each climbed about 0.9%. "Given high valuations overall, there's going to be a laser focus on if they're able to continue to hit those growth numbers," said Horizon Investments head of research and quantitative strategies Mike Dickson. Traders are also watching for a slew of key economic data this week, including a preliminary reading on third-quarter gross domestic product out on Wednesday; the September personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, price index, on expected Thursday; and the October jobs report due Friday. Correction: The October jobs report is due on Friday. An earlier version misstated the month. U.S. stocks finished Monday's trading session in the green. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 273.17 points, or 0.65%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.27% and 0.26%, respectively. — Hakyung Kim The Japanese yen depreciated 0.2% against the dollar on Monday, hitting its lowest level in three months. The latest Japanese election results, during which the ruling Liberal Democratic Party lost its majority, raised uncertainty surrounding the country's political and monetary policy. The greenback last traded at 153.24 yen, after gaining as much as 1% against the yen earlier on Monday. — Hakyung Kim U.S. crude oil sold off more than 6% on Monday, for its worst day in more than two years after Iranian energy facilities were not damaged during Israeli strikes over the weekend. U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures dropped 6.13% to close at $67.38 per barrel for its biggest daily loss since July 12, 2022, when the benchmark shed 7.93%. Futures for global crude benchmark Brent slid 6.09% to settle at $71.42 per barrel. For weeks, markets had braced themselves for an Israeli retaliation following Iran's ballistic missile attack on Oct. 1. Israel on Saturday attacked Iranian military installations in three provinces — Spencer Kimball Small cap stocks saw outsized gains in Monday's session. The Russell 2000 climbed more than 1.6% in afternoon trading. By comparison, the broad S&P 500 rose just around 0.5%. To be sure, Monday's jump comes amid a period of underperformance for the Russell 2000. The small cap-focused index has gained less than 11% in 2024, while the S&P 500 has jumped more than 22%. — Alex Harring Stocks could be running out of bullish sentiment moving forward, according to Raymond James. "Ongoing deterioration in market breadth and the percentage of stocks with bullish patterns, in conjunction with weakening Investor Sentiment would be consistent with a new intermediate-term (1-3 month) equity market corrective phase developing," analyst Javed Mirza wrote on Monday. "Equity markets are approaching our time target for the intermediate-term equity market rally that began in August, which further reinforces our view that the reward/risk ratio at current levels is poor," Mirza added. — Brian Evans Financials and utilities outperformed the broader market on Monday. Both sectors rose 1% for the day. Raymond James and Goldman Sachs both gained 2% to emerge as some of the top names in the financials sector. In utilities, Vistra jumped 3% to lead the sector. The only sector negative on the day was energy, which fell 0.6% as oil prices fell to their worst day in two years. — Hakyung Kim Clean energy stocks have more on the line in the U.S. presidential election than any other sector of market, and investors expect volatile trading regardless of who wins. The Invesco Solar ETF and iShares Global Clean Energy ETF haven fallen about 7% and more than 9%, respectively this month, as recent polling shows a dead heat between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. Traders are worried that the Republicans could sweep the White House and Congress, which would put the Inflation Reduction Act in jeopardy and likely lead to a clean energy selloff. But renewable stocks could soar if Democrats are able to prevent unified GOP control. "A Harris victory or Dem win in the House could alternatively spur a massive relief rally," Steve Fleishman, an analyst at Wolfe Research, told clients in a note this month. "We recommend investors keep powder dry and be ready to take advantage of potential opportunities." — Spencer Kimball There's many ways to slice the data and be optimistic about November. November has been the best trading month of the year, on average, for the S&P 500 over the last decade and when looking at every year going back to 1950, according to Carson Group data. It's also been the strongest month historically in election years. It has also been higher in 11 of the past 12 years. November's trading month begins on Friday. The S&P 500 is currently slated to finish October with a gain of more than 1%. — Alex Harring These are the stocks moving the most in midday trading: Read the full list of stocks moving here. — Lisa Kailai Han The S&P 500 has bullish seasonality heading into the end of the year, according to Bank of America technical research strategist Stephen Suttmeier. "When the SPX is up YTD through October, which is the likely scenario for 2024, the index is up 79% of the time for the November-December period on average and median returns of 4.00% and 4.27%, respectively," Suttmeier said in a Monday note. The strategist added that this pattern also occurs in presidential election years, with November and December returns actually faring even better in election years. Just November shows the S&P 500 up 62% of the time with an average return of 0.96%, while December shows the broad-market index up 74% of the time with an average return of 1.32%, he said. The S&P 500 is up about 1.1% this month and roughly 22.1% year to date. — Pia Singh The outcome of the U.S. presidential election next week could determine whether the confrontation between Israel and Iran escalates into a conflict that disrupts oil supplies, according to Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets. The oil market has again shrugged off the risk of a supply disruption in the Middle East after Israel spared Iran's energy industry during weekend strikes on military facilities in the Islamic Republic. U.S. crude oil was last trading down 5.49% to $67.84 per barrel. The question now is how Iran responds to Israel's attack, Croft told CNBC's "Money Movers" on Monday. The Revolutionary Guard in Iran has been making harder statements over the last 24 hours about the need to respond to the attack, she said. If Donald Trump wins the U.S. presidential election, there is a risk that the conflict between Israel and Iran escalates further, according to Croft. "There are people around President Trump who strongly want an Israeli strike on the nuclear sites, on the energy sites, who say it's a historic opportunity for Israel to sort of remake the Middle East," Croft said. "The question is, do the Israelis do something more significant, depending on the outcome of the US election next week," she said. — Spencer Kimball On Friday, Aaon announced it had received a $175 million order from one data center customer to supply liquid cooling equipment. With management noting that this order is just "a fraction of a much larger pipeline of opportunity," Baird analyst Timothy Wojs upgraded the stock to outperform on Monday. Artificial intelligence has been fueling a boom in data center development. Companies that can help keep chips cool as they train AI models, a form of computing that requires more power and generates more heat than earlier technologies, stand to benefit. That's where liquid cooling equipment comes in. Aaon shares have climbed nearly 60% year to date. However, if the stock hits Wojs' $130 price target, it will have climbed 17% from Friday's close. The stock was up nearly 8% in trading. The analyst said Aaon has historically grown sales at a compound annual rate of 6% to 7%. The company is now targeting a 10%-plus growth rate, but Wojs expects 11% to 15% growth is not out of the question. —Christina Cheddar Berk Wells Fargo sees outperformance from Spotify ahead. Shares rose about 2% in the premarket after the bank, which has an overweight rating on the audio streaming giant, named the stock a top pick and upped its price target. Its updated target implies about 24% upside from Friday's close. "Incremental Premium gross margins imply that Spotify's evolving product mix and Label relationships are improving the bottom-line," analyst Steven Cahall wrote in a Monday note. "SPOT is also efficiency-focused on overhead costs. These are all the components of a premium growth stock." CNBC Pro subscribers can read more here. — Sean Conlon Shares of McDonald's climbed about 1.5% after the company said its Quarter Pounder burger would return this week to restaurants where it was removed from after a deadly E. coli outbreak. About 900 locations will serve the burger without slivered onion, which believed to be the source of the outbreak, for the foreseeable future as health authorities continue to investigate the matter. McDonald's shares declined more than 7.5% last week, notching its worst weekly performance since 2020 ahead of the company's third-quarter earnings out Tuesday. — Pia Singh A strong third quarter for revenue and EBITDA could spell more gains for Duolingo, according to Bank of America. Shares were fractionally higher after analyst Curtis Nagle reiterated his buy rating on the language app and upped his price target. His updated target implies more than 11% upside from Friday's close. "While we expect another beat and raise quarter in 3Q, expectations are high going into the quarter which could add some near-term volatility risk to shares," he said in a Monday note. "With that said, Duolingo is one of the highest growth cos. within Internet and we remain positive on the opp. for cont. earnings upside." Duolingo shares have surged more than 28% in 2024 and more than 68% in the past three months. The company is expected to post its quarterly results after market close on Nov. 6. — Sean Conlon Stocks tied to the price of bitcoin jumped on Monday as the flagship cryptocurrency moved above $69,000, after briefly touching the level a week ago. Crypto exchange operator Coinbase added 4%. Bitcoin price proxy MicroStrategy advanced more than 5%. Both companies are scheduled to report their quarterly earnings on Wednesday. Bitcoin miners Mara Holdings rose 6% and Riot Platforms gained 5%. Bitcoin has been trying to reclaim the $70,000 level since hitting its record in March above $73,000. Earlier attempts this year have led to brief forays above $70,000, but it has not touched the level since June. Some say that could soon change with the U.S. presidential election drawing nearer. — Tanaya Macheel U.S. stocks began Monday's trading session in the green. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 232 points, or 0.6%. The S&P 500 rose 0.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.7%. — Hakyung Kim Check out the companies making headlines in premarket trading. For the full list, read here. — Pia Singh Oct. 28 is one of the best days of the year to go long U.S. stocks and heralds a highly favorable period for stocks through year-end, according to Goldman Sachs' trading desk managing director Scott Rubner. "Today starts the best trading period of Q4 for U.S. equities with data going back to 1928," Rubner said in a premarket note out to clients Monday referencing the S&P 500. "October 28th is one of the best trading days of the year and a positive seasonal trading stretch with 9 straight days of gains. The 47th all-time high was set on 10/18: 5864 or ~ 20 points higher than today's premarket open." Rubner gave a host of reasons why U.S. stocks are likely to move higher over the remaining nine weeks of 2024, among them that Monday starts "the best trading period of the year for U.S. equities also during election years" while the end of October means less selling from mutual funds and pensions and brings "back online the largest buyer of the equity market, U.S. Corporates." The "repurchase window" for U.S. companies to buy back their own stock "starts today with 50% of corporates in the open window," Rubner wrote. Stocks are also likely to get a boost from diminished volatility, with the Chicago Board Options Exchange's CBOE Volatility Index down to about 19.2 on Monday, and from a contrarian call against a "global consensus on Wall Street" that stock prices will fall after the presidential election on Nov. 5. "I do not think that we see this left tail," Rubner told clients. "[T]he U.S. election will be a clearing event for risk assets, and re-risking may happen quickly," favoring sectors and themes "that are under-owned." — Scott Schnipper A few catalysts have set Tesla up for more outperformance in the coming months, according to Canaccord Genuity. Analyst George Gianarikas, who has a buy rating on the electric vehicle maker, hiked his price target, which implies more than 10% upside from Friday's close. Gianarikas finds that Tesla's earnings trends will get closer to other "Magnificent Seven" names in the current quarter and outpace them next year. "Tesla's stock underperformed since the beginning of 2022 as [profit and loss] trends deteriorated," he continued. "The stock appears to have also bottomed as P&L trends bottomed in 1Q24. We see the stock as likely to follow the upcoming P&L acceleration in our estimates and outperform."

Futures for global crude benchmark Brent slid 5.83% to $71.62 per barrel at 7:54 am ET, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures dropped 6.13% to $67.38 per barrel. Israel on Saturday attacked Iran's military installations in three provinces in response to Tehran launching ballistic missiles against Israel on Oct. 1. "The recent Israel military action is unlikely to be seen by the market as leading to an escalation that impacts oil supply," Citi analysts wrote in a note on Monday, cutting the bank's Brent oil forecast by $4 to $70 per barrel over the next three months. — Lee Ying Shan, Spencer Kimball A couple of catalysts may send shares of Nio higher over the coming months, according to Macquarie. The stock rose around 3% in the premarket on the heels of analyst Eugene Hsiao upgrading the stock to outperform from neutral. His price target also reflects more than 25% upside from Friday's close. "NIO [is] the only player where volume/sales may miss expectations, but Onvo L60 [is] likely more meaningful in 4Q," he wrote in a Monday note. He added that current order trends are "well above" the company's guide of 20,000 unit deliveries for the period. On top of that, Hsiao said that there may also be upside from the Chinese electric vehicle maker's launch of its Firefly brand next year. While shares have gained more than 18% in the past three months, they've slumped this year, falling around 42%. — Sean Conlon Slowing organic sales growth could weigh on Colgate-Palmolive in the near term, according to Stifel. Shares were marginally lower in the premarket after analyst Mark Astrachan downgraded his rating on the stock to hold from buy. He also slightly cut his price target, which now reflects more than 5% upside from Friday's close. This year, the stock has soared about 20%. "We view fundamentals as more-than-solid, evidenced by ~4% volume growth following ~3% growth in 1H24, making Colgate one of the best-performing large-cap consumer staples companies," Astrachan wrote in a recent note to clients. "That said, comparisons are increasingly challenging, and we anticipate organic sales growth to slow from high single-digits in recent years." More specifically, the analyst estimates between 4% and 5% growth in organic sales over the next four quarters. "We think decelerating organic sales is unlikely to result in multiple expansion for CL shares, resulting in range-bound trading over the near-to-medium term, in our view," he also said. — Sean Conlon Wolfe Research thinks some headwinds could bog down Honeywell over the next year. The firm downgraded its rating on the stock to peer perform from outperform, seeing its risk-reward profile as being in the "middle of the pack." That marks the first time since November 2005 that Wolfe has changed from its outperform rating on the name. "HON has struggled for the past 2 years, and we have now become less optimistic that headwinds will resolve over the next 12 months," analyst Nigel Coe wrote in a Monday note to clients. "We see risk of another wave of negative EPS revisions during 1H25." While Coe thinks that warehouse and supply chain headwinds will likely improve next year and in 2026, deceleration across some of the company's business units like Honeywell Process Solutions (HPS) and Universal Oil Products (UOP) could offset the gains seen in its short-cycle units. "Consistent margin expansion has been HON's hallmark, but there are some worrying signs of a margin peak developing, especially if Aero margins remain pinned at ~27% in 2025," he continued. Although the stock has risen more than 7% in the past six months, it's slid almost 1% year to date. — Sean Conlon John Stoltzfus of Oppenheimer Asset Management thinks markets will be choppy in the days leading to the election. After that, investors should be able to exhale. "The Presidential election certainly looks to be a close one. We expect markets to continue to experience some upside and downside risk leading up to the election based on day to day news flow," the firm's chief investment strategist wrote. "After the election? The market is likely to show some relief that an election outcome is known after which it will seek out opportunities and risks tied to policy that could emerge post-election," he added. — Fred Imbert European markets were higher as trading began on Monday, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 last adding 0.24% at 8:15 a.m. London time. Travel and leisure stocks were up around 1.1%, while oil and gas stocks lost 1.7%. Regional bourses were also mostly higher with France's CAC 40 adding 0.7% and Germany's DAX rising 0.2%. — Sophie Kiderlin Japan's Nikkei 225 led gains in Asia on Monday, climbing 1.82% after the country's ruling Liberal Democratic Party lost its majority in the lower house of parliament.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs Reach $3 Billion Inflows In October, Retail Investors Lead The Charge – Report
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-etfs-reach-3-billion-inflows-in-october-retail-investors-lead-the-charge-report/

Bitcoin ETFs ended last week on another positive note with $997.70 million in net inflows and demand reaching its highest level in six months. Undoubtedly, these ETFs have marked the turning point for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies since the beginning of the year, as it opened up the cryptocurrency to inflows from every side. Interestingly, data has shown that retail investors are responsible for most of the demand for Spot Bitcoin ETFs, accounting for 80% of the total assets under management. According to Bloomberg data, Bitcoin ETFs have dominated the ETF landscape in 2024, claiming the top four positions for inflows among all ETFs launched this year. Specifically, out of the 575 ETFs introduced thus far, 14 of the top 30 are new funds focusing on Bitcoin or Ethereum. The standout performer is the BlackRock IBIT fund, which has attracted over $23 billion in year-to-date inflows. Last week was another example of the positive performance in Spot Bitcoin ETFs, despite the coin’s consolidation below the $68,000 price level. According to flow data from SosoValue, weekly inflows started on a positive note on Monday, October 21, with $294.29 million entering the funds and ended the week with $402.08 million in inflows on Friday, October 25. Interestingly, Spot Bitcoin ETFs now hold about 938,700 BTC in 10 months since launch and are steadily approaching the 1 million BTC mark. Although these ETFs have opened doors for institutional investors, a recent report from crypto exchange Binance indicates that retail investors are the primary drivers of this surge in demand, accounting for 80% of the holdings in Spot BTC ETFs. Originally intended to provide institutional investors access to BTC, Spot Bitcoin ETFs have now become the preferred choice for many individual investors looking to take advantage of the regulatory clarity they offer. Nonetheless, there has been a steady demand from the institutional side, with institutional holdings rising by 30% since Q1. Among institutional investors, investment advisers have emerged as the fastest-growing party, with their holdings increasing by 44.2% to reach 71,800 BTC this quarter. Thanks to the rapid growth of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, an impressive 1,179 institutions, including financial giants such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, have joined the crypto’s cap table in less than a year. For comparison, Gold ETFs were only able to attract 95 institutions in their first year of trading. This upward trajectory of institutional investments in Bitcoin is poised to continue into the foreseeable future, which bodes well for the overall price outlook of Bitcoin. As these ETFs attract more institutional capital, they are likely to produce second-order effects like increased BTC dominance, improved market efficiency, and reduced volatility that could significantly benefit the cryptocurrency ecosystem. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $67,100.

Title: Winning ways for Clontarf in Cork as they beat champions Constitution

Clontarf returned to winning ways by travelling to Cork and avenging last season’s epic semi-final defeat with a 20-16 win over the champions Constitution. Con led 13-6 at the break thanks to a try by Irish Sevens winger Sean French, but Clontarf stormed back in the second half through tries by centre Tadhg Bird and Leinster academy winger Aitzol Arenzana-King. Shock of the day was at Lakelands Park where City of Armagh secured a last gasp 30-26 win. Terenure had not lost at home in over a year and had beaten each of the other “big four”. But Armagh roared into a 23-5 interval lead, Kyle Faloon kicking three penalties and converting Dylan Nelson’s try in addition to a penalty try. Terenure responded with three converted tries by Craig Adams (his second), Harrison Brewer and Henry McErlean, but Armagh went to the corner for hooker Jonny Morton to burrow over. Ballynahinch moved into second with a 33-7 win at home to Garryowen, securing a bonus point by half time before a second try by another ex-Irish Sevens winger Zac Ward. St Mary’s also secured a bonus pint by half time in UCD through tries by Leandro Ramirez, Dan Goggin and Jack Nelson (two) en route to a 29-21 win which moved them above Terenure ahead of the sides’ first derby in seven seasons at Templeville Road a fortnight hence. Young Munster also had a bonus point by the interval through tries by Manuel Covella, Jake O’Riordan, Christian Foley and Hubert Gilvarry, and another by Stephen McLoughlin, converted by Argentinian Julian Leszczynski, had them 36-7 ahead before a late rally by Lansdowne. In the 2B summit meeting at Corinthian Park the young home side led 14-0 through tries by Orin Burke and John Devine, the second created by Sean Naughton’s break and offload, but Instonians led at half time through unconverted tries by Bradley McNamara, Ian Whitten and Schalk van der Merwe, two conversions hitting the upright. After a red card for the 37-year-old Whitten, eldest of four Instonians’ siblings, Corinthians’ late siege led to centre Tom Waters crashing over for a 21-15 win. It was just a third defeat in 41 games for “Inst”, and the second in that run by Corinthians. In 2B neighbours Galwegians lost 26-24 in Malone, a fifth defeat by two points or one, leaving them winless with six bonus points and a points difference of minus seven.

Title: Sam Altman-backed energy stock surges amid AI-driven 'nuclear power renaissance'

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Sam Altman-backed nuclear power company Oklo (OKLO) has boomed on the stock market over the past month as investors look to nuclear energy as the next big AI trade. Shares in the company, which is designing so-called small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), have surged nearly 140% over the past month on Big Tech’s growing interest in nuclear power. SMRs are designed to produce cheaper, faster, greener energy than traditional nuclear facilities. Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG) in mid-October announced substantial investments in SMR projects as they look to balance their climate goals with the growing energy demands of the data centers powering their various AI software. Oracle's (ORCL) Larry Ellison announced in September that the company intends to build a data center powered by SMRs. “A nuclear power renaissance is underway with nuclear increasingly viewed as a solution which solves both the increased need for baseload power and the need to decarbonize,” wrote Craig-Hallum analyst Eric Stine in a recent note to investors. Baseload power refers to the day-to-day energy demand on an electrical grid. Stine said Google and Amazon’s investments are “truly just the beginning of a multi-decade megatrend.” Goldman Sachs estimates that global data center power consumption will grow 160% by 2030, driven by demand from artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, separate data from the International Atomic Energy Agency shows nuclear power production in North America potentially doubling by 2050. Stocks of other firms making similar tech to Oklo’s, such as NuScale (SMƒR) and NANO Nuclear Energy (NNE), also surged following news of Google's and Amazon's investments on Oct. 14 and Oct. 16, respectively, before paring gains this week. “The opportunity is so massive here in the market that there's going to be a good number of folks that are successful,” Oklo CEO Jacob DeWitte told Yahoo Finance. In fact, the SMR market could grow to $300 billion by 2040, according to research cited by Citi analysts. Oklo went public in May through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, AltC Acquisition Corp., which Altman co-founded. In addition to Altman, Cathie Wood and Peter Thiel are on its list of investors. Sam Altman owned a 2.6% stake in the company, according to a regulatory filing in June. He became chair of Oklo in 2024 after serving as its CEO for three years. While Oklo was founded in 2013, well ahead of the AI boom, the energy needs of artificial intelligence have been a boon to the firm as it builds its client book, DeWitte said. “AI does make [up] the bulk of our order book that we've talked about,” DeWitte said in an interview. That includes clients in the chip sector as well as data centers, he added. Publicly, the company has said it's working with hyperscalers Equinix and Prometheus Hyperscale. It has yet to disclose any deals with Big Tech firms. But Wall Street analysts caution that the company and its competitors face regulatory and supply chain hurdles before they can produce anywhere near the amount of power needed to run artificial intelligence data centers. Nuclear projects have been subject to stringent regulations in response to high-profile global nuclear meltdowns at Three Mile Island in 1979, Chernobyl in 1986, and Fukushima in 2011. On average, it takes the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission 80 months to approve nuclear plant construction in the US, compared to an average of 54 months in the UK, according to research cited by Canaccord Genuity. While a number of companies are developing SMRs — including Bill Gates’ TerraPower — none have been deployed in the US to date, and long licensing processes mean profitability isn't exactly on the horizon. In Oklo’s first earnings report since going public on Aug. 13, the company reported a net loss of about $53 million for the first six months of the year, wider than the roughly $9 million loss it posted in the year-earlier period. Fuel is also an issue for companies in the space: Many SMRs, such as those of Oklo, NuScale, and TerraPower, require a specific type called high-assay low-enriched uranium, also known as HALEU, which is imported from Russia. There's little to no domestic supply since the West at large has avoided developing a HALEU supply chain. That's because enriched uranium is used in nuclear weapons, according to Canaccord Genuity. “A developed Western HALEU supply chain is absent, particularly given efforts to limit enrichment due to concerns over proliferation,” wrote Canaccord Genuity analyst George Gianarikas in a note to investors early this year. Citing supply constraints and long and difficult licensing processes, Citi’s Vikram Bagri recently reduced his price target on Oklo stock from $11 to $10. “There are too many ‘ifs’ in this process,” Bagri said. “The new technology and new nuclear installs, it seems like, will happen only after 2030. After 2030, it remains to be seen who gets successful and how successful they get, how many nuclear reactors we see.” But Seaport analyst Jeffrey Campbell sees Oklo having advantages in the burgeoning market, pointing to its ability to use “much cheaper” recycled fuel. Whereas a traditional nuclear plant can take billions of dollars to build, Oklo has said the cost of bringing one of its SMRs online is a few hundred million dollars. For his part, DeWitte is optimistic about the future of the market — and Oklo’s place in it. DeWitte cited mounting bipartisan support to reduce regulatory hurdles and enhance the domestic supply of HALEU. He said Oklo is unique because the company is looking to own and operate its facilities and sell energy directly to customers, rather than the traditional model of licensing its technology to utilities. DeWitte believes this will enable the company to bring its reactors online faster. “In the world today, where this opportunity is so massive — diverse customers that need different things, want different things … you're going to see a diverse ecosystem evolve,” he said. He added, “You're not going to see one winner take all.” Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X @LauraBratton5.

Title: BlackRock Makes History With 400,000 Bitcoin (BTC)

U.Today - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) has reached a new milestone in its Bitcoin holdings, with a total of over 400,000 BTC. Right now, the hedge fund's holdings are valued at around $26.98 billion, with a total of 403,725 BTC. This big accumulation comes as the asset management giant bought another 34,085 BTC over the past two weeks, which is estimated to be worth about $2.3 billion, reports Lookonchain. The ongoing inflows into Bitcoin ETFs are helping BlackRock to grow its presence in the cryptocurrency market, making the firm a dominant force. This shows that more and more, Bitcoin ETFs are becoming a big way for institutions to own BTC. As the company increases its holdings, some people think that Bitcoin's future might change. Many are already projecting a sort of Bitcoin wars in the future, making dystopian predictions that BlackRock will eventually push for the fork of the original BTC chain and then promote its own forked chain as the real one, using all its massive resources to do so. It does not sound like something impossible, but in the current realm it seems more like a conspiracy theory. Such a rapid accumulation of Bitcoin has people wondering where BlackRock will draw the line in its pursuit of dominance in the cryptocurrency market. On the other hand, the financial behemoth faces challenges to its influence from other significant stakeholders in the Bitcoin space, including figures like Michael Saylor with MicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings, mining entities, early adopters and millions of individual investors who form a large and decentralized market presence. Whether they will be able to present a solid opposition to BlackRock is another question however. This article was originally published on U.Today

Title: Zelensky the Lying War Criminal Tries to Create World War III

Time Published: 2024-10-27T16:30:39Z

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/27/2024 9:30:39 AM PDT by delta7 world into World War III. He actually suggested he be given nuclear weapons if not allowed to join NATO. I have had employees both in Kyiv and Donetsk, and the sad part about this is they have lost their country, and for what? I warned them that he was dishonest and had been constantly lying and trying to manipulate the world. He intentionally dresses as if he is in the military, no matter what he attends. He thinks this is a psychological ploy to get him never-ending money constantly. The only way to world peace is to arrest this clown, and he should be in prison for the rest of his life without parole. Zelensky lied to get into office and pretended to be Christian, even baptizing g his two children. He promised peace to win, and my sources in Kiev swear the election was rigged. He promised peace, and has done everything put what he promised and then declared Martial Law so he does not have to stand for election every again as long as he can keep this war going. Heis VICTORY PLAN was nothing but to conquer and destroy Russia. He then suddenly became Jewish to select the fact that he was a Neo-Nazi and used to joke on stage about confiscating assets from Jews and Russians which he classified as the same. Friends in Israel do not consider him Jewish and he was pushing his claimed Jewish heritage and then asking for money implying this was vaguely connected to exterminating the Jews. The Pandora Papers revealed that Zelensky also had secret hidden offshore accounts along with all the other corrupt Ukrainian politicians. He had the audacity to claim that they were offshore protecting him against pro-Russian forces. In truth, these offshore accounts pre-dated him becoming president. Sources in Ukraine also claim that he was drafted and never showed up for military service. warned that if Zelensky were assassinated, he would be by a Ukrainian. He has destroyed his own country hoping to make a fortune on its reconstruction. Farmland is now bought by Blackrock, and the list of corruption is endless. Zelensky is looking for hundreds of billions to rebuild Ukraine and has the audacity to claim this will be the biggest investment project for Europe in modern history. The day before Russia came to the aid of the Donbas in this civil war that Kiev started on the alleged orders of Victoria Nuland, to ensure Putin would cross the border, he declared that Ukraine would rearm with nuclear weapons. That was the final straw; Putin even noted that in his address to Russia. It was not any different than the JFK and the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Washington Post found out that Zelensky knew when Russia would cross the border and did not warn his people. Like Hamas, he wanted civilians to be killed so he could blame Russia. When asked why he did not warn his people, he said it would have cost him $7 billion dollars. That is a war criminal. It was the American Neocons who instructed the UNELECTED Kiev government to attack the Russians in the Donbas and call them terrorists because they, too, wanted to separate from the Ukrainians who hate Russians and were killing them on the streets of Odesa. Zelendky staged the entirely false claim that Russia just killed civilians in Bucha. I have seen footage of pretend bodies with no visible blood lying in the streets, and as the car passed, they got up. There was no evidence of any such massacre. You have to understand that creating false flags is the #1 occupation of Ukraine. On March 31, 2022, the mayor of Bucha was joyful in announcing that the settlement had been liberated. He does not talk about any corpses on the roads and the terrible destruction of mass graves. It was two days later when suddenly photos and videos of people lying along the road appeared and horrendous stories about hundreds of dead being thrown in mass graves. These reports did not surface until two days after the Russians left. The Ukrainians were staging another false flag. Why did the mayor appear joyous and make no mention at first of these atrocities? This is why the West simply claimed there was no evidence and hid this was yet another Ukrainian False Flag trying to start World War III. Any Western Politician who votes for anything to support Ukraine should be charged with treason. Zelensky tried to claim Russia attacked Poland to start World War III. The evidence shows it was Ukraine that attacked Poland and tried to claim it was Russia. My RELIABLE sources insisted that it was Ukrainians who shot down the Malaysia fight and tried to blame the Russians. That was all covered up, and they blamed Russians in the Donbas. The West simply wants to destroy Russia. This is why Merkel lied to Putin and falsely negotiated the Minsk Agreement to buy time for Ukraine to build an army. This has been on the agenda for decades, and the fall of communism never changed that policy. They will do the same with China. In truth, this is Ukrainians invading the Russian territory where Russians have lived for centuries. The propaganda has flipped this completely around, claiming Putin was invading Ukraine when they began this civil war in 2014 and launched the first attacks on the Donbas. The treatment of Polish, Jews, and Russians during WWII even horrified the German Nazis. Why would Poland ever support Ukraine can only be that its leaders are told what to say and do by those behind NATO seeking World War III. The Polish people should wake up, for they will be the next to be thrown on this altar of geopolitical sacrifice. The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis. Poland officially called the Ukrainian actions genocide. The Ukrainians have been protected by the CIA for decades ONLY because they hated Russians. They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person’s throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person’s torso in half with a carpenter’s saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women’s abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: “Some Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ” id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia’s enemy is the West’s friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. “We’re not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,” he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn’t join NATO. “Either Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.” There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: “I can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.” Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world’s financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

Because the “America First” crowd was dead wrong in WW2. But they were dead right in WW1. America (and Europe) would have been much better off if Wilson had resisted the pressure to enter the war. So what to do? Perhaps we should be - at least initially - guided by: America goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.

He intentionally dresses as if he is in the military, no matter what he attends. He thinks this is a psychological ploy to get him never-ending money constantly. The only way to world peace is to arrest this clown, and he should be in prison for the rest of his life without parole. Zelensky lied to get into office and pretended to be Christian, even baptizing g his two children. He promised peace to win, and my sources in Kiev swear the election was rigged. He promised peace, and has done everything put what he promised and then declared Martial Law so he does not have to stand for election every again as long as he can keep this war going. Heis VICTORY PLAN was nothing but to conquer and destroy Russia. He then suddenly became Jewish to select the fact that he was a Neo-Nazi and used to joke on stage about confiscating assets from Jews and Russians which he classified as the same. Friends in Israel do not consider him Jewish and he was pushing his claimed Jewish heritage and then asking for money implying this was vaguely connected to exterminating the Jews. The Pandora Papers revealed that Zelensky also had secret hidden offshore accounts along with all the other corrupt Ukrainian politicians. He had the audacity to claim that they were offshore protecting him against pro-Russian forces. In truth, these offshore accounts pre-dated him becoming president. Sources in Ukraine also claim that he was drafted and never showed up for military service. warned that if Zelensky were assassinated, he would be by a Ukrainian. He has destroyed his own country hoping to make a fortune on its reconstruction. Farmland is now bought by Blackrock, and the list of corruption is endless. Zelensky is looking for hundreds of billions to rebuild Ukraine and has the audacity to claim this will be the biggest investment project for Europe in modern history. The day before Russia came to the aid of the Donbas in this civil war that Kiev started on the alleged orders of Victoria Nuland, to ensure Putin would cross the border, he declared that Ukraine would rearm with nuclear weapons. That was the final straw; Putin even noted that in his address to Russia. It was not any different than the JFK and the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Washington Post found out that Zelensky knew when Russia would cross the border and did not warn his people. Like Hamas, he wanted civilians to be killed so he could blame Russia. When asked why he did not warn his people, he said it would have cost him $7 billion dollars. That is a war criminal. It was the American Neocons who instructed the UNELECTED Kiev government to attack the Russians in the Donbas and call them terrorists because they, too, wanted to separate from the Ukrainians who hate Russians and were killing them on the streets of Odesa. Zelendky staged the entirely false claim that Russia just killed civilians in Bucha. I have seen footage of pretend bodies with no visible blood lying in the streets, and as the car passed, they got up. There was no evidence of any such massacre. You have to understand that creating false flags is the #1 occupation of Ukraine. On March 31, 2022, the mayor of Bucha was joyful in announcing that the settlement had been liberated. He does not talk about any corpses on the roads and the terrible destruction of mass graves. It was two days later when suddenly photos and videos of people lying along the road appeared and horrendous stories about hundreds of dead being thrown in mass graves. These reports did not surface until two days after the Russians left. The Ukrainians were staging another false flag. Why did the mayor appear joyous and make no mention at first of these atrocities? This is why the West simply claimed there was no evidence and hid this was yet another Ukrainian False Flag trying to start World War III. Any Western Politician who votes for anything to support Ukraine should be charged with treason. Zelensky tried to claim Russia attacked Poland to start World War III. The evidence shows it was Ukraine that attacked Poland and tried to claim it was Russia. My RELIABLE sources insisted that it was Ukrainians who shot down the Malaysia fight and tried to blame the Russians. That was all covered up, and they blamed Russians in the Donbas. The West simply wants to destroy Russia. This is why Merkel lied to Putin and falsely negotiated the Minsk Agreement to buy time for Ukraine to build an army. This has been on the agenda for decades, and the fall of communism never changed that policy. They will do the same with China. In truth, this is Ukrainians invading the Russian territory where Russians have lived for centuries. The propaganda has flipped this completely around, claiming Putin was invading Ukraine when they began this civil war in 2014 and launched the first attacks on the Donbas. The treatment of Polish, Jews, and Russians during WWII even horrified the German Nazis. Why would Poland ever support Ukraine can only be that its leaders are told what to say and do by those behind NATO seeking World War III.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Zelensky lied to get into office and pretended to be Christian, even baptizing g his two children. He promised peace to win, and my sources in Kiev swear the election was rigged. He promised peace, and has done everything put what he promised and then declared Martial Law so he does not have to stand for election every again as long as he can keep this war going. Heis VICTORY PLAN was nothing but to conquer and destroy Russia. He then suddenly became Jewish to select the fact that he was a Neo-Nazi and used to joke on stage about confiscating assets from Jews and Russians which he classified as the same. Friends in Israel do not consider him Jewish and he was pushing his claimed Jewish heritage and then asking for money implying this was vaguely connected to exterminating the Jews. The Pandora Papers revealed that Zelensky also had secret hidden offshore accounts along with all the other corrupt Ukrainian politicians. He had the audacity to claim that they were offshore protecting him against pro-Russian forces. In truth, these offshore accounts pre-dated him becoming president. Sources in Ukraine also claim that he was drafted and never showed up for military service. warned that if Zelensky were assassinated, he would be by a Ukrainian. He has destroyed his own country hoping to make a fortune on its reconstruction. Farmland is now bought by Blackrock, and the list of corruption is endless. Zelensky is looking for hundreds of billions to rebuild Ukraine and has the audacity to claim this will be the biggest investment project for Europe in modern history. The day before Russia came to the aid of the Donbas in this civil war that Kiev started on the alleged orders of Victoria Nuland, to ensure Putin would cross the border, he declared that Ukraine would rearm with nuclear weapons. That was the final straw; Putin even noted that in his address to Russia. It was not any different than the JFK and the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Washington Post found out that Zelensky knew when Russia would cross the border and did not warn his people. Like Hamas, he wanted civilians to be killed so he could blame Russia. When asked why he did not warn his people, he said it would have cost him $7 billion dollars. That is a war criminal. It was the American Neocons who instructed the UNELECTED Kiev government to attack the Russians in the Donbas and call them terrorists because they, too, wanted to separate from the Ukrainians who hate Russians and were killing them on the streets of Odesa. Zelendky staged the entirely false claim that Russia just killed civilians in Bucha. I have seen footage of pretend bodies with no visible blood lying in the streets, and as the car passed, they got up. There was no evidence of any such massacre. You have to understand that creating false flags is the #1 occupation of Ukraine. On March 31, 2022, the mayor of Bucha was joyful in announcing that the settlement had been liberated. He does not talk about any corpses on the roads and the terrible destruction of mass graves. It was two days later when suddenly photos and videos of people lying along the road appeared and horrendous stories about hundreds of dead being thrown in mass graves. These reports did not surface until two days after the Russians left. The Ukrainians were staging another false flag. Why did the mayor appear joyous and make no mention at first of these atrocities? This is why the West simply claimed there was no evidence and hid this was yet another Ukrainian False Flag trying to start World War III. Any Western Politician who votes for anything to support Ukraine should be charged with treason. Zelensky tried to claim Russia attacked Poland to start World War III. The evidence shows it was Ukraine that attacked Poland and tried to claim it was Russia. My RELIABLE sources insisted that it was Ukrainians who shot down the Malaysia fight and tried to blame the Russians. That was all covered up, and they blamed Russians in the Donbas. The West simply wants to destroy Russia. This is why Merkel lied to Putin and falsely negotiated the Minsk Agreement to buy time for Ukraine to build an army. This has been on the agenda for decades, and the fall of communism never changed that policy. They will do the same with China. In truth, this is Ukrainians invading the Russian territory where Russians have lived for centuries. The propaganda has flipped this completely around, claiming Putin was invading Ukraine when they began this civil war in 2014 and launched the first attacks on the Donbas. The treatment of Polish, Jews, and Russians during WWII even horrified the German Nazis. Why would Poland ever support Ukraine can only be that its leaders are told what to say and do by those behind NATO seeking World War III. The Polish people should wake up, for they will be the next to be thrown on this altar of geopolitical sacrifice. The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis. Poland officially called the Ukrainian actions genocide. The Ukrainians have been protected by the CIA for decades ONLY because they hated Russians. They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person’s throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person’s torso in half with a carpenter’s saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women’s abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: “Some Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ” id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia’s enemy is the West’s friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. “We’re not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,” he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn’t join NATO. “Either Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.” There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: “I can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.” Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world’s financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

Because the “America First” crowd was dead wrong in WW2. But they were dead right in WW1. America (and Europe) would have been much better off if Wilson had resisted the pressure to enter the war. So what to do? Perhaps we should be - at least initially - guided by: America goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.

He had the audacity to claim that they were offshore protecting him against pro-Russian forces. In truth, these offshore accounts pre-dated him becoming president. Sources in Ukraine also claim that he was drafted and never showed up for military service. warned that if Zelensky were assassinated, he would be by a Ukrainian. He has destroyed his own country hoping to make a fortune on its reconstruction. Farmland is now bought by Blackrock, and the list of corruption is endless. Zelensky is looking for hundreds of billions to rebuild Ukraine and has the audacity to claim this will be the biggest investment project for Europe in modern history. The day before Russia came to the aid of the Donbas in this civil war that Kiev started on the alleged orders of Victoria Nuland, to ensure Putin would cross the border, he declared that Ukraine would rearm with nuclear weapons. That was the final straw; Putin even noted that in his address to Russia. It was not any different than the JFK and the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Washington Post found out that Zelensky knew when Russia would cross the border and did not warn his people. Like Hamas, he wanted civilians to be killed so he could blame Russia. When asked why he did not warn his people, he said it would have cost him $7 billion dollars. That is a war criminal. It was the American Neocons who instructed the UNELECTED Kiev government to attack the Russians in the Donbas and call them terrorists because they, too, wanted to separate from the Ukrainians who hate Russians and were killing them on the streets of Odesa. Zelendky staged the entirely false claim that Russia just killed civilians in Bucha. I have seen footage of pretend bodies with no visible blood lying in the streets, and as the car passed, they got up. There was no evidence of any such massacre. You have to understand that creating false flags is the #1 occupation of Ukraine. On March 31, 2022, the mayor of Bucha was joyful in announcing that the settlement had been liberated. He does not talk about any corpses on the roads and the terrible destruction of mass graves. It was two days later when suddenly photos and videos of people lying along the road appeared and horrendous stories about hundreds of dead being thrown in mass graves. These reports did not surface until two days after the Russians left. The Ukrainians were staging another false flag. Why did the mayor appear joyous and make no mention at first of these atrocities? This is why the West simply claimed there was no evidence and hid this was yet another Ukrainian False Flag trying to start World War III. Any Western Politician who votes for anything to support Ukraine should be charged with treason. Zelensky tried to claim Russia attacked Poland to start World War III. The evidence shows it was Ukraine that attacked Poland and tried to claim it was Russia. My RELIABLE sources insisted that it was Ukrainians who shot down the Malaysia fight and tried to blame the Russians. That was all covered up, and they blamed Russians in the Donbas. The West simply wants to destroy Russia. This is why Merkel lied to Putin and falsely negotiated the Minsk Agreement to buy time for Ukraine to build an army. This has been on the agenda for decades, and the fall of communism never changed that policy. They will do the same with China. In truth, this is Ukrainians invading the Russian territory where Russians have lived for centuries. The propaganda has flipped this completely around, claiming Putin was invading Ukraine when they began this civil war in 2014 and launched the first attacks on the Donbas. The treatment of Polish, Jews, and Russians during WWII even horrified the German Nazis. Why would Poland ever support Ukraine can only be that its leaders are told what to say and do by those behind NATO seeking World War III. The Polish people should wake up, for they will be the next to be thrown on this altar of geopolitical sacrifice. The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis. Poland officially called the Ukrainian actions genocide. The Ukrainians have been protected by the CIA for decades ONLY because they hated Russians. They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person’s throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person’s torso in half with a carpenter’s saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women’s abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: “Some Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ” id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia’s enemy is the West’s friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. “We’re not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,” he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn’t join NATO. “Either Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.” There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: “I can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.” Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world’s financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

I don’t care how corrupt or “Nazi” Ukraine is. That’s internal stuff. Ukraine never invaded anyone. However, there’s a third player here. And that’s NATO. NATO recklessly expanded to the east after the Cold War ended. Russia would have to see that as being provocative. Just as JFK saw Soviet missiles in Cuba as being provocative.

That was the final straw; Putin even noted that in his address to Russia. It was not any different than the JFK and the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Washington Post found out that Zelensky knew when Russia would cross the border and did not warn his people. Like Hamas, he wanted civilians to be killed so he could blame Russia. When asked why he did not warn his people, he said it would have cost him $7 billion dollars. That is a war criminal. It was the American Neocons who instructed the UNELECTED Kiev government to attack the Russians in the Donbas and call them terrorists because they, too, wanted to separate from the Ukrainians who hate Russians and were killing them on the streets of Odesa. Zelendky staged the entirely false claim that Russia just killed civilians in Bucha. I have seen footage of pretend bodies with no visible blood lying in the streets, and as the car passed, they got up. There was no evidence of any such massacre. You have to understand that creating false flags is the #1 occupation of Ukraine. On March 31, 2022, the mayor of Bucha was joyful in announcing that the settlement had been liberated. He does not talk about any corpses on the roads and the terrible destruction of mass graves. It was two days later when suddenly photos and videos of people lying along the road appeared and horrendous stories about hundreds of dead being thrown in mass graves. These reports did not surface until two days after the Russians left. The Ukrainians were staging another false flag. Why did the mayor appear joyous and make no mention at first of these atrocities? This is why the West simply claimed there was no evidence and hid this was yet another Ukrainian False Flag trying to start World War III. Any Western Politician who votes for anything to support Ukraine should be charged with treason. Zelensky tried to claim Russia attacked Poland to start World War III. The evidence shows it was Ukraine that attacked Poland and tried to claim it was Russia. My RELIABLE sources insisted that it was Ukrainians who shot down the Malaysia fight and tried to blame the Russians. That was all covered up, and they blamed Russians in the Donbas. The West simply wants to destroy Russia. This is why Merkel lied to Putin and falsely negotiated the Minsk Agreement to buy time for Ukraine to build an army. This has been on the agenda for decades, and the fall of communism never changed that policy. They will do the same with China. In truth, this is Ukrainians invading the Russian territory where Russians have lived for centuries. The propaganda has flipped this completely around, claiming Putin was invading Ukraine when they began this civil war in 2014 and launched the first attacks on the Donbas. The treatment of Polish, Jews, and Russians during WWII even horrified the German Nazis. Why would Poland ever support Ukraine can only be that its leaders are told what to say and do by those behind NATO seeking World War III. The Polish people should wake up, for they will be the next to be thrown on this altar of geopolitical sacrifice. The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis. Poland officially called the Ukrainian actions genocide. The Ukrainians have been protected by the CIA for decades ONLY because they hated Russians. They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person’s throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person’s torso in half with a carpenter’s saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women’s abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: “Some Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ” id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia’s enemy is the West’s friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. “We’re not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,” he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn’t join NATO. “Either Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.” There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: “I can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.” Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world’s financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

Zelendky staged the entirely false claim that Russia just killed civilians in Bucha. I have seen footage of pretend bodies with no visible blood lying in the streets, and as the car passed, they got up. There was no evidence of any such massacre. You have to understand that creating false flags is the #1 occupation of Ukraine. On March 31, 2022, the mayor of Bucha was joyful in announcing that the settlement had been liberated. He does not talk about any corpses on the roads and the terrible destruction of mass graves. It was two days later when suddenly photos and videos of people lying along the road appeared and horrendous stories about hundreds of dead being thrown in mass graves. These reports did not surface until two days after the Russians left. The Ukrainians were staging another false flag. Why did the mayor appear joyous and make no mention at first of these atrocities? This is why the West simply claimed there was no evidence and hid this was yet another Ukrainian False Flag trying to start World War III. Any Western Politician who votes for anything to support Ukraine should be charged with treason. Zelensky tried to claim Russia attacked Poland to start World War III. The evidence shows it was Ukraine that attacked Poland and tried to claim it was Russia. My RELIABLE sources insisted that it was Ukrainians who shot down the Malaysia fight and tried to blame the Russians. That was all covered up, and they blamed Russians in the Donbas. The West simply wants to destroy Russia. This is why Merkel lied to Putin and falsely negotiated the Minsk Agreement to buy time for Ukraine to build an army. This has been on the agenda for decades, and the fall of communism never changed that policy. They will do the same with China. In truth, this is Ukrainians invading the Russian territory where Russians have lived for centuries. The propaganda has flipped this completely around, claiming Putin was invading Ukraine when they began this civil war in 2014 and launched the first attacks on the Donbas. The treatment of Polish, Jews, and Russians during WWII even horrified the German Nazis. Why would Poland ever support Ukraine can only be that its leaders are told what to say and do by those behind NATO seeking World War III. The Polish people should wake up, for they will be the next to be thrown on this altar of geopolitical sacrifice. The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis. Poland officially called the Ukrainian actions genocide. The Ukrainians have been protected by the CIA for decades ONLY because they hated Russians. They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person’s throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person’s torso in half with a carpenter’s saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women’s abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: “Some Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ” id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia’s enemy is the West’s friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. “We’re not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,” he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn’t join NATO. “Either Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.” There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: “I can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.” Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world’s financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

Because the “America First” crowd was dead wrong in WW2. But they were dead right in WW1. America (and Europe) would have been much better off if Wilson had resisted the pressure to enter the war. So what to do? Perhaps we should be - at least initially - guided by: America goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson You have to understand that creating false flags is the #1 occupation of Ukraine. On March 31, 2022, the mayor of Bucha was joyful in announcing that the settlement had been liberated. He does not talk about any corpses on the roads and the terrible destruction of mass graves. It was two days later when suddenly photos and videos of people lying along the road appeared and horrendous stories about hundreds of dead being thrown in mass graves. These reports did not surface until two days after the Russians left. The Ukrainians were staging another false flag. Why did the mayor appear joyous and make no mention at first of these atrocities? This is why the West simply claimed there was no evidence and hid this was yet another Ukrainian False Flag trying to start World War III. Any Western Politician who votes for anything to support Ukraine should be charged with treason. Zelensky tried to claim Russia attacked Poland to start World War III. The evidence shows it was Ukraine that attacked Poland and tried to claim it was Russia. My RELIABLE sources insisted that it was Ukrainians who shot down the Malaysia fight and tried to blame the Russians. That was all covered up, and they blamed Russians in the Donbas. The West simply wants to destroy Russia. This is why Merkel lied to Putin and falsely negotiated the Minsk Agreement to buy time for Ukraine to build an army. This has been on the agenda for decades, and the fall of communism never changed that policy. They will do the same with China. In truth, this is Ukrainians invading the Russian territory where Russians have lived for centuries. The propaganda has flipped this completely around, claiming Putin was invading Ukraine when they began this civil war in 2014 and launched the first attacks on the Donbas. The treatment of Polish, Jews, and Russians during WWII even horrified the German Nazis. Why would Poland ever support Ukraine can only be that its leaders are told what to say and do by those behind NATO seeking World War III. The Polish people should wake up, for they will be the next to be thrown on this altar of geopolitical sacrifice. The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis. Poland officially called the Ukrainian actions genocide. The Ukrainians have been protected by the CIA for decades ONLY because they hated Russians. They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person’s throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person’s torso in half with a carpenter’s saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women’s abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: “Some Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ” id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia’s enemy is the West’s friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. “We’re not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,” he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn’t join NATO. “Either Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.” There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: “I can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.” Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world’s financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

Because the “America First” crowd was dead wrong in WW2. But they were dead right in WW1. America (and Europe) would have been much better off if Wilson had resisted the pressure to enter the war. So what to do? Perhaps we should be - at least initially - guided by: America goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.

The evidence shows it was Ukraine that attacked Poland and tried to claim it was Russia. My RELIABLE sources insisted that it was Ukrainians who shot down the Malaysia fight and tried to blame the Russians. That was all covered up, and they blamed Russians in the Donbas. The West simply wants to destroy Russia. This is why Merkel lied to Putin and falsely negotiated the Minsk Agreement to buy time for Ukraine to build an army. This has been on the agenda for decades, and the fall of communism never changed that policy. They will do the same with China. In truth, this is Ukrainians invading the Russian territory where Russians have lived for centuries. The propaganda has flipped this completely around, claiming Putin was invading Ukraine when they began this civil war in 2014 and launched the first attacks on the Donbas. The treatment of Polish, Jews, and Russians during WWII even horrified the German Nazis. Why would Poland ever support Ukraine can only be that its leaders are told what to say and do by those behind NATO seeking World War III. The Polish people should wake up, for they will be the next to be thrown on this altar of geopolitical sacrifice. The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis. Poland officially called the Ukrainian actions genocide. The Ukrainians have been protected by the CIA for decades ONLY because they hated Russians. They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person’s throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person’s torso in half with a carpenter’s saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women’s abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: “Some Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ” id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia’s enemy is the West’s friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. “We’re not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,” he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn’t join NATO. “Either Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.” There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: “I can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.” Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world’s financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

Because the “America First” crowd was dead wrong in WW2. But they were dead right in WW1. America (and Europe) would have been much better off if Wilson had resisted the pressure to enter the war. So what to do? Perhaps we should be - at least initially - guided by: America goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.

Why would Poland ever support Ukraine can only be that its leaders are told what to say and do by those behind NATO seeking World War III. The Polish people should wake up, for they will be the next to be thrown on this altar of geopolitical sacrifice. The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis. Poland officially called the Ukrainian actions genocide. The Ukrainians have been protected by the CIA for decades ONLY because they hated Russians. They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person’s throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person’s torso in half with a carpenter’s saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women’s abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: “Some Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ” id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia’s enemy is the West’s friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. “We’re not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,” he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn’t join NATO. “Either Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.” There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: “I can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.” Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world’s financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

Because the “America First” crowd was dead wrong in WW2. But they were dead right in WW1. America (and Europe) would have been much better off if Wilson had resisted the pressure to enter the war. So what to do? Perhaps we should be - at least initially - guided by: America goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.

They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person’s throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person’s torso in half with a carpenter’s saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women’s abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: “Some Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ” id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia’s enemy is the West’s friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. “We’re not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,” he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn’t join NATO. “Either Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.” There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: “I can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.” Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world’s financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing.

Because the “America First” crowd was dead wrong in WW2. But they were dead right in WW1. America (and Europe) would have been much better off if Wilson had resisted the pressure to enter the war. So what to do? Perhaps we should be - at least initially - guided by: America goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.

The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. “We’re not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,” he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn’t join NATO. “Either Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.” There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: “I can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.” Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world’s financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

I don’t care how corrupt or “Nazi” Ukraine is. That’s internal stuff. Ukraine never invaded anyone. However, there’s a third player here. And that’s NATO.

Keep up with you clot shots DugwayDouche. ————— Senile Joe’s MRNA vax/ mask, shut down debacle falls right in line with his Afghanistan and Ukie war debacle. That said, a disclaimer: I am a Pureblood, never bought into his fear campaign. I saw right through it early on. > President Trump is going to end this genocidal disaster of a war < “Genocidal disaster” is a good description of this Ukraine/Russia war. It’s very much like WW1, just on a smaller scale. Christians desperately trying to kill Christians - and all over relatively minor issues. As you noted, if anyone can end this war it will be Donald Trump. And that’s why the next election is so critical. It won’t just affect the United States. “Genocidal disaster” is a good description of this Ukraine/Russia war. It’s very much like WW1, just on a smaller scale. Christians desperately trying to kill Christians - and all over relatively minor issues. And if they could drag the Poles and Belarussians into the fight it would even be better for them. They want dead Slavs. delta7 wrote: “He world’s biggest threat? The US has all beat, Somalia, Libya, Yugoslavia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, just to mention a few.

Because the “America First” crowd was dead wrong in WW2. But they were dead right in WW1. America (and Europe) would have been much better off if Wilson had resisted the pressure to enter the war. So what to do? Perhaps we should be - at least initially - guided by: America goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.

Title: The Ambiguity Of Buying From Temu: How To Stay Safe Ahead Of The Festive Retail Season | HackerNoon

As the festive season approaches, holiday shoppers whose budgets have been stretched to their limits could begin looking around for more affordable alternatives in an attempt to fulfill their holiday wishlist. While there are plenty of more affordable budget-friendly options, one name is standing out in the crowd. After years of explosive growth, Temu has become a go-to place for shoppers looking for the best possible deals on high-tech gadgets, toys, clothing, homeware, and plenty more. However, amidst the questionably low prices and an endless array of products to choose from, customers are beginning to raise concerns about Temu’s credibility, with many previous customers complaining about unfulfilled orders, poor product quality, and seemingly non-existent customer service. Temu has become a double-edged sword for many customers looking to cut down on their holiday spending. The online marketplace offers incredible deals and promotions, however, many customers are noticing red flags, with some concerns regarding digital privacy, leaving many shoppers to wonder whether it’s still safe to shop on Temu ahead of the festive season. Many avid online shoppers may have already come across Temu in the past, as the company has pushed some fairly aggressive marketing campaigns in recent years following its launch in the United States about two years ago. Despite the countless internet sleuths claiming that Temu is a fake website, the reality of this couldn’t be farther from the truth. Temu is a very real, and very active online marketplace, which is a subsidiary of the Chinese-based commerce group, PDD Holdings, otherwise known as Pinduoduo Inc. Launched in September 2022 by PDD Holdings, Temu has very quickly become a go-to destination for affordable online shopping. Similar to Amazon, Temu offers an endless selection of products and has partnered with hundreds of brands to help bolster their online inventory lists. Following lofty marketing campaigns, and spending millions of dollars on advertising during the 2022 Super Bowl Championship, Temu has seen surging popularity among millions of consumers, with the e-commerce platform seeing a record-setting 60 million downloads in July 2024 globally, making it more popular than the Amazon marketplace app. The wide selection of cheap deals has helped Temu win over a large portion of the market, especially during a period when the majority of consumers were having to cope with rising prices on the back of decades-high inflation. Temu’s strategic business model allows them to partner directly with manufacturers and warehouses in China while selling directly to customers. By cutting out the middlemen across the supply chain, Temu can sell products at steep discounts, and still offer customers free or partially free shipping, depending on their order or location. Many shoppers may be wondering whether it’s safe to shop on Temu, and while there are plenty of people who have ordered and purchased products from their website, the answer is not necessarily a straightforward one. Before you begin browsing, here are a few things that you should know about shopping in Temu: One of the most important things to take into consideration is that Temu is not accredited by the Better Business Bureau (BBB). According to the Better Business Bureau, the online marketplace is currently registered in Massachusetts as a Foreign Corporation through Delaware, although there are several discrepancies for the company not fulfilling the accreditation requirements. For one, the BBB has received thousands of customer complaints during the last several years, which can affect a company’s accreditation. In addition, the BBB does outline that transparent business practices and the number of years a business has been in operation are taken into account when scoring any new business. BBB accreditation helps businesses establish credibility and reliability with customers and state or federal regulators. Not having this status doesn't mean that a company should be barred from operating, instead, consumers are advised to practice increased caution when engaging with non-accredited enterprises. Temu, and more importantly its subsidiary, PDD Holdings have been at the center of multiple allegations that both companies have direct links to the Chinese government, including the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The platform’s involvement in data collection has been linked to People’s Data, an intelligence agency working with the CCP and Chinese authorities. There have been reports that People’s Data helps to manipulate state-run media and data, which harvests data from online sources. Although it’s unclear whether Temu and PDD Holdings are directly involved in the efforts of People’s Data, there are many that have raised concerns about the connections these companies have with Chinese authorities, including the CCP’s propaganda efforts. Legislators have had difficulty closing the current loopholes that exist with U.S. customs regulations, which allow for the import of goods valued below $800 to enter the United States without having to pay customs duty fees or endure multiple rounds of inspections. Temu has managed to use this loophole as a way to sidestep regulatory compliance, which allows them to import countless goods into the country, avoiding any customs duties and minimal scrutiny. According to the Center For Strategic And International Studies (CSIC), Temu has used this loophole in the system to avoid paying import duties, but more than this, created a highly competitive ecosystem that makes it possible for other enterprises to compete at the same level. There are also concerns regarding the importation of counterfeit or illicit goods entering the U.S. market, and the lack of scrutiny that Temu has enjoyed over the last several years. Temu, along with fast-fashion retailer, Shein has provided limited transparency regarding their compliance with the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), which requires the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHA) to investigate and minimize the entry of goods that have been manufactured using Uyghur slave labor. Both the UFLPA and DHA help provide more transparency for consumers and in turn bars any manufacturers, exporters, and organizations that are not compliant to conduct business on the U.S. market. However, in more recent months, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has called upon DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to take further action against Temu and Shein for their lack of transparency regarding compliance with UFLPA requirements, and the high probability of these companies exploiting loopholes to facilitate the importation of products that have been manufactured with Uyghur forced labor. Something that has been a recurring issue with many Temu customers is the inconsistent quality of some of their products. As with any major online marketplace, Temu relies on third-party suppliers and allows various vendors to sell through their platform. However, in the past, customers have complained about the quality of their orders, which often leaves a lot of speculation around Temu’s business model and practices. Additionally, there are countless incidents of customers receiving an order that’s nothing like what was advertised, or having received goods that are in a bad condition. It’s worth mentioning that Temu offers a generous 90-day return policy, which is nearly double that of Amazon’s 30-day return policy. However, this safety net does not make up for the gamble that many customers often take when ordering from Temu. Product quality can be inconsistent, and although shoppers might stumble across an incredible deal, having to log a return with Temu customer services can sometimes outweigh the cheaper price customers have to pay for items that can be purchased from local sellers. Temu’s ability to partner directly with Chinese manufacturers and ship from local warehouses allows them to undercut prices, and provide customers with more favorable options to choose from. Not only this, but the platform offers free standard shipping, which varies depending on the order, and free express shipping for orders over $129. These factors have made Temu widely popular among countless consumers looking for a more affordable alternative to local options. This, however, has raised some concerns among business owners, with some claiming that Temu’s dominance could directly threaten and outprice small American businesses. A report has found that Temu now dominates nearly 17% of the U.S. market share, and has gone on to challenge even the biggest low-income retailers such as Dollar Tree and Dollar General, both of which operate 28% and 43% of the market share, respectively. Temu’s ability to directly undercut American retailers has already seen some announcing layoffs or store closures to deal with the shifting consumer landscape. Perhaps it’s our shared consumer experience to look for flaws in a business model that’s not quite what we are used to. This is perhaps even more important in an increasingly polarized political environment where foreign policy between the U.S. and China has undergone tremendous scrutiny. To put things bluntly, the catch with Temu is that you get what you pay for. Paying a highly discounted price for clothes, toys or houseware does come with the uncertainty of whether a product will live up to your expectations and survive years of use. However, it’s not fair to shear all the sheep with the same comb, and some products on Temu are genuinely good quality. In fact, the platform indicates when an item is genuine and helps to provide some transparency to customers regarding the quality of each product sold on the website. Delivery periods may also vary depending on the order and the location you are shipping to. On average, standard shipping can take anywhere from 6 to 20 days, while express shipping can take between 4 and 9 days. However, some customers have reported not receiving their orders within the provided shipping time. Others have shared of never receiving their package, although this could also be due to external factors such as weather conditions, product availability, shipping carriers, shipping method, and order processing time. Something else to think about is that some of Temu’s products are often replicas of existing items. For instance, a pair of sunglasses or slides might be selling for a lot cheaper on Temu compared to Amazon, however, these may be replicas of an original product that’s offered elsewhere. Temu has also been accused of selling counterfeit products, including items that are near-exact replicas of products designed and sold by other vendors. In a Times Magazine article, stories of entrepreneurs having to find out their hand-made designs are being copied and sold on Temu, at a much cheaper price have further raised concerns about the level of product authenticity. Following safety protocols while shopping online is an important practice that every person should apply when browsing through a digital marketplace. Regardless of what your opinion of Temu is, taking steps to protect yourself will limit your information from ending up in the wrong hands. As with any other type of online activity, ensure that your browser is secured. The best way to secure your browsing experience is to adjust your device browser settings such as blocking pop-ups or removing any saved passwords from your browser. Depending on which device you are shopping from, try and use “Incognito Mode” to prevent websites from tracking your activity. Part of keeping your browser secure is to install antivirus software which helps minimize the threat of potential malware attacks. Antivirus software helps to keep devices safe by authenticating websites and links. Additionally, this software can help prevent possible threats or any type of malicious activity that may be taking place without you noticing. As a precaution, shop using your browser instead of an app. While using an app may be more convenient, you can limit the amount of personal information that you need to provide. Not only this, but apps save personal information, and until a few years ago, device makers were able to track your activity while using specific mobile applications. Try and opt out of in-app tracking wherever possible, and keep any information that you need to provide to a minimum. A VPN or Virtual Private Network helps to secure your connections by using network encryptions, instead of ordinary public domains. VPNs work similarly to other software protection security software and can be purchased online and automatically installed on your device. For added security and anonymity, try and use a VPN as much as possible, especially when shopping around websites where you need to provide plenty of personal information to complete transactions. You should always check with the platform through which you are shopping that they provide secure payment options. Most e-commerce sites will offer a variety of payment options, however, the best option is to limit any direct exposure to your personal banking details. In this case, try to make use of a gift card or digital wallet such as PayPal, Venmo, or Apple Pay. Do not provide account or card details on websites where there are limited security verifications for transactions, and try and seek alternative payment methods as much as possible. Many of us may have subscription accounts for online services. While this may make the shopping experience more convenient, there are certain drawbacks to keeping around subscriptions that are not being fully utilized. Aside from having to pay for these subscriptions, you are leaving a lot of personal information available on the table, allowing anyone to access your account at any time. Around 2 out of 5 users experience subscription fatigue, with 37 percent saying they’re struggling to manage all their subscription accounts. Having the same or similar password for various accounts is a recipe for disaster. Not only this but not regularly updating your passwords can create even more dangers for individuals who do not practice online safety. Research suggests that at least 3 in 4 people are facing the risk of being hacked due to poor password management. Update your passwords regularly, avoid using easy-to-guess passwords, and don’t make your password the same across multiple accounts. The best way to uncover whether a product on Temu is worth the price and waiting time is to read through customer reviews. When reading the reviews, make sure that you discern from comments that may have been published by fake accounts to help boost product popularity. There are plenty of businesses out there that will use fake reviews to help improve their product authority. Be sure that what you’re reading is the truth and has been published by human customers. Aside from checking customer reviews, you can read more about the seller as well. This will help give you a better idea of what the seller is like, the type of products and services they provide, and whether they have a trusted relationship with their customers. Again, there are plenty of sellers who may be using fake accounts to help boost their reputation, and it’s advised to do your research to help establish their credibility. While shopping online during the holiday season, familiarize yourself with the various shipping and return policies of platforms. In the case of Temu, customers will have 90 days to return items should a product not have lived up to their satisfaction. Shipping is also something to keep in mind, seeing as Temu ships from Chinese-based warehouses. Various factors can influence when an order arrives and the condition in which it arrives at your door. Yes, Temu is a legit online marketplace that sells affordable products, shipped from Chinese manufacturers and warehouses. As with any international business operating in the United States, there are plenty of challenges the company is currently facing, and shoppers are advised to use Temu at their own discretion. Regardless of your opinion, Temu is providing a service that many American shoppers find incredibly valuable, especially during a period where many consumers have been struggling to keep up with the rising cost of living. You get what you pay for when shopping on Temu, and depending on what you are looking to buy from the platform, you should always do your homework before the time to ensure that you get the best value for your money, but also to ensure that your personal information remains safe and is not used in a malicious way.

Title: Cowardly Billionaires Are Obeying Trump in Advance

Rule No. 1 of fighting fascism — do not obey in advance — crumbles as major newspapers kill endorsements to appease Trump. Do not obey in advance. Most of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like these, individuals think ahead about what a repressive government will want, and then offer themselves without being asked. A citizen who adapts in this way is teaching power what it can do. — Yale historian Timothy Snyder, On Tyranny Once upon a time, in a world that feels so very far away, stories of courage by the reporters, editors, and publisher at the Washington Post inspired a generation of young people to believe that journalism was a way — and maybe the best way — to change the world for good. The pivotal scene in 1976’s All the President’s Men — which burnished both the facts and some legend about the Post, star reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, and their role in the Watergate scandal that took down Richard Nixon — takes place in the dead of night on the pitch-black lawn of top editor Ben Bradlee. The two journalists, fearful they are being bugged, relay their source Deep Throat’s warning that “people’s lives are in danger, maybe even ours.” In a famous monologue, Bradlee (played by Jason Robards, who won an Oscar) tells Woodward and Bernstein to keep reporting the story, that “nothing’s riding on this except the First Amendment to the Constitution, freedom of the press, and maybe the future of the country,” adding his trademarked newsroom cynicism, “not that any of that matters.” Yet, perhaps an even more revealing scene occurs earlier when Nixon’s campaign manager, John Mitchell — called by the reporters for his comment on a damning article — instead issues a warning to the Post’s trailblazing publisher, saying, “Katie Graham’s going to get her [crude word for breast] caught in a big fat wringer if that’s published.” Katharine Graham’s Post had a lot at stake — federal regulators could strip her company’s lucrative TV licenses — yet both the story and the quote, minus the T-word, were published, and the Post won a Pulitzer Prize for its relentless pursuit of Watergate. These are the stories journalists tell ourselves in order to live — so much so that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos felt compelled when he bought the Post from Graham’s heirs in 2013 to invoke them to reassure a wary newsroom that he would never diminish the Post’s reputation for courageous journalism. The $200 billion man wrote in a letter to staffers: “While I hope no one ever threatens to put one of my body parts through a wringer, if they do, thanks to Mrs. Graham’s example, I’ll be ready.” Bezos was lying. On Friday, the world’s third-richest person, his scandal-scarred British publisher Will Lewis, and the iconic newspaper they control stunned both the American body politic and the media world by spiking their editorial board’s endorsement of Kamala Harris for president. The move came just days ahead of an election defined by her rival Donald Trump’s increasing threats to impose a tyrannical form of government with mass deportation camps and arrests for his growing enemies list, including journalists. Lewis’ utterly incoherent defense of the decision — ending a tradition of presidential endorsements the Post launched in 1976, the same year All the President’s Men was released — did nothing to quell the rampant, informed speculation that his boss Bezos has killed the already drafted editorial out of fear a revenge-minded Trump 47 could terminate the billionaire’s extensive business dealings with the federal government. It seemed all too fitting that Trump was in Austin, Texas, meeting executives of Bezos’ space venture, Blue Origin, at the same time as the endorsement kibosh. If this looks like the latest saga of open corruption in a nation that’s become a billionaire kleptocracy, it is — but this moment is also so much more than that. America is witnessing the raw power of dictatorship some nine days before voters even decide if that will truly be our future path. The cowardly Bezos can spend billions to erect a man-made projectile that sends him into space, but he’ll never have the cojones of a Katharine Graham. He is obeying fascism in advance, and he is not alone. Three thousand miles west, Bezos’ fellow billionaire, Patrick Soon-Shiong — owner of the Los Angeles Times since 2018 — pulled essentially the same maneuver in killing his editorial board’s endorsement of Harris that had been in the works for weeks, and which followed months of editorials warning of the authoritarian dangers of a Trump presidency. Observers noted that Soon-Shiong is a longtime close friend to — you guessed it — another billionaire, Elon Musk, who is the world’s richest man and has thrown all his time and considerable dollars into getting Trump elected. (Soon-Shiong’s daughter insists the reason was both candidates’ failure to address the carnage in Gaza.) While the moral center of the journalistic universe seemed to be collapsing, Trump told a rally in Tempe, Ariz., that the media is “the enemy of the people, they are. I’ve been asked not to say it, I don’t want to say it. They’re the enemy of the people.” The Republican’s replay of this ominous language echoing dictators of the 1930s was quickly followed by a new threat to create licensing woes for CBS because Trump didn’t like its editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Harris, and a lengthy post on Truth Social threatening to prosecute his enemies. » READ MORE: Journalism fails miserably at explaining what is really happening to America | Will Bunch The message here is clear. The cowardice of the news organizations controlled by Bezos and Soon-Shiong has already taught Trump — in the words of Yale’s Snyder, a leading U.S. expert on fascism — what power can do, and if he prevails in next week’s election, he plans to bring that hammer down in full force. What happened at the Post and the Times was a stunning betrayal of journalism’s moral values, but in a strange way, the papers did perform a public service: showing American voters what life under a dictator would feel like. The endorsement cancellations came with a heaping side order of nuance. One irony, as some observers pointed out, is that the expected endorsements of Harris from both editorial boards would have been a tiny blip on the political radar, compared to the earthquake of the owners’ interference. What’s more, there’s an intellectual argument — I once made it myself in a long-vanished blog post — that newspapers shouldn’t endorse candidates. If the Post or the Times had announced such a decision a year ago — and not under the heat of the election’s final days, under pressure from self-interested billionaires — there’d be little controversy. But these reversals, coming now and coming from the poisoned heart of American oligarchy, have instead confirmed the worst fears among an anxiety-wracked electorate that the core institutions that once saved U.S. democracy under the life-and-death pressures of Watergate — the U.S. Supreme Court, Congress, and an aggressive media — have morally imploded into empty shells. Even worse, readers’ sudden sense of betrayal seems to have greatly accelerated the already steep decline of public trust in American journalism, with reports that both the Post and the Times have been bombarded with thousands of canceled subscriptions. Some have switched to news organizations like The Inquirer, which published a long and compelling endorsement of Harris at almost the exact moment the Post’s capitulation went public. But many readers will be lost for good. This will create even more layoffs, which will lead to even less accountability journalism in a crumbling democracy, which will create even more cynicism — the tainted gasoline that fuels autocracy. It’s also critical to note that this fish stinks mainly from the head. The vast majority of working journalists — most of whom weren’t born yet when Woodward and Bernstein stood on Bradlee’s lawn — are just as outraged as their readers frantically hitting the “cancel my subscription” button. Scores of reporters, columnists, and others in the two newsrooms have bravely condemned their bosses’ decisions in online posts and in open letters. The editorial page editor of the Times, Mariel Garza, resigned in protest — despite the horrendous journalism job market— and at least two other colleagues have joined her. “I am resigning because I want to make it clear that I am not OK with us being silent,” Garza told Columbia Journalism Review. “In dangerous times, honest people need to stand up. This is how I’m standing up.” With the election little more than a week away, I hope that the brave actions of Garza and the words of those who are speaking out — a growing list that includes Woodward and Bernstein themselves — will be the ultimate takeaway and not the craven corruption of a little man like Bezos. This early sneak preview of what dictatorship actually looks like is also providing the most important lesson we could have right now, which is how to not obey in advance, but stand up against strongmen and bullies. How all of us respond over the coming days and weeks will decide the fate of the First Amendment to the Constitution, freedom of the press, and maybe the future of the country. And if any of that matters. » READ MORE: SIGN UP: The Will Bunch Newsletter Editor’s note: An earlier version of this column gave an incorrect name for Jeff Bezos’ space venture, Blue Origin.

Title: One chart shows how AI will drive another decade of US stock market dominance

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US companies already dominate the global stock market when it comes to size. A new chart from JPMorgan Asset Management shows that's largely expected to continue. The firm attributes the boom to artificial intelligence. In JPM's 2025 Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions released on Monday, the team projected that US companies' market cap share of the total global equity market will fall from 64% currently to 60% in 2037. Still, as seen in the chart below, the US (in green) would maintain a large lead over the estimated second-largest share of the global equity market, China (in red). JPMorgan Asset Management's global head of multi-asset and portfolio solutions Monica Issar told Yahoo Finance during a media roundtable on Monday that the US will continue to lead by market cap share as artificial intelligence benefits expand beyond a few large tech names that have dominated the market rally over the past year to companies in various industries. Issar gave two reasons for the prediction: revenue production and margin improvement. The first will come from the money pouring into AI benefiting companies outside of Big Tech. This plays out as tech companies buy AI chips from the likes of Nvidia (NVDA), and, as they need more power, these AI operators are forced to spend with companies in the Utilities (XLU) and Energy (XLE) sectors. As AI makes companies more efficient and eliminates the most simple work, eventually cutting down costs, US corporates should get a boost to profit margins. "It's going to be the US predominantly, and then obviously Europe will follow, because you're starting to see some adoption there," Issar said. To put the current US dominance in perspective, just Nvidia's (NVDA) market cap alone is larger than most other G7 countries, Apollo chief global economist Torsten Sløk wrote in a research note on Thursday. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.) To be sure, Sløk noted that this could be a risk to the market overall. "Global equity markets, including retirement allocations to equities, are basically leveraged to Nvidia," Sløk wrote. "Let’s hope the value of Nvidia doesn’t decline significantly." Others have a more sanguine view of the AI superpower's dominance, though. In a recent research note detailing why the S&P 500 (^GSPC) could average more than 10% annual returns over the next decade, DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas pointed to the US being at the forefront of AI adoption and well positioned to dominate amid the technology's "global adoption." Colas wrote the odds that a non-US tech company will rise over the next decade and unseat the large tech companies currently driving the US market share like Apple (AAPL), Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and Meta (META) are "almost zero." "The US continues to dominate global venture capital," Colas wrote. "If a new US business does eventually threaten their preeminence, then it will certainly go public, be in the S&P 500, and drive future returns." Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Title: Magnificent 7 shake-up: Why Wall Street is reassessing Tesla's position and looking toward Netflix

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Tesla (TSLA) has work to do if it wants to remain among tech elites. Despite a surprising third quarter earnings report that sent the EV maker's stock surging — resulting in its biggest intraday jump in over a decade — Wall Street is once again reevaluating its inclusion in the Magnificent Seven. The group’s members — Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla — dominated markets in 2023 and have returned as a potential key driver as third quarter earnings season gets underway. The group is expected to lead with 18.1% year-over-year earnings growth in Q3, and four of the stocks — Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta — are projected to be in the top 10 contributors to S&P 500 earnings growth, according to FactSet. The debate over Tesla has returned as concerns linger despite its earnings resurgence. Tesla's third quarter profits jumped 17%, a dramatic turnaround after two quarters of declines. That’s not enough for Wall Street: Strategists tell me it's still at risk of falling behind the rest of Big Tech due to overhyped fundamentals. Freedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods likened Tesla to bitcoin, suggesting the stock trades more on “hopes and dreams” than fundamentals. “Tesla had its moment in the sun … to me, it's more like a Cisco (CSCO) or an Intel (INTC) during the dot-com bubble, and now we're moving on to other things,” Woods warned on Yahoo Finance’s Morning Brief. While CEO Elon Musk has often categorized Tesla as a tech company, the firm’s AI and robotics bets will likely take years to pay off. In the meantime, Tesla must rely on improving its core auto business — a stark contrast to its Magnificent Seven peers. “I've been in the tech sector since 1990, and I remember the Four Horsemen … We didn't add an auto stock with Cisco, Intel, Dell (DELL), and Microsoft,” longtime tech investor Dan Morgan told me. Tesla’s recent underperformance and high valuation further strain its standing among its Mag Seven peers. At nearly 73 times forward earnings per Yahoo Finance data, its forward price-to-earnings multiple far exceeds others in the group. As of Friday afternoon, just over 40% of analysts covering Tesla rated the stock a Buy, according to Bloomberg data, making Tesla the least favored Magnificent Seven stock among analysts. As far as Tesla’s replacement, Netflix has emerged as a strong contender. Wealth Enhancement Group’s Ayako Yoshioka noted to me that Netflix “makes the most sense,” as shares of the original FAANG member recently hit an all-time high, buoyed by strong earnings and solid guidance. Since the start of the year, the stock has surged 55%, behind only Nvidia and Meta in the Magnificent Seven. Portfolio Wealth Advisors’ Jesus Alvarado-Martinez told me being a member of the Mag Seven is all about being a “cash flow machine," and Netflix “fits the bill.” “Netflix’s free cash flow has been relentless … Magnificent earnings, magnificent free cash flow, and magnificent subscribers numbers,” Alvarado added. The streamer's free cash flow has steadily climbed since the pandemic, growing to $2.19 billion in the third quarter, up from $1.89 billion a year earlier. For 2023, its free cash flow totaled $6.93 billion, compared to $1.62 billion in 2022. Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich sees Netflix’s growing free cash flow as a “catalyst” for the stock and estimates free cash flow to rise to $8.9 billion in 2025 and $11.16 billion in 2026. As of Friday, analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Netflix. 87% of analysts covering the stock rate it a Buy, while only 3% recommend selling the stock. While Tesla’s fate in the Magnificent Seven remains uncertain, Netflix’s recent surge reminds investors why it was once a favorite, further bolstering the case that now might be the right time to consider a switch-up in the dominant group.

While CEO Elon Musk has often categorized Tesla as a tech company, the firm’s AI and robotics bets will likely take years to pay off. In the meantime, Tesla must rely on improving its core auto business — a stark contrast to its Magnificent Seven peers. “I've been in the tech sector since 1990, and I remember the Four Horsemen … We didn't add an auto stock with Cisco, Intel, Dell (DELL), and Microsoft,” longtime tech investor Dan Morgan told me. Tesla’s recent underperformance and high valuation further strain its standing among its Mag Seven peers. At nearly 73 times forward earnings per Yahoo Finance data, its forward price-to-earnings multiple far exceeds others in the group. As of Friday afternoon, just over 40% of analysts covering Tesla rated the stock a Buy, according to Bloomberg data, making Tesla the least favored Magnificent Seven stock among analysts. As far as Tesla’s replacement, Netflix has emerged as a strong contender. Wealth Enhancement Group’s Ayako Yoshioka noted to me that Netflix “makes the most sense,” as shares of the original FAANG member recently hit an all-time high, buoyed by strong earnings and solid guidance. Since the start of the year, the stock has surged 55%, behind only Nvidia and Meta in the Magnificent Seven. Portfolio Wealth Advisors’ Jesus Alvarado-Martinez told me being a member of the Mag Seven is all about being a “cash flow machine," and Netflix “fits the bill.” “Netflix’s free cash flow has been relentless … Magnificent earnings, magnificent free cash flow, and magnificent subscribers numbers,” Alvarado added. The streamer's free cash flow has steadily climbed since the pandemic, growing to $2.19 billion in the third quarter, up from $1.89 billion a year earlier. For 2023, its free cash flow totaled $6.93 billion, compared to $1.62 billion in 2022. Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich sees Netflix’s growing free cash flow as a “catalyst” for the stock and estimates free cash flow to rise to $8.9 billion in 2025 and $11.16 billion in 2026. As of Friday, analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Netflix. 87% of analysts covering the stock rate it a Buy, while only 3% recommend selling the stock. While Tesla’s fate in the Magnificent Seven remains uncertain, Netflix’s recent surge reminds investors why it was once a favorite, further bolstering the case that now might be the right time to consider a switch-up in the dominant group.

Title: Stocks rally faces gauntlet of tech earnings, jobs data, election
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/stocks-rally-faces-gauntlet-of-tech-earnings-jobs-data-election-3684717
Time Published: 2024-10-27T13:00:35Z

By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK (Reuters) -The rally in U.S. stocks is wobbling as it confronts a stretch of potentially market-shaking events, starting next week with corporate results from tech titans and the closely watched employment report, while the U.S. election is also nearing. The benchmark S&P 500 is up about 22% on the year, but has edged back from record-high levels in recent days. Still, equities remain at elevated valuations, which could make stocks vulnerable should any of the near-term market events fall short of expectations. The S&P 500's price-to-earnings ratio, based on earnings estimates for the next 12 months, is at 21.8, near its highest level in over three years, according to LSEG Datastream. "People will be on pins and needles for most of next week," said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel Corp. "The market is expensive ... Any time you have an elevated market the potential for a bigger downdraft exists if something disappointing happens." Five of the "Magnificent Seven" group of megacap companies that have played a major role in driving the market over the past couple of years are set to report quarterly results next week: Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Because of their massive market values, those companies jointly account for 23% of the weight of the S&P 500, meaning market reaction to their results could sway broader indexes in coming days. The Magnificent Seven stocks trade an average forward P/E ratio of 35 times, as the companies overall have posted much stronger profit growth than the rest of the S&P 500. But that gap is expected to close in coming quarters. "I see a handful of companies that deservedly have very high multiples but if that reason for being deserved falters then there's a lot of room below for those stocks to fall," said Bryant VanCronkhite, senior portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments. Investors will be looking across these megacap companies to see if their increased spending on artificial intelligence capabilities is starting to show benefits. AI "hyperscalers" -- Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta -- are set to increase capital expenditures by 40% this year, while such capex spending for the rest of S&P 500 companies are on pace to fall 1% in 2024, according to BofA Global Research. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), the first of the Magnificent Seven to report results, saw its shares surge on Thursday after CEO Elon Musk said he expects vehicle sales to grow 20% to 30% next year. Next week is the busiest week of the third-quarter reporting season overall, with well over 150 S&P 500 companies set to post results. The U.S. jobs report on Nov. 1 comes as investors are weighing whether a stronger-than-expected economy could lead to fewer interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve than initially anticipated. Economists expect the employment report to show that the economy created 140,000 jobs in October, according to Reuters data. The report could be "messy" in the wake of two significant storms, but the wages data will be important to watch, said Nanette Abuhoff Jacobson, global investment strategist at Hartford Funds. "If we saw an uptick in wages, that would be concerning," Jacobson said. "The bond market is already getting a whiff of possibly stronger growth than expected, possibly inflation rearing its ugly head again, and the possibility of the Fed not being able to ease as much as what's priced in." Benchmark Treasury yields climbed to three-month highs this week, reflecting expectations of a potentially less dovish Fed as well as possibly increased spending under the next president. Bets on Donald Trump prevailing have risen on prediction markets in recent weeks, with the Republican seen as backing policies including tariffs that could lead to higher inflation. The run of market-sensitive events continues the following week, with Election Day on Nov. 5 and the Fed's next monetary policy decision on Nov. 7, which could put investors increasingly on edge in the coming days. The Cboe Volatility Index, an options-based indicator of demand for protection from market swings, was last around 19, after edging below 15 late last month. "Investors should expect market volatility in the lead-up to the U.S. presidential election," analysts at UBS Global Wealth Management said in a note on Thursday. As Nov. 5 "inches closer, market sentiment is likely to stay vulnerable." text_section_type="notes">Wall St Week Ahead runs every Friday. For the daily stock market report, please click [.N]

Title: From Nvidia to nuclear power to extra spicy hot sauce

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings The earnings avalanche has commenced. And what does that mean? You've probably missed a lot of other stories that could impact your portfolio. After all, there's more to one's investing life than modeling out 2050 profits for Nvidia (NVDA) and wondering whether Tesla (TSLA) will haul in $10 billion in sales from humanoid robots. In the spirit of this, here are a couple of convos I had this week that may leave you thinking (hopefully). AI meets extra spicy hot sauce: I was at a CEO dinner this week where an analyst specializing in AI proceeded to share the deep impact to businesses as AI proliferates. I tend to agree the way business is done will change profoundly, and it'll include a good bit of job loss. An example of AI's impact is in Cholula hot sauce. Its parent, spice maker McCormick (MKC), held an investor day this week. "We have used generative AI to really understand where all the commentary was going [for hot sauce], we learned there were some Cholula lovers out there that wanted a hotter version. So in January, we are launching an extra-hot version of Cholula," McCormick CEO Brendan Foley told me on Yahoo Finance's Market Domination Overtime. McCormick reiterated its long-term sales growth guidance of 4% to 6% and earnings growth of 9% to 11%. Shares are up 16% year to date compared to the 22% gain for the S&P 500. You can catch that full spicy segment here. Building a 21st-century media company: The traditional media industry continues to be disrupted by everything from new streaming networks to creators posting on YouTube. Why else do you think Disney (DIS) said this week its CEO Bob Iger was sticking around until 2026 (he was rumored to be leaving in 2025)? He has to leave the business in a much better place than his last exit. One of these disrupters in the past 15 years has been Dude Perfect. The company was started by five friends who went to Texas A&M and rose to fame for viral trick-shot videos posted on YouTube. The company now boasts 60.5 million subscribers and churns out a steady, broader array of content. Armed with a new $100 million capital infusion from Highmount Capital, Dude Perfect is gearing up for more unique programming and the build-out of a headquarters in Frisco, Texas. In charge of bringing that vision to life? Dude Perfect's first-ever CEO Andrew Yaffe, who took the job several weeks ago. "I think people underestimate how big YouTube is," Yaffe told me of the Google-owned (GOOG) platform on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in here). "YouTube is the biggest media platform in the US in terms of consumption. Bigger than Netflix (NFLX). And that's growing quickly. It's also the biggest outside the US. It's massive — it is how people under the age of 34 consume content." Not massive: Google's stock price year to date. Shares have lagged the S&P 500's 23% gain, rising only 16%. Big Blue is a big AI player: So much gets lost on a company's earnings day as traders zoom in on the numbers and a couple of trends on the earnings call. Ultimately this is why I think companies should be reporting twice a year, but that's a discussion for a different day. One number that got lost in IBM's earnings release Wednesday (which led to a shellacking in the stock price as consulting sales missed estimates): $3 billion of AI-related project backing. IBM's veteran CFO Jim Kavanaugh tells me the company is tracking toward adding $1 billion in AI project backlog a quarter. That's huge and aligns with what Kavanaugh thinks is a long runway for AI infrastructure buildout. "In my personal opinion, I think it's going to be the longest [adoption] curve that we'll see also because it'll play in many different industries and many different clients," Kavanaugh said. That bullish sentiment was echoed in a convo I had on Opening Bid with BofA analyst Vivek Arya this week, where he went into how AI's buildout will require the use of nuclear power. More insight on that and how it will benefit market darling Nvidia here. Our Morning Brief anchor Seana Smith will be diving into IBM's AI future with chairman and CEO Arvind Krishna at our annual Invest conference on Nov. 12. Want to stop by and say hi and be in the room for some wealth-building chats? Register here! There is still a Marriott running Marriott: Meet David S. Marriott, 50, who assumed the chairman role at Marriott (MAR) from his legendary father J.W. "Bill" Marriott, Jr., 92, in 2022. David's father — who is chairman emeritus — served as chairman for 60 years and CEO for 40 years. Mind-blowing! Bill's parents, Alice Marriott and J. Willard Marriott, founded the company as an A&W root beer stand in 1927. Suffice it to say, the younger Marriott hardly does interviews (he travels a lot and has four children) — so it was a treat to spend time with him on Opening Bid. "I spent several summers doing internships in the kitchen, learning how to prep food, hot food, cold food, and learning how to cook on the line. And, I spent a summer as a bellman and spent some time making beds and working behind the front desk," Marriott told me of his on-the-job training.

Title: Will Magnificent 7 Earnings Be A Trick Or A Treat?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2024/10/27/will-magnificent-7-earnings-be-a-trick-or-a-treat/
Time Published: 2024-10-27T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
The third-quarter earnings season enters its busiest reporting week, including five of the ... [+] Magnificent 7 providing earnings results. Within the S&P 500, 111 companies reported earnings last week, and 75% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. The third-quarter earnings season enters its busiest reporting week, with 170 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. S&P 500 Earnings Season The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), feature heavily in the upcoming earnings week. Five of the seven companies report earnings this week: Alphabet on Tuesday, Meta and Microsoft on Wednesday, and Amazon and Apple on Thursday. Tesla reported much better-than-expected earnings last week, and NVIDIA won’t report until late November. Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the quarterly results will be crucial to stock performance this week. Magnificent 7: Q3 Estimated Earnings Growth Other scheduled companies include McDonald’s (MCD), Visa (V), Starbucks (SBUX), Merck (MRK), Mastercard (MA), Uber Technologies (UBER), Chevron (CVX), ExxonMobil (XOM), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B). The S&P 500 fell by 1% for the week. The Magnificent 7 gained 3.5%, primarily due to a 22% gain in Tesla, which had excellent earnings and a positive profit outlook. Stock Performance After a long trend in the opposite direction due to the better-than-expected monthly jobs report, the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks underperformed the less economically exposed defensives. Cyclicals Versus Defensives According to FactSet, the financials and consumer discretionary sectors were the most significant contributors to last week's earnings growth improvement. Within financials, Capital One Financial (COF), KKR & Co (KKR), Northern Trust (NTRS), and Raymond James Financial (RJF) were significant positive contributors. The increase in profits for industrials came primarily from General Motors (GM) and Tesla (TSLA). Relative to expectations at the end of the quarter, the energy, healthcare, and industrials sectors have been the most significant detractors of S&P 500 earnings growth. Earnings estimates for energy companies, including Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), were cut, sending the energy sector estimates to -27.3% year-over-year after expecting a -19.1% at the start of the earnings season. Boeing (BA) reported worse than the previously announced preliminary results, sending the industrials sector estimates to -11.0% year-over-year versus 1.3% growth at the start of the earnings season. Healthcare sector earnings, expected to be a bright spot this quarter, have fallen to an expected 5.8% growth rate compared to 11.2% year-over-year at the end of the quarter. The primary culprit was Eli Lilly (LLY), which saw earnings estimates revised lower after an announcement that acquisition-related charges for in-process research and development (IPR&D) would lower profits by approximately $2.83 billion or $3.08 per share. 3Q 2024 Earnings By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth has exceeded expectations, with the tailwind from solid year-over-year nominal GDP. 3Q 2024 Sales By Sector So far, the blended earnings performance has underperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +3.6% year-over-year, below the expectation of +4.4% at the end of the quarter, but an improvement over the previous week’s 3.4%. S&P 500 Earnings Estimate Summary Beyond earnings, this Friday marks the release of the October monthly jobs report. Last month's blowout September jobs report marked a positive change in sentiment about how quickly the economy might be slowing and removed much of the fear about any impending economic recession. The Atlanta Fed’s current estimate of third-quarter GDP growth is a robust 3.3%. While the better-than-expected growth has supported earnings estimates and thus stock prices, bond yields have risen sharply off the recent lows. Treasury Yields The additional rate cuts expected in 2024 are two successive 25 basis point (0.25%) cuts in November and December. While the probability, based on the pricing of Fed Fund futures, remains high, they fell from higher conviction levels as recent economic data has been robust. A weaker- or stronger-than-expected monthly jobs report this week could significantly impact the rate cut expectations. Expected Fed Rate Cuts The busiest week of earnings season has five Magnificent 7 companies reporting earnings. Given the superior expected earnings growth rates and the market capitalization, the Magnificent 7’s quarterly results and outlooks will be crucial for this earnings season and stock performance this week. The earnings outlook from management remains critical, with expectations high and the S&P 500 selling for a not inexpensive 23 times the forward twelve months earnings estimates. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently holds Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Chevron (CVX), Exxon Mobil (XOM), McDonald’s (MCD), Visa (V), Starbucks (SBUX), Merck (MRK), Mastercard (MA), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) within its recommended investment strategies.

Title: 3 Big Differences – Nvidia Is Poised To Take Over From Apple

Microchip and Nvidia logo displayed on a phone screen are seen in this multiple exposure ... [+] illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on April 10, 2023. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Nvidia finally poked its head briefly above the stock value of the dominant Apple empire this week, before settling back down to market value of $3.47 trillion with Apple’s value at $3.52 trillion. Reuters reporting shows how close this is, with a chart showing Nvidia’s rise against Apple and Microsoft, the other two dominant tech companies. “The Silicon Valley chipmaker is the dominant supplier of processors used in AI computing, and the company has become the biggest winner in a race between Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and other heavyweights, to dominate the emerging technology,” write Reuters reporters Sruthi Shankar and Noel Randewich. “Known since the 1990s as a designer of processors for videogames, Nvidia's stock has risen about 18% so far in October, with a string of gains coming after OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, announced a funding round of $6.6 billion.” Microsoft now rests slightly below the other two, with around $3.18 trillion in value. A look back shows that Nvidia also won out temporarily over the same competitors back in June of this year; prior to that, the firm’s stock price was under $100 per share, until it finally spiked early this year and continued to rise. Sticking at around $140 per share, this giant is now poised to earn its crown as the most valuable company in the world. What this represents for the market is a major change from one kind of technology to another. You could express this three different ways: You could say that Apple makes consumer-facing technology, while Nvidia makes ‘back end’ server/hardware technology. You could say that Apple makes endpoint technology, where Nvidia makes supply technology. Or you could say that Apple makes devices that you can use, where Nvidia makes hardware that allows AI to think. With items likes A100 GPU, Nvidia is a dominant producer of AI hardware. And everybody wants a piece of this, from Microsoft and Blackrock, to all kinds of other stakeholders who are getting in on the AI revolution. While Nvidia’s own chips are powerhouses in their own right, analysts show that many companies are investing in their own hardware in the form of custom chips known in the industry as application-specific integrated circuits or ASICs. Some of those closest to the phenomenon cite companies like Broadcom (AVGO) and others as competitor companies that may rise as their clients look for ASIC technology. However, Nvidia is also making its own play in the ASIC market, and will apparently open sores this technology. “There has been speculation that fixed function application-specific circuits (ASICs) might one day eclipse NVIDIA’s GPU-centric approach,” writes Karl Fruend at Moor Insights and Strategy. “Now NVIDIA itself seems to have embraced this approach, albeit in a limited fashion, announcing its own ASIC technology for Deep Learning acceleration. In a surprising and bold move, the company also announced that it will open source this technology to enable others to build chips using this technology.” Maybe that pivot will help them address one of the major threats to their dominance in the market. In any case, it’s a timely piece of news, because what it shows is that AI is ascendant. We’re watching this technology blossom right before our eyes, in real time, and after a few years of relative obscurity, Nvidia seems to have won out – at least for now. One Community. Many Voices.

A look back shows that Nvidia also won out temporarily over the same competitors back in June of this year; prior to that, the firm’s stock price was under $100 per share, until it finally spiked early this year and continued to rise. Sticking at around $140 per share, this giant is now poised to earn its crown as the most valuable company in the world. What this represents for the market is a major change from one kind of technology to another. You could express this three different ways: You could say that Apple makes consumer-facing technology, while Nvidia makes ‘back end’ server/hardware technology. You could say that Apple makes endpoint technology, where Nvidia makes supply technology. Or you could say that Apple makes devices that you can use, where Nvidia makes hardware that allows AI to think. With items likes A100 GPU, Nvidia is a dominant producer of AI hardware. And everybody wants a piece of this, from Microsoft and Blackrock, to all kinds of other stakeholders who are getting in on the AI revolution. While Nvidia’s own chips are powerhouses in their own right, analysts show that many companies are investing in their own hardware in the form of custom chips known in the industry as application-specific integrated circuits or ASICs. Some of those closest to the phenomenon cite companies like Broadcom (AVGO) and others as competitor companies that may rise as their clients look for ASIC technology. However, Nvidia is also making its own play in the ASIC market, and will apparently open sores this technology. “There has been speculation that fixed function application-specific circuits (ASICs) might one day eclipse NVIDIA’s GPU-centric approach,” writes Karl Fruend at Moor Insights and Strategy. “Now NVIDIA itself seems to have embraced this approach, albeit in a limited fashion, announcing its own ASIC technology for Deep Learning acceleration. In a surprising and bold move, the company also announced that it will open source this technology to enable others to build chips using this technology.” Maybe that pivot will help them address one of the major threats to their dominance in the market. In any case, it’s a timely piece of news, because what it shows is that AI is ascendant. We’re watching this technology blossom right before our eyes, in real time, and after a few years of relative obscurity, Nvidia seems to have won out – at least for now. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Tesla Cybertruck Becomes The Third Best-Selling EV In The US

Tesla’s Cybertruck continues to make headlines, as it becomes the third best-selling EV in the US beating all other non-Tesla models. Only the Model 3 and Model Y sold more units. This achievement is even more impressive considering how the Cybertruck was selling at it’s highest price point with the most expensive trim. It’s clear that major automakers like Ford and GM are struggling to compete in the EV market. Tech Crunch reports that Ford only sold around 7,000 F-150 Lightnings and 13,000 Mustang Mach-E SUVs last quarter, while GM sold a total of 32,000 electric vehicles. Rivian’s electric pickup sales were even lower, at around 3,800 units. Tesla’s financial results for the third quarter were impressive, with the company generating $25.2 billion in sales and notching a $2.2 billion profit. The Cybertruck’s positive gross margin and the sale of regulatory credits to other automakers certainly helped boost profits. Additionally, Tesla’s cost-cutting measures have reduced the cost of goods sold per vehicle to $35,100. Investors are taking notice, as Tesla’s stock price jumped over 9% in after-hours trading. However, not all aspects of the business are thriving. Tesla’s Supercharger growth has slowed to 20% year-over-year, likely due to the company-wide layoff earlier this year. Despite this, Tesla remains a dominant force in the EV market.

Delta Air Lines (DAL) is suing cybersecurity company CrowdStrike Inc. (CRWD) over a faulty software update in July that brought its operations to a halt and affected more than a million customers. In a lawsuit Friday, Delta said the software update that affected Microsoft (MSFT) Windows-based systems across the world was "catastrophic" for the company, leading to days of canceled or delayed flights. The airlines estimates that the debacle cost it $500 million, along with loss of future revenue and damaged reputation. The complaint alleges breach of contract, gross negligence and intentional misrepresentation or fraud by omission on CrowdStrike's part. Delta, which was among the most severely affected by the outage, took this legal action after months of finger-pointing among the three companies. Previously, both CrowdStrike and Microsoft had criticized Delta's handling of the situation, saying that the airline refused offers for help. “While we aimed to reach a business resolution that puts customers first, Delta has chosen a different path,” a CrowdStrike spokesperson told CNBC. “Delta’s claims are based on disproven misinformation, demonstrate a lack of understanding of how modern cybersecurity works, and reflect a desperate attempt to shift blame for its slow recovery away from its failure to modernize its antiquated IT infrastructure.” CORRECTION: This article has been updated with the correct spelling of CrowdStrike in several instances, and of Delta Air Lines.

Title: Chart of the Week: Taking a closer look at the Magnificent Seven

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings Tesla (TSLA) stole the show this week, notching its biggest day in over a decade on Thursday as investors applauded the company’s quarterly results with a flurry of buying. A 22% increase that day put the stock firmly back in the green for the year, up nearly 7% now after having lagged its “Magnificent Seven” counterparts — and at one point in April being down almost 43% since the new year began. That means that for the first time since September, all seven Magnificents are back in the green, as our Chart of the Week shows. And if there’s one chart that encompasses 2024’s story for the stock market, this continues to be a good candidate. The more you look at it, the more thoughts jump out. For example, amid the euphoria of the Tesla comeback story, its 2024 arc still skews tragic — significantly lagging its peers as a distant backmarker despite the week’s gains. Zooming out further, the differences among Big Tech stocks continue to be stark, keeping questions bubbling up about Tesla’s membership in this informal — but important — cohort amid potential replacement candidates, like former FAANG member Netflix (NFLX), up 63% so far this year. Perhaps the most important line on this chart is the benchmark — who’s above it and who’s not. As Nvidia's (NVDA) outsized returns have broken further away from the rest of Big Tech, only two others have even managed to outperform the S&P 500 this year as investors rotate into other sectors. Nvidia, of course, is responsible for a lot of that. When Nvidia moves, the S&P 500 usually moves too. But between Meta's (META) line and the S&P's 23% benchmark are around 150 companies — 30% of the index — that are pulling the index up as they benefit from the market’s broadening and rotation. Since the future trajectory of stocks, smoothed out, is likely to continue to go up and to the right, a narrative to watch for 2025 is exactly where the S&P 500 line will fall on this chart and which companies can outperform it. As DataTrek’s Nicolas Colas wrote this week, this is where the rubber meets the road for the economy and the Magnificent Seven. “If one believes that US GDP growth can be +3% in 2025, then the S&P 493 is likely the better bet,” Colas wrote. “Our own view is that growth will be more modest, giving the edge to Big Tech.” Ethan Wolff-Mann is a Senior Editor at Yahoo Finance, running newsletters.

Title: Will Microsoft Shareholders Vote ‘Yes’ On Bitcoin? What To Expect
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/microsoft-shareholders-vote-bitcoin-what-to-expect/
Time Published: 2024-10-26T01:00:47Z

In a recent SEC filing dated Thursday, October 24, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) revealed that an “Assessment of Investing in Bitcoin” will be a voting item at its forthcoming shareholder meeting on December 10. This development has ignited discussions within the investment community about the potential direction of Microsoft’s treasury strategy and the likelihood of shareholder approval. Microsoft’s board of directors has formally recommended voting against the Bitcoin investment proposal. In supplementary materials filed with the SEC on October 25, the board articulated that the requested assessment is redundant, emphasizing that Microsoft’s management already integrates considerations of cryptocurrencies into their broader investment strategy. The board highlights that “This proposal requests that the Board conduct an assessment that is unnecessary because Microsoft’s management already carefully considers this topic. Microsoft’s Global Treasury and Investment Services team evaluates a wide range of investable assets to fund Microsoft’s ongoing operations, including assets expected to provide diversification and inflation protection.” The filing further noted that past evaluations have included Bitcoin among other cryptocurrencies. “Past evaluations have included Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies among the options considered, and Microsoft continues to monitor trends and developments related to cryptocurrencies to inform future decision making,” the filing adds. The board asserted confidence in Microsoft’s existing processes to manage and diversify its corporate treasury for the long-term benefit of shareholders, deeming the public assessment unnecessary. “Microsoft has strong and appropriate processes in place to manage and diversify its corporate treasury for the long-term benefit of shareholders and this requested public assessment is unwarranted.” Microsoft’s shareholder base is a diverse mix of institutional investors, public companies, and individual investors. As of June 30, 2024, institutional investors held approximately 43.13% of Microsoft’s outstanding shares, while public companies and individual investors accounted for 56.84%. Insiders held a negligible 0.04% of the shares. The Vanguard Group stands as Microsoft’s largest shareholder, owning around 9.09% of the total shares outstanding. BlackRock follows with a 7.45% stake, making it the second-largest shareholder. State Street holds the third-largest position with a 4.04% ownership. Given this distribution, these major shareholders could be pivotal in determining the outcome of the proposal. Vanguard’s anti-BTC stance suggests a likely “no” vote, aligning with the board’s recommendation. Conversely, BlackRock has become a strong proponent of Bitcoin and offers its US clients a spot Bitcoin ETF since January this year. In their latest earning call, CEO Larry Fink said, “We believe Bitcoin is an asset class in itself.” He added, “It is an alternative to other commodities like gold.” State Street seems somewhat open-minded to Bitcoin. In mid-September, State Street launched in collaboration Galaxy 3 new crypto ETFs. In August, State Street partnered with Taurus to enhance its crypto services, facilitating the transformation of real-world assets into tradable digital assets. Nonetheless, industry analysts largely predict that the proposal to invest in Bitcoin will not gain sufficient support among Microsoft shareholders. Matthew Sigel, Head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck, summarized the situation on X: “Microsoft Shareholders to Vote on Proposal to Invest in Bitcoin. MSFT Board Advises ‘Nay’. No-Coiner Vanguard owns ~9%.” Similarly, Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store and Co-Founder of the ETF Institute, expressed his expectations: “Gonna go out on a limb & predict Microsoft’s largest shareholder (Vanguard) will be voting ‘no’ on adding btc to the balance sheet…” Di Lewis, CFO at BTC Inc., also expressed strong skepticism about Microsoft’s likelihood to adopt Bitcoin, stating there is “0% chance Microsoft adds bitcoin to their balance sheet this decade.” Adam Cochran, a partner at CEHV, dismissed the proposal as a “fringe” idea from a think tank shareholder. He stated, “No. This is a fringe proposal by a think tank shareholder, and is not a serious consideration by Microsoft at large.” At press time, BTC traded at $67,608.

Title: Walmart maintains the upper hand as it battles Target for Americans' wallets

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. In the battle for America's shoppers, Walmart (WMT) is still dominating Target (TGT). The world's biggest retailer continues to gain high-income shoppers in the face of sticky inflation while it expands its membership and advertising revenue. It's maintained its edge in value, offering grocery prices that are about 10% to 12% cheaper for an average basket of food, per Goldman Sachs analyst Kate McShane. "The Walmart thesis is they're really among the biggest and best retailers out there," Telsey Advisory Group's Joe Feldman told Yahoo Finance over the phone. The company is "well positioned when times are tough, they're well positioned when things are getting better." Walmart has done "a very good job going after a more affluent consumer and keep retaining their core customer" of lower- to middle-income consumers, Feldman added. Groceries make up 60% of US sales for Walmart but just 20% to 25% of Target's sales, per Morningstar analyst Noah Rohr. Go inside the fascinating leadership journey of Target CEO Brian Cornell Target has been trying to turn the tide, announcing a plan in May to cut prices on 5,000 goods, which Bank of America analyst Robert Ohmes said "brought a positive momentum to foot traffic for Target." This week, Target announced another price cut on 2,000 items ahead of the holiday. "We believe that additional pricing cuts could spur additional traffic as we enter the crucial Holiday shopping season. Overall, we view this announcement as positive for Target's top-line and comparable sales ahead," Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe wrote in a note to clients. Walmart isn't just competing with Target, but also supermarket chains, drug stores, and discount stores. In the latest quarter, its US same-store sales were up 4.3%, while Target's declined 2.0%. Investors have awarded the results. Walmart's stock is up 52% in 2024, compared to Target's 5% gain and the S&P 500's 23% gain. Walmart's edge in the food aisles continues to help counter soft sales in categories like toys, apparel, and electronics. "Discretionary has been down for the last 10 quarters," McShane said, with some signs of recovery at both retailers. In 2025, discretionary goods spending is expected to grow, which could be a boost for Target, said McShane. When it comes to branching into other high-margin businesses, like memberships, e-commerce, and retail advertising, Walmart also took a head start. The company launched its Amazon (AMZN) Prime competitor, Walmart+, in 2020 for $98 per year. Target only started its Target Circle 360 program this March for $99 a year. Both include same-day delivery, though Target has a $35 minimum. Walmart+ touts additional perks, like savings on Paramount+ subscriptions, 25% off Burger King digital orders, $0.10 off a gallon of gas at over 13,000 stations, pickup for returns at customers' homes, and even free tire repair. "What really happened with Target Circle is they didn't do a lot with Target Circle during the COVID years where they were over-performing everybody," Ohmes said. "They really had to get beyond COVID ... beyond the inventory issues they had in 2022, and that led to the clearance issues they had in 2023." Now Target is trying to invest more aggressively in its loyalty rewards and paid memberships. It's offering Circle members an extra 30 days for returns, plus same-day orders from dozens of retailers through the Shipt Marketplace. Last quarter, Walmart US saw its e-commerce sales jump 3%, boosted by store pickups and delivery. "Pickup is growing faster than our in-store or club sales, and delivery is growing even faster than pickup. Delivery accuracy and speed continue to improve," CEO Doug McMillon said on the earnings call. Target saw its digital sales jump 8.7% year over year. CEO Brian Cornell said its Drive Up and Target Circle 360 programs both grew sales in the low teens. He added that same-day services now make up two-thirds of its digital sales, with most customers opting for Drive Up, which brought in $2 billion in sales in Q2. Walmart Connect, the company's advertising business, has also been blooming. Its US revenue grew 30% year over year, with advertising sales by online marketplace sellers up nearly 50%. Target is trying to develop its own offering, Target Roundel. Cornell said it "continues to experience rapid growth based on the joint value it creates for both our guests and our vendors," with double-digit revenue growth. It's expected to grow in the "high teens" for the full fiscal year, after "more than 20% growth in 2023." Neither retailer has shared exact revenue figures for its ads business. For reference, Amazon's ad unit boasted a 20% revenue growth year over year last quarter, bringing $12.77 billion in Q2. Walmart's e-commerce marketplace is "getting very close to being profitable" at Walmart, said McShane. "There's more buy-in from the investor base [in] the alternative revenue streams that Walmart's been going after... that they are faster-growing and higher-margin businesses that should drive better profitability for the company longer term," McShane said. "Walmart's had a great year and they've been outperforming ... From a fundamental standpoint, all is going so well for them from a stock perspective. Plus, it doesn't look like we're done ... With the setup for this holiday season, everybody's searching for value. What better retailer gives value than Walmart?" Feldman said. — Brooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Title: FAIR: LA Times Non-Endorsement Another Sign of Our Billionaire-Dominated Politics

Time Published: 2024-10-25T22:22:52Z
Full Content:
FAIRNESS & ACCURACY IN REPORTING Challenging media bias since 1986. FAIR FAIR is the national progressive media watchdog group, challenging corporate media bias, spin and misinformation. The Los Angeles Times will not be making a presidential endorsement in this election, the first time the paper has stayed silent on a presidential race since 2004. But the decision not to endorse a candidate was not made by an editor. The paper’s billionaire owner, Patrick Soon-Shiong, stepped in to forbid the paper from doing so. The move sparked a furor over the lack of editorial freedom (Semafor, 10/22/24; KTLA, 10/22/24; Adweek, 10/23/24). The paper lost 2,000 subscribers, and editorials editor Mariel Garza resigned in protest, along with two other staffers, including a Pulitzer Prize winner (Guardian, 10/25/24). Guardian (9/23/16): “The lack of transparency around Soon-Shiong’s reasons for not allowing his paper to make a presidential endorsement has left journalists in the Los Angeles Times’ newsroom frustrated and confused.” The LA Times was widely expected to support the Democrat, Vice President Kamala Harris, a Southern California resident and former senator from the state. The paper’s editorial board enthusiastically supported Joe Biden in 2020 (9/10/20) and Hillary Clinton four years before that (9/23/16). According to news reports, the paper had been preparing an endorsement until Soon-Shiong reached across the wall that is supposed to separate the business and editorial wings of a newspaper. He tried to rationalize his decision, according to the Guardian: “I think my fear is, if we chose either one, that it would just add to the division,” Soon-Shiong told Spectrum News, noting he was a “registered independent.” On Wednesday, Soon-Shiong tweeted that he had asked the editorial board to instead publish a list of positive and negative attributes about both of the presidential candidates, but that the board had refused. Soon-Shiong said that the dangers of divisiveness in American politics was highlighted by the responses to his tweet about his decision not to endorse, saying the feed had “gone a little crazy when we just said, ‘You decide.’” And the LA Times is not alone. The Jeff Bezos–owned Washington Post will also issue no presidential endorsement, for the first time since 1980 (NPR, 10/25/24). Former editor-in-chief Martin Baron called the move “cowardice,” telling NPR: Donald Trump will celebrate this as an invitation to further intimidate the Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos (and other media owners). History will mark a disturbing chapter of spinelessness at an institution famed for courage. Stat (11/21/16): “Soon-Shiong called it an ‘incredible honor’ to dine with Trump, who ‘truly wants to advance health care for all.’” Soon-Shiong, who bought the LA Times from Tronc in 2018, attempted to portray himself as a defender of the free press against attacks from then-President Donald Trump (CNBC, 9/7/18). But Soon-Shiong—a doctor who made a fortune in the for-profit medical industry (New Yorker, 10/25/21)—was not shy about his ambitions for a top health position in the Trump administration (Stat, 11/21/16, 1/25/17). Is Soon-Shiong trying to make nice with Trump? One thing we know about him is that he’s not big on paying taxes; “He hasn’t paid federal income tax in five consecutive recent years,” ProPublica (12/8/21) reported. He’s also not overly concerned about ethical niceties; Stat (7/20/17) has raised questions about conflicts of interest in his medical business and how they might impact patients. A Politico investigation (4/9/17) of Soon-Shiong’s research foundation found widespread self-dealing: Of the nearly $59.6 million in foundation expenditures between its founding in 2010 and 2015, the most recent year for which records are available, over 70% have gone to Soon-Shiong–affiliated not-for-profits and for-profits, along with entities that do business with his for-profit firms. This isn’t the first time Soon-Shiong’s intervention at the paper has raised alarms about editorial freedom. The Daily Beast (10/22/24) reported that earlier this year “executive editor Kevin Merida resigned after Soon-Shiong tried to block a story that accused one of his friends’ dogs of biting a woman in a Los Angeles park.” Layoffs at the Times earlier this year also sparked outrage from trade unionists and journalists. “A delegation of 10 members of Congress warned Soon-Shiong in a letter that sweeping media layoffs could undermine democracy in a high-stakes election year,” reported Los Angeles Magazine (1/23/24). There was also a racial element, the Times union said in a statement (Editor and Publisher, 1/24/24): It also means the company has reneged on its promises to diversify its ranks since young journalists of color have been disproportionately affected. The Black, AAPI and Latino Caucuses have suffered devastating losses. Bezos is far better known than Soon-Shiong; while it’s not reported that he directly intervened to stop a Post endorsement, like at the LA Times, NPR noted that Bezos depends on harmonious interactions with the federal government, as the company he founded, Amazon, depends on government contracts. Conflict-of-interest questions have long surrounded his control of the paper (FAIR.org, 3/1/14, 3/14/18, 9/19/19; CJR, 9/27/22; Guardian, 6/12/24; CNN, 6/18/24). NPR (10/25/24): Elon Musk “has become one of the leading boosters of baseless claims that Democrats are bringing in immigrants to illegally vote for them — a conspiracy theory that Trump and other Republicans have made core to their narratives about the 2024 election.” It’s hard to ignore that in blocking endorsements expected to go to Trump’s opponent, billionaire owners are using their media power to help a fellow billionaire. With the Washington Post, readers can easily assume that Bezos cares more about not offending the powerful than its now-laughable slogan, “Democracy Dies in Darkness.” Bill Grueskin (X, 10/25/24), a professor at Columbia Journalism School, said that these endorsements are “unimportant politically” because “few votes would be swayed”—the Los Angeles area and the Beltway are solidly blue. But there’s an ominous factor here, he said, because “the billionaire owners are (intentionally or not) sending a signal to the newsrooms: Prepare to accommodate your coverage to a Trump regime.” Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, is likewise using his wealth and his ownership of the social media network Twitter (rebranded as X) to boost Trump (PBS, 10/21/24; NPR, 10/25/24). And Republican megadonor and billionaire Miriam Adelson “shelled out $95 million to the pro-Donald Trump Preserve America PAC during its third quarter,” Forbes (10/15/24) reported. Her late husband bought the Las Vegas Review-Journal in December of 2015 (AP, 12/17/15), and as the New York Times (1/2/16) reported: Suspicions about his motives for paying a lavish $140 million for the newspaper last month are based on his reputation in Las Vegas as a figure comfortable with using his money in support of his numerous business and political concerns, said more than a dozen of the current and former Review-Journal staffers and local civic figures who have worked closely with him. Big money has played an enormous part in US elections, especially since the Citizens United decision eviscerated limits on campaign spending (PBS, 2/1/23). “A handful of powerful megadonors have played an outsized role in shaping the 2024 presidential race through mammoth donations toward their favored candidates,” Axios (10/23/24) reported. These megadonors “skew Republican,” the Washington Post (10/16/24) reported. Much of the press in the United States has, correctly, portrayed a second Trump term as a threat to democracy and a move toward corrupt autocracy, eroding institutions like the free press and independent justice system (Atlantic, 8/2/23; New York Times, 9/21/24, 10/3/24, 10/22/24; MSNBC, 10/22/24; NPR, 10/22/24). Yet the intervention of Soon-Shiong and his fellow moguls is an indication that our media are already not in democratic hands. Far from it; they are in the hands of the billionaire class. And it is sure to have an impact on this election. FAIR’s work is sustained by our generous contributors, who allow us to remain independent. Donate today to be a part of this important mission.

Doug Latimer October 25, 2024 at 7:17 pm The right thing to do For the so very many wrong reasons QadK October 25, 2024 at 9:58 pm Aren’t you presuming to know the motives of the LA Times owner? I do agree with you that it was probably not a bad decision, but this whole critique seems to be an indictment based more on who the owner is than the merits of his decision. Both parties are deaf to the policies favored overwhelmingly by the public, and favoring one over the other seems to be foolish in that regard. Add to that the almost lockstep unity in the media in its dismissal of Trump as a legitimate representative of a large swath of the electorate, and an endorsement for Kamala Harris who has been a lackluster candidate would serve as confirmation of that. I don’t know enough about the LA Times owner to condemn him for it wanting to appear as biased as most of the mainstream media. Gary October 25, 2024 at 11:00 pm LA is is not important. The major media {TVs) outlets, including social media and MTVs are Jewish-controlled and are endorsing the live-streamed murderous Genocide in Palestine. Alissa Reed October 26, 2024 at 7:28 pm And here we have Gary, just another hate spewing antisemite going on record with the well worn Jewish controlled media conspiracy. Next please. QadK October 27, 2024 at 11:01 pm If I can infer from your response that you are a supporter of Israel, then I think you will agree that the support and bankrolling for the murders being committed by the Israeli state will do more to promote antisemitism all over the planet than any hate-filled individual. WalterZ October 26, 2024 at 9:01 am News outlets should not be in the business of endorsing candidates. As for Harris, she is part of an administration that has the power to stop the genocide in Gaza and to engage in de-escalation and diplomacy. Harris has indicated she will do neither of those things if elected. Why endorse such a person? TB October 26, 2024 at 10:01 am This is about taxes pure and simple. Harris has said she will make the ultra wealthy pay their fair share. Well, they don’t want to, so they go against everything they say they believe in because of their own greed. Anaisha Chopra October 26, 2024 at 12:42 pm Yea right. Is that why Mark Cuban, who is her top billionaire marquee supporter, has public stated ‘zero chance’ of asset based ‘fair’ taxes? Do you forget she was appointed by the powers that be in the Democrat party? Worse yet, she is an empty suit who stands for nothing and has no convictions. At the end of the day, she is simply the lessor of two evils. Pathetic we have to chose from these two trolls. Alissa Reed October 26, 2024 at 7:15 pm Humm…a newspaper that has never endorsed a Republican presidential candidate in it’s entire history announces it will not endorse Harris or Trump for president. They did endorse Jimmy Carter and Mondale way back when yet won’t be backing Harris. Perhaps they learned a lesson, can read leaves and don’t want to be on the losing side. Félix Matos MD October 26, 2024 at 10:10 pm By in large, today’s media is indeed in the hands of the billionaire class. The business model changed and the legacy media sorta missed the boat, with these billionaires picking up the pieces for penny’s on the dollar. That said, you gotta give Elon Musk his due. Not only was he a visionary regarding Tesla but also a genus relative to unrelated businesses like SpaceX. I admire him actually. Ryan Mills October 27, 2024 at 12:11 pm I gotta say, Musk’s SpaceX company catching that huge Starship booster rocket shortly after liftoff was a major achievement. It was also a shot across the bow for all these bloated, corrupt defense and space competitors in the US. Developing reusable boosters for its Falcon vehicles has been key to SpaceX’s efforts to cut the cost of space flight. From a small start up to this is amazing for sure and you got to give Musk his due. Bradley Grower October 26, 2024 at 10:54 pm Why this is pretty funny. Does anyone (including the above author) really think ANYONE makes up their mind on who to vote for by what a given newspaper or any media source is telling me who to vote for ? I don’t trust a given newspaper; I don’t trust anybody. Dave E October 27, 2024 at 8:25 am Mainstream media has been stepped on by their corporate owners for decades. That’s why top-flight mainstream, investigative journalist, Robert Parry, who broke the Iran Contra story left mainstream journalism to form Consortium News (which just went down today, hopefully, just a temporary server problem and not censorship). But there are many good reasons in this case not to endorse either of these two mainstream candidates, foremost being that the Biden-Harris Administration vetoed the UN call for an arms embargo to stop a genocide. Candidate Harris has assured that she will not support an arms embargo, a position that places her to the right of Ronald Reagan. Senator Kamala Harris in 2017 supported Trump’s ditching of Obama’s Iran Nuclear deal. Really, as much as I think billionaire shouldn’t exist (no, they shouldn’t all be poisoned! The system shouldn’t allow such wealth disparity!), the idea of listing the pros and cons of both is a better idea than endorsing either. However, the best idea would be to look outside the top-two (worst two) parties for one to endorse. Jill Stein and Butch Ware are far more in tune with the populace than either major party which both represent their megadonors rather than their constituents.

Title: Is Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) the Best FAANG Stock To Buy According to Analysts?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best FAANG Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts. Each of the big tech stocks has revealed its plans to invest $50 to $100 billion in GPU compute, evidence that Artificial intelligence may be the biggest theme right now. On October 21, Ray Wang, Constellation Research’s principal analyst, founder, and chairman, joined CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ to share his stance on the tech sector, especially the Magnificent Seven, and the role of artificial intelligence. The third quarter earnings season is upon us some of the mag seven are yet to report their quarterly results. Wang suggests artificial intelligence is just beginning to pan out and will stand as the major theme for a long while. He adds that companies, among the mega-caps, have poured hundreds of billions into AI during the first half of the year, and plan to add more during the second. He also shared that these mega-cap companies are driving demand as well. READ ALSO: Jim Cramer’s Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch and 10 AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024. While these expenditures may seem to have little to no payoff, historically investors were also worried about companies investing in the Internet. However, Wang dissects that the internet is not the same as artificial intelligence. The internet was rather open and decentralized and had many winners. AI, on the other hand, is more centralized, closed, and expensive, meaning that only a few players are going to make a mark. Wang also shares that he owns all of the magnificent seven stocks. An interesting conjunction, highlighted by Wang, is that across search, social media, and commerce, most of the stocks in the Mag 7 have digital ads. Across all these three avenues, the next players cannot compete with the Magnificent Seven, especially in terms of revenue. On the regulatory front, he emphasized that the sector needs some relief. He adds that the tech sector needs to play out mergers and currently IPOs are lined up, explaining why everything is on hold. FAANG is an acronym, which originally began as FANG, consisting of five major technology companies. The original term, FANG was coined by Jim Cramer in 2013 because, according to him, the four tech stocks belonged together as they functioned across similar themes of digitization and the web. FAANG today is much broader and includes technology companies that are shaping the future, which may also be categorized as the magnificent seven. That said, let’s take a look at the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts. Our Methodology To come up with the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts, we went over the NYSE FANG+ index and picked the latest holdings. We then examined the stocks and picked the ones with the highest analyst upside potential as of October 22, 2024. We also added the hedge fund sentiment of each stock as of Q2 2024. The list is in ascending order of analyst upside primarily and hedge fund holders, as of Q2 2024, secondarily. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. Analyst Upside as of October 22, 2024: 10.9% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 130 Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor company that designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software products. Some of its products include cable modems, networking processors, and storage adapters. 2024 has been quite a feat for Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO). During the year, the company launched two breakthrough technologies such as the industry’s first switch platform for scalable AI systems and Retimers, facilitating the management of large datasets for AI tasks. To keep its strategy active, on October 15, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) expanded its 20-year partnership with Deutsche Telekom’s subsidiary, T-Systems. The subsidiary is now a VMware Cloud Service Provider. On June 13, Nancy Tengler, CEO and chief investment officer of Laffer Tengler Investments, appeared in an Interview on Yahoo Finance where she shared her bullish stance on AVGO. Tengler states that AVGO is like the poor man’s NVIDIA and is part of her 12 best ideas portfolio. She adds that the company is in the sweet spot in the generative AI sector for both the hardware and software components. As Tengler states, AVGO indeed is in a sweet spot for AI. In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, Broadcom expects revenue from AI to grow by 10% sequentially reaching $3.5 billion, bringing the full-year total to $12 billion. In addition to that, its cloud computing platform for enterprises promises a solid growth opportunity as AVGO leverages artificial intelligence. ClearBridge Investments’ ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: "In IT, we bought Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) as we believe the company has a long runway for growth with its custom silicon business, which should be more durable and less volatile than other components within the AI food chain. We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple. We made room for Broadcom by exiting Lam Research, whose shares we believed priced in a full recovery, while we grew increasingly concerned that China exposure might create an air pocket." Overall AVGO ranks 4th among the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: What You Need To Know Ahead of Meta’s Earnings

Meta (META) will report earnings after the market closes Wednesday, with investors watching whether the social media giant's stock can keep up its strong performance so far this year. Analysts expect Meta to post third-quarter revenue of $40.25 billion, surging nearly 18% year-over-year. Net income is projected to land at $13.56 billion or $5.20 per share, up from $11.58 billion or $4.39 per share a year ago. Meta shares popped after the social media giant reported in July that it's seen early gains from artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize user engagement, benefitting its ad business. Deutsche Bank analysts told clients earlier this month they expect Meta's AI-driven optimization campaign to continue to bring "durable ad wallet share gains.” Meta posted advertising revenue of $38.33 billion in the second quarter, with the Street consensus sitting at $39.54 for the third quarter. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in July that Meta AI is "on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year.” In September, Meta released Llama 3.2, its most capable open-source AI model yet, in its efforts to compete with Microsoft-backed (MSFT) OpenAI, Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, and Amazon-backed (AMZN) Anthropic. Ahead of the company's earnings call, Bank of America analysts called the social media giant a “top AI pick,” pointing to strong core ad growth, growing core app usage among younger users, and the capability of the company’s large language model. All but one of the 31 analysts covering Meta tracked by Visible Alpha hold a "buy" or equivalent rating for the stock, with an average price target of $612.34, implying about 7% upside from Friday's closing price. Meta shares have surged more than 60% since the start of the year, finishing Friday at $573.25.

Title: The billionaire owners of the Washington Post and L.A. Times just capitulated to Trump

Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows Once upon a time, after the publisher decided our newspaper would endorse a candidate that those of us on the editorial board didn’t prefer, a colleague circled the date on the calendar and joked that it was “Reminder That We Work for The Man Day.” We knew, even if readers didn’t, that newspaper endorsements don’t always reflect a consensus or the majority opinion of its editorial writers. I am resigning because I want to make it clear that I am not OK with us being silent. Mariel garza, former editorials editor for los angeles times At The Los Angeles Times, the man in charge is Patrick Soon-Shiong, the billionaire doctor and founder of the health care software company NantHealth who spent $500 million for the newspaper in 2018. Soon-Shiong’s decision to block the paper from endorsing California’s own Kamala Harris for president, as its board was reportedly planning to do, led to Donald Trump crowing and the paper’s editorials editor quitting. “I am resigning because I want to make it clear that I am not OK with us being silent,” Mariel Garza told the Columbia Journalism Review. “In dangerous times, honest people need to stand up. This is how I’m standing up.” Two more members of the newspaper's editorial board resigned after Garza did. At The Washington Post, the world’s third-richest man, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, is The Man. And his venerable newspaper, which he bought in 2013 for $250 million, will not endorse a presidential candidate this year. And won’t going forward, according to its relatively new publisher and chief executive, Will Lewis. “The Washington Post will not be making an endorsement of a presidential candidate in this election. Nor in any future presidential election,” Lewis wrote on the newspaper’s website Friday. “We are returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates.” The newspaper, Lewis writes, didn’t endorse in presidential races from 1960 to 1972 but did from 1976 to 2020. The newspaper endorsed Joe Biden in 2020. It endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016, but almost three months before that, it had declared Trump “a unique threat to American democracy.” As The Washington Post did, from 2008 to 2020, the L.A. Times endorsed Barack Obama twice and then Clinton and Biden. Importantly, the L.A. Times endorsed Harris in 2014 when she was the state’s attorney general running for re-election and then endorsed her successful 2016 U.S. Senate run. To Garza’s point, the stakes are high in this election, at least for people who aren’t billionaires. And we have to consider the possibilities that the leaders of these newspapers are OK with Trump — or terrified of him. Given the size and influence of these papers, neither of those possibilities is comforting. On X, Marty Baron, a former executive editor of The Washington Post who was in charge when the paper adopted “Democracy Dies in Darkness” as its slogan, responded to Lewis’ piece: “This is cowardice, with democracy as its casualty.” He said Trump “will see this as invitation to further intimidate” Bezos, and he called it “Disturbing spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.” According to a Washington Post story about the nonendorsement that cited two sources briefed on the events, “The decision not to publish was made by The Post’s owner — Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.” It certainly appears that Soon-Shiong and Bezos are less concerned with their newspaper’s duty to the public and to history and more worried about what might happen to them if Trump wins and carries out his plans of retribution. As important as it is to save newspapers, an obvious downside of billionaires coming to the rescue is their influence on those publications and their editorial pages. (On top of that, these billionaire owners have not put an end to the layoffs of journalists or the offers of buyouts that plagued major publications before they were “rescued” by them.) Granted, there are questions about how effective endorsements are. According to the American Presidency Project, which looked at the country’s top 100 newspapers by circulation, in 2016, 57 newspapers (with a combined circulation of 13,095,067) endorsed Clinton for president. Another three newspapers with a combined circulation of 3,243,140 urged their readers not to vote for Trump, and 26 didn’t endorse. The Las Vegas Review-Journal and The Florida Times-Union (combined circulation of 315,666) were the only two that endorsed Trump. Granted, there are questions about how effective endorsements are. Little good that did Clinton, though. She lost. Not the popular vote, of course, but, still, she lost. What’s striking is that in 2020, there were almost as many of those newspapers that didn’t endorse (44) as the 47 that endorsed the eventual winner, Biden. (Trump received seven endorsements that time.) There are likely multiple reasons for smaller newspapers declining to endorse, including public assumptions that endorsements govern news coverage and the anger that such endorsements inevitably cause. It is far more likely that a newspaper subscriber will cancel their subscription if the paper endorses the candidate they oppose than it is that someone who doesn’t subscribe will become a reader because their candidate was endorsed. It’s a high-risk/no-reward proposition. But it’s still something newspapers do, and if other owners and publishers can take the risks, then billionaires certainly can. Soon-Shiong posted a comment on X Wednesday that mischaracterizes what editorials boards do: The Editorial Board was provided the opportunity to draft a factual analysis of all the POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE policies by EACH candidate during their tenures at the White House, and how these policies affected the nation. In addition, the Board was asked to provide their understanding of the policies and plans enunciated by the candidates during this campaign and its potential effect on the nation in the next four years. In this way, with this clear and non-partisan information side-by-side, our readers could decide who would be worthy of being President for the next four years. Instead of adopting this path as suggested, the Editorial Board chose to remain silent and I accepted their decision. An endorsement is not an analysis. It’s an opinion. It picks a candidate in the same way readers will pick one. The path that Soon-Shiong said he suggested is not a path editorial writers and editors would take. Because editorial writers take sides. That said, Garza told the Columbia Journalism Review that she’d received no such request from Soon-Shiong to write an analysis of the candidates. In 2016, almost three months before The Washington Post endorsed Clinton’s candidacy, it published an editorial identifying Trump as “a unique threat” to democracy. It should be noted that the newspaper did that years before “saving democracy” became a theme. Trump’s threat to democracy is even more obvious today. And, yet, the newspaper that tells us that “democracy dies in darkness” can’t be bothered to put up a fight for it. Yes, there may have been hell to pay if the paper had endorsed Harris and Trump won and then turned against the press as he has promised to do. But hell will be visited on more vulnerable people to a much greater degree. It is unforgivable that the ultra-wealthy who have purchased these huge and influential platforms appear to be more concerned with their own interests than the interests of the readers they serve.

Title: Retail Investors Are Buying Up Nvidia and Other Single Stocks. Here's What That Means.
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/retail-investors-nvidia-and-other-single-stocks-what-that-means-8734308
Time Published: 2024-10-25T19:29:38Z

Retail investors have been buying up Nvidia (NVDA) and favoring single stocks over exchange-traded funds lately. That could indicate optimism about the markets. According to Vanda Research, which tracks investment flows from retail buyers and sellers, net retail purchases of Nvidia totaled more than $1.1 billion between Oct. 17 and Oct. 23. Retail investors had inflows totaling $885 million into single stocks versus $497 million into ETFs during that period, Vanda said. "The recent uptick in single stock purchases suggests that confidence levels remain relatively optimistic," wrote Vanda analysts in a Thursday note. "In a more cautious environment we would see purchases of ETFs increase as individuals generally like to stay invested but scale down risk levels by broadening exposure outside of concentrated single-name bets." Tesla (TSLA) was a not-so-close second to Nvidia, attracting more than $353 million of retail investors' dollars between Oct. 17 and Oct. 23. Tesla reported earnings that beat expectations after the ball on the 23rd, causing its shares to rise 22% in yesterday's session. The EV maker's results and outlook rejuvenated interest in the shares, Vanda said, writing that a recent robotaxi event "failed to meet lofty expectations and retail investors began to flock back into their semiconductor darling" — meaning Nvidia. Nvidia's results are due next month. While retail investors are still putting their money in big tech companies like Nvidia, Tesla, Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), they're also betting on Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) ahead of election day in the United States. There were $34 million worth of net retail purchases of "DJT" between Oct. 17 and Oct. 23, Vanda said. "DJT has historically been regarded as a 'meme stock', but now it’s increasingly being used by retail speculators as a vehicle to bet on a Trump win at the upcoming US election," wrote Vanda analysts.

Title: Nvidia dethrones Apple as the world's most valuable company
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/nvidia-stock-price-market-cap-apple-most-valuable-company-nvda-2024-10
Time Published: 2024-10-25T17:50:35Z

Nvidia briefly eclipsed Apple to become the world's most valuable company on Friday. It's the first time Nvidia has been the world's largest company since mid-June. Nvidia stock jumped as much as 3% on Friday to an intra-day high of $144.13, catapulting its market valuation to $3.53 trillion. In contrast, Apple traded up less than 1%, giving it a market valuation of $3.52 trillion. Nvidia stock has since pared its gains to about 1% and is trading neck-and-neck with Apple's valuation, at $3.52 trillion compared to Apple's $3.53 trillion at 1:24 p.m., according to data from YCharts. The massive size of Nvidia is a testament to its quick ascent since OpenAI released its first version of ChatGPT in November 2022. Since then, shares of Nvidia, which supplies the technology world with AI-enabling GPU chips, have added $3.1 trillion to their market valuation, with their stock price soaring more than 740%. Wall Street believes the gains can continue, with some analysts expecting the stock to eclipse a $4 trillion valuation soon. Bank of America analysts raised their Nvidia price target to $190 last week, citing strong upside and a "generational opportunity" as it grows its lead in the AI space. Meanwhile, CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino bumped his price target to $160 as an "AI war" takes place among the major cloud companies. "The higher multiple and target reflect our higher conviction that NVDA will post results that exceed our/consensus views in CY 25, as Blackwell ramps. As we previously cited, Blackwell will take greater wallet share from hyperscalers (e.g., greater GPU, CPU, networking, and software revenue) amid an AI war in the cloud," Zino wrote. All eyes will be on Nvidia when they report their third-quarter earnings results next month. Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks Jump to

Title: Fantasy Basketball Waiver Wire Week 2: Dyson Daniels' new role could yield improved Fantasy numbers, more

Full Content:
If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Welcome back! I missed the NBA. And I missed you, dear readers. Glad to have this space we can share together again. It's been a bizarre opening week. Half of the first 12 games were double-digit blowouts, and four of last season's top-14 per-game fantasy producers missed Game 1. As opening weeks go, these complications mean we've learned less than we'd hoped, but we've still learned plenty. We can learn infinitely more from a single lopsided and injury-riddled regular season game than the entire preseason and training camp put together. As you'd expect, the waiver wire is deep this week. Two players are stop-everything-go-now must-adds, and a whole lot more have attractive potential. And, of course, our annual cautionary note: don't panic-drop your middle-round picks. Jonathan Kuminga and Jabari Smith put up disappointing stats in their first games, but there's a reason they were widely hyped by analysts and went inside the top 100 in every industry draft I was a part of. Smith, in fact, was also featured in this paragraph after an Opening Night dud last year – he finished the season safely inside the top 90, mildly beating expectations. Don't panic on earlier picks with tremendous upside after one disappointing night. As we do every year, the players in this article must be rostered in less than two-thirds of CBS leagues. Players are listed in the order that I recommend adding them, assuming they are equally good fits for your team. Players rostered in more than two-thirds of leagues but who are still under-rostered. Double-check to make sure they aren't available in your league. In many cases, these players qualified for this article before big opening night performances, meaning managers with once-weekly waiver runs are particularly likely to see these players still available. Walker Kessler, Jazz (80% rostered) Dereck Lively, Mavericks (71% rostered) Jalen Suggs, Magic (80% rostered) Brook Lopez, Bucks (77% rostered)Cameron Johnson, Nets (75% rostered) Jeremy Sochan, Spurs (69% rostered) Andrew Wiggins, Warriors (81% rostered)Ben Simmons, Nets (82% rostered) Dyson Daniels, Hawks (43% rostered) Daniels started and played 35 minutes in the opener. Securing that massive role is, by far, the most important reason that Daniels is this week's top add. The fact that he was wildly productive – 15-5-2 with five steals, two 3s, and a block – is a nice bonus, but he'd be addable regardless. The 21-year-old former lottery pick was buried on the Pelicans' depth chart before coming to Atlanta in the Dejounte Murray trade last summer. Daniels' per-minute productivity was mediocre, but earning the start and playing big minutes over a healthy Bogdan Bogdanovic likely implies that Daniels will get enough work to rack up stats. He's likely to be most helpful on defense, with low-ish scoring and decent rebounds and assists. Note: I would prioritize Daniels over everyone listed in "double-check your leagues," except for Kessler. Onyeka Okongwu, Hawks (61% rostered) If the Hawks' minute distribution in their first game is indicative of what will happen all season, then calling Okongwu a must-add is underselling it. Fantasy managers have known about Okongwu's great per-minute productivity for years, pining for the day when he'd finally see a full workload. In the opener, he played 28 minutes off the bench, while starter Clint Capela played only 20. It's only one game, but it was a real game – and there was no blowout, foul trouble, or injury to muddle the data. The Hawks' second game is Friday night at 7:30 ET. If you're reading this after that game, and Okongwu once again saw 28-ish minutes while Capela played 22 or fewer, then go ahead and flip him ahead of Daniels for this week's top pickup. Note: I would prioritize Okongwu over Wiggins and Simmons, listed in "double-check your leagues" above. Mark Williams, Hornets (62% rostered) Williams (foot) will miss the second game of the season, an ominous start after playing in just 62 games combined through his first two seasons. That said, waiver pickups are free, and he's really productive when he plays. Last season, he averaged 13-10 with 1.1 blocks and 0.8 steals in just 26.7 minutes. Especially if you have an IR spot, add Williams, stash him, and then add someone else. Note: I would prioritize Williams over Wiggins and Simmons, listed in "double-check your leagues" above. Norman Powell, Clippers (63% rostered) The Clippers are short-staffed. With Kawhi Leonard (knee) out indefinitely and P.J. Tucker permanently away from the team, they lack rotation players. We learned Wednesday that part of their plan to replace all of those players is to just give all their minutes to Powell. He played 40 in the opener, tying teammate James Harden for the third-most by any player so far this season. With that many minutes, it would be hard to avoid making a fantasy impact. Powell should score a lot while also helping in 3s and steals. Note: I would prioritize Powell over Wiggins and Simmons, listed in "double-check your leagues" above. Rui Hachimura, Lakers (52% rostered) Hachimura took over as a starter shortly before the All-Star break last season. Over those final two months of the season, he averaged 16-5-1 with 1.8 3s in 31 minutes per game while shooting 56-45-76. If the 35 minutes he played in the opener is indicative of a further increasing role, then Hachimura should easily flirt with the top 100, and that's without factoring in any improvement for the 26-year-old. Trayce Jackson-Davis, Warriors (46% rostered) Another player who took over as a starter late last season and carried that promotion into the new campaign. He averaged 11-8-2 with 2.4 stocks in 25.4 minutes in his 11 full-time starts, and his opening night workload mirrored that. Jackson-Davis was drafted in most industry leagues, and his roster rate is much higher on other host sites – he's only so widely available because CBS had an unusually low default rank on him in their draft room. He's highly likely to reach a near-universal roster rate within a couple of weeks. Yves Missi, Pelicans (25% rostered) The Pelicans probably have the worst center depth chart in the league. It's just Daniel Theis, Missi, the 21st pick in last June's draft, and Karlo Matkovic. Matkovic was a late second-round pick in 2022 who spent last season in the G-League and made his NBA debut in the final minute of Wednesday night's game. Theis started but played only 19 minutes to Missi's 23. Missi was having a good game, and the margin was somewhat small, so we'll need to keep watching to see if this pattern continues. But if it does, Missi could emerge as an excellent source of defensive stats. In the "actions speak louder than words" department, Missi was the first player in this column that I actually went out and added in my own competitive leagues (in part because the players listed above were already rostered). Andre Drummond, 76ers (55% rostered) When Joel Embiid is out, Drummond needs to be in lineups. It's that simple. I don't think Drummond will have much utility while Embiid is playing, hence Drummond's low-ish placement in this column. But he's a must-start any time Embiid is out, and we already know Embiid (knee) will be out on Friday. De'Andre Hunter, Hawks (40% rostered) Despite foul trouble, Hunter still managed 26 minutes in an opening night start. That's a great sign for a chronically underrated Fantasy contributor. Hunter has popped up in this column repeatedly over the past two seasons, averaging basically 16-4-2 with nearly two 3s while playing around 30 minutes per game. His workload in the debut implies another season of a similar role, which means another season of rosterability for as long as he can stay healthy. After Missi, Hunter was the second player I added in my own leagues this week. Bilal Coulibaly, Wizards (47% rostered) It was kind of unfair for the Wizards to kick off their schedule against the Celtics. The two teams are just in completely different classes. But one of the few bright spots in their merciless drubbing was Coulibaly, who put up 8-6-6 with a steal in 30 minutes. It wasn't anything amazing, but it was solid production and a lot of minutes against a great opponent. It might not turn into anything, but this is the sort of performance that can easily build into a breakout campaign. Toumani Camara, Trail Blazers (10% rostered) Generally speaking, I think the fantasy basketball community underrates the "he's just a good player" factor, especially when it comes to surprising players like Camara. A good recent parallel is Herb Jones, who, like Camara, was a defense-first, second-round pick who surprised everyone by forcing his way into a large rotation role as a rookie. That undeniability usually matters. Camara isn't as good as Jones, but he is a good defender who has earned a large role in the rotation. He played 30 minutes as a starter in the opener, though, granted, that was without Shaedon Sharpe (shoulder) and Matisse Thybulle (knee). Sharpe is the more serious threat, so we'll see what happens when he returns (expected in about two weeks). Even with that looming threat, however, I like Camara as a flier to see if he can maintain this workload and what happens to his numbers as he continues to improve. Other recommendations: Al Horford, Celtics (54% rostered); Nikola Jovic, Heat (23% rostered); Tre Mann, Hornets (25% rostered) Dalton Knecht, Lakers Knecht barely did enough to warrant a blurb, but he was the most popular pickup on CBS this week after playing a larger-than-expected 16 minutes on opening night, so I wanted to address him. It is an excellent sign that Knecht appears to be starting the season firmly in the rotation. The rookie sharpshooter could be a solid contributor if he earns a larger role. But first, he'll have to hold onto these minutes once Jarred Vanderbilt (foot) returns). Knecht's surprisingly lengthy appearance Tuesday increases his dynasty appeal. But he's droppable if you drafted him in a standard-sized league. Lonzo Ball, Bulls Another of the week's most popular pickups that need to be dropped. It is very exciting to see Ball back in action after nearly three years away. If he ever gets anything near full health and a full workload, he'll be rosterable. But he played 14 minutes in the opener. Keep an eye on the transaction page in your league – the following injured players have seen their roster rates fall meaningfully over the past week. As evidence of these players' value, all of these players were selected well inside the top 100 in recent industry drafts. Let other managers' impatience be your benefit. Isaiah Hartenstein, Thunder (71% rostered) – out at least four more weeks Trey Murphy, Pelicans (66% rostered) – out at least two more weeks Ausar Thompson, Pistons (50% rostered) – out indefinitely Toumani Camara, Trail Blazers (10% rostered) Just making sure you noticed that Camara is 10% available. His blurb is in the "adds for all leagues" section. Miles McBride, Knicks (21% rostered) McBride was the clear sixth man for the Knicks on Opening Night. The blowout was obvious early, so it's unclear how many minutes that will translate to during a competitive game – but, historically, it's been a profitable position under substitution-challenged coach Tom Thibodeau. Last season, in the 20 games where he played between 19-33 minutes, he averaged 11-2-2 with 2.1 3s and 1.1 steals (while averaging 24.9 minutes). If he is, in fact, firmly entrenched as the sixth man, then that strikes me as a realistic and possibly slightly conservative expectation of what we might see from him moving forward. Other recommendations: Bruce Brown, Raptors (8% rostered); Dean Wade, Cavaliers (1% rostered); Derrick Jones Jr, Clippers (5% rostered) © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's compensation rises 63% to $79.11 million despite his request for a pay cut

What just happened? In a scenario that the vast majority of us will never experience, Microsoft boss Satya Nadella has seen his take-home pay increase 63% compared to last year despite the CEO requesting the amount he receives be reduced. While Nadella's salary was cut by 50%, other forms of his compensation increased significantly, bringing his total to $79.11 million in fiscal 2024, up from $48.51 million a year earlier. Nadella requested that his pay be reduced as a reflection of his accountability in relation to the company's security failures, including the major cyberattacks against Microsoft's and the CrowdStrike fiasco. The incidents led to Nadella making security a "top priority" above all else at Microsoft, which now ties employee bonuses and promotions to security performance. Microsoft's board compensation committee agreed to Nadella's request, reducing his cash incentive from the $10.7 million he was set to receive by more than 50% to $5.2 million. Like most CEOs, the majority of Nadella's compensation – around 90% – comes in the form of stock awards. This year saw those awards increase from $39 million in 2023 to around $71 million as Microsoft's market cap passed $3 trillion. "The Board reviewed the Company's performance and firmly believes that Mr. Nadella provided exceptional leadership and was both critical in achieving the extremely strong performance of the Company and personally responsible for the ongoing repositioning of its investments and priorities," the Microsoft Compensation Committee wrote in a filing. "It also considered the factors that Mr. Nadella raised in requesting a reduction of his cash incentive and concluded that such an adjustment was appropriate." Surprisingly, this isn't the largest award Nadella has received during his time at the head of Microsoft. He was paid $84 million in 2014, the same year he became the Redmond giant's third chief executive. Other Microsoft execs also received a pay bump. President Brad Smith's compensation was up 29% to $23.4 million, while Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood saw a 30% increase to $25.8 million. Microsoft's valuation has increased by more than tenfold in the decade since Nadella took over from Steve Ballmer. Its share price has continued to grow in recent times, up from $327 one year ago to $427 today. It is currently the third-largest company in the world by market cap, sitting behind Nvidia and leader Apple. TECHSPOT : Tech Enthusiasts, Power Users, Gamers TechSpot is a registered trademark.

Title: Weight loss drugs have yet to lower patients' health care costs

GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy (NVO-0.35%) might help with weight loss, but they aren’t leading to lower health care costs yet, according to a new analysis of U.S. health insurance claims. A review by pharmacy benefit manager Prime Therapeutics, and reported by Reuters, found that patients with obesity incurred average annual medical costs of $18,507 two years after starting GLP-1 drugs, a 46% increase from before they were on the drugs. For comparison, medical costs for a control group not using GLP-1 drugs rose by 14% over the same period. The analysis found that prescription drug costs were the primary driver of these increases, with other medical expenses also rising during the two years on the drug. It showed no reduction in obesity-related medical events — such as heart attacks, strokes, and type 2 diabetes diagnoses, compared to the control group. GLP-1 drugs, which mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar, have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Demand for these medications has turned Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly (LLY+0.76%) — the producer of Mounjaro and Zepbound, both GLP-1 drugs for diabetes and weight loss — into the largest pharma companies in the world. Ozempic and prescription weight loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know However, many U.S. employers and government insurance programs have been hesitant to cover these medications due to their high initial costs and uncertainty about long-term savings. Prime Therapeutics analyzed the pharmacy and medical claims of 3,046 commercially insured patients who received new GLP-1 prescriptions for obesity in 2021, excluding those already diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Among the GLP-1 users, 46% were taking Wegovy or Ozempic, while others were on Saxenda, Victoza, Rybelsus, or Lilly’s Trulicity. Newer drugs, such as Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro and Zepbound, were not included since they launched after study started. The analysis also highlighted adherence challenges. Only 25% of patients who were prescribed Wegovy or Ozempic for weight loss were still taking the medication two years later. This low adherence rate makes it challenging to replicate the results shown in clinical trials, according to Prime Therapeutics VP for pharmacy clinical services David Lassen. “I don’t think it’s fully conclusive at this point,” Lassen told Reuters (TRI+0.10%). He noted that more data and time may be necessary to fully gauge the costs. “We want to do everything possible to help individuals achieve the positive outcomes of being on this medication,” Lassen said. “But if we determine there is not a positive outcome with our data and there is not a return on investment, that will be an inflection point ahead that we will have to consider.” Prime’s assistant VP for health outcomes Patrick Gleason estimated that GLP-1 drugs will cost employers and insurers about $11,200 more per patient over the first two years, despite discounts and rebates. The company said that fewer than 20% of its members have coverage for these weight-loss drugs. Still, it supports clients who choose to cover GLP-1s when combined with lifestyle modification programs. Prime manages pharmacy benefits for about 38 million people and is owned by 19 U.S. Blue Cross and Blue Shield health insurance plans.

Title: AST SpaceMobile: SpaceX Is a Bully, Uses Anticompetitive Tactics
URL: https://me.pcmag.com/en/networking/26573/ast-spacemobile-spacex-is-a-bully-uses-anticompetitive-tactics
Time Published: 2024-10-25T15:44:29Z

AST SpaceMobile is criticizing SpaceX for allegedly using "anticompetitive" tactics to try and override concerns about its cellular Starlink system for phones. "Ironically, SpaceX's own attempt to intimidate and bully its competitors, regulators, and cellular operators is itself anti-competitive and an effort to deflect technical shortcomings of its own system,” AST SpaceMobile tells the Federal Communications Commission. The startup is hitting back after SpaceX sent a letter to the FCC earlier this month, accusing AST SpaceMobile of spreading misinformation meant to “hamstring” its work on the direct-to-cell Starlink system. SpaceX also derided AST SpaceMobile as “meme stock” driven by investors and foreign partners. In response, AST SpaceMobile sent its own letter to the FCC on Thursday, calling out SpaceX for allegedly trying to “manufacture a controversy.” “SpaceX has resorted to hurling unfounded accusations at AST SpaceMobile, a company capable of delivering space-based cellular broadband [device-to-device] connectivity to every American,” the company told the FCC. “AST SpaceMobile respectfully requests that SpaceX refrain from making further inflammatory statements to distract from key MNO [mobile network operator] concerns.” The dispute highlights the simmering competition in the race to deliver satellite connectivity to today’s smartphones. Like SpaceX, AST SpaceMobile is working to launch a high-speed satellite service to help carriers fill dead zones in their cellular coverage. But SpaceX is much closer to launching its own competing service through T-Mobile; it already has 240 satellites in orbit. In contrast, AST only has five satellites in space and may need another year or more before its satellite fleet is large enough to offer continuous coverage over the US. The problem is that SpaceX has been urging the FCC to grant a waiver to loosen the radio emission limits for the cellular Starlink satellites. Without the waiver, the satellites risk losing the ability to power real-time satellite voice calls for consumer phones. However, a growing number of companies—including AT&T and Verizon, key investors of AST SpaceMobile—have been imploring the FCC to reject SpaceX’s request to loosen the radio emission limits, citing their own data showing it’ll generate radio interference for their mobile networks. The regulatory battle has since escalated; a group of European telecommunication firms and partners of AST have also told the FCC they’ll sue if SpaceX receives the necessary waiver to operate the cellular Starlink technology beyond the normal limits. AST is now taking a more vocal role in the dispute. In Thursday’s letter to the FCC, the company said it supported the mobile carriers' "legitimate" interference concerns about cellular Starlink technology operating beyond the normal radio emission limits. "AST SpaceMobile’s position is simple: SCS [supplemental coverage from space] providers should be allowed to operate as long as they avoid causing harmful interference to the cellular networks on which billions of people rely globally,” the company said. In the same letter, AST also alleged that SpaceX’s lobbying efforts to the FCC are a “thinly veiled attempt to deflect the technical shortcomings of its own design and its inability to effectively share terrestrial spectrum.” However, SpaceX has long maintained its request to increase the radio emission limits for the cellular Starlink technology won’t generate radio interference, citing its own analysis. In a separate letter to the FCC last week, SpaceX also continued to fire shots at AST SpaceMobile, saying, “Unfortunately, AST is once again marshaling its investors to make bogus technical arguments from harming AST’s competitors.” “The latest tag-team letters from AST’s investors AT&T and Verizon only further demonstrate that AST’s primary goal is to suppress competition, no matter the cost to American families and first responders,” the company added. In the meantime, AST and SpaceX are still waiting for the FCC to grant full regulatory approval, enabling the companies to operate their cellular satellite services commercially. I've been working as a journalist for over 15 years—I got my start as a schools and cities reporter in Kansas City and joined PCMag in 2017. I've been following SpaceX's Starlink network for several years, writing 500+ stories on availability and feature launches, but also the regulatory battles over the expansion of satellite constellations, fights between rival providers, and the effort to expand into satellite-based mobile service.

In response, AST SpaceMobile sent its own letter to the FCC on Thursday, calling out SpaceX for allegedly trying to “manufacture a controversy.” “SpaceX has resorted to hurling unfounded accusations at AST SpaceMobile, a company capable of delivering space-based cellular broadband [device-to-device] connectivity to every American,” the company told the FCC. “AST SpaceMobile respectfully requests that SpaceX refrain from making further inflammatory statements to distract from key MNO [mobile network operator] concerns.” The dispute highlights the simmering competition in the race to deliver satellite connectivity to today’s smartphones. Like SpaceX, AST SpaceMobile is working to launch a high-speed satellite service to help carriers fill dead zones in their cellular coverage. But SpaceX is much closer to launching its own competing service through T-Mobile; it already has 240 satellites in orbit. In contrast, AST only has five satellites in space and may need another year or more before its satellite fleet is large enough to offer continuous coverage over the US. The problem is that SpaceX has been urging the FCC to grant a waiver to loosen the radio emission limits for the cellular Starlink satellites. Without the waiver, the satellites risk losing the ability to power real-time satellite voice calls for consumer phones. However, a growing number of companies—including AT&T and Verizon, key investors of AST SpaceMobile—have been imploring the FCC to reject SpaceX’s request to loosen the radio emission limits, citing their own data showing it’ll generate radio interference for their mobile networks. The regulatory battle has since escalated; a group of European telecommunication firms and partners of AST have also told the FCC they’ll sue if SpaceX receives the necessary waiver to operate the cellular Starlink technology beyond the normal limits. AST is now taking a more vocal role in the dispute. In Thursday’s letter to the FCC, the company said it supported the mobile carriers' "legitimate" interference concerns about cellular Starlink technology operating beyond the normal radio emission limits. "AST SpaceMobile’s position is simple: SCS [supplemental coverage from space] providers should be allowed to operate as long as they avoid causing harmful interference to the cellular networks on which billions of people rely globally,” the company said. In the same letter, AST also alleged that SpaceX’s lobbying efforts to the FCC are a “thinly veiled attempt to deflect the technical shortcomings of its own design and its inability to effectively share terrestrial spectrum.” However, SpaceX has long maintained its request to increase the radio emission limits for the cellular Starlink technology won’t generate radio interference, citing its own analysis. In a separate letter to the FCC last week, SpaceX also continued to fire shots at AST SpaceMobile, saying, “Unfortunately, AST is once again marshaling its investors to make bogus technical arguments from harming AST’s competitors.” “The latest tag-team letters from AST’s investors AT&T and Verizon only further demonstrate that AST’s primary goal is to suppress competition, no matter the cost to American families and first responders,” the company added. In the meantime, AST and SpaceX are still waiting for the FCC to grant full regulatory approval, enabling the companies to operate their cellular satellite services commercially.

Title: Former Intel CEO Craig Barrett: Splitting up America’s leading chipmaker is a bad idea
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/10/25/former-intel-ceo-craig-barrett-splitting-up-america-leading-chipmaker-bad-idea-semiconductors-tech-finance/
Time Published: 2024-10-25T14:33:08Z
Full Content:
Throughout the 59-year history of Moore’s Law, the only consistent truth in the semiconductor industry has been that performance wins. Competitors come and go, and new technologies like PCs, smartphones, and artificial intelligence rapidly change the landscape. But in the end, the company with the best technology and ability to manufacture in high volume wins the prize. For decades, this was Intel. The company’s mantra was to drive technology leadership at all costs and push Moore’s Law to the limit. That’s how Intel became the most successful semiconductor company on the planet, with manufacturing technology consistently one generation (about two years) ahead of everyone else. During the last decade, this all changed. Intel stumbled and lost its leadership position—and now it’s viewed by some as just another company struggling to survive. Some pundits think there is a simple solution: split the company into two. That way, their argument goes, the Intel design company can compete with other chip designers (AMD, Qualcomm, NVIDIA, etc.) while the foundry part of the company can be free to serve all chip designers. This simplistic solution ignores the existence of Moore’s Law—and would be bad for Intel and the United States. Every design company wants the best manufacturing technology available so as to maximize the performance of its chips. This holds true for companies that sell chips on the open market as well as those that design for the internal use of the likes of Apple and Amazon. Whichever foundry has the latest and greatest technology will win the lion’s share of all the chip designer’s business. Today, that position is held by TSMC. Much of the industry relies on the same manufacturer to build their products—their only manufacturing advantage is TSMC’s technology leadership. Intel can attract these same chip customers by restoring its foundry technology leadership. Even if you compete with Intel designs, why put yourself at a disadvantage? As long as Intel has the best technology and is competitive on price, competitive issues can be resolved. This is all unfolding at a time when the world needs a more globally diverse and resilient semiconductor supply chain. Geopolitical tensions around the world are escalating, making the urgent need for having a strong U.S. manufacturing capability on our own shores even more pressing. Splitting Intel into two separate companies wouldn’t do the U.S. any good if the Intel design business succeeds and the foundry business does not. In that case, the U.S. would remain dependent on a foreign supplier for leading-edge technology—and the $50 billion in the CHIPS ACT would have been wasted. We’ve seen this movie before. Years ago, a struggling AMD split off its manufacturing capacity into Global Foundries. Pundits applauded the split at the time. A decade later, AMD is doing well using TSMC, while Global Foundries has little if any differentiated technology. Global Foundries just didn’t have enough research and development (R&D) budget, and with limited production and revenue, struggled to keep up with market leaders. The economic reality is that it takes massive investment to drive Moore’s Law. In today’s semiconductor industry, only three companies (Intel, Samsung, and TSMC) have sufficient revenue to contend for technology leadership. If you split up Intel, the foundry portion will probably fail because of decreased R&D spending along with the complex realities of splitting up a huge multinational company in the midst of a multiyear turnaround effort. Instead of wasting time and effort splitting Intel into two separate companies, why not focus on the real issue? The Intel of tomorrow needs to be like the Intel of 15 years ago—the driver and leader of Moore’s Law. That way, you get a win-win scenario with U.S.-based design and manufacturing technology. This starts with rebuilding Intel’s technology leadership. The current CEO, Pat Gelsinger, has precisely the right strategy and attributes, and he is already driving the right changes. Intel is on the verge of completing an unprecedented pace of node development to catch up to TSMC. It has taken the lead on next-gen technologies that will shape the semiconductor industry for years to come, such as high NA EUV lithography and backside power delivery. Yes, more work is needed—but this is a good start, and they must keep going. The U.S. government must do its part as well. This includes increased funding of basic pre-competitive research in semiconductor technology in our research universities and national laboratories. The U.S. has made a small step in this direction with the creation of the National Semiconductor Technology Center, but there is still a ways to go, especially when you consider the NSTC budget for five years is less than what Intel spends annually on R&D. There are immense challenges as leading manufacturers race to create technologies that combine 100 billion transistors into a piece of silicon the size of a fingernail. These are the most complicated things mankind has ever built, and semiconductor leaders will spend tens of billions of dollars to make it happen. Let’s not kid ourselves: If the U.S. wants to be a leader in this game once again, simply slicing Intel in half is not the solution. We must be willing to invest and do the hard work of leading Moore’s Law into the future, not waste time rearranging the deck chairs. I remember a similar time in Intel’s history—the dot-com bubble crash of the early 2000s. Customer demand evaporated. Wall Street said we should have layoffs, close factories, and cut R&D spending. The Intel board agonized over the situation but followed management’s plan to maintain investment in R&D and build new factories. The stock price crashed, but when demand returned, Intel was in a stronger position than before. It wasn’t pretty but it was the right thing to do. Pat Gelsinger is doing the right thing now.

Title: Nasdaq Hits All-Time High—First Since July As Tesla Stock Leads Tech Rally

The Nasdaq Composite jumped to an all-time high Friday, a first for the tech-heavy stock index in more than three months as the group shook off tailwinds such as rising bond yields and enjoyed a boost from Tesla’s share price. A new tech stock high was set Friday. The Nasdaq rose as much as 1.5% to a new record of 18.690.01, surpassing the previous high set July 11. Predictably leading the way for the Nasdaq were the “magnificent seven” behemoths, with Amazon, Facebook parent Meta, Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla stocks all rising at least 1.5% by midmorning, with Tesla’s near 3% gain leading the group and Apple stock’s 0.7% advance trailing those of its peers. The less tech-exposed S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average indexes rose 0.5% and 0.8%, respectively, short of their all-time highs set last week. 25%. That’s how much shares of the electric vehicle giant Tesla are up since Wednesday, as its third-quarter earnings report impressed investors. The Nasdaq was much harder-hit by this summer’s economic growth scare selloff than the more industry-neutral Dow and S&P, as the Nasdaq fell into a more than 10% correction in August as the market sold off on tech companies thought to be more sensitive to a potential recession. But data over the last two months have shown little signs of an economic slowdown, helping restore faith in the earnings growth trajectory necessary to justify the Nasdaq’s more than 70% gain over the last two years. Much of that rally is tied to investor excitement over the profit potential for tech companies stemming from the exploding interest in artificial intelligence. Nvidia, which is the primary architect of the semiconductor technology powering generative AI, is the poster child of this rally, growing its market capitalization from less than $300 billion in Oct. 2022 to $3.5 trillion Friday. Tech stocks will face several tests next week as major third-quarter results come in. Alphabet, Amazon Apple, Meta, Microsoft and Uber are among the companies whose earnings reports will out between next Tuesday and Thursday. One Community. Many Voices.

Yesterday's hit stock has cooled a bit today—but it's still working its way higher. Shares of EV maker Tesla (TSLA) were up nearly 3% in early trading Friday to around $268, outperforming the benchmark S&P 500. (Read today's markets coverage here.) That's less dramatic than the numbers the stock turned in Thursday as the company saw its shares rise 22%, its biggest percentage gain in more than a decade, on the back of an earnings report and outlook investors cheered. Today's move has the stock on track for a weekly gain of about 21% from last Friday's close of $220.70. It has the company's market capitalization at around $840 billion, according to Visible Alpha data. Analysts tracked by Visible Alpha have yet to catch up to Tesla's latest ride higher, with their mean price target at about $232. It also comes as the other six of the so-called Magnificent Seven megacap tech shares—Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA)—rose, with all but Apple up more than 1% in recent trading. That would point toward general optimism ahead of quarterly financial results from Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta that are expected next week.

Should you invest in growth stocks for capital gains through stock price appreciation or in dividend stocks for steady, reliable income? There's no one-size-fits-all answer, but patient investors are crushing it with income strategies, earning substantial returns through regular dividends. About two months ago, a dividend investor shared his success story and income report on r/Dividends – a community of over 600,000 members on Reddit. The investor, 48, said he was collecting about $2,200 per month in dividend income with a portfolio worth $378,351. This gives the portfolio a strong dividend yield of over 7%. Don’t Miss Out: These five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends. Your biggest returns may not come from the stock market. Invest the way colleges, pension funds, and the 1% do. Get started investing in commercial real estate today. The investor was asked about his expectations of capital growth from his portfolio. Here was his response: "I expect it to grow between 5-7% annually without reinvesting dividends. Yes, I am reinvesting dividends. With dividends reinvested, I expect it to grow 8-10% annually." Based on the screenshots shared by the investor publicly, let's examine some of the biggest holdings of this high-yield dividend portfolio. Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares (MUTF: VFIAX) was one of the Redditor’s biggest positions, earning $2,200 per month in dividends. His portfolio screenshots showed that VFIAX accounted for about 34.5% of the entire portfolio. This fund tracks the S&P 500 Index, with about 79% of the portfolio comprising large-cap stocks. The fund yields 1.3% and pays quarterly dividends. Fidelity Total Bond K6 Fund Fidelity Total Bond K6 Fund (FTKFX) invests in U.S. government securities, investment-grade corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities and other debt instruments. The fund suits investors looking for safer, fixed-income investments rather than stocks. FTKFX has a dividend yield of about 4.5% and pays monthly. About 32% of the investor’s total portfolio making $2,200 per month was invested in FTKFX.

Title: Kamala Harris Has More Billionaires Prominently Backing Her Than Trump—Buffett, Gates Weigh In (Updated)

Forbes found at least 100 billionaires in the corners of either former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris—with many more backing Harris—but unlike the world’s richest man Elon Musk, who stumps extensively on Trump’s behalf, many have elected to watch from the sidelines, like Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg. Trump and Harris during their September presidential debate. Our breakdown records 82 billionaires supporting Harris and 52 backing Trump so far (see the lists for both below). Many more billionaires may still financially back a candidate, but their donations won’t be learned until after the election, when final Federal Election Commission reports are issued in December. Billionaires leaning toward Harris may seem incongruous, since she often criticizes Trump for advocating for policies favorable toward billionaires—but there are practical reasons why the ultra wealthy may favor Harris. A letter signed by more than a dozen billionaires last month endorsing Harris explained their belief Harris “will continue to advance fair and predictable policies that support the rule of law, stability, and a sound business environment,” indicating the support for the status quo as the U.S. economy and stock market exhibit strength, while a recent survey of millionaire investors—which found a 57% to 43% split in Harris’s favor—identified technology, healthcare and sustainability stocks as the sectors most poised to benefit from a Harris win, a mix friendly to many of her billionaire backers from Silicon Valley, who grew familiar with Harris during her time as a California prosecutor. Forbes will update this list through Election Day. Jeff Bezos, left, Larry Page, second from left, Sheryl Sandberg, former chief operating officer of ... [+] Facebook, then-Vice President-elect Mike Pence and then-President-elect Donald Trump meet in 2016. Jeff Bezos: The Amazon founder and world’s fourth-richest man wrote Trump “showed tremendous grace and courage under literal fire” following the assassination attempt at a July 13 rally, but Bezos has not endorsed or financially backed, even though he has publicly warred with Trump during his presidency. He celebrated Biden’s election in 2020 with an Instagram post noting the Biden win indicated “unity, empathy, and decency are not characteristics of a bygone era.” UPDATE (Oct. 29): In a strongly worded editorial in the Bezos-owned Washington Post, the centibillionaire explained his decision to reportedly strike down the newspaper’s endorsement of Harris amid a storm of controversy, explaining he believed it would help restore the public’s faith in the paper’s journalism. “Presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election,” wrote Bezos. Ken Griffin: Griffin (Citadel) confirmed he has not financially backed Trump, adding he’s “torn” and won’t vote with a “smile on my face” as both candidates aren’t “going to receive an award for the quality of their policies” or “the quality of their leadership.” UPDATE (Oct. 29): Griffin, one of the wealthiest hedge fund managers in the world and one of the deepest-pocketed Republican donors in prior election years, told Bloomberg financial markets’ “expectation today is that Donald Trump will win the White House,” echoing a chorus of Wall Street money flows seemingly pricing in such a scenario. But regardless of who wins, “the reduction of uncertainty is almost positive for asset prices and we’re at that moment of peak uncertainty,” offering a positive prognostication for investors. Bill Gates: Though his ex-wife French Gates is among Harris’ deepest backers—her reported $13 million donation to Harris groups would place her among the top individual donors this cycle—the Microsoft cofounder Gates has not officially endorsed a candidate, but appeared to offer positive words toward Harris in a July interview, saying it is “great to have somebody who's younger, who can think about things like AI and how we shape that in the right way.” But “I don’t tell other people how to vote” due to his work with his nonprofit Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Gates added. UPDATE (Oct. 22): Gates told allies he donated $50 million to the non-profit wing of a Democratic political action committee supporting Harris, The New York Times reported Tuesday, citing three sources familiar with the situation. The bombshell report goes against Gates’ history of public nonpartisanship. Though Gates did not confirm the donation to the Times, he hinted at his Harris backing in a statement, saying he supports “candidates who demonstrate a clear commitment to improving health care, reducing poverty and fighting climate change” and “this election is different” than those of the past. Jamie Dimon: Trump shared a false social media post touting Dimon’s endorsement, but the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, did not endorse any candidate, according to his spokesperson. Still, some see hints in Dimon’s words. He’s been outspoken about the election, penning an opinion in The Washington Post calling on voters “to elect a president who is dedicated to the ideals that define and unite us.” UPDATE (Oct. 22): The Times reported Dimon has privately endorsed Harris and has indicated he’s open to a role in her administration, including the top economic role of Treasury secretary. Dimon spokesman Joe Evangelisti told the Times the banker “has never publicly endorsed a presidential candidate.” Dimon’s wife, Judith Kent, has donated more than $250,000 to Democratic causes in 2024 through the couple’s joint The James and Judith K Dimon Foundation, according to Federal Election Commission filings. A source close to Dimon told Forbes that the JPMorgan chief is not considering a role in either a Harris or Trump administration. Steve Ballmer, UPDATE (Oct. 22): Ballmer, the owner of the NBA’s Los Angeles Clippers and former chief executive of Microsoft, made clear in an interview with Forbes last week he will not endorse a candidate, though he has shelled out more than $40 million to his not-for-profit company USAFacts to arm the public with easily accessible government data. “At some point all the money does is help bid up the price of ads on Facebook,” Ballmer bemoaned to Forbes about the impact traditional political spending can have. Connie Ballmer, the wife of the world’s 10th-richest person, has donated more than $300,000 to Democratic causes this year, according to government records, but “I don't control my wife and would never want to,” Steve Ballmer added about what that indicates about his own leanings. Warren Buffett: Though Berkshire Hathaway CEO Buffett said in 2020 he’s a Democrat and clapped back at Trump in 2016 for an income tax jab, Buffett, the world’s sixth-richest person, has also stayed quiet this cycle. UPDATE (Oct. 23): Berkshire released a statement Wednesday that Buffett won’t publicly “endorse and support political candidates.” Buffett explained to CNBC he’s “worried about people impersonating” him and “nobody should believe anybody saying I’m telling them how to...vote.” Mark Zuckerberg: Trump told New York Magazine that Zuckerberg said to him he can’t “vote for a Democrat in this election” after the assassination attempt. But a Meta spokesperson said Zuckerberg, the third-wealthiest person on the planet, is “not endorsing anybody in this race and has not communicated to anybody how he intends to vote.” In 2020, Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan donated $419 million toward organizations supporting in-person voting during the pandemics. The Meta CEO and Facebook cofounder called Trump’s response to the assassination attempt “badass” in a July interview. Ray Dalio: Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, told CNBC last month it’s the “most consequential” election of his, but he won’t endorse Harris or Trump as he desires a more moderate candidate. Sergey Brin: The Google cofounder and eighth-wealthiest person in the world Brin said following the 2016 election he found Trump’s election “deeply offensive” as an immigrant, according to an internal video leaked in 2018, but has not made public any feelings during this cycle. Larry Ellison: Ellison is one of the most surprising billionaires who has stayed quiet in the final months of the presidential election cycle considering he has donated millions to Republican causes in the past. Ellison (Oracle), the second-richest person on earth, had backed Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), in the primaries. A total of 82 billionaires (or more) are backing Harris. Forbes identified these 28 billionaires who donated $1 million toward groups supporting Harris through August: Michael Bloomberg, left, and Harris appear together in 2023. The following 36 billionaires made between $50,000 and $999,999 in donations to groups supporting Harris through August, according to Forbes’ analysis of FEC data: The news outlet Bloomberg reported these additional four billionaires have donated to Harris’ election funds or groups supporting Harris’ election: These six billionaires signed a Sept. 6 open letter supporting Harris: (Updated Oct. 16): And these three billionaires donated to a Harris committee during the third quarter, according to FEC filings analyzed by The New York Times: And there's music stars Bruce Springsteen, who backed Harris Oct. 3, and Taylor Swift, who endorsed Harris Sept. 10. (Updated Oct. 28): Bloomberg donated another $50 million to the same non-profit organization backing Harris, the Times reported Monday. Bloomberg was already the most prolific individual donor to Harris groups this cycle, and his total financial commitment toward Democratic causes now reportedly approaches nearly $100 million. Also, Duolingo founder Luis von Ahn endorsed Harris, declaring the Democratic candidate is “the better option for the US economy.” A total of 52 billionaires have been identified as Trump backers. Forbes identified in August these 26 billionaires who had donated at least $1 million toward Trump election efforts: Musk, right, jumps on stage as he joins Trump at a Saturday rally. Another 16 billionaires gave between $50,000 and $999,999 to groups supporting Trump through that period: (Updated Oct. 16) The New York Times named the following three billionaires as donating at least $100,000 to Trump groups last quarter: And of course there’s Elon Musk (Tesla and SpaceX CEO), who gave $75 million last quarter to his pro-Trump America PAC, according to filings. He gave another $43.6 million to a pro-Trump committee from Oct. 1 to Oct. 16, becoming the second-most prolific donor in Trump’s camp this year, trailing only Adelson. Other known Trump supporters include Jeff Hildebrand (Hilcorp), Isaac Perlmutter (Marvel Entertainment), Thomas Peterffy (Interactive Brokers) and Gary Rollins (Rollins Inc.), according to media reports and Bloomberg’s analysis of public election records last month. (Updated Oct. 22): The New Yorker recently reported activist investor Nelson Peltz hosted a February fundraiser for Trump, where Peltz reportedly quipped Trump is “a terrible human being, but our country’s in a bad place, and we can’t afford Joe Biden.” Peltz has not made public comment since Biden ceded way to Harris, and his Trian Partners asset manager did not return a request for comment. A pair of other Wall Street billionaires have said the stock market is heavily leaning toward Trump in Daniel Loeb and Stanley Druckenmiller, though neither have publicly endorsed or made major donations toward a candidate. Fellow hedge fund billionaire Leon Cooperman told Fox Business he doesn’t plan to vote for either major candidate. Kyle Khan-Mullins and Leo Kalmin contributed reporting. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Lords committee warns about risks of the UK losing its EU data adequacy

mixmagic - stock.adobe.com British businesses and public sector organisations will face huge extra costs if the UK loses its ability to seamlessly transfer data to the European Union (EU), warns cross-party House of Lords committee. In June 2021, the European Commission granted “data adequacy” to the UK following its exit from the European Union (EU), allowing the free flow of personal data to and from the bloc to continue, but warned that the decision may yet be revoked if future data protection laws diverge significantly from those in Europe. In exiting the EU, the UK became a “third country” under the bloc’s rules, which means the European Commission (EC) will have to periodically assess whether it does provide an essentially equivalent level of data protection for EU citizens’ data. The EC will have to make two separate adequacy determinations under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Law Enforcement Directive (LED) – both of which were transposed into UK law via the current Data Protection Act 2018 – by the end of June 2025. Now, following a seven-month inquiry into the UK’s EU data adequacy, the European Affairs Committee (EAC) has written to digital secretary Peter Kyle urging the government to engage in early talks with the EC to ensure the UK maximises its prospects of achieving a data adequacy agreement in the first half of 2025. It also emphasised the that losing adequacy status could cause significant problems across a range of areas. This includes raising new barriers to international trade and economic cooperation, imposing significant extra costs and administrative burdens on organisations which share data between the UK and the EU (particularly in the context of policing and healthcare), and the risk of upending the Good Friday Agreement. The EAC also noted the high financial costs of losing adequacy, adding that while “compliance with GDPR can itself be costly, the loss of data adequacy would also lead to significant financial penalties for many organisations”. For example, the NHS Confederation and Understanding Patient Data estimated in a joint submission to the EAC that losing adequacy could cost the NHS alone tens of millions of pounds, while other estimates noted failing to secure adequacy status would impose additional compliance costs on UK businesses of £1 to £1.6bn. It added that adequacy was therefore valuable because it would reduce administrative burdens and compliance costs, increase legal certainty, and make the UK a more attractive location to invest and do business. “The UK faces a potential cliff-edge in June 2025 unless agreement is reached with the EU on the continued free flow of data. The safe and effective exchange of data underpins our trade and economic links with the EU and cooperation between our law-enforcement bodies,” said committee chair Lord Ricketts. “The loss of data adequacy would create new barriers and run completely counter to the government’s ambitions to grow the economy and reset relations with the EU. We recommend that reaching timely agreement on data adequacy should be integral to the reset, and the government’s top data protection priority.” To limit the uncertainty around its future adequacy status, the EAC recommended that the government “engages early with the European Commission and other EU stakeholders with a view to ensuring that the adequacy renewal process is on a positive track, and providing reassurance as soon as possible about the retention of adequacy status”. It added that the government should also explore the prospects for securing future adequacy renewal decisions from the European Commission which do not expire after a fixed period, and that it should engage with the EU in good time to explain and provide reassurances on any of its planned data protection reforms. “Since taking office, the science secretary has met EU commissioner Reynders twice to discuss the upcoming EU personal data adequacy review of the UK, and how to ensure secure continuity of personal data flows from the EU to the UK,” said a DSIT spokesperson in response to Computer Weekly’s request for comment on the EAC’s letter. “Our officials will join technical discussions with EU counterparts where required to support the review process.” The EAC’s letter noted although much of the evidence provided to its inquiry focused on the previous government’s Data Protection and Digital Information Bill (DPDI Bill) – which was dropped from the legislative agenda during the pre-general election “wash up” period – the new government’s planned Digital Information and Smart Data (DISD) Bill covers some of the same issues. The DISD was introduced to Parliament as the Data Use and Access (DUA) bill on 23 October 2024. Once passed, the DUA will therefore amend the UK’s implementation of both the GDPR and LED. While the EC’s adequacy decision will rest on the exact contents of DISD Bill (which was only published online on 24 October), it will be looking to assess whether the framework provides an essentially equivalent level of data protection for EU citizens’ data. This follows the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) striking down the EU-US Privacy Shield data-sharing agreement on 16 July 2020 for failing to ensure that European citizens had adequate rights of redress when data can be collected by the US National Security Agency (NSA) and other US intelligence services. The ruling – colloquially known as Schrems II after the Austrian lawyer who took the case to the CJEU – found that people must be given “essentially equivalent protection” for their data when it is transferred to the US and other countries as they would receive in the EU under the GDPR and the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, which guarantees people the right for private communications and the protection of their private data. “The UK’s current GDPR regime is far from perfect. But the consequences of not reaching agreement with the EU are extremely harmful,” said Lord Ricketts. “There is clearly scope to reform and improve GDPR as part of the government’s new Digital Information and Smart Data Bill. But this must not jeopardise the UK’s adequacy status.” Lord Clement-Jones – a Liberal Democrat peer and spokesman for the digital economy in the House of Lords – added that the EAC’s letter “illustrates only too clearly the fragility of the UK’s data adequacy situation and the importance of resisting significant changes proposed by the last government to the UK GDPR”. Those previously suggested changes to the DPDI bill before it was dropped included removing the need to conduct data protection impact assessments and to have a data protection officer, loosening requirements around automated processing, and giving the secretary of state the power to directly appoint the information commissioner. In terms of the direct risks to data adequacy, the EAC said the UK faces “two distinct potential hurdles”, one being the EC’s renewal decision, and the potential of a legal case being brought against a positive renewal decision at the CJEU. It added that while the EC itself is likely to want to renew the UK’s adequacy status due to a range of factors – including the economic benefits it would bring the bloc, the fact the UK is using already GDPR as a starting point, and the EC’s own political and strategic imperatives – it was more likely the UK would lose adequacy as a result of a legal challenge being brought to the CJEU. “There was a large measure of consensus among our witnesses that, of the European Commission and the CJEU, the latter is the greater risk to the continuation of the UK’s adequacy status. For example, the not-for-profit technology organisation Reset called the CJEU ‘the more exacting forum of the two’ and said that the court ‘has in recent years consistently taken a more absolute line than the European Commission (and most of the Member States) in defence of fundamental privacy rights’,” it said. “Several witnesses pointed out that, in its two Schrems rulings, the CJEU had struck down previous EU adequacy arrangements with a partner as important as the United States. (The key issue in the strike-down was the risk of disproportionate access – and the nature of oversight of the access – by US national security and law enforcement agencies to personal data held by private entities, and the risk of this including transferred data from the EU.)” It added that several witnesses said that if the UK were to lose adequacy status, “they would expect the UK and European Commission to implement one or several immediate ‘workarounds’, to avoid the cliff-edge scenario and buy time in which to take steps that would see adequacy restored”. Suggested alternatives to data adequacy include the use of multilateral agreements and legal mechanisms such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) or Binding Corporate Rules (BCR). However, doubt was cast on validity of the SCC route by Schrems II, which found although these were legally valid, companies still had a responsibility to ensure that those they shared the data with granted privacy protections equivalent to those contained in EU law. According to Owen Sayers – an independent security consultant and enterprise architect with more than 25 years of experience in delivering secure solutions to policing – there is a risk the EAC has collapsed the distinction between GDPR and LED adequacy by too closely aligning them in form, function and nature, when they are “structurally veery different” to one another. “Under GDPR you can quite simply transfer data if you have adequacy,” he said. “Under LED, it is very hard, and for some specific organisations is virtually impossible, to transfer data unless you have adequacy. “These sound quite similar conditions, but they’re poles apart – ‘you can do if’ is intrinsically permissive in nature; whereas ‘you cannot do unless’ is a barrier control. Even if you do have LED adequacy, you are then restricted as to who in your target country you wish to send that data to.” The EAC added there are a range of issues that would be of “interest and potential concern” to both the EC and CJEU as they consider the UK’s adequacy statuses. This includes potential divergence on data protection standards that would make it harder for people to exercise their data rights; the possibility that the UK government undermines end-to-end encryption; the independence and effectiveness of the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO); aspects of the UK’s national security regime under the Investigatory Powers Act 2016, including data collection and retention, surveillance powers and practices, and the role of the Investigatory Powers Tribunal; and any legal cases which provide grounds for concern about UK data protection standards. The EAC also highlighted potential risks posed by onward transfers of data from the UK to other third countries, including under the UK-US Cloud Agreement. “All this means that government and public services generally need to take a hard look at their governance of data and AI deployment ahead of their ambitious plans for tech adoption in the public sector,” Clement-Jones told Computer Weekly. While the EAC itself did not assess the impacts on adequacy of IT systems already procured and in-use, the growing use of US-based public cloud services by UK police and the wider criminal justice sector has previously been cited to Computer Weekly as a potentially huge problem for the UK’s ability to obtain LED adequacy, primarily due to the potential for remote access to that data and its onward transfer to a non-adequate jurisdiction. Since Computer Weekly revealed in December 2020 that dozens of UK police forces were processing more than a million people’s data unlawfully in Microsoft 365, data protection experts and police tech regulators have questioned various aspects of how hyperscale public cloud infrastructure has been deployed by UK policing, arguing that they are currently unable to comply with strict law enforcement-specific rules laid out in the DPA. At the start of April 2023, Computer Weekly then revealed the Scottish government’s Digital Evidence Sharing Capability (DESC) service – contracted to body-worn video provider Axon for delivery and hosted on Microsoft Azure – was being piloted by Police Scotland despite a police watchdog raising concerns about how the use of Azure “would not be legal”. Specifically, the police watchdog said that there were a number of other unresolved high risks to data subjects, such as US government access via the Cloud Act, which effectively gives the US government access to any data, stored anywhere, by US corporations in the cloud; Microsoft’s use of generic, rather than specific, contracts; and Axon’s inability to comply with contractual clauses around data sovereignty. Computer Weekly also revealed that Microsoft, Axon and the ICO were all aware of these issues before processing in DESC began. The risks identified extend to every public cloud system used for a law enforcement purpose in the UK, as they are governed by the same data protection rules. In June 2024, Computer Weekly then reported details of discussions between Microsoft and the Scottish Police Authority (SPA), in which the tech giant admitted it cannot guarantee the sovereignty of UK policing data hosted on its hyperscale public cloud infrastructure. Specifically, it showed that data hosted in Microsoft infrastructure is routinely transferred and processed overseas; that the data processing agreement in place for DESC did not cover UK-specific data protection requirements; and that while the company claimed it has the ability to make technical changes to ensure data protection compliance, it is only prepared to make these changes for DESC partners and not other policing bodies because “no one else had asked”. The documents also contain acknowledgements from Microsoft that international data transfers are inherent to its public cloud architecture, and that limiting transfers based on individual approvals by a Police Force – as required under DPA Part 3 – “cannot be operationalised”. Although the ICO released its police cloud guidance in the same set of FOI disclosures – which highlights some potential data transfer mechanisms it thinks can clear up ongoing legal issues – data protection experts questioned the viability of the suggested routes on the basis the mechanisms are rooted in the GDPR rather than the law enforcement-specific rules contained in Part 3, and that is it not clear if they can in fact prevent US government access. Computer Weekly contacted the Home Office about the how data protection issues with existing systems that have already been procured and deployed could affect LED adequacy, but received no response by time of publication. Commenting on the issue of police data protection and sovereignty, Clement-Jones said: “The revelation of police forces’ failure to observe the requirements of Part Three raises real issues for ongoing adequacy, but also for any trust in the governance around the way technologies such as live facial recognition are deployed.” According to Sayers, even if the mechanisms suggested by the ICO could prevent US government access, the transfers would be unlawful anyway as UK law lays down a series of specific steps that must be followed for each and every transfer of a specific piece of personal data under Part 3. “These steps are not being followed, and Microsoft have made clear that they cannot be followed (actually, they said ‘impossible to operationalise’). Because the steps laid down in the DPA 2018 Part 3 are not and cannot be followed, that is one of the main reasons why the processing done on these clouds is in breach of UK law,” he said. “It makes zero difference at all if the US government bogeyman tries to use Cloud Act to look at the data, as the data was illegally transferred regardless of cloud act.” Sayers added that the EAC principally looked at what UK law says in relation to LED and what the impacts of this are, but missed a “huge area of consideration” in whether the UK actually adheres to its own data protection laws in practice. “That is where the policing stuff becomes interesting, because if the EU examine the UK's operating track record of compliance with their own domestic version of LED (Part Three), then it’s clear that they absolutely do not comply with it to any real measure,” he said. “To be adequate, the EU might simply look at the legislation in force; but I think they also need to consider the available evidence of UK behaviour (and if they do that the picture is far from rosy). “The reason they need to consider the latter is that presently if an EU citizens data is sent to a UK law enforcement body, it is almost certainly going to be processed in contravention of UK DP laws. That means it’s certainly being processed in contravention of EU LED-based laws.”

Title: MicroStrategy Touches New Highs as Trading Volume Relative to Nvidia Surges

Election 2024 coverage presented by Disclosure: The author of this story owns shares in MicroStrategy (MSTR). Bitcoin (BTC)-holder MicroStrategy’s (MSTR) soaring stock is driving up trading volumes relative to AI-proxy Nvidia (NVDA), one of the biggest companies by market cap, reflecting heightened investor enthusiasm. MSTR has surged over 240% this year, with prices doubling to $236 in the past five weeks alone, according to data source TradingView. That’s the highest level for the stock since the dotcom bubble 25 years ago. The rally has MSTR closing in on a market cap of $50 billion, barely 1.5% of NVDA’s $3.44 trillion. However, MSTR’s trading volume, as a percentage against NVDA, has continued to climb this year, reaching a high of 17.65% this month. According to Investing.com data, this milestone occurred on Oct. 11, as MicroStrategy saw 30 million trading volume, while NVIDIA had 170 million. That’s a significant improvement since the bull market of 2021. Back then, MSTR peaked over $130 on Feb. 9 with a volume of 23.2 million, equating to just 8% of NVDA that day. An increase in trading volumes alongside a price rally may confirm the stock's uptrend. That said, a continued surge in volume relative to NVDA might be telling of a build up of a speculative froth in the market. With a year-to-date gain of over 240%, MSTR has outperformed NVDA’s 192% surge by a big margin. Since MSTR adopted bitcoin as a treasury asset in August 2020, the gap has grown even bigger, with MSTR up 1,800% versus NVDA’s 1,150%, that’s probably the best evidence of MicroStrategy and its CEO Michael Saylor’s success. MicroStrategy’s net asset value (NAV), which is is calculated by dividing MSTR's market capitalization by the value of its bitcoin stack, continues to expand once again, with bitcoin still trending in the mid $60,000 range. According to the MSTR tracker, the NAV premium currently sits at almost 3, the highest level since early 2021. Edited by Parikshit Mishra.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / OCTOBER 25 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood.

Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love.

In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / OCTOBER 25 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture.

Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce.

Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas.

Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems.

Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell.

At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations.

It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis.

Title: Buy, Sell, Or Hold Nvidia Stock?

Time Published: 2024-10-25T10:28:11Z
Full Content:
CEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, speaks during the launch of the supercomputer Gefion at Vilhelm ... [+] Lauritzen Terminal in Kastrup, Denmark, on October 23, 2024. (Photo by Mads Claus Rasmussen / Ritzau Scanpix / AFP) / Denmark OUT (Photo by MADS CLAUS RASMUSSEN/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images) Nvidia stock alone has created more value in the last three years than the combined market cap of 250 companies in the S&P 500. Talk about the 1% — specifically, $3 trillion! But everyone knows that. The bigger question is: what’s next? Should you buy, sell, or hold Nvidia at this point? In our recent analyses, we argued for a range of outcomes: Nvidia’s road to $300 and the counterpoint Nvidia’s downside to $40. Intuitive Surgical is No Dud Either — Here’s Path to 10x NVDA stock swelled over 10x from levels of $13 in early January 2021 to around $140 now, vs. an increase of about 50% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 4-year period. It was a bumpy ride, with returns for the stock being 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, and 239% in 2023. The underperformance in NVDA’s stock vs. the S&P 500 in 2022 stands out in particular – as the benchmark index had returns of -19% that year. Notably, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Now, below are the facts, and a concrete view of how you might want to think of Nvidia in your portfolio. Answer: Add Nvidia to your portfolio in the amount such that while you sit envisioning a 5x gain in the long term, you’re also willing to stomach 50% loss at any time during the ride. Yep, be willing to bear short-term pain - the price you’ll pay - to be rewarded in the long run. This sounds simple in theory but is never easy to live by in practice. Below are more specifics on the pros and cons. Here’s the thing, competition is heating up. AMD isn’t sitting idle - the company has doubled down on AI-focused GPUs and claims its new Instinct MI300X chip outperforms Nvidia’s in several areas. Intel is also emerging as a competitor, gaining traction with value-priced AI chips. Moreover, big tech players like Google - one of Nvidia’s biggest customers - are developing their own AI and machine learning silicon. With these rivals, the rapid growth in Nvidia’s revenues and the unusually high levels of Nvidia’s cash-flow margins (over 50% in recent quarters) may not be sustainable. The underlying economics of the AI GPU market remain weak, with most of Nvidia’s customers still unprofitable. Why is that? Large language models are expensive to build and train and the payoff can take a long time. VC firm Sequoia estimates that the AI industry spent $50 billion on Nvidia chips last year, possibly exceeding $100 billion when including other costs. Yet, these investments have only generated about $3 billion in revenue, with few services besides ChatGPT gaining large, paying user bases. We may well be in an AI “FOMO phase,” where companies feel compelled to invest in AI simply because their competitors are. As shareholders seek better returns, capital spending may cool off, impacting companies like Nvidia. Separately, large AI deployments follow two stages. The first is the compute-intensive training phase, during which AI models are built from large datasets with GPUs being used to process data and adjust the model’s parameters. The second stage is the deployment phase, where trained models run in real-world applications and typically require lower processing power, allowing companies to use less expensive hardware to run models for daily tasks. As the AI revolution began just about two years ago, most companies are in the training phase and there is a possibility that demand could ease off as we move towards lower power inferencing. Nvidia has had a head start in the AI market. And it has the foresight to not let its early mover advantage slip away. The company has built a comprehensive ecosystem around its AI processors, including programming languages and software, which can lock customers into its products as they scale up their AI investments. Nvidia’s extensive software stack - including CUDA, cuDNN, and TensorRT - not only enhances performance but also simplifies AI development, making it increasingly difficult and costly for companies to switch to alternative platforms. Look at it this way. As companies deploy their AI bets they will be spending time and resources on training, tuning their AI models, and integrating these tools into their broader IT systems and workflows. This makes it more difficult and costly to shift to competitors. The ecosystem could help to protect Nvidia’s margins, with software-related sales also likely expanding in the long run. While the initial AI models deployed by the likes of OpenAI in 2022 were largely text-based, models are increasingly multimodal meaning that they work with speech, images, video, and 3D content - calling for higher computing power and a larger number of GPU shipments. Moreover, unlike a decade or so ago when advancements in computing power - particularly with processors - outpaced the development software that could fully utilize these capabilities, in the AI era, the demand for computing power has skyrocketed due to the intense computational requirements of machine learning models. This trend could result in sustained strong demand for Nvidia. The shift in U.S. monetary policy could also give Nvidia an extra lift. The Fed’s 50 basis point cut - the first in nearly four years - brings the federal funds rate to 4.75%-5%, with room for further reductions. Lower rates boost growth sectors like tech by increasing the present value of future earnings. The rate cuts are particularly beneficial to Nvidia. Why? Lower interest rates would reduce financing costs for builders of large data centers, potentially driving up capital spending in the space, and helping players like Nvidia which sells GPUs for servers. Moreover, the economics of the AI revolution remain mixed, given the high costs of model training and inferencing. A drop in interest rates could improve the financial feasibility of these investments. Check out our analysis of other ways to profit from the Fed’s next move?

Title: Morning Bid: Megacap earnings loom, Japan decides, gilts wobble

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan Tesla's 20%-plus stock surge whets investor appetites for next week's earnings from most of the rest of the "Magnificent 7" of U.S. megacaps - with overseas markets keeping close tabs on weekend elections in Japan and next week's UK budget. A relatively quiet end to a busy week sees market attention drift to numerous big events coming down the pike, not least the U.S. election in 11 days time. But the related edginess in the Treasury market earlier this week seems to have settled for now and the White House race remains far too close to call. Relatively upbeat economic numbers on business activity, jobless claims and housing did little to disturb the slightly calmer bond waters - especially as business price pressures appear to have eased further and oil prices retreated again. Ten-year yields hovered on 4.2% early on Friday, with the Federal Reserve's cyclical rate trough now seen as high 3.5% - close to Fed policymakers' highest estimates of the so-called 'neutral' long-term policy rate. The dollar index also held the line with Treasuries. For stocks, all the action was in earnings - with Tesla shares clocking their biggest single-day gain in over a decade as CEO Elon Musk's forecast of surging sales reassured investors he was still focussed on a core electric car business. The stock spike puts Tesla shares back in the black for the year to date and now tilts the market to updates from the other six megacaps next week - starting with Alphabet's quarterlies on Tuesday, Microsoft and Meta on Wednesday and Amazon and Apple on Thursday. Overall, the S&P500 ended three days of losses and closed marginally higher on Thursday, with futures up further ahead of Friday open. Japan's yen nudged lower through 152 per dollar as Sunday's election results and Wednesday's Bank of Japan policy decision were awaited, with data showing Tokyo inflation ebbing this month against a backdrop of fresh government warnings about excessive currency moves. For some investors, the risk of Japan ending up with a minority coalition government after the weekend poll raises some concerns that the BOJ could face complications in its quest to gradually normalise its super-easy interest rates. Several recent polls have increased speculation the ruling coalition could lose its majority in parliament, which could cost new premier Shigeru Ishiba his job or force his Liberal Democratic Party to look for another coalition partner to stay in power. And such a prospect may deprive the BOJ of the consensus support needed to push ahead with raising rates, some reckon. Britain provided the other big focus of the weekahead, with reports of significantly higher borrowing to fund a public investment push unnerving UK government bonds on Thursday. Finance minister Rachel Reeves said that next Wednesday she will announce a change to the measure of public debt that the government targets over a five year period in order to allow billions of pounds of more borrowing for investment. Economists estimate that had this measure been in place in March, it would have created scope for more than 50 billion pounds ($65 billion) of extra borrowing, equivalent to about 1.5% of Britain's annual economic output. In stark contrast to the retreat in U.S. yields on Thursday, the British bond market juddered at the prospect of higher borrowing tallies - with 10-year gilt yields hitting their highest in almost four months and the five-year yield premium over Germany reaching its highest this year. The pound has held steady to firmer, however, showing no wider disturbance to investor confidence. Elsewhere, most stock markets in Europe and Asia were higher on Friday - with Japan's Nikkei the underperformer. Above-forecast German business confidence readings from Ifo eased some of the gloom about Europe's biggest economy - but there are persistent concerns about the country's mammoth auto sector as trade tensions with China build. German automaker Mercedes-Benz fell 3.7% after third-quarter earnings in its core car division massively missed estimates, while France's Valeo shed 7.5% as the automotive supplier cut its annual sales guidance for the second time this year. Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Friday: * US September durable goods orders, University of Michigan October consumer survey; Canada Sept house prices, August retail sales and government budget balance * US corporate earnings: Aon, Colgate-Palmolive, Centene, HCA Healthcare * International Monetary Fund and World Bank Annual Meetings in Washington, speakers include German Finance Minister Christian Lindner, Budesbank President Joachim Nagel and Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem * Boston Federal Reserve Bank of President Susan Collins speaks (By Mike Dolan,; mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com) Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: NUKZ: Brand-New Nuclear Energy ETF is one of 2024’s Hottest ETFs
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nukz-brand-nuclear-energy-etf-064518698.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The brand new Range Nuclear Renaissance ETF (NUKZ) is one of the hottest ETFs of 2024, gaining nearly 70% since its launch in January. And while AI and large-cap tech have gotten most of the limelight from investors this year, NUKZ focuses on a different segment of the market entirely – nuclear energy. That said, NUKZ is still an intriguing way to potentially gain backdoor exposure to the growth of AI, the growing need for data centers, and other big tech themes. I’m bullish on NUKZ due to its impressive performance and its exposure to uranium producers, utilities, and manufacturers that are essential for the potential shift toward nuclear energy. This transition is becoming increasingly urgent as the need for sustainable energy solutions becomes more evident. The NUKZ ETF was launched on January 23, 2024, by Range ETFs. It is still a small fund with $40.7 in assets under management (AUM), but it picked a good time to debut as investor interest in nuclear energy is reaching new heights in 2024. According to Range ETFs, NUKZ “is designed to provide exposure to companies that are involved in the following segments: advanced reactor, utilities, construction & services, and fuel.” Nuclear energy is a clean and efficient form of energy. It produces no greenhouse gases, and it is more efficient and reliable than solar or wind energy. The U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Nuclear Energy finds that the typical nuclear plant has a capacity factor of 92.5%, meaning it is working at full capacity 92.5% of the time, versus just 35.4% for wind and a paltry 24.9% for solar. Nuclear energy is a baseload energy source that is more reliable than solar and wind. Consulting firm McKinsey forecasts that electricity demand will triple by 2050, so there is clearly a need for the efficient and clean baseload energy that nuclear can provide. Plus, with so much demand likely to come online, there is room for multiple winners as nuclear, solar, wind, and natural gas will all be needed, so this isn’t a zero-sum game. The AI revolution is also putting a finer point on this growing demand for power. More data centers are being built to house the computing power that hyperscalers need to power their AI solutions, and nuclear energy can play a key role in providing them with clean energy. Already, we’ve seen mega-cap tech companies commit to and invest in nuclear energy. Amazon recently announced its support for several new nuclear projects in Washington and Virginia, including the construction of new Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), an exciting new breed of nuclear reactor with a smaller physical footprint and shorter lead time. Also, Alphabet (GOOG) announced it will buy nuclear power produced by SMRs that will be developed by a company called Kairos Power. Meanwhile, Microsoft (MSFT) struck a deal with major power company Constellation Energy (CEG) to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear plant. NUKZ owns 39 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 53.4% of its assets. Below, you’ll find an overview of NUKZ’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool. The fund’s largest holding is Cameco (CCO), the world’s largest uranium producer. Beyond Cameco, NUKZ also owns utilities like Constellation Energy, which maintains the largest fleet of nuclear power plants in the United States with 21 nuclear reactors. The fund also owns NuScale Power (SMR), which makes the types of small module reactors discussed above. There’s also a place for Industrials, like GE Vernova (GEV) and Honeywell (HON) within the NUKZ ETF. GE Vernova manufactures nuclear turbine islands used by nuclear plants, while Honeywell operates a uranium conversion facility that makes a component needed for the enriched nuclear fuel utilized by nuclear reactors. One word of caution is that as a new ETF with relatively low assets under management, NUKZ is an expensive ETF, charging a fee of 0.85%. This means that an investor allocating $10,000 into the fund will pay $85 in fees on an annual basis. This is considerably more expensive than the fees many investors are used to seeing with broad-market index ETFs, and well above the average expense ratio for all ETFs (0.52%). If the ETF continues to perform well over the long term, the high expense ratio won’t trouble many holders, but it is something for investors to keep in mind, especially if the ETF’s performance begins to lag. Aside from the high expense ratio, other risks to this investment include the fact that it is a new ETF without a long-term track record, and a very small one at that, so it could prove volatile. Stocks in this space have already had quite a run in 2024, so there could be volatility to the downside. However, overall, I believe this is still a good long-term investment, as we are still in the early stages of the nuclear story. Turning to Wall Street, NUKZ earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 27 Buys, 11 Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average NUKZ stock price target of $42.38 implies about 2.0% upside potential from current levels. I’m bullish on NUKZ due to the increasing demand for clean and efficient baseload energy as electricity consumption rises. The recent embrace of nuclear energy by major tech firms like Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft underscores its importance in powering data centers and is attracting new investor interest in these stocks. Moreover, we are still in the early stages of the transition to nuclear energy. While NUKZ has performed well in 2024, there is likely significant upside potential ahead, though volatility is expected along the way. Additionally, NUKZ provides a solid way to gain broad exposure to the nuclear energy sector, investing in uranium producers like Cameco, utilities such as Constellation Energy, and reactor manufacturers like NuScale.

Title: NUKZ: Brand-New Nuclear Energy ETF is one of 2024’s Hottest ETFs

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The brand new Range Nuclear Renaissance ETF (NUKZ) is one of the hottest ETFs of 2024, gaining nearly 70% since its launch in January. And while AI and large-cap tech have gotten most of the limelight from investors this year, NUKZ focuses on a different segment of the market entirely – nuclear energy. That said, NUKZ is still an intriguing way to potentially gain backdoor exposure to the growth of AI, the growing need for data centers, and other big tech themes. I’m bullish on NUKZ due to its impressive performance and its exposure to uranium producers, utilities, and manufacturers that are essential for the potential shift toward nuclear energy. This transition is becoming increasingly urgent as the need for sustainable energy solutions becomes more evident. The NUKZ ETF was launched on January 23, 2024, by Range ETFs. It is still a small fund with $40.7 in assets under management (AUM), but it picked a good time to debut as investor interest in nuclear energy is reaching new heights in 2024. According to Range ETFs, NUKZ “is designed to provide exposure to companies that are involved in the following segments: advanced reactor, utilities, construction & services, and fuel.” Nuclear energy is a clean and efficient form of energy. It produces no greenhouse gases, and it is more efficient and reliable than solar or wind energy. The U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Nuclear Energy finds that the typical nuclear plant has a capacity factor of 92.5%, meaning it is working at full capacity 92.5% of the time, versus just 35.4% for wind and a paltry 24.9% for solar. Nuclear energy is a baseload energy source that is more reliable than solar and wind. Consulting firm McKinsey forecasts that electricity demand will triple by 2050, so there is clearly a need for the efficient and clean baseload energy that nuclear can provide. Plus, with so much demand likely to come online, there is room for multiple winners as nuclear, solar, wind, and natural gas will all be needed, so this isn’t a zero-sum game. The AI revolution is also putting a finer point on this growing demand for power. More data centers are being built to house the computing power that hyperscalers need to power their AI solutions, and nuclear energy can play a key role in providing them with clean energy. Already, we’ve seen mega-cap tech companies commit to and invest in nuclear energy. Amazon recently announced its support for several new nuclear projects in Washington and Virginia, including the construction of new Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), an exciting new breed of nuclear reactor with a smaller physical footprint and shorter lead time. Also, Alphabet (GOOG) announced it will buy nuclear power produced by SMRs that will be developed by a company called Kairos Power. Meanwhile, Microsoft (MSFT) struck a deal with major power company Constellation Energy (CEG) to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear plant. NUKZ owns 39 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 53.4% of its assets. Below, you’ll find an overview of NUKZ’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool. The fund’s largest holding is Cameco (CCO), the world’s largest uranium producer. Beyond Cameco, NUKZ also owns utilities like Constellation Energy, which maintains the largest fleet of nuclear power plants in the United States with 21 nuclear reactors. The fund also owns NuScale Power (SMR), which makes the types of small module reactors discussed above. There’s also a place for Industrials, like GE Vernova (GEV) and Honeywell (HON) within the NUKZ ETF. GE Vernova manufactures nuclear turbine islands used by nuclear plants, while Honeywell operates a uranium conversion facility that makes a component needed for the enriched nuclear fuel utilized by nuclear reactors. One word of caution is that as a new ETF with relatively low assets under management, NUKZ is an expensive ETF, charging a fee of 0.85%. This means that an investor allocating $10,000 into the fund will pay $85 in fees on an annual basis. This is considerably more expensive than the fees many investors are used to seeing with broad-market index ETFs, and well above the average expense ratio for all ETFs (0.52%). If the ETF continues to perform well over the long term, the high expense ratio won’t trouble many holders, but it is something for investors to keep in mind, especially if the ETF’s performance begins to lag. Aside from the high expense ratio, other risks to this investment include the fact that it is a new ETF without a long-term track record, and a very small one at that, so it could prove volatile. Stocks in this space have already had quite a run in 2024, so there could be volatility to the downside. However, overall, I believe this is still a good long-term investment, as we are still in the early stages of the nuclear story. Turning to Wall Street, NUKZ earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 27 Buys, 11 Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average NUKZ stock price target of $42.38 implies about 2.0% upside potential from current levels. I’m bullish on NUKZ due to the increasing demand for clean and efficient baseload energy as electricity consumption rises. The recent embrace of nuclear energy by major tech firms like Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft underscores its importance in powering data centers and is attracting new investor interest in these stocks. Moreover, we are still in the early stages of the transition to nuclear energy. While NUKZ has performed well in 2024, there is likely significant upside potential ahead, though volatility is expected along the way. Additionally, NUKZ provides a solid way to gain broad exposure to the nuclear energy sector, investing in uranium producers like Cameco, utilities such as Constellation Energy, and reactor manufacturers like NuScale.

Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research, MOFSL Gold prices steadied but were headed for a weekly gain, driven by safe-haven demand due to escalating geopolitical concerns. Israel’s military said yesterday it killed a Hamas commander who took part in the Oct. 7, 2023, assault on southern Israel and also worked for the U.N. aid agency in the Gaza Strip. Uncertainty is also high ahead of U.S. Election Day on Nov. 5, with polls showing a tight race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. New applications for U.S. unemployment aid unexpectedly fell last week, but the number of people collecting benefits in mid-October was the highest in nearly three years, indicating it was becoming harder for those losing jobs to land new positions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has called jobs the most pressing global issue. She has also urged the World Bank to collaborate with countries to identify high-priority skilling sectors that generate employment. She was making intervention at the plenary lunch during the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank while speaking on the topic ‘How Should the World Bank Shape Its Future Strategic Direction and Help Clients Create More Jobs to Keep Pace with Evolving Megatrends.’” She emphasised that jobs are the most pressing global issue, given the continued economic headwinds and rapid technological change that are redefining the skills required for youth to enter the job market,” a social media post of Finance Ministry quoting Sitharaman said. Trading in Gift Nifty indicates a flat opening on Friday and another dull day for domestic markets. Amid mixed global cues, domestic benchmarks are expected to remain range-bound while action will be on the broader markets, said analysts. Stock-specific action will continue based on Q2-FY25 performance, they added. Dr Lal Pathlabs’ (DLPL) Q2-FY25 margins expanded by 110bps y-o-y on the back of improving contribution from Swasthfit and better margin performance at Suburban (about 600 bps q-o-q). Sample volume growth (+8.6 per cent y-o-y), however, remained soft owing to lower incidence of monsoon-related illnesses (except West region) and a higher base. Broadly, TVS Motor has reported bottom-line in line with estimates in Q2FY25 led by of sustenance of EBITDA margin at above 11 per cent level. Revenues increased by 13.3 per cent y-o-y to ₹9,228 crore (Vs estimate of ₹9,538 crore) on the back of 14.3 per cent y-o-y increase in volumes as ASPs declined by 0.9 per cent y-o-y. Coforge (₹7,699): The stock bounced off the 50-day moving average (DMA) this week and broke out of the resistance at ₹7,500. But note that ₹7,700 is a potential resistance. We retain our BUY rating and TP unchanged at Rs1,230 on Krystal Integrated Services (KIS), a rising leader in the Integrated Facilities Management Services (IFMS). The company’s quarterly performance aligns with our estimates and sets a strong foundation for future growth, also supported by new contract wins in H1FY25. These wins, along with Krystal’s expansion into promising verticals like MEP services, robotics, and AI-driven technical solutions, are poised to drive sustainable growth. The strategic partnership with Vishnu Prasad Research Centre to commercialize solid waste management technology further strengthens its competitive edge and coupled with growing demand in the catering business is a perfect recipe for solid growth. With reduced working capital days and a stable revenue mix, Krystal is well-positioned to capitalize on the rising opportunity in the IFMS services. Valued at 16x Sept 26e EPS to arrive at TP of Rs1,230.
