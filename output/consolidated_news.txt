Title: Proposed Minnesota Power sale to BlackRock rouses concern

Sponsored By ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT DULUTH — As a potential sale of Minnesota Power looms, a crowd of concerned citizens gathered at the company’s doorstep Wednesday afternoon to voice their concerns. On Sept. 25, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission is expected to begin weighing whether to approve a $6.2 billion purchase of the Duluth-based utility by BlackRock Global Infrastructure Partners with help from the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. ADVERTISEMENT Jenna Yeakle, a Sierra Club staff member, told crowd members Wednesday: “I’m here with you all today to push back against this story that we have been told by Minnesota Power and their potential buyers that they need to be scooped up by BlackRock in order to achieve a carbon-free energy picture." To the contrary, Yeakle suggested the acquisition “could slow much-needed climate action and actually threaten our democracy.” But the utility would really benefit from some outside support to achieve its reduced-emission goals, according to Jen Cady, vice president of regulatory affairs for Allete Inc., Minnesota Power’s parent company. “The scale of what’s in front of us is really unlike anything the company has had to navigate in the past,” she said. Cady noted that Minnesota Power expects it will need to spend $5 billion in the next five years — a sum greater than it has had to raise in the past 75 years. “And these are the right partners to help us navigate that future,” she said. Cady also pointed out that Minnesota Power will continue to be governed by the state PUC and will need to justify any proposed future rate increases, regardless of its ownership. ADVERTISEMENT But Buddy Robinson, a member of the Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota who addressed the crowd as an individual Minnesota Power ratepayer, advised that the state PUC pay heed to a July 15 recommendation by an administrative law judge suggesting the acquisition should be blocked for not being in the public interest. “The key fact established in the proceedings is that BlackRock and CPP, as private equity companies, intend to increase rates faster than would happen otherwise,” he said. Robinson said this is the same reason large customers, including taconite and paper producers, have also lined up against the sale. He said that the economic power of BlackRock “boggles the mind,” with a portfolio of $11 trillion in assets — greater than the gross domestic product of all nations, except the U.S. and China. Angel Dubrow, another concerned customer and landlord, suggested higher electricity costs could drive up housing costs that are already unaffordable for many residents, especially as BlackRock and its partners seek to recoup a $1.5 billion premium they have offered to purchase Allete, above its market valuation at the time of the deal. But Cady predicted the new ownership would bring greater stability to Allete and its subsidiary, Minnesota Power. She noted that the company already is publicly traded on Wall Street, with its value largely determined by investors making quarter-to-quarter financial decisions. “Infrastructure funds and pension funds are inherently long-term investors,” she said. “They are looking to provide stable returns over a long period of time. And that investor expectation is much more closely aligned with the utility business, where we build big infrastructure that serves customers for decades.” ADVERTISEMENT Over the past 16 months, Cady said Allete has listened and worked to address customers’ concerns, signing an agreement with the Minnesota Department of Commerce that contains about 70 commitments, including a one-year base-rate freeze. Unfortunately, that agreement was signed just before the administrative law judge handed down her recommendation, and Cady suggested a close reading might have changed the outcome. “I don’t think the judge had adequate time to really evaluate all of the components of that settlement before her report was due,” she said, contending that the issues raised were pretty comprehensively covered. Yet, state Sen. Jen McEwen, DFL-Duluth, says her fears have not been allayed. “This proposed sale does affect the entire community,” she said. “The BlackRock Corp. controls trillions of dollars of assets internationally," she said. "So, when they become a 60% majority owner of our electric utility, the financial decisions they’re making — whether they be about business strategy, expansion, compliance with our clean energy laws here in the state of Minnesota, whether they honor union contracts, how they treat their workers, whether they go for a rate increase or how much — all of those decisions are going to also be affected by the forces that are coming down on that corporation from their international interests." McEwen predicted this structure would lead to “an inevitable conflict of interest.” ADVERTISEMENT “It is not always going to be in the financial interests of BlackRock to keep our rates as low as possible, to serve our community the electricity we need,” she said. “That’s not the business they are in. They are in the business of making profit from as many things as possible." ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT

September 03, 2025 20:09 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Sept. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Coinbase Wallet Shows Massive XRP Cuts, What’s Going On?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-massive-xrp-cuts/
Time Published: 2025-09-03T22:00:23Z
Full Content:
Data shows crypto exchange Coinbase has made a surprising shift in its XRP holdings by reducing its stash from more than 780 million XRP to around 200 million in a matter of weeks. According to data from XRPScan, Coinbase’s total XRP holdings have fallen by a massive 69% from its most recent proof of reserve report. Notably, this cutback comes at a time when institutional players like BlackRock are increasingly intertwined with Coinbase’s operations Once the fifth-largest exchange holder of XRP, Coinbase has now slipped to tenth place after reducing its balance from approximately 780.13 million XRP to 199.47 million. This represents a staggering 69% reduction since the second quarter of 2025, with a 57% plunge in just the past month. Such a huge cutback in Coinbase’s XRP holdings within a short period of time can only be attributed to outflows from institutional investors. At the time of writing, Coinbase has 11 cold wallets remaining, each holding 16.5 million XRP tokens. This is a massive fall from early June numbers of 52 cold Coinbase wallets holding a total of 970 million XRP, according to XRPwallets, an XRP commentator account on the social media platform X. Interestingly, XRPwallets also hinted at the possibility of these huge movements being linked to BlackRock. BlackRock is a suspect due to the nature of its recent collaboration with Coinbase. That collaboration, which was announced in early August, was done to allow institutional investors easy access to digital assets directly through Coinbase. Although Bitcoin was initially the focus, the partnership has most likely expanded to XRP due to its growing demand among institutional investors. Right now, all that’s left in Coinbase’s XRP wallets might be mostly XRP held by retail traders. XRPwallets also speculated that other major exchanges, such as Uphold, Binance, and Upbit, could eventually show similar balances, around 200 million XRP each, once Ripple’s distributions move through the system. By their estimates, this would leave about 1 billion XRP across exchanges and another 900 million resting in retail cold wallets. Although the numbers were framed as guesses, they relate to the idea that institutional channels are absorbing XRP, leaving exchanges increasingly as platforms for retail activity. Interestingly, other crypto exchanges like Upbit and Uphold have also seen their XRP holdings fall massively within the same time period as Coinbase. Upbit, for instance, saw its XRP balance fall from 6.03 billion XRP to 5.84 billion XRP. Uphold, on the other hand, saw its XRP balance fall from 1.907 billion XRP to 1.746 billion XRP. XRP is still trading below the $3 resistance level after repeated rejections this month, which has left the crypto’s near-term trajectory in question. Reduced exchange balances often point to decreasing sell pressure, which could help support price stability. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.83, up by 0.8% in the past 24 hours.

Neil Treacy RTÉ Sport Journalist Last year's win against New Zealand took more out of Brittany Hogan than she had ever experienced in her rugby career. If Ireland are to pull off a repeat of last year’s epic win this weekend, she knows it will take even more. It’s not hyperbole. The stats back it up. Hogan made 19 tackles that night in Vancouver, more than any other Irish player, while only Niamh O’Dowd and Aoife Wafer logged more carries. "I always say that when we played New Zealand last year it was the hardest game I've ever played in my life," the Ireland number 8 said ahead of Sunday’s Rugby World Cup Pool C decider against the Black Ferns (2.45pm, live on RTÉ). "We all are all well aware that we're going to have to go to the well at the weekend, so we're fully prepared to have a big shift." The 26-year-old (below) has had to go to the well already in this World Cup. After a player of the match display against Japan, she was named among the replacements for last Sunday’s game against Spain, and was called in after just over 20 minutes when Sam Monaghan departed with a hip issue, but led Ireland with 14 carries despite only playing 56 minutes. The games are only getting tougher, with the defending champions this weekend followed by a quarter-final, and if they win that they’ll be staying in England for two more matches. Hogan insists there’s still plenty of petrol left in the tank. She said: "To be fair, it was a very high ball-in-play game [against Spain]. And Spain had so much possession on pick and goes, you just rack up tackles, you rack up those meters." With 36 caps to her name, the Blackrock and Ulster back row has been one of Scott Bemand’s most trusted forwards since he took charge two years ago, in part down to her ability to move between number 8 and blindside flanker. Wafer is yet to appear at this World Cup, so Hogan has been leaned on heavily across both sides of the ball in the opening two games, leading Ireland’s tackle (34) and carry (26) charts, while her 120 carry metres are the highest of any forward in the squad. "I've been trying to put myself into more of a ball carrying role because that's just the way that my game has developed," she said. "It's become sort of a strength of mine that the team and the coaches like to utilise. "So that comes hand in hand with [Aoife] Wafer, and if I have to latch Wafer, no problem. She's an incredible asset to our team. "Whenever she's gone, if I have to have a couple more carries I will, but we are spreading that across the team pretty well. "[It has been] organic, it just comes with my physical adaptations the past year and my awareness of the game and trying to just put my hand up and say, 'I'm carrying’ and people come around me. "I love carrying the ball. Give it to me any day. I'll do it. No problem." Almost a year on from that thrilling 29-27 win against New Zealand, the memories are still as vivid as ever. "It is going to be like that, essentially like a Croke Park feeling for these girls"@HannahOConnor22 on the unique vibe that will wait Ireland against New Zealand at Brighton's Amex Stadium #RWC2025 📺/🎧 #RTERugby Podcast: https://t.co/DbbgFFNsnf pic.twitter.com/EfLVo77Rut "The scrum in the midfield," Hogan said, when asked for her abiding memory. "And just saying to girls, all of us looking each other in the eyes and saying, ‘Right, New Zealand are going to come for us here, lock in and give it absolutely everything that you can’. "That moment and then Dannah [O’Brien] kicking it off, and just shock and then the changing-room afterwards. "I suppose it kind of kick-started our belief behind the group, behind the girls, behind the coaching staff. "It kick-started the IRFU putting loads more funding, loads more investment into us, everybody was on our train and on our wavelength then. "And I think that just after that New Zealand game, we knew that we could do it internally, but externally I think that just like put a rocket boost behind the team." Twelve months on from providing 2024's biggest shock in rugby, what are the chances they do it again? "We have that belief behind us that we are capable of doing it [again], and we're more than capable of doing it, but we are well aware that New Zealand are a world class outfit and it's going to be an incredibly tough game. "If we come out with the right side of the scoreboard afterwards, great, if we don't, that's fine as well. "But we all have that full belief and confidence that we are going to be able to pack a good performance and hopefully a good show for the crowd. "We know that they are able to show up in these competitions and they always do. I suppose that kind of fear factor wasn't really there [last year]. "We were more underdogs, we kind of had that, well, we've got nothing to lose kind of factor. "We've taken away the element of surprise. So now we just have to work that little bit harder."

Title: Anthropic Rakes in $183B Valuation as It Takes on Musk, Altman

Time Published: 2025-09-03T18:00:51Z
Full Content:
Anthropic, the AI startup behind the Claude family of models, has secured a $13 billion Series F financing at a staggering $183 billion post-money valuation, nearly tripling its worth since March. Anthropic is backed by AmazonÂ and Google-parent Alphabet. The company said that the round was led by ICONIQ Capital and co-led by Fidelity and Lightspeed Venture Partners, with institutional heavyweights such as BlackRock, GIC, Qatar Investment Authority, Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, and Coatue among the backers. âWe are seeing exponential growth in demand across our entire customer base,â Anthropic Chief Financial OfficerÂ Krishna Rao said in a statement. âThis financing demonstrates investorsâ extraordinary confidence in our financial performance and the strength of their collaboration with us to continue fueling our unprecedented growth.â In early 2025, Anthropicâs valuation stood at $61.5 billion following a $3.5 billion Series E round. Since then, the companyâs annualized revenue has surged from $1 billion to over $5 billion, attributed to rapidly growing enterprise adoption of Claude. Claude Code, Anthropicâs developer-focused AI assistant, has become a standout performer, generating more than $500 million in run-rate revenue within just a few months of its May launch. Its usage climbed over tenfold in that time. The company now services over 300,000 business clients, with accounts contributing over $100,000 in annual revenue, increasing nearly sevenfold. Investor enthusiasm remains palpable, pulling in capital from major sovereign wealth funds. The Qatar Investment Authorityâs participation signals growing geopolitical attention on AI infrastructure. Anthropic said it plans to deploy the fresh capital toward three core initiatives: enterprise scaling, AI safety research, and global expansion efforts that reinforce its positioning as a safe and capable alternative to consumer-facing rivals. Anthropicâs skyrocketing valuation underscores how investor appetite for AI overrides the traditional risk calculus. But as a private company far from IPO, questions around future profitability, regulatory scrutiny, and competitive threats, especially from OpenAI, xAI, and others, loom large. Despite the injections of capital and growth signals, the sustainability of ultra-high private valuations in the tech space has come under increasing scrutiny. Anthropic now sits among the most valuable private companies globally and faces pressure to deliver on the lofty expectations that such a valuation implies. OpenAI has secured $8.3 billion in new funding at a $300 billion valuation, part of a broader $40 billion financing drive slated for 2025. The companyâs annual revenue run rates are reported between $12 billion and $13 billion, with projections potentially reaching $20 billion by year-end. OpenAI is also exploring a $500 billion valuation via a secondary share sale for current and former employees, signaling investor enthusiasm for liquidity events. Elon Musk’s AI venture, xAI, merged with his social media company X in an all-stock deal that valued xAI at about $80 billion and X at $33 billion, for a combined enterprise valuation of $113 billion. Earlier, xAI had raised $10 billion in debt and equity financing, underscoring Muskâs aggressive push in AI.

Title: SharpLink makes $174 mln Ethereum gamble: Co-CEO warns of risks

SharpLink Gaming cements its second spot among Ethereum treasuries. Can they maintain this momentum? SharpLink Gaming acquired $174M worth of ETH, strengthening its spot among public treasuries. However, Co-CEO Chalom noted the risk associated with these treasury firms. This year alone, Ethereum [ETH] has seen about eleven U.S. institutions adopt ETH strategies, an honor that was initially reserved for Bitcoin [BTC]. On that note, SharpLink Gaming (SBET) took its total holdings to 837,230 ETH. This followed an announcement that they had acquired another 39,008 ETH, valued at $176.4 million. In total, the company added about 397,923 ETH in the last 30 days, per CoinGecko data. Their total holdings were at $3.66B at press time, about 0.694% of Ethereum’s total supply. SharpLink paid an average price of $3,603 per token since their July switch to a public company focused on ETH. The king of altcoin’s price of $4,366 indicated that they were in profits at press time. The firm’s concentration of Ethereum has risen by about 97% since early June. From the data on SharpLink Gaming, the company had earned 2,318 ETH in staking rewards, with their ETH NAV at $3.68 billion. About 860,369 ETH, valued at $3.7B, were waiting to be staked in September. Source; SharpLink Gaming However, despite the acquisition and strong fundamentals, their stock (SBET) continued to decline. The last 24 hours saw a drop of more than 4.71%, as price traded at $16.98, per Yahoo Finance data. Co-CEO Joseph Chalom said that Ethereum was embraced on Wall Street due to its security and liquidity. The staking component ensures the network remains secure, while its wide application across the crypto space offered liquidity. The former Head of Strategies at BlackRock explained that SharpLink raised $400M from Consensys and other institutions investors to buy ETH. They also raise money through an at-the-market program on a daily basis from new equity investors. The Ethereum is staked and provide yield to make it productive. However, Chalom noted the risk associated with ETH treasury firms in case of a massive market downturn. U.S. firms accounted for about 2.68% of the supply. SharpLink was second in terms of holdings, behind BitMine, which had more than double their amount. BitMine’s total was at 1.867 ETH worth $8.167 billion, which represented about 1.547% of total ETH supply. Coinbase, Bit Digital and ETHZilla wrapped up the top five, respectively. The total held by U.S. firms was at 3.233M valued at $14.15B, a 9.9% rise on the day.

Title: Crystal Dynamics’ and Amazon MGM’s Tomb Raider TV Series Casts Sophie Turner as Lara Croft, Filming Kicks Off in 2026

The Tomb Raider TV series based on Crystal Dynamics' iteration of Lara Croft from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon MGM Studios will officially start filming in 2026, with Sophie Turner confirmed to play Lara Croft, per a report from Variety. This is the same series that was announced in May 2024 with award-winning Phoebe Waller-Bridge signed on as a writer, executive producer, and showrunner for the series, which will also be part of a completely interconnected Tomb Raider universe that Amazon is creating between Crystal Dynamics games, TV series, and films. "I’m so excited to announce the formidable Sophie Turner as our Lara alongside this phenomenal creative team," Waller-Bridge said on signing Turner. "It’s not very often you get to make a show of this scale with a character you grew up loving. Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave, and hilarious as she is. Get your artifacts out… Croft is coming…" For Turner's part, she added that she is "thrilled beyond measure" to be stepping into the role. "She’s such an iconic character, who means so much to so many – and I am giving everything I’ve got. They’re massive shoes to fill, following in the steps of Angelina and Alicia with their powerhouse performances, but with Phoebe at the helm, we (and Lara) are all in very safe hands. I can’t wait for you all to see what we have cooking." It's good to have a positive update on the TV series, but the most recent news out of Crystal Dynamics is much less positive. The studio confirmed layoffs last week, and even though it stipulated that work on the next Tomb Raider game was "unaffected," it's difficult to take statements like that at face value, especially when layoffs impact the morale of everyone at any developer, no matter what team was impacted by them.

Title: Stop Using Brave Browser
URL: https://www.spacebar.news/stop-using-brave-browser/
Time Published: 2025-09-03T17:24:31Z
Full Content:
Seriously. The Brave web browser has carved out a niche over the past few years as an alternative to Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and other mainstream web browsers. Some of that has come from its marketing as a privacy-preserving web browser, and it has also been repeatedly evangelized by cryptocurrency enthusiasts. If someone recommends Brave to you, you should ignore them, because they are wrong. Brave Browser is a mess of a software project, and the company building it is even worse. Brave Software, the company behind the browser of the same name, was founded by Brendan Eich. He's best known as the creator of JavaScript from his days at Netscape Communications, and he was later the co-founder of Mozilla. He remained at Mozilla Foundation and its for-profit segment, Mozilla Corporation, well into the 2000s. In 2014, he was appointed as CEO of Mozilla Corporation, which immediately caused backlash from at least a few people inside Mozilla and many people outside the organization. Why was appointing Eich as CEO so controversial? It's because he donated $1,000 in support of California's Proposition 8 in 2008, which was a proposed amendment to California's state constitution to ban same-sex marriage. Eich wrote a blog post defending himself in 2012, when the donation was initially discovered, where did not apologize and denied the donation made him a bigot: In other words, because he silently donated to causes seeking to strip rights from minority groups instead of directly harassing them, the outrage was unjustified. Okay, Brendan. The appointment was a full-on PR disaster for Mozilla, and as an example of how far-reaching the criticism became, OkCupid started showing a popup to its Firefox visitors about the donations and suggested switching to another browser. Brendan Eich quit after 11 days as CEO. He then went on to create Brave Software and obtain $2.5 million in early funding by late 2015, then another $4.5 million by mid-2016. Here's a bonus fun fact: one of those early investors was Founders Fund, which is operated by billionaire Peter Thiel. He's a regular campaign donor to far-right political candidates, and said in an essay that "I no longer think that freedom and democracy are compatible." He also keeps funding libertarian “seasteading” ships designed to function as independent cities in international waters (think BioShock), all of which have failed miserably. Targeted advertisements can be incredibly damaging to online privacy, because most of them rely on ad networks that purchase or quietly monitor your online behavior to serve personalized ads. That has given ad blockers a dual mandate — they make the web less annoying (at the expense of web revenue), and protect your privacy online. The advertising industry is fighting back with increasingly-complicated detection methods for ad blockers, but as of right now, it’s still a cat-and-mouse battle. From the start, Brave Software had a different idea than just blocking ads outright. The initial version of Brave allowed some advertisements hosted by the site itself (e.g. pre-roll ads on YouTube), and had a long-term goal of building its own advertising network. Here’s what Brendan Eich said in 2016: Brave’s plan was to remove most of the third-party advertisements in a page, create its own ad units based on data collected by the web browser itself, and then split the revenue with publishers. Brave said originally that it was aiming for at least 55% of the money to go to the publisher, with the eventual goal of giving 70% of the revenue to the publisher. The web browser user would also receive a cut. The Newspaper Association of America responded with cease-and-desist letter to Brave Software, calling the ad replacements “blatantly illegal” and insisting it amounted to “republication” of copyrighted content. Brad Flora, who was previously Director of Business Development at Brave, said this never ended up happening: Brave started a 1,000-user trial of its advertising network in 2018. The program rewarded Brave users with Basic Attention Tokens (BAT), based on how long they spent viewing ads and content, which would then be kept in a digital wallet or given to publishers as a sort of tipping system. That system hasn’t significantly changed since then, but some of the ad formats are different now. Brave’s website explains that the ads are served in search results in Brave Search, the New Tab page, the Brave News newsfeed, and notifications. BAT is a cryptocurrency. That means its value is highly volatile, and the initial coin offering (ICO) generated another $35 million for Brave in 2017. Brave users can’t redeem BAT for actual (fiat) money without first transferring it to another cryptocurrency wallet, and publishers/content creators are also paid in BAT. There’s an option for publishers/content creators to automatically convert the tokens earned into real money, but again, the value of BAT changes constantly. Brave’s replacement for ads doesn’t reward users in a meaningful amount (reports in 2021 were around 2-6 BAT per month, which is $0.40-$1.25 on the current exchange rate), and requires publishers and content creators to jump through additional hoops to reclaim lost revenue from ad blockers. If the goal was to create a more fair payment system for content on the web, it has largely failed. It has generated a lot of revenue for Brave, though, so that’s nice. Brave’s BAT was built around the cryptocurrency ecosystem (it’s an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain), which helped it attract users from the crowd of crypto enthusiasts. Brave Software continued to bake in more crypto-adjacent functionality over time, billing itself as the ultimate browser for crypto and web 3.0. A full crypto wallet was added in 2021, replacing the original wallet built around BAT. It supports live and historical market graphs, sending and receiving crypto, managing NFTs, and interacting with decentralized apps (Dapps). The past year has revealed how most of this ecosystem was built on overvalued startups, hype, and outright scams. Here are some of the companies, individuals, and organizations that Brave has worked with in the crypto industry: Brave was also caught up in a privacy scandal in 2020, when it was revealed that the browser was adding affiliate codes to some URLs typed into the address bar. For example, typing in “binance.us” would add Brave’s affiliate link to the end, allowing Brave Software to collect revenue from signups or purchases. An official blog post called that “a mistake,” and the functionality was later turned off. That should have been enough to swear off Brave as a privacy-centric browser forever, considering the entire point of affiliate links is to collect data about the user and traffic source. For example, when you click an Amazon affiliate link in a web article, the publisher can see the exact products you purchase in the timeframe the tracking cookie remains active (which is currently 24 hours). Brave's defenders will point to the revenue sources for other browsers as something similar to Brave's URL replacement experiment. Vivaldi adds sponsored bookmarks on the new tab page, for example. However, I’m not aware of another browser ever rewriting what the user types in the address bar. Ultimately, Brave Browser is the apparatus of an advertising company, a bloated and complicated experience for the average user, and the pet project of the person kicked out of Mozilla for continuing to defend harmful political donations. If you want a privacy-focused web browser, use Firefox or Vivaldi. If you want to support your favorite content creators and publishers, turn on advertisements or support them through the methods they already support (Patreon, Ko-Fi, and so on). Brave Browser is irredeemable, and you should not use it under any circumstances. Tech companies wanted "AI" to represent a bright future. Now it represents every annoyance in our daily lives. Servo was supposed to be Firefox's future. Now it's an independent effort to make a fast and secure web browser engine. FireWire, the Newton PDA, and other technologies from Apple's past are still hiding in macOS. You can download videos and audio as MP3, M4A, OGG, or other audio formats with the yt-dlp command line tool. An inside look at the technology around us.

GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. The TV series is moving ahead and will begin filming in early 2026. By Eddie Makuch on September 3, 2025 at 10:37AM PDT Amazon MGM Studios has announced that Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner will indeed play the role of Lara Croft in an upcoming Tomb Raider series. A previous report said Turner had dropped out and the show itself was "dead." Variety and others confirmed the news today that the Tomb Raider TV series is moving ahead. Additionally, Amazon MGM Studios confirmed that filming will begin in January 2026. As announced previously, Fleabag's Phoebe Waller-Bridge is the creator, writer, and executive producer for the series, with Chad Hodge (Single All the Way, Wayward Pines) joining as co-showrunner and executive producer. Shogun director Jonathan van Tulleken has also come aboard as executive producer and director. Waller-Bridge said in a statement, "Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave, and hilarious as she is. Get your artifacts out ... Croft is coming ..." Before Turner, the actors Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander brought the character Lara Croft to life in film. For her part, Turner said she is "thrilled beyond measure" to play Croft. "They're massive shoes to fill, following in the steps of Angelina and Alicia with their powerhouse performances, but with Phoebe at the helm, we (and Lara) are all in very safe hands. I can't wait for you all to see what we have cooking," she said. The Tomb Raider series for Prime Video was greenlit under the leadership of Amazon MGM Studios boss Jennifer Salke, but Salke exited the company earlier this year amid reports of a power struggle. Salke was said to be personally overseeing the Tomb Raider series. Matthew Belloni of Puck reported in March that the Tomb Raider series went through multiple writers rooms, with "tens of millions" spent on development costs. In addition to producing the TV series, Amazon is publishing the next Tomb Raider game from Crystal Dynamics--the studio recently underwent layoffs after the cancellation of Perfect Dark. At the time, the studio said Tomb Raider was unaffected. This new game was never expected to be connected to the TV series. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Sept. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the September 30, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the Novo Nordisk class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/NVO or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

US stocks are pricier than ever before by some measures, raising fears that the market could be headed for a crash. By John Power The US stock market has been having a stellar run – so much so that many investors fear it is overpriced. Since early 2023, the benchmark S&P 500 has risen more than 60 percent, hitting all-time highs despite headwinds ranging from US President Donald Trump’s tariffs to concerns that artificial intelligence (AI) may be overhyped. For investors, the explosive growth has come at a cost: by some measures, US stocks are pricier than ever before. An investor buying into the S&P 500 last week had to fork over $3.25 for every $1 in revenues generated by its 500 constituent firms, according to GuruFocus, the highest price-to-sales ratio on record. While US stocks look less expensive when compared against forecasts of company profits, the benchmark index is still trading at more than 22 times forward earnings, well above the historical average. In a poll by Bank of America last month, nine out of 10 fund managers surveyed said they viewed US stocks as overvalued. The market’s sky-high valuation has led some analysts to draw comparisons to the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s. Fueled by excitement over the rise of the Internet, shares on the tech-heavy Nasdaq soared about 80 percent before giving up almost all of their gains between 2000 and 2022. “Nobody knows what a stock is really worth because its value is based on future earnings,” said James Angel, an expert on financial markets at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business. “Only God knows what the future holds. Because of this uncertainty, stock prices always have been and always will be very volatile. A small change in the market’s consensus estimate of future performance can lead to a large and sudden change in value.” Even as investors are increasingly expressing qualms about the price of US stocks, they are not staying away. The S&P 500 set five all-time highs in August alone and is up about 10 percent so far this year, putting it on track to comfortably beat its average annual return in 2025. Analysts have offered a range of explanations for the market’s untrammelled ascent, including the remarkable profitability of the “Magnificent Seven” – Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, Meta, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta and Alphabet – and the as yet untapped potential of AI. “Earnings at US companies have held up surprisingly well, and continue to grow,” said Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University. “AI may have driven up the value of a couple of the big tech companies and companies that build AI architecture, but it cannot explain the overall rise in the rest of the market,” Damodaran added. While the market’s heavy reliance on the “Magnificent Seven” has been a source of concern for some investors – they make up about one-third of the S&P 500 – such concentration is not unprecedented. Robert E Wright, lecturer in the Department of Economics at Central Michigan University, said the dynamic of a few companies dominating the market can be found as far back as the late 18th century. “Banks were the most important technology of the time, followed by property insurers,” Wright said. “Later came textile mills and other manufacturers, then railroads and, eventually, automobiles. We cannot get too precise due to differences in the way capitalisation was measured, but the pattern seems the same: innovations leads to success, which leads to investment and more success until commodification. Then innovation in a different field occurs and the cycle begins anew.” More prosaic explanations have been offered for the market’s stellar performance, too, such as the shift away from actively managed mutual funds toward passive index funds in recent decades. The increasing popularity of funds that track the S&P500 and other broad measures of the market means that more people are buying stocks regardless of economic conditions than in the past. But a bigger factor than any economic metric could be human psychology. Stephen Thomas, a professor at Bayes Business School in the UK, said that herd behaviour provides a better explanation for stock market moves than the performance of businesses or the state of the economy. “The only tried and tested investment strategy with both international, cross asset and historical support is ‘momentum,’ ie, what goes up carries on rising until it doesn’t,” Thomas said. “Fund managers can’t afford to get left behind their competitors,” Thomas added. “And these are using momentum either explicitly or quietly. So they are behaving rationally in terms of firm behaviour, and indeed, in terms of our knowledge of investment strategies.” There is no way to accurately predict a stock market crash. But steep falls are a regular feature of the market. Since the end of World War II, the market has dropped 20 percent or more from its peak 15 times. While the market rebounded to its peak within a few years in most of those cases, the worst crashes kept investors in the red for much longer. Investors hit by the double whammy of the dot-com bust and the 2008-09 global financial crisis did not fully recover their losses for nearly 13 years. But if there is one thing that financial experts are practically unanimous on, it is that attempting to time the market is a fool’s errand. “One reason that waiting to see a trend is so dangerous is that some of the best up days in the market follow soon after the worst down days,” Angel said. “The best year in US stock market history was in 1933, at the depth of the Great Depression. The market had gone down so much, that when it became clear that a recovery was under way, the market rallied rapidly.” Burton Malkiel, a professor of economics at Princeton University, said investors who feel they are at the limits of their risk tolerance are better off shifting the balance of their portfolios towards lower-risk assets, such as bonds and holding onto more cash than trying to time the market. “You will invariably get it wrong and in the long run the US will eventually straighten things out,” he said.

Title: The Protocol: Solana Community Approves Alpenglow Upgrade

This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Welcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. I’m Margaux Nijkerk, a reporter at CoinDesk. In this issue: ALPENGLOW APPROVED BY SOLANA COMMUNITY: The Solana community voted overwhelmingly in favor of the long-awaited Alpenglow upgrade, bringing the network one step closer to the most significant technical transformation in its history. According to Solana Status on X, 98.27% of SOL stakers that voted approved the proposal, with only 1.05% voting against and 0.36% abstaining. In total, 52% of the network’s stakers participated in the vote. The upgrade introduces a new consensus protocol designed to dramatically improve transaction finality and network efficiency. At the heart of Alpenglow are two new components, Votor and Rotor, which will replace Solana’s existing systems, Proof-of-History and TowerBFT. Currently, Proof-of-History timestamps transactions to preserve their order without slowing the network, while TowerBFT handles the voting process among validators. Alpenglow will overhaul both systems. Votor will slash transaction finality times from over 12 seconds to around 150 milliseconds, delivering near-instant confirmation for users. Rotor, scheduled for a later rollout, will minimize data transfers between validators, a crucial improvement for high-demand applications such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain-based gaming.With approval secured, Solana is now preparing to implement the upgrade, a milestone expected to unlock greater speed, resilience, and scalability across its ecosystem. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. EF TO SELL 10K ETH OVER NEXT FEW WEEKS: The Ethereum Foundation (EF) shared in a post on X on Tuesday that it plans to sell 10,000 ETH through centralized exchanges over the next several weeks to support work toward research & development, ecosystem grants and related donations. According to CoinMarketCap, the ETH will amount to roughly $43 million at Tuesday’s prices. “Conversions will take place over multiple smaller orders, rather than as a single large transaction,” the EF wrote in the post on X.The news follows the EF’s rollout of a new treasury policy in June that caps annual operational spending (opex) at 15%, establishes a multiyear reserve buffer and sets a gradual pace toward even leaner spending long-term. The foundation sold an additional 10,000 ETH to SharpLink Gaming in July, making the online casino marketing firm the first publicly traded company to buy ETH from a key firm in the network’s ecosystem. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. A CHAT WITH BRUCE LIU ON OP_CAT: Without OP_CAT, Bruce Liu says Bitcoin is as "useful as a jumbo jet without wings" capable of much more than it’s allowed to do, but stuck on the ground while Ethereum and Solana soar. Liu, the founder of OPCAT_Labs, says a single opcode, OP_CAT, could transform bitcoin from static digital gold into programmable money that rivals other layer-1 chains. OP_CAT is a long-disabled opcode in Bitcoin’s code that, if re-enabled, would allow developers to concatenate data in scripts and unlock new possibilities, from vaults and covenants to decentralized exchanges and zero-knowledge proofs. The Bitcoin blockchain, if OP_CAT was re-enabled, would be as programmable as Ethereum or Solana, said Liu. "OP_CAT is not new code. It was never deleted, just commented out and disabled. We are not adding my opcode or somebody else’s. It’s Satoshi’s,” Liu told CoinDesk during an interview on the sidelines of BTC Asia in Hong Kong. — Sam Reynolds Read more. HOLESKY SUNSET IS COMING AFTER FUSAKA UPGRADE: A fresh slate of Ethereum testnets is replacing Holesky, the once-massive staging ground now set for shutdown after two years of service.The wind-down will occur two weeks after the Fusaka upgrade is finalized later this year, at which point client and infrastructure teams will cease providing support. Fusaka is set to make Ethereum rollups cheaper and faster by spreading out the “data storage work” more evenly across validators. Holesky went live in 2023 to stress-test Ethereum’s proof-of-stake machinery at scale. It quickly became the largest public testnet, providing thousands of validators with a platform to trial upgrades before they were deployed on the mainnet. Major milestones, such as the Dencun and Pectra upgrades — which lowered transaction costs and upgraded validator efficiency, among other features — were run through Holesky first. However, cracks began to appear as the network aged. Holesky encountered “inactivity leaks” after Pectra’s activation in early 2025, a term referring to validators going offline in large numbers, which created a significant backlog for those attempting to exit. The result was months-long queues that made it impractical to test the full validator lifecycle. For developers needing fast feedback loops, Holesky had become more of a roadblock than a tool. — Shaurya Malwa Read more.

September 03, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, Sept. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming September 30, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) securities between May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR NOVO NORDISK INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On July 29, 2025, Novo Nordisk cut its previously issued fiscal year 2025 guidance, lowering sales growth from 13-21% to 8-14%, and operating profit from 16-24% to 10-16%. The Company cited lower growth expectations for both Ozempic and Wegovy on the back of a slowdown in market expansion, competition, and the alleged continued use of compounded GLP-1s. On this news, Novo Nordisk’s stock price fell $15.06, or 21.8%, to close at $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, thereby injuring investors. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Novo Nordisk repeatedly ignored and minimized the significance of the personalization exception for GLP-1 compounding, greatly overestimated its ability to capture patients coming off of compounded treatments, and was ultimately ill equipped to capitalize upon the purported significant unmet patient population; and (2) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than September 30, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Title: Google is feeling lucky after avoiding the worst of the proposed penalties in its antitrust case

Hello there! Frustrated by the increase in tipping culture over the last few years? You're not alone. McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said restaurants are "getting the customer to pay" for their workers with tipped wages. In today's big story, a judge ruled on Google's penalties for its online search monopoly. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Google is … feeling lucky? A judge's ruling on Google's penalties for its online search monopoly didn't leave the tech giant unscathed. Still, it largely avoided the severe punishments its prosecutor, the US government, was after. So how was Google punished? -Google can't negotiate exclusive partnerships to be the default search engine. As a reminder, Google paid Apple $20 billion in 2022 alone to be Safari's default engine. -Google needs to share its search index and user-interaction data with competitors. Rivals will now have the benefit of training up their own models with some of the troves of data Google has collected. -Google has to provide syndication services to competitors looking to establish their own search and ads business. However, it can charge them for it. But it could have been a lot worse. -The judge rejected the biggest penalty prosecutors were after: a forced sale of the Chrome browser or Android operating system. -Google can also keep paying partners like Apple for distribution. The deals just can't be exclusive. -It doesn't need to share its highly valuable ads data with anyone. Don't take my word for it, though. As always, the markets are the true judge. Alphabet's stock rose as much as 8% in after-hours trading. The ruling also came with a unique twist. US District Judge Amit Mehta acknowledged that the fast-paced nature of tech, especially the recent rise of generative AI, had to be considered in the decision. In fact, in a roundabout way, rivals like OpenAI might have actually saved Google from facing far worse consequences, writes BI's Charles Rollet. Depending on who you ask, generative AI is already eating into Google's search business. So while Google has a monopoly now, that might not be the case going forward. The rise of chatbots like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude is reshaping the competitive landscape in search. Penalizing Google now could hamstring it at a critical inflection point for tech. A significant gap still exists between a search giant like Google and up-and-coming chatbots. But Mehta acknowledged the AI startups could "end up being game changers." "Unlike the typical case where the court's job is to resolve a dispute based on historic facts, here the court is asked to gaze into a crystal ball and look to the future," Mehta wrote. "Not exactly a judge's forte." 3 things in markets 1. Summer's over. Wall Street is leaving vacation mode and entering a historically weak month for the stock market. That's coupled with a heavy load of economic data that's incoming. Here's what's on investors' radars this week. Meanwhile, investing pros shared four ways they're placing their bets. 2. Tech stocks are having a rough start to the month. The Nasdaq 100 slid as much as 1.9% on the first trading day of September, with heavy hitters like Nvidia and Amazon suffering steep losses. Investors are grappling with three factors heading into September. 3. Hedge funds are on track for a strong year. Large funds, including $68 billion Citadel, saw positive returns in August, people close to the money managers told BI. Multistrategy hedge fund managers outside the big four are continue their strong year as global stock markets are on rise. 3 things in tech 1. Tesla has a long road to launching Full Self-Driving in Europe. The company has teased a rollout of its driver-assist software for nearly a year. But it faces what Elon Musk has called a "layer cake of bureaucracy": European regulators are moving more slowly and have more testing requirements than their US counterparts.2 2. Cold brews, cryochambers, and baths with Paris Hilton. Carter Reum, who co-founded the VC firm M13 with his brother Courtney, is a big fan of intermittent fasting and cooking simple meals. He walked BI through his daily routine, which always ends by taking a bath with Paris Hilton, his wife, for our Power Hours series. 3. The battle of the LLMs. LMArena, a popular website where enthusiasts can evaluate AI models, recently blew up when Nano Banana went viral for churning out impressive images and photo edits. Now, LMArena has over 3 million monthly, according to CTO Wei-Lin Chiang. BI chatted with Chiang about the top AI models people are using, and more. 3 things in business 1. Welcome to real estate's year of cold feet. Homebuyers are backing out of deals just before the finish line at a record rate. Buyers are growing skittish about the rising costs of home ownership, mortgage rates, and the job market. With more houses available and fewer buyers to compete with, current home buyers can afford to be picky — but that leverage won't last forever. 2. MrBeast's new venture: telecommunications. The world's biggest YouTube creator is looking to start a mobile virtual network operator, or MVNO, per a leaked investor deck from early 2025 viewed by BI. MVNOs are a popular business strategy among celebrities like Ryan Reynolds, and the move is part of a larger push from Beast Industries to diversify MrBeast beyond media. 3. Meet Chloe Malle, Vogue's new top editor. The speculation is over: Anna Wintour has named Malle to be the head of the publication's editorial content. The 39-year-old has spent almost her entire career at Vogue, starting in 2011 as a social editor. Here's what we know about her. BlackRock shares the 3 main things it's learned from a wild first half of 2025 in markets. The Business Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York City.

Ondo Finance launched Wednesday its tokenized equity platform dubbed Ondo Global Markets, offering non-U.S. investors access to more than 100 U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on-chain. The tokenized equities, first announced in February, has gone live on Ethereum and are backed by securities held at U.S.-registered broker-dealers, the firm said. The offering includes crypto token versions of Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA) and the QQQ ETF among others. Investors in Asia-Pacific, Europe, Africa and Latin America can mint and redeem shares around the clock during trading days, with access to underlying exchange liquidity. The service is not available for U.S. users. The tokens are designed to move freely between wallets, exchanges and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. The firm has also partnered with BitGo, Ledger, Chainlink and other infrastructure providers to support the rollout. Ondo said it plans to expand the selection to more than 1,000 assets by the end of this year and bring the service to Solana SOL$204.21 and BNB Chain (BNB) with LayerZero-powered interoperability. "We saw stablecoins export the U.S. dollar by bringing it on-chain," said Nathan Allman, founder and CEO of Ondo Finance. "Now, Ondo Global Markets is doing the same thing for U.S. securities." The rollout comes as tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) gains momentum across crypto markets, with projects bringing treasuries, private credit and now equities onto blockchains pursuing broader access and liquidity. A list of trading platforms and exchanges have introduced tokenized equities in the past few months, including by Robinhood, Gemini, Kraken and several other crypto exchanges. Coinbase and eToro also shared plans to offer stock trading in token form. However, some offerings drew backlash over potential issues such as limited shareholder rights and fragmented regulations.

Title: Etherealize Raises $40 Million to Rewire Wall Street’s Infrastructure with Ethereum

September 03, 2025 09:00 ET | Source: Etherealize, Inc. Etherealize, Inc. NEW YORK, Sept. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Etherealize, the company developing products and infrastructure to onboard institutions to Ethereum, has announced the closing of a $40 million funding round led by Electric Capital and Paradigm. This funding is in addition to a grant received from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation in 2024 to kickstart its operations and educate the financial sector about Ethereum. With this latest raise, Etherealize is strengthening its position at the forefront of innovation on Wall Street and as the definitive builder of institutional-grade settlement and privacy infrastructure for tokenized assets. The team will continue driving institutional adoption of Ethereum by developing: "Over the past decade, Ethereum has gone from an experiment to the world's most battle-tested, open financial network. This raise kicks off the ‘Institutional Merge'—upgrading institutional finance to modern, safer, globally accessible rails," said Danny Ryan, cofounder and President of Etherealize. Etherealize's Mission The company remains focused on two priorities: educating the financial sector on Ethereum's value proposition and rewiring Wall Street with Ethereum's programmable, credibly neutral infrastructure.Co-founded by former Wall Street trader Vivek Raman, former member of Ethereum Foundation leadership and research lead Danny Ryan, and Ethereum veterans Grant Hummer and Zach Obront, Etherealize is on a mission to modernize the legacy financial system with Ethereum as its core. "After hundreds of conversations with banks and institutions, one thing is clear: the future of finance will be built on Ethereum," said Vivek Raman, CEO of Etherealize. "This funding allows us to accelerate the development of institutional-grade infrastructure that rewires Wall Street with Ethereum as its invisible backbone.

Posted on 09/03/2025 5:57:02 AM PDT by TigerClaws Four candidates and two reserves from the right-wing AfD political party in Germany have dropped dead within 13 days of each other — just before elections, according to reports. The Alternative for Deutschland candidates were set to appear on ballots in North Rhine-Westphalia on September 14. Officials said no foul play is currently suspected in any of their deaths, the BBC reported. Ralph Lange, 66, Wolfgang Klinger, 71, Stefan Berendes, 59, and Wolfgang Seitz, 59, all kicked the bucket within two weeks of each other, the European Conservative reported. Two reserve candidates also died over the same period. German officials stated that two of the deaths were a result of natural causes, but have not commented on the cause of the others.

Macron and the EUropean Globalists have been killing or trying to assasinate those they don’t like for several years, in addition to massive NGO monies. The US is involved in this at ground level. If the this political party comes to power over the next 8-10 years, Germany will slip from EU membership and rebuild itself; Macron is Mr. Blackrock himself - what we know of them is that they always get what they want. This is a changing of the guard - we can kill the opposition for only so long before their voter base becomes unstable. Germany is in no position to weather internal riots by the German people. 3 posted on 09/03/2025 6:04:55 AM PDT by Jumper [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: TigerClaws one last thing dont throw them all out of windows mix it up a bit 4 posted on 09/03/2025 6:06:40 AM PDT by joshua c [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: TigerClaws Germans doing what Germans do. 5 posted on 09/03/2025 6:06:43 AM PDT by brownsfan (It's going to take real, serious, hard times to wake the American public.)

Germany is in no position to weather internal riots by the German people. 3 posted on 09/03/2025 6:04:55 AM PDT by Jumper [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: TigerClaws one last thing dont throw them all out of windows mix it up a bit 4 posted on 09/03/2025 6:06:40 AM PDT by joshua c [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: TigerClaws Germans doing what Germans do. 5 posted on 09/03/2025 6:06:43 AM PDT by brownsfan (It's going to take real, serious, hard times to wake the American public.)

Title: BlackRock calls out state officials for ‘politicization’ of public pensions

Let ESG Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. After Republican and Democrat state and local finance officials offered dueling views on fiduciary duty, the asset manager said such “politicization of pension fund management” costs retirees. BlackRock’s letter said “the politicization of pension fund management ultimately costs savers and retirees” and that most of the questions raised in the letters ultimately concern the asset manager’s approach to investment stewardship for its clients. In addition to urging BlackRock and 24 other U.S. financial institutions to stop framing climate change and other “deterministic future outcomes as long-term risks,” the Republican state finance officers sought to have the firms refrain from incorporating net-zero climate commitments, natural capital frameworks or the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive into their investment strategies. Democrat state and local finance officials sent their letter to BlackRock and 17 other firms, looking for the firms to reaffirm their commitment to managing long-term climate change, supply chain and governance-related risks. The officials urged the institutions to expand proxy voting opportunities and develop advanced capital oversight tools. “Fiduciary duty is one of our foundational principles — as an asset manager, we always put our clients and their interests first,” Moffat wrote. “We take this duty seriously and are proud to help 35 million Americans save and invest for retirement, including many who reside in your states.” Moffat said in the response letter that many of the firm’s clients “believe that shareholder participation also encourages a healthier capital market system and serves as a foundational element of America’s strong capital markets.” However, she distinguished the firm from activist investors by noting that BlackRock doesn’t file shareholder proposals or issue board nominations, or “act collectively with other shareholders or organizations” to vote shares or rely on outside proxy advisory firms. “Various federal, state, and local regulators monitor BlackRock’s compliance with standards and commitments that require us to refrain from being an activist shareholder,” BlackRock’s Aug. 27 letter said. “We have always complied with these regulations.” This spring, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission renewed BlackRock’s blanket authorization to acquire up to 20% of voting shares in some public utilities, with FERC finding arguments that the asset manager was an activist investor “unpersuasive.” BlackRock’s letter to the state officials noted that the agency upheld that finding in early August after a request for rehearing from consumer advocacy nonprofit Public Citizen. FERC’s Aug. 6 determination ultimately affirmed its reauthorization of BlackRock’s blanket authorization and separately rejected a joint appeal from a coalition of Republican state attorneys general and conservative nonprofit Consumers’ Research as untimely.

Title: Watch for this signal in Nvidia stock to capitalize on spring-loaded gains ahead
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-stock-price-trading-strategy-buy-signal-short-ratio-nvda-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-03T12:40:55Z
Full Content:
It's been a volatile year for shares of Nvidia, with the stock plunging 31% to start the year before rallying 84% since April lows. Sam Pierson, the director of research at S3 Partners, has found a fairly reliable way to capitalize on that volatility. Or rather, a metric to watch within the stock that serves as a signal for outsized gains ahead. It's called the long-to-short ratio, and it's calculated by taking a stock's active long interest and dividing it by short interest. In new research published Tuesday, Pierson found that following notable increases in the ratio, Nvidia's share price has typically surged over the following few months. More specifically, when the ratio climbs to 1.5 standard deviations above its six-month moving average, it's gone up 11% over the following month. That's nearly double the usual average monthly gain of 6%. For the subsequent three-month period, following the signal, Nvidia has returned 28%, versus 19% normally. The stock saw gains 86% of the time in the month following a reading above the 1.5-standard-deviation threshold. When the stock saw rare losses during those periods, it only fell by an average of 1%. These findings led Pierson to call the ratio a "powerful short-to-intermediate-term tool," as it seems to lose its ability to predict returns beyond six months. Here's a chart showing the returns. Periods when the long-to-short ratio is at least at 1.5 are shaded orange. Nvidia's stock returns are shown in the black line. Right now, the measure is below the 1.5 standard-deviation threshold as the ratio of long positions to short positions has fallen in recent weeks to 15.4. The model has continued to be effective so far this year. "In 2025 year-to-date, the LTS extreme signal has remained effective: across 46 threshold days, NVDA delivered an average +7% forward 1M return with a 76% win rate, compared with just +5% on all days, with a 54% win rate," Pierson wrote. He added: "In 2025, periods of Long-to-Short crowding in NVIDIA have coincided with roughly double the baseline 1-month forward return." Nvidia stock has had a rough 10 days after it warned of slowing growth ahead during its quarterly earnings call last week. Since August 26, the stock is down 6.5%. The stock remains a favorite among investors. Brokerage platform Interactive Brokers said Nvidia was the most bought stock over the last five trading days with 234,628 buy orders. "Our customers are certainly a faithful bunch. #1 NVDA brought immense success to many of them, and they are clearly not willing to abandon that name even if some poorly received earnings get in the way," said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, in an email. He continued: "It was not only the most active stock on our platform, displacing #3 PLTR, last week's surprise leader, but also representing just under 1/3 of all the net purchasing activity among the stocks in this table."

September 03, 2025 08:21 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Sept. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), Altimmune, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALT), SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE:SLQT) and Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPPI). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) Class Period: May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2025 According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Novo lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NVO Altimmune, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALT) Class Period: August 10, 2023 to June 25, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 6, 2025 According to the complaint, on June 26, 2025, Altimmune published a press release announcing topline results from the IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial of Pemvidutide in the Treatment of MASH. While defendants had continuously provided inflated expectations ahead of these results, the analysis showed a pointed failure by the Company to achieve statistical significance in its analysis of the fibrosis reduction primary endpoint in its IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial. In particular, while a positive trend in fibrosis improvement was observed, statistical significance was not met due to a higher-than-expected placebo response. When questioned about this concerning miss, defendants answered indifferently, attributing this result to the Phase 2 nature of the trial and stated that Altimmune was hoping for better results following the Phase 3 trial. Following this news, the price of Altimmune’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $7.71 per share on June 25, 2025, Altimmune’s stock price fell to $3.61 per share on June 26, 2025, a decline of 53.2% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Altimmune lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ALT SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE:SLQT) Class Period: September 9, 2020 to May 1, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 10, 2025 On May 1, 2025, at approximately noon eastern standard time, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) filed a False Claims Act complaint against SelectQuote, alleging, “[f]rom 2016 through at least 2021”1 SelectQuote received “tens of millions of dollars” in “illegal kickbacks” from health insurance companies in exchange for steering Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in the insurers’ plans. Further, SelectQuote, in exchange for kickbacks, engaged in a conspiracy with major insurers to illegally discriminate against beneficiaries deemed to be less profitable, including those with disabilities. The DOJ concluded that SelectQuote made materially false claims by stating it offers “unbiased coverage comparisons” when in fact it “repeatedly directed Medicare beneficiaries to the plans offered by insurers that paid them the most money, regardless of the quality or suitability of the insurers’ plans.” On this news, SelectQuote’s stock price fell $0.61, or 19.2%, to close at $2.56 per share on May 1, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose: (1) that the Company was directing Medicare beneficiaries to the plans offered by insurers that best compensated SelectQuote, regardless of the quality or suitability of the insurers’ plans; (2) that SelectQuote did not provided unbiased comparison shopping for Medicare Advantage insurance plans; (3) that SelectQuote received illegal kickbacks to steer Medicare beneficiaries to certain insurers and limit enrollment in competitors’ plans; (4) that as a result, SelectQuote had not complied with applicable laws, regulations, and contractual provisions; (5) that SelectQuote was vulnerable to regulatory and legal sanctions as a result of its conduct, including claims that it had violated the False Claims Act; and (6) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. For more information on the SelectQuote lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/SLQT Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPPI) Class Period: March 17, 2022 to September 22, 2022 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 24, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. Spectrum’s Pinnacle Study of poziotinib for the treatment of lung cancer was less positive than it portrayed to investors. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period.

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Dogecoin’s backers moved quickly this week to create what they call the first official DOGE treasury, pushing $175 million into a vehicle aimed at buying Dogecoin and bringing more institutional muscle to the token. According to reports, the fund was set up through a private placement that issued 175,000,420 pre-funded warrants priced at $1 each, a structure meant to provide immediate capital for purchases. The plan has drawn big-name crypto firms and traditional investors. Based on reports, the financing raised $175 million in total. Over 80 institutional and crypto-native investors are said to have taken part, with names like Pantera, GSR, FalconX, Mythos and Borderless listed among participants. The offering is expected to close around September 4, 2025, subject to regulatory approvals and the formal listing of the new warrants. CleanCore Solutions $ZONE is converting to become the first ever Dogecoin Treasury company in partnership with the House of Doge. Stock immediately plummets 59%. What a world. pic.twitter.com/xqHYHXixYu — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) September 2, 2025 The company tied to the move is CleanCore Solutions, which will house the program alongside a commercial arm called House of Doge. Markets reacted fast. CleanCore’s share price fell about 60%, sliding from roughly $6.85 to near $2.69 after the arrangement was disclosed. That drop reflected investor worries about dilution, execution risk, and how public markets would view a corporate play centered on a meme token. Trading in the warrants and the conversion mechanics were flagged by analysts as key details investors will watch closely. Reports have disclosed a noteworthy lineup of people and advisors. Alex Spiro, who has been publicly identified as an attorney for Elon Musk, is named to serve as Chairman of the Board at CleanCore. Timothy Stebbing, Director at the Dogecoin Foundation and CTO of House of Doge, will join CleanCore’s board, while Marco Margiotta, CEO of House of Doge, is slated to act as CleanCore’s Chief Investment Officer. The crypto-ETF firm 21Shares will advise on governance, capital allocation and strategy for the treasury. Those moves were described in filings and press releases tied to the deal. The effort aims to move Dogecoin from pure meme status toward something that can be held in a corporate reserve and used for payments, tokenization efforts, and other financial uses. According to statements circulating with the financing documents, the treasury would buy DOGE with the raised capital and could help create institutional-grade products around the token. Details about custody, trading rules and how purchases will be executed were not fully spelled out in initial disclosures.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto.

Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC.

Title: Forbes Daily: Alphabet Shares Soar As Google Scores A Victory In Court

ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. AI is king on Forbes’ latest Cloud 100 list, which features the top companies in cloud computing. It’s not surprising that AI juggernauts OpenAI and Anthropic took the No. 1 and 2 spots, respectively, but another firm that made a blockbuster debut at No. 8 is Anysphere, the company behind popular generative coding tool Cursor. One notable absence is Scale AI, which ranked No. 7 last year, but announced in June that Meta was buying nearly half of the company for $14 billion. With Scale’s high-profile founder and CEO Alexandr Wang now leading Meta’s AI lab, it’s unclear how strong its business will be going forward. Google will not have to sell its Chrome browser to remedy its search market monopoly, a federal judge ruled Tuesday, but the tech giant will have to share some of its data with competitors, among other legal concessions. Google makes most of its revenue from its ad business, and shares of its parent company Alphabet surged nearly 8% in after-hours trading Tuesday. A federal appeals court ruled that President Donald Trump’s administration cannot fast-track the deportation of Venezuelan migrants from the country using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which has previously only been used during wartime. The court dismissed the argument that the migrants were part of an “invasion,” and if the Trump Administration challenges the ruling, it’s likely to bring the issue to the Supreme Court again. Shares of TSMC, the world’s largest semiconductor firm by market value, fell sharply after the U.S. revoked a waiver allowing the company to ship to its China-based facilities freely. The move could interrupt the company’s production, as the Trump Administration has tightened export controls on semiconductor and chip shipments to China this year. When Meta announced its Scale AI deal, Mercor, a smaller rival that recruits PhDs and other experts to train models for AI labs, saw an immediate opening. But the buzzy startup, debuting on Forbes’ Cloud 100 list, is in transition: Its original conception was to modernize recruiting with AI, but along the way, it found its sweet spot in recruiting people to train AI models. Seattle-based Interlune faces daunting hurdles in its quest to develop robots to harvest a valuable form of helium on the moon. But the firm, which has received $18 million in funding, may be among the startups with the best shot of building a space mining business in the near term —partly because it has ways to monetize its technology in the meantime. President Donald Trump pledged to send the National Guard to Chicago and Baltimore, though he didn’t clarify when it could happen. Trump said he would move forward with the deployment with or without Illinois Governor JB Pritzker’s approval, even as a judge ruled Tuesday that the president’s Los Angeles takeover violated federal law. The FAA’s plan to address a long-standing air traffic controller shortage has hit a snag: There aren’t enough instructors to train thousands of new recruits. The agency expects to hire 8,900 new air traffic controllers by 2028, but because of factors like attrition, retirements and program washouts, this will only result in 1,000 more certified controllers, according to FAA documents. With more than 80,000 AI-powered cameras across the U.S., Flock Safety has become one of cops’ go-to surveillance tools and a $7.5 billion business since its founding in 2017. The cameras record not just the license plate numbers of the cars that pass them, but their make and distinctive features—broken windows, dings, bumper stickers. CEO and cofoun­der Garrett Langley estimates they help solve 1 million crimes a year. Soon, Flock’s cameras will take to the skies mounted on its own “made in Amer­ica” drones. Produced at a factory the company opened earlier this year near its Atlanta offices, they’ll add a new dimension to Flock’s business and aim to challenge Chinese drone giant DJI’s dominance. Langley has a prediction: In less than 10 years, Flock’s cameras, airborne and fixed, will eradicate almost all crime in the U.S. (He acknowledges that programs to boost youth employment and cut recidivism will help.) Not everyone shares law enforcement’s enthusiasm for Flock’s rapid expansion. Privacy advocates say the company is building an unprecedented mass-surveillance dystopia. But Langley’s most pressing concern by far is the $2.1 billion (2024 revenue) police tech giant Axon Enterprise. Flock had a burgeoning partnership with the publicly traded ($59 billion market cap) Taser creator, but in January, Axon CEO and billionaire cofounder Rick Smith killed their deal, accusing Flock of overcharging and trying to lock customers into its products. In April, Axon debuted its own stand-alone license plate reader cameras along with a shot-across-the-bow first customer: the Atlanta Police Department, a current Flock user. Langley says Axon is a monopolist abusing its market position to choke out competition. “I plan to go take them out,” he says. “We will deliver a better product at a lower price.” WHY IT MATTERS The goal of preventing all crime in the U.S. sounds like a pipe dream from another AI-can-solve-everything tech bro, but Langley, in the face of a wave of opposition from privacy advocates and Flock’s archrival Axon, is a true believer. “I’ve talked to plenty of activists who think crime is just the cost of modern society. I disagree,” Langley says. “I think we can have a crime-free city and civil liberties … We can have it all.” MORE Flock’s AI Cameras Are Watching Cars All Over America. They’re About To Get A Lot More Powerful. The “No Tax on Tips” policy enacted through President Donald Trump’s signature spending bill is reportedly set to impact millions of workers in industries like hospitality, food and beverage and personal services. The Trump Administration has yet to confirm the exact list of professions: Up to $25,000: The amount the provision allows certain workers to deduct in tip income from their federal taxes Around 4 million: The number of Americans who worked in tipped occupations as of 2023, according to Yale University’s Budget Lab $40 billion: The approximate cost of the program to the government through 2028, according to an estimate by the Congressional Budget Office Many workers looking to make a career change feel stymied by financial concerns, but you can start working toward your desired career on the side without quitting your current gig. To build up knowledge in your new field, start with no- or low-cost resources like library books or courses. And before you make any switch, run the numbers on expected salary, earnings growth and the job market.

Already have an account?Sign in Last month, Kith made a statement by literally stopping New York traffic to host a runway show titled “INSTITUTION.” Now, with the opening of Kith IVY, it’s going beyond mere New York institution. A private padel club housed on the rooftop of a West Village residential commercial building, Kith Ivy is also host to New York’s first-ever Erewhon. Yes, streetwear mega-retailer Kith managed to coax Erewhon out of its LA home for the first time, delivering its pricey, organic, celebrity-cosigned smoothies to the people of New York. But there’s a catch. According to reports, it’ll cost $36,000 in initiation fees plus an annual payment of $7,000 to get access to Kith Ivy and, by extension, the in-house Erewhon. As if paying $20 for Hailey Bieber's Strawberry Glaze Skin Smoothie wasn’t already enough. Note that even for that price, you don’t get access to an entire Erewhon supermarket but an Erewhon-branded tonic bar. Still, Kith Ivy comes with amenities like that aforementioned padel court, a private gym, and a restaurant by the owners of the East Village’s Cafe Mogador. There’s also a boutique that’ll stock Kith’s new Padel line of the same name. However, all is not lost for anyone craving an Erewhon smoothie in the Big Apple. New Yorkers within the vicinity of Kith Ivy will be able to get smoothies delivered from Erewhon’s Kith Ivy outpost via Postmates and Uber Eats. Kith already wears many hats, of course. It's a retailer with 21 outposts worldwide, a similarly expansive cereal bar, a fashion brand with handfuls of diffusion lines, and a many-armed collaborator on everything from sports cars to dad shoes. This new project marks a significant expansion to the already vast Kith-everse. "The Kith Ivy club in New York is our most holistic entry into hospitality, expanding outside of dining into true lifestyle services, sport and wellness, and product," commented Kith founder Ronnie Fieg in a statement. Kith can now add "home to the first Erewhon outside of California," to its long list of accomplishments.

ByThomas Brewster, Forbes Staff. In a windowless room inside Atlanta’s Dunwoody police department, Lieutenant Tim Fecht hits a button and an insectile DJI drone rises silently from the station rooftop. It already has its coordinates: a local mall where a 911 call has alerted the cops to a male shoplifter. From high above the complex, Fecht zooms in on a man checking his phone, then examines a group of people waiting for a train. They’re all hundreds of yards away, but crystal clear on the room-dominating display inside the department’s crime center, a classroom-sized space with walls covered in monitors flashing real- time crime data—surveillance and license plate reader camera feeds, gunshot detection reports, digital maps showing the location of cop cars across the city. As more 911 calls come in, AI transcribes them on another screen. Fecht can access any of it with a few clicks. Twenty minutes down the road from Dunwoody, in an office where Flock Safety’s cameras and gunshot detectors are arrayed like museum pieces, 38-year-old CEO and cofoun­der Garrett Langley presides over the $300 million (estimated 2024 sales) company responsible for it all. Since its founding in 2017, Flock, which was valued at $7.5 billion in its most recent funding round, has quietly built a network of more than 80,000 cameras pointed at highways, thoroughfares and parking lots across the U.S. They record not just the license plate numbers of the cars that pass them, but their make and distinctive features—broken windows, dings, bumper stickers. Langley estimates its cameras help solve 1 million crimes a year. Soon they’ll help solve even more. In August, Flock’s cameras will take to the skies mounted on its own “made in Amer­ica” drones. Produced at a factory the company opened earlier this year near its Atlanta offices, they’ll add a new dimension to Flock’s business and aim to challenge Chinese drone giant DJI’s dominance. Langley offers a prediction: In less than 10 years, Flock’s cameras, airborne and fixed, will eradicate almost all crime in the U.S. (He acknowledges that programs to boost youth employment and cut recidivism will help.) It sounds like a pipe dream from another AI-can-solve- everything tech bro, but Langley, in the face of a wave of opposition from privacy advocates and Flock’s archrival, the $2.1 billion (2024 revenue) police tech giant Axon Enterprise, is a true believer. He’s convinced that America can and should be a place where everyone feels safe. And once it’s draped in a vast net of U.S.-made Flock surveillance tech, it will be. “I’ve talked to plenty of activists who think crime is just the cost of modern society. I disagree,” Langley says. “I think we can have a crime-free city and civil liberties. . . . We can have it all.” In municipalities in which Flock is deployed, he adds, the average criminal—those between 16 and 24 committing nonviolent crime—“will most likely get caught.” Not always, though. Back at the Dunwoody Police Department, the cops are unable to identify that shoplifter. But Fecht and his boss, Major Patrick Krieg, are quick to reel off other cases in which they say Flock was pivotal in finding offenders: an ATM theft gang that knocked off pharmacies across the East Coast until Flock’s cameras tracked one of their getaway vehicles; an armed man headed into a bustling bar district identified via drone by the tattoo on his neck and apprehended before he could do harm; a woman who had pulled a gun on her neighbor. When the July 4 parade, the biggest in Georgia, comes to Dunwoody a few days later, Flock cameras will be watching for those who might disrupt it. “It just gives us the opportunity to ensure the safety of the community during huge events like that,” Krieg says. Fresh from a family vacation in Europe, the tall and athletic Langley is cheery, almost buoyant. Growth has been explosive, with revenue up some 70% from the estimated $175 million it booked in 2023. It’s not yet profitable and has no imminent plan to be as it prioritizes growth, backed by a $275 million March funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz. Those numbers were more than sufficient to land Flock on Forbes’ 2025 Cloud 100 list of the top private cloud computing companies. Langley says turning Flock into a $100 billion business is “very within reach.” Ilya Sukhar, an early investor and partner at VC firm Matrix who sits on Flock’s board, agrees. “It’s a bit cliché, but it does feel like we’re just getting started,” he says. “It’s not hard for me to project to a place where we get to that level.” Each Flock license plate reader cam costs between $3,000 and $3,500, with an additional fee for FlockOS, the operating system that makes all the data Flock collects accessible via a browser or a mobile app, based on either the number of users or cameras. Dunwoody PD, for instance, pays around $500,000 annually for its array of 105 cameras, gunshot detectors, that skittering DJI drone and the software that controls it all. Flock’s growth isn’t solely fueled by its 5,000 law enforcement customers across 49 states (it hasn’t yet installed its cameras in Alaska). It has 1,000 corporate customers, including blue chips like FedEx, Lowe’s and Simon Property, America’s largest mall owner. Then there are housing and homeowner associations, small businesses, schools and organizations like the Jewish Federation of Greater Atlanta, which has installed 64 Flock cameras across different properties in the city, including a community center that has reported a recent spike in antisemitic threats to Dunwoody police. All these customers can choose to grant the police access to their camera feeds, further expanding the surveillance coverage Flock can offer law enforcement. Many do. Langley had no experience in police tech when he and fellow Georgia Tech alums Matt Feury, 36, and Paige Todd, 40, started the company in 2017. Previously they’d worked together on an app Langley cofounded for upgrading sports or concert seats to VIP-status events, where Feury and Todd were early employees. (It was acquired by Atlanta-based conglomerate Cox Enterprises and no longer exists.) Inspired by an unsolved robbery in Langley’s neighborhood, the trio started work on the first Flock prototype, an Android phone camera in a waterproof box that took pictures of cars and picked out license plates that could then be searched via an app. It was crude, but proof of concept. When Sukhar first invested in Flock in 2018, the company was struggling to build the device the founders had envisioned: a weatherproof, solar-powered, always-on camera that could quickly snap accurate photos and transmit them over the internet to an Amazon cloud server where they could be reviewed and compared at scale. “That took some time to figure out,” he says. By 2020, Flock had it all dialed in and was quickly building out a network of cameras that would soon extend across the country. And it already had an eager customer in law enforcement; cops loved the idea of searching a countrywide network of cameras to track down a suspect vehicle. Not everyone shares law enforcement’s enthusiasm for Flock’s rapid expansion. Privacy advocates say the company is building an unprecedented mass-surveillance dystopia. One activist group, DeFlock, has crowdsourced a map of license plate reader camera locations that now tops 29,000, two-thirds of which are from Flock, and runs a Discord channel where users are encouraged to challenge rollouts in their area. Creator Will Freeman, based in Boulder, Colorado, says what Flock is building is “messed up and against the principles of the Fourth Amendment” because “they’re searching all the time.” He accused Langely of wanting to “put the whole country under surveillance while he profits.” Other activists are less verbal. Cameras have been vandalized and stolen. There have been physical threats against company employees. Langley, who described those threatening the company as “terrorists,” is worried enough about being targeted that Flock’s offices, manufacturing facilities and camera installation vans are purposefully logoless. But his most pressing concern by far is police-tech behemoth Axon. Flock had a burgeoning partnership with the publicly traded ($59 billion market cap) Taser creator after Axon made a minority investment back in 2020. The market incumbent, founded in 1993, had promised to promote Flock license plate readers and make them work seamlessly with Axon’s tech. But in January, Axon CEO and billionaire cofounder Rick Smith killed their deal, accusing Flock of overcharging and trying to lock customers into its products. In April, Axon debuted its own stand-alone license plate reader cameras along with a shot-across-the-bow first customer: the Atlanta Police Department, a current Flock user. Axon is charging 20% less for its cameras, and early adopters get the first year of their software free. Langley is returning fire. He says Axon is a monopolist abusing its market position to choke out competition. “I plan to go take them out,” he says. “We will deliver a better product at a lower price.” He isn’t the first to make such allegations. In 2020, the FTC challenged Axon’s acquisition of bodycam rival VieVu, claiming the merger would effectively create a monopoly. While the agency dropped the complaint three years later because of legal delays, three local governments—Baltimore, Holmdel, New Jersey, and LaSalle County, Illinois—are suing Axon, alleging much the same. Axon has denied accusations of anticompetitive behavior; the case is ongoing. In a recent investor presentation, it said it controls less than 15% of the $11 billion law enforcement market. Flock isn’t without regulatory troubles of its own. The state of Illinois is investigating whether cops broke the law there when they gave out-of-state agencies access to their Flock feeds to hunt down breaches of immigration or abortion law. (Flock has since updated its tools to prevent out-of-state sharing in states with laws prohibiting it.) Last year, a Forbes investigation found Flock had regularly failed to get the correct permits and licenses to deploy its devices, appearing to break a number of local laws. Langley admits the company is “still very far from perfect” but that in cases where it has struggled to get quick permit approvals from transportation agencies, waiting 12 months “just doesn’t make sense.” He complains that “it feels like we were penalized for saving a kid from being hit by a car and we got caught for jaywalking.” Other jurisdictions have tried either to ban or remove Flock and its ilk. Earlier this year, the city council in Austin, Texas, chose not to renew its Flock contract; one councilor cited Forbes’ investigation and pointed to Immigration and Customs Enforcement having accessed Flock data. In 2023, the Camden County Commission in Missouri passed a law barring police from using license plate rea­ders, but already deployed Flock cameras didn’t come down immediately. After Flock ignored requests by local commissioner Ike Skelton to remove a camera, he took it down himself. He was swiftly charged by local prosecutors with tampering with a public utility and obstructing government operations; if convicted, he won’t be able to run for public office again. The case is yet to be heard in court, but Skelton tells Forbes he believed he was operating within “the law of the land” and the ordinance banning plate rea­ders in Camden County. He remains worried not just about his job, but also Flock’s creation of a “surveillance system that you’ll never, ever know that you’re being tracked.” None of this is slowing Langley down. “The consequence of building a product that actually changes people’s lives is that there will be a lot of people we piss off along the way, because what we’re doing actually matters,” he says. The company is chugging along with new products in the pipeline. It’s adding car crash detection to its gunshot flagging system, Raven, and enhancements to its license plate camera feeds. Further out, there’s Nova, Flock’s crown jewel to be, born of the company’s February 2025 acquisition of Lucidus, a Nashville, Tennessee–based startup. Flock has rebuilt the Lucidus tool, though the basic premise is the same: Nova promises to knit law enforcement records with all manner of public information—property and occupancy data, Social Security numbers and personal credit bureau histories—and make it all granularly searchable with AI. Nova’s product lead, Martin Howley, recounts an anecdote about a law enforcement partner searching for a murder suspect. Using Nova to analyze drone footage, the cops were able to determine the six-hour window in which a victim’s body was dumped in a specific location, allowing them to tighten their search of Flock cameras for cars in the area at the time. In emails obtained by Forbes, an Amazon Web Services law enforcement director described Lucidus’ tech as “one of the most amazing tools that I have seen for law enforcement”—and that was before Flock got its hands on it. “It’s an end run around privacy laws and the Constitution,” says ACLU senior policy analyst Jay Stanley. Expanding alongside Flock’s product line is its mission. The company thinks it can not only solve crimes but improve traffic management and expedite street repairs. Langley envisions a benevolent American panopticon where everyone feels safe and cities use all the data at their disposal to improve our quality of life. “We’ve got all these Flock cameras deployed from a criminal perspective,” Langley says. “Why would we not then walk down to the public works department and say, ‘stop sending people out to look for potholes. I have all that data. Let’s build a better city together’?” He’s most excited about Flock’s drones. In an industrial park 10 miles north of Atlanta, in a 97,000-square-foot, $10 million manufacturing facility, he shows one off. It’s unremarkable, little different from other police drones. But it’s American-made. That will matter if states follow a recent Florida order banning Chinese-made drones from police use. Langley concedes that no company can outdo DJI—for now. But he’s going to try. Flock’s first stab at that mission will be in customers’ hands come August. In a test drive, a drone in Riverside County, California, rises from the roof of a Flock facility on the outskirts of town. Controlled via browser, with just a keyboard and mouse, it’s like playing a video game—no surprise given that Flock employed developers from the Overwatch first-person shooter game series to build it. Text pops up to explain what’s on the screen: a mental health care center, a McDonald’s. Then, with a simple scroll of the mouse, the camera zooms in on two men playing softball on a field hundreds of yards in the distance. The batter misses one, then hits a doozy. He has no idea he’s being watched from a surveillance company’s factory 2,000 miles away.

Title: BlackRock shares the 3 main things it's learned from a wild first half of 2025 in markets

With a volatile first half of the year in the books for markets, analysts from the BlackRock Investment Institute (BII) are finally taking some time to breathe and take stock of some lessons learned. The firm cited uncertainty around President Donald Trump's tariff policies as a primary driver of price swings in the first half of the year — but also said the lack of sustained volatility was a surprise in and of itself. In total, the BII team arrived at three main observations from the first eight months of the year, based on how investor behavior has informed moves in the bond market and red-hot AI sector: In the first lesson, BlackRock recalls when the market was able to serve as a guardrail against Trump's most extreme tariff plan. The best example was so-called Liberation Day, when Trump announced a wide range of duties on US trade partners. Stocks plunged and treasury yields spiked. Investors made their displeasure felt, and Trump ultimately walked back some tariffs, or delayed their implementation altogether. "We recognized the global financial order couldn't rewire fast and U.S. stocks have now caught up," the analysts summarized, describing the strategy of betting on these reversals as one of the year's best plays. The BlackRock analysts used the most formidable current mega-force — AI — as their example for lesson number two. Rather than broadly flinging money at AI, investors should be more discerning and realize which areas are still ripe with opportunity, and which are fully priced. Not everything with the word "AI" in its name is going to succeed. BII says the most successful traders will constantly track developments and keep maneuvering over time. From the analysts' perspective, the market is currently in the buildout stage of the AI, the first of three phases that also includes adoption and transformation, both of which will likely take time to develop and may end up changing before they do. "This uncertainty demands adaptability to incoming information," the authors noted, citing the tech stock sell-off sparked by the release of Chinese startup DeepSeek's R1 AI model in January 2025 as an example. While making clear that 2025 has been a complicated year for investing so far, BII's analysts also laid out an inconvenient reality: historically reliable diversifiers like Treasury bonds are no longer as rock-steady as they once were. The analysts argue that the age of long-term US Treasurys offering a spot for resilience during equity market selloffs seems to be over. "Yield movements have broken with pre-pandemic norms as fiscal concerns have mounted, with 30-year U.S. Treasury yields rising as two-year yields fall, reinforcing our preference for shorter-term Treasurys," the report stated. Recommending that investors find new sources of resilience, the analysts highlighted gold's recent surge as a popular diversifier. In addition, they cited bitcoin and private assets as potential means of diversifying portfolios as economic uncertainty persists. Jump to

Allie Garfinkle is a senior finance reporter for Fortune, covering venture capital and startups. She authors Term Sheet, Fortune’s weekday dealmaking newsletter. What do you want to be when you grow up? It’s a question we all heard as kids, and our answers were frequently telling. A child’s answer— whether firefighter, astronaut, or, in my case, paleontologist—said something about their instincts and their imagined future. Lots of kids dream of space and fire trucks, but Philip Clark had a distinct set of ambitions: he wanted to be a physicist and the CEO of Lockheed Martin. “Oh, I loved the [now-retired Lockheed recon aircraft] SR-71 when I was a kid,” said Clark. “I remember my parents put me in a preschool interview, and I was telling people about the aerodynamics of F-16s. I don’t know how much I really understood at the time, but I was definitely talking about it in building-block interviews with preschool and kindergarten principals. They were like: ‘So, you really want to talk about the air resistance on the angular momentum of this particular wing?’” Today, Clark may not be the CEO of Lockheed Martin (though he’s only 28, so he still has time) but he’s found another route into defense—in 2022, Clark began working on Thrive Capital’s investment in defense tech juggernaut Anduril, last valued this summer at $30.5 billion. Since joining Thrive from 8VC in 2022, Clark has also worked on the firm’s investments in OpenAI, Cursor, Wiz, Nudge, and Physical Intelligence. Now, Clark has been promoted to partner at Thrive, Fortune has exclusively learned. “There aren’t that many companies that end up mattering in world history,” he told Fortune. “I often talk about the alien test: If aliens were to come down to Earth and ask how the world works, what companies would appear in your description of the world?… The test at Thrive, for the companies we invest in, is that we need to believe they will appear on that list.” Thrive, started in 2011 by Joshua Kushner (profiled in Fortune last year), has become known for its big swings—big even among VCs, like doubling down on OpenAI in the largest private tech deal ever. “I often think about the word ‘counterfactual’ when investing,” said Clark. “There are two types of counterfactuals that are really important when I partner with someone. Test A: If this company or idea didn’t exist, would the world look the same or different? And I don’t mean it in a loosey-goosey way. If you walked down the street, would the world look physically different? Or if you go on your computer, does that computer look different? And Test B: Is this person counterfactually impactful? Could I give another really smart person this same idea, and get a similar result on this company? The answer to both these questions is that the idea needs to be counterfactually impactful, and the person needs to be counterfactually important.” Clark’s been at the center of the AI boom—jumping in to help hire at Cursor after Thrive’s investment in 2024 and working on the firm’s OpenAI deal—and he doesn’t think there’s an AI bubble. “People are way too narrow in how they think about what the impact of AI will be on the world,” he said. “There’s a lot about automating knowledge work, but we talk way too little about the fact that this is unlocking fundamentally new ways of manipulating atoms in the physical world… You can actually build fast, manufacturable, easily configurable, highly-customized, valuable hardware and physical world solutions to lots of problems.” That said, there is, of course, nuance. “Things can be simultaneously true,” said Clark. “Lots of less strong businesses can be funded as the most important companies in the world are created. I don’t think we’re in a dotcom era bubble right now, but it was true even then that the most important companies of the Internet were created—Google, Amazon, Netflix, etc. That was true even as you had Pets.com and Webvan. Our job is to make sure you partner with Amazon, and as long as you do that early—’97, ‘99, 2001—that’s going to be an important and wild journey.” AI update… Anthropic announced yesterday it raised $13 billion at a $183 billion valuation, with investors including Iconiq, Fidelity, and Lightspeed. Elsewhere, OpenAI announced plans to acquire Statsig for $1.1 billion in an all-stock deal.

Title: Trump’s Industrial Policy: What’s Right and Wrong
URL: http://washingtonmonthly.com/2025/09/03/trump-industrial-policy/
Time Published: 2025-09-03T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
In recent weeks and months, Donald Trump’s administration has supplemented its globe-spanning tariffs with bespoke industrial policy deals with U.S. corporations. These include the federal government taking equity stakes in Intel, a “golden share” in U.S. Steel, and profit-sharing on Nvidia and AMD’s chip sales in China. The deals have astonished and unnerved economic analysts across the political spectrum. Commentators from The Wall Street Journal editorial page to MSNBC have decried them as “unprecedented” and amounting to “socialism,” “corporatism,” or “state capitalism with American characteristics.” In truth, Trump’s actions are rooted in a long history of presidents from both parties taking temporary control or ownership of systemically important companies. However, until now, most of these interventions have been temporary and involved either wartime emergencies or too-big-to-fail corporate collapse. Under Woodrow Wilson, the federal government took temporary ownership of the railroad industry to support troops during World War I. During World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt’s administration directed much of the corporate industrial sector. In 1980, Jimmy Carter’s administration extended loan guarantees to Chrysler in exchange for stock warrants. After the company recovered and repaid its loans, the government earned $311 million in capital gains. During the Financial Crisis, Barack Obama’s administration provided the auto industry with tens of billions of dollars in exchange for equity stakes and commitments for substantial restructuring. Trump’s moves also build on recent industrial policy interventions by his and the Joe Biden administrations. Until now, those policies stopped short of the government seeking direct influence over corporate governance through golden shares or equity stakes. During his first term, Trump primarily conducted industrial policy through targeted tariffs and trade actions to promote American industry, and by jawboning corporations to boost domestic manufacturing. The Biden administration went further, providing computer chip and clean energy companies with hundreds of billions of dollars—and detailed requirements for how they could be spent—as part of a long-term post-neoliberal industrial strategy for national security. Those actions were consistent with, though a major step beyond, Trump’s first-term trade policies, just as Trump’s second-term corporate dealmaking is an advance on Biden’s (even if neither president would admit it). So, while Trump’s dealmaking spree is not unprecedented, it ventures into new territory reflecting Trump’s strongman tendencies: He has claimed for himself concentrated power to oversee and influence corporate decision-making, authority thus far ceded to him by Congress and the courts. He has operated outside the law through handshake deals that corporations often cannot afford to refuse, endowing the presidency with powerful—and dangerous—economic tools for routine use. This is unlikely to be a mere Trump-era aberration. Presidents typically don’t forego inherited powers. Today’s novelty policies may become tomorrow’s precedent, as the last decade has shown. Some elements of industrial policy with Trumpist characteristics may become long-term features of American governance. But Congress and the judiciary should assert democratic and constitutional control over American industrial policy now and in the future to prevent its abuse and, potentially, its collapse. Here’s a rundown of Trump’s corporate dealmaking thus far: U.S. Steel: In June, the White House greenlit Nippon Steel’s takeover bid for the American steelmaker U.S. Steel. Trump overturned Biden blocking the deal—on the condition that the government receive a “golden share” of the company, allowing it to veto major corporate decisions, such as offshoring jobs and closing plants. MP Materials: In July, the Department of Defense announced an investment in MP Materials, the country’s only active producer of certain rare earth minerals used for military equipment. The deal provided government support for the company, guaranteeing a minimum price for its products and providing a guaranteed buyer—the federal government—for all its output for the next ten years. The feds also extended a $150 million loan and purchased $400 million in company stock making it MP’s largest shareholder. Japan Trade Deal: Also in July, the White House announced a trade deal with Japan that purportedly included Tokyo creating a $550 billion investment fund for the administration to use toward its industrial policy priorities, including energy infrastructure, semiconductor manufacturing, critical mineral supply chains, pharmaceutical production, and shipbuilding. Japan quickly contested the administration’s description of the deal, explaining that the investment fund would be nearly entirely composed of loans the U.S. would need to repay. Nvidia and AMD: In August, the administration agreed to allow the semiconductor makers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices to sell certain modified chips in China, reversing national security restrictions. The companies also agreed to give 15 percent of all profits earned in China with the U.S. government. Intel: Later that month, the administration took a 10 percent equity stake in chipmaker Intel. The deal converted billions of dollars in grants the company was due under the CHIPS and Science Act into equity stakes, making the federal government Intel’s largest shareholder. That conversion also, without any legal authority, dispensed with CHIPS Act taxpayer safeguards that required Intel to reach milestones toward completing new domestic manufacturing sites to receive federal funding. Trump’s economic interventions bear a number of distinctive qualities that expand on industrial policy precedent, but five stand out: Sign up for our daily newsletter to get one story in your inbox every weekday. Email (required) * Example: Yes, I would like to receive emails from Washington Monthly. (You can unsubscribe anytime) Some elements of Trump’s approach are likely to endure. The wraparound support for MP Materials, for example, could well become a model for how the government cultivates strategically important domestic production. The type of golden share Trump obtained in U.S. Steel could be on the table for future mitigation agreements between the federal government and foreign companies seeking to invest in critical domestic sectors. As I wrote for the Monthly, there are also compelling reasons for the government to insist on a direct return on its industrial policy investments. Taking equity stakes in semiconductor companies funded by the CHIPS Act was originally a Bernie Sanders proposal. When used in the right context, equity stakes ensure that industrial policy returns upside revenue to the public, instead of merely socializing profits for corporations. External trends may also lend Trump’s industrial policy approach greater staying power. As policymakers seek new revenue sources beyond traditional taxation, they may increasingly look to levers like equity stakes, profit-sharing agreements, and royalties. Congress’s tendency toward gridlock and paralysis has long spurred administrations to seek creative executive workarounds, but the courts have increasingly limited the discretion given to the administrative state. That may steer administrations toward regulation-by-deal as a flexible means for the executive branch to regain power from the judiciary. It’s not hard to imagine where Trumpist industrial policy may be headed. White House advisers have said they will seek equity stakes in other companies receiving federal grants and loans to seed a sovereign wealth fund. Moreover, if Intel cannot right its ship, it may be forced to revisit previous discussions of spinning off its semiconductor factories to a foreign firm like the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). The Trump administration, which has opposed such a move, could, as Intel’s largest shareholder, dictate the terms of such a deal. (Indeed, the Intel agreement included a poison pill to symie the sale of its foundries.) Plus, any such sale must win the administration’s approval through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). One could imagine the administration negotiating on economic and national security grounds for government ownership of Intel’s factories, which could then be leased to another chipmaker. Trump’s industrial policy toolkit may empower future administrations with different priorities. For instance, federal policies—steep tariffs and national security exclusions—are sparing U.S. automakers from a flood of low-cost, cutting-edge Chinese electric vehicles. A future administration could condition that continued industry protection on American carmakers offering more affordable low-emissions vehicles and ramping up their research and development investments. A future administration could use the specter of the government’s statutory powers to limit or override patents on federally funded technologies to negotiate long-term profit-sharing agreements with artificial intelligence companies. It could also use similar authority to negotiate price reductions from pharmaceutical companies and leverage the Medicare Advantage market to acquire golden shares in health insurance companies, with veto power over major corporate decisions. A future Democratic administration could grant targeted tariff reductions to countries or companies that decarbonize their energy grids and production processes—and dangle extra reductions to those that use American-made clean energy technology. It could use the Defense Production Act’s preemption power to expedite clean energy and new housing development around other legal impediments. If the industrial policy arc from the first Trump administration to the Biden administration is any guide, the next Democratic president will make fulsome use of these kinds of Trump-inspired tools. So sheer inertia may well propel Trumpist industrial policy forward. But there are several stark and urgent reasons Congress and the courts should pump the brakes and reconsider major elements of Trump’s approach. For one, Trump’s approach may simply yield worse industrial policy. Absent exceeding care and deliberation, go-it-alone executive branch industrial policy can overreach and implode without the safeguards and democratic legitimacy of operating through Congress. Even if Trump’s deals successfully evade the courts, a subsequent administration could deem some contrary to law and declare them null and void—regulation by deal has far less long-term durability than regulation by regulation, let alone legislation. Such whipsawing will make the U.S. government a less reliable, more tumultuous economic actor. For another, elements of Trump’s industrial policy are a recipe for abuse and corruption. Pay-to-play regimes for exporting sensitive technologies to foreign adversaries jeopardize fair competition and national security. Personalist policymaking is a recipe for cronyism, corruption, and favoritism for well-connected dominant firms. Trump’s industrial policy deals have so far been structured to secure public gains. Still, it is all too easy to foresee future gambits redounding to the private benefit of the Trump family (like the Paramount merger with Skydance, which routed $16 million into the Trump presidential library). Moreover, while leverage can be useful for achieving policy aims, marshaling the vast regulatory state as one big pressure-cooker to coerce concessions from targeted companies risks undermining other vital policy interests. We’re already seeing that regarding antitrust. Companies seeking merger approvals have won favorable treatment from the Trump administration by making side promises for domestic manufacturing investments. The potential for Trumpist misuse of industrial policy risks poisoning the whole enterprise. That’s where Congress and the courts come in—or at least, where they should. Congress was a true coequal branch during the Biden administration’s major industrial policy programs, shaping and passing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act through normal legislative processes. It could again instill democratic prerogatives and guardrails for industrial policy. Congress could determine when the government should take equity stakes in private companies. It could set ground rules around taking golden shares, like which corporate decisions may be subject to a government veto and which are off-limits. It could set standards around appropriate uses of revenue-sharing deals with the federal government. It could stipulate where the revenue generated from industry policy investments should go and how it should be spent. It could set rules preventing the government from unduly favoring companies where it has taken equity stakes in competitor firms. It could establish safeguards to ensure that industrial policy is not used to enrich public officials. Meanwhile, the courts may need to revisit legal doctrines like standing to ensure that some party can contest deals of questionable legality, like the Nvidia revenue-sharing agreement or the Intel equity swap. If Congress fails to act, it could be understood as blessing Trump’s mode of industrial policy by one-man dealmaking. That doesn’t just invite corruption, but is also a recipe for managerial disaster. The Obama administration’s masterful overhaul of Detroit is arguably less remembered today than the failure of Solyndra. After receiving an Energy Department loan, the solar panel firm’s bankruptcy led to a series of high-profile investigations that ultimately uncovered no criminal wrongdoing or corruption but soured the public on Obama’s nascent clean energy industrial strategy. With Trump’s state capitalism, the hands-off market fundamentalism era is over. The question is whether the government’s new terms of engagement with industry will be dominated by the president or deliberated upon by Congress and the courts. Acquiescence by the other branches to Trump’s deals, warts and all, risks heralding the unchecked and unbalanced industrial policy of the unitary executive. Activation by them, however, could lead to a whole-of-government effort to sand away the roughest edges of Trump’s approach to craft an industrial policy that is both powerful and responsible to effectively guide the country forward.

Title: People don't trust social media firms on fraud protection
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/0903/1531552-bank-of-ireland-fraud-warning/
Time Published: 2025-09-03T08:40:25Z

Research commissioned by Bank of Ireland for its latest fraud awareness campaign reveals that 91% of its customers believe social media firms should be banned from profiting off fraudulent ads. 90% of survey participants also say that financial service advertisers on social media should be required to prove their legitimacy, Bank of Ireland added. Bank of Ireland also said that seven in ten social media users do not trust social media companies to protect them from fraud and 73% distrust the ads they see on these platforms. The bank said its fraud research, which was conducted by Red C in August, reveals that 83% of consumers believe that fraud is a big problem in society today, while 76% said the risk of fraud scams makes them wary when they shop online. Meanwhile, 86% of those seeing fraudulent content on social media platforms said they saw it on Meta platforms, while 91% feel social media companies should not be allowed generate revenue from fraudsters placing ads on their platforms. 90% also feel that companies that advertise financial services on social media platforms should have to prove that the ads are genuine and the company is registered with the Central Bank. Nicola Sadlier, Head of Fraud at Bank of Ireland, said that social media platforms have become a lucrative hunting ground for fraudsters and consumers are paying the price while technology giants gain revenue. "With results from the latest RED C survey, seven in ten consumers now distrusting social media companies to shield them from fraud, and over 90% demanding an end to platforms profiting from scam ads, the message is clear - the public wants protection," she said. "It's time for increased accountability, not just algorithms," she added. Through extensive public affairs and PR activity, Bank of Ireland has been campaigning for a change in legislation to better protect consumers from fraud originating on social media channels. The bank today also issued a warning about "pump and dump" WhatsApp investment scams - where fraudsters lure victims via fake social media ads to join an investment WhatsApp group. Posing as a financial investment expert, the fraudster then spreads misleading information to group members about particular companies/stocks. Group members then buy the stock, the price is pumped up due to the increased demand and when the price peaks, the scammers sell (dump) their holdings at a profit, and disappear, Bank of Ireland explains. Professor Mary Aiken said that fraud online is now an industrialised, platform-enabled phenomenon. "Scammers leverage the same targeting and engagement tools legitimate advertisers use; the difference is that families and businesses bear the cost," the Professor said. "Bank of Ireland's findings, which show that seven in ten users distrust platform protection and over 90% want an end to profits from scam ads, reveal an overwhelming public appetite for reform," she said. "The solution is safety by design, verifying financial advertisers, building friction and warnings into investment journeys, and enforcing clear accountability when systems enable harm. If platforms can target us to buy, they can target protections to keep us safe," she added. © RTÉ 2025. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

Title: Analysts are calling Google's antitrust decision 'broadly favorable' and 'benign'

The verdict on Google's lengthy lawsuit is out, and analysts say the search giant left the room largely unscathed. Nearly five years after the Department of Justice filed an antitrust suit against Google, a district judge on Tuesday ruled that Google won't have to divest its Chrome or YouTube businesses. Instead, District Judge Amit Mehta's ruling said that Google will be barred from entering exclusive contracts with partners such as Apple to give its search engine priority, and it will be forced to share some data with rivals. Google's stock jumped 6.7% after hours following the decision. In post-ruling reactions, analysts called the decision "benign" and said that it finally removed a "significant overhang" on Google's stock. "The judge's decision largely surrounded opening up portions of Google's search technology to competitors rather than trying to disrupt its distribution framework (ie divesting Chrome) which seemed like the more adverse risk to us," RBC Capital analysts led by Brad Erickson wrote in a note on Tuesday. "The path for compounding earnings growth along with multiple expansion hasn't looked this clear in some time," the RBC analysts added. RBC raised its price target for the company from $220 to $260 on Tuesday. Alphabet, Google's parent company, closed at $212 on Tuesday. Analysts at Wedbush titled their note, "Government Folds Like Cheap Suit" and wrote: "The outcome is broadly favorable for Google, in our view, with the court ruling against the most severe remedy proposals introduced by the DOJ." The Wedbush analysts led by Scott Devitt shared three reasons they are bullish on Google and think its stock is being punished compared to Big Tech peers like Meta. First, they said that Tuesday's decision removed "lingering risks" associated with the worst-case outcome for the company. Second, they said that the impact of generative AI rivals such as OpenAI and Perplexity is fading. Lastly, they added that Google's leadership is "repositioning the business as a winner in the AI space, with strong demand trends and an acceleration in Cloud growth." Wedbush raised its stock price target from $225 to $245 on Tuesday. Google's stock has risen 11.3% year to date. Jump to

Title: Can Google Stock Unlock $1 Trillion After Antitrust Victory?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Google’s shareholders had plenty to celebrate in after-hours trading on Tuesday, September 2nd, with the stock jumping 7% following what can only be described as a major legal victory after a federal judge ruled that Google won’t be forced to sell its Chrome browser as part of the antitrust penalties – a decision that removes one of the biggest clouds hanging over the tech giant. Separately, see – Buy META Stock Over Amazon? Let's be honest here – losing Chrome would have been catastrophic for Google. We're not talking about just another product in their portfolio. Chrome is absolutely central to Google's business model, serving as the gateway that funnels billions of users toward Google's search engine and, ultimately, its advertising goldmine. The browser's value to Google? We've estimated it in the trillions. Investors were relieved when they heard this asset was safe. That said, the ruling wasn't entirely in Google's favor. Judge Amit Mehta did put some guardrails in place, specifically blocking Google from entering exclusive search contracts like the lucrative deal it has with Apple. However, the company can still pursue deals that make Chrome the default browser option – a meaningful distinction that preserves much of Chrome's strategic value. Before we get too carried away, it's worth remembering that Google still faces another significant legal hurdle. A separate US court found last year that the company illegally monopolized online search and advertising markets, with the final verdict due on September 10. That's less than a week away, and it could still pose meaningful risks. Now, regulatory risk is just a small part of the risk assessment framework we apply while constructing the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Here's where things get particularly compelling from an investment standpoint. Google has been trading at a significant discount to its Big Tech peers, largely due to these regulatory headwinds. While Amazon trades at 35 times trailing earnings, Microsoft at 37 times, and Meta at 28 times, Google was sitting at just 22 times as of yesterday's close. This valuation gap never quite made sense when you consider Google's fundamentals. The company has been firing on all cylinders lately – solid revenue growth, improving profitability margins, and a dominant position in search and cloud. The regulatory overhang was essentially the only thing keeping that multiple compressed. Here’s the kicker: If Google's valuation multiple were to rise to 35 times – similar to Amazon and Microsoft – it would translate into stock levels over $320, implying roughly 50% upside from current levels. We're talking about potentially adding over $1 trillion to the company's market cap. That's not just a nice boost for shareholders; it's a fundamental re-rating of one of the world's most profitable businesses. Of course, this kind of re-rating will likely have to wait for the September 10 ruling to provide more clarity on the regulatory front. And let’s be clear – there are still meaningful risks that could weigh on Google’s stock performance, which we’ve discussed in detail in our separate analysis on Google’s Valuation, Growth Drivers, and Key Risks. Yesterday's ruling feels like a turning point for Google's stock. The company has been delivering strong operational performance while trading at a discount due to regulatory uncertainty. With one major threat now off the table, investors are starting to price in the possibility that Google's valuation multiple could finally start catching up to its peers. While Google is not completely in the clear yet – that September 10 verdict still looms – this development suggests the worst-case scenarios for the company may be behind us. For a stock that’s been performing well operationally but struggling with regulatory baggage, that’s exactly the kind of catalyst that could unlock significant value.

Title: Seán Moran: After nearly a century, has the time come for a GAA President of Ireland?

The involvement of such a high-profile Gaelic games personality as Jim Gavin in the race for the Áras underlines how infrequently the GAA has been a significant factor in the careers of past presidents. Gavin’s life as a public servant in both the armed forces and aviation sector has been combined with civic involvement. Between chairing Dublin’s North East Inner City programme implementation board and the Citizen’s Assembly on a directly elected mayor for the city, he has decent credentials for a run at elected office. How he fares in the bear pit of securing the Fianna Fáil nomination is one thing, and if successful, the circumstances of having his life forensically scrutinised will be another matter. But he has clearly prepared for this and will have detailed plans to take it on one step farther. At Oireachtas and government level, there has never been any shortage of GAA-gene pool politicians, especially in Fianna Fáil. Current Taoiseach Micheál Martin is a committed Nemo Rangers supporter. His predecessor Brian Cowen played football for Offaly. The exemplar of the connection is Jack Lynch, winner of six successive All-Ireland medals and a lifelong supporter of Gaelic games. Given the strength of that connection, the broader question of why the GAA has been so sparsely represented in the Phoenix Park comes into focus in the week of Éamon De Valera’s 50th anniversary. His assertion that hurling and rugby were the games most suited to the Irish temperament is well known and this newspaper had a role in Dev’s most famous, or notorious, statement about Gaelic games, made just two years before he became president. Speaking at the southern branch of the Blackrock Past Pupils’ Union annual dinner, held at Shannon Airport in April 1957, he regretted that hurling was no longer played in the school. There was also a lament that he had felt unable to attend a rugby match since 1913 because he didn’t “want it raised as a political matter and having rows kicked up about it but I will not deny that I am a keen listener to rugby commentaries”. An Irish Times reporter was on hand to detail the following controversial statement. “For Irishmen there is no football game that could equal rugby and if all our young men played rugby,” he said, “we would not only beat England and Wales, but France and the whole lot of them together.” It was hardly surprising that in the one county guaranteed to have a view on what football game was paramount, the then-taoiseach’s views came under scrutiny. At a meeting in Tralee on May 11th, Kerry county board squabbled over whether De Valera’s comments were or were not “worthy of discussion”. County chair FJ Sheehy said that he was afraid that “the taoiseach was letting too many statements go by the board”. James Barrett, of the well-known Tralee family, said that the taoiseach was being taken out of context and had issued a denial and clarified his original statement to the effect that “Irishmen in international rugby would have made a name for themselves but that hurling was their game”. The chair wasn’t convinced, saying that if the original report had been correct, it was “an outlandish statement”. JJ Sheehy, the 1920s All-Ireland winner and well-known republican, was reported as saying that it was “not the games they were comparing but the things for which they stood. The GAA fighting for the freedom of the country, the language, the games and everything distinctive of Irish nationalism”. In the end, the board decided against issuing a statement by 13 votes to eight. In a postscript, the editor of The Irish Times said the paper was satisfied that their reporter’s version of the original speech was correct. De Valera was still a fixture at All-Ireland finals during his presidency. He was never a member of the GAA, though. This was significant during the association’s most notorious interaction with the presidency during the very first term of office of Douglas Hyde. In November 1938, Hyde together with taoiseach De Valera, attended an Ireland-Poland soccer match at Dalymount Park. The president was also patron of the GAA and his presence at the international was a breach of the then operative ban on foreign games. The GAA could do nothing about De Valera’s attendance, as he wasn’t a member but Hyde was removed as patron of the association. [ Jim Gavin profile: Is the former Dublin GAA manager a good fit for president?Opens in new window ] It is ironic that the most successful of the movements for cultural independence that took root at the end of the 19th century, was the sporting one – the GAA – but despite its local community base, it has had limited success in providing candidates for the presidency. Perhaps the underlying exclusiveness of the association for many years – it’s little more than 50 years since the ban was abolished and even less time since the prohibitions on British security force membership and the use of GAA grounds by other sports, followed it – impacted at a broader level. It is true that a recent president Mary McAleese and her husband Martin, former Antrim player and Sigerson Cup winner with Queen’s, are very much from that background and the former president is currently grappling with the knotty challenge of integrating the women’s and men’s Gaelic games associations. But McAleese’s background was as a lawyer with political connections to Fianna Fáil when initially elected in 1997. Given that a successful presidential term can make it harder to get out of the Áras than into it, whoever wins in October might well be in office until 2039, taking it beyond the centenary of the presidency, which was originally devised in the 1937 Constitution. Has the time come for a successful candidate whose primary profile arises from Gaelic games? sean.moran@irishtimes.com Get an in-depth look at the weekend's action and the best analysis of upcoming fixtures in our weekly newsletter © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: ‘The judge told me I would die in prison’ – Irishman to share his story of being held hostage in Iran’s ‘Satan’s Block’

Bernard Phelan, in his 60s, stripped of his dignity and forced to go on hunger strike in a desperate plight for freedom from Iran’s ‘Satan’s Block,’ where he was held for over 200 days. Bernard Phelan with his late father Vincent Phelan, who never gave up on his son as he was held hostage in an Iranian prison. An innocent Irishman held hostage in ‘Satan’s Block’ in Iran for over 200 days, told an RTÉ documentary a judge informed him: “You will die in prison.” The harrowing jail term saw former tourism worker Bernard Phelan, aged in his 60s, stripped of his dignity and forced to go on hunger strike in a desperate plight for freedom. Mr Phelan went from working in tourism IT and co-owning a well known LGBTQ+ bar in Paris - to being imprisoned, wrongly accused of providing information to an enemy country. You Will Die In Prison, An Irishman’s Hostage story, airs tonight at 10.35pm on RTÉ One and unearths the mental and physical toll one innocent man withstood and his survival against the might of the Iranian regime. Born in Clonmel, Co Tipperary, Mr Phelan grew up in Blackrock, South Co Dublin. He was living in Paris, before being taken hostage in Mashhad, Iran in October 2022. “I was taken to an interrogation centre in a car, blindfolded and handcuffed and that's when the nightmare really started,” Mr Phelan told the RTÉ documentary. “As I left the room, the judge said to me, through his translation: ‘You will die in prison.’ That was a big shock.” After visiting the country as a tourist, Mr Phelan struck up a business relationship with a company offering adventure tours. And in September 2022, he visited Iran to meet the business owners. However, the dual Irish-French national was, he admits, in the “wrong place at the wrong time.” The country had just witnessed a watershed moment, an uprising for women’s rights, after the killing of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini. The young woman was arrested by the morality police for not wearing a hijab in accordance with Iranian Government protocol. She died in police custody, sparking huge protests, the likes never witnessed in Iran. As he visited the exterior of the holy Imam Reza Mosque in Mashhad, where his business partner was taking photographs, Mr Phelan was arrested and taken to an interrogation centre. He was blindfolded and handcuffed and “that’s when the nightmare really started,” he said. Mr Phelan was kept in chains and named Number 67 in Arabic. When his number was called, he had no idea if he was to be given bread or have his throat slit. He described being moved to Mashhad Prison, meant to hold 1,500 prisoners, but where he believed there may be as many as 20,000. Bernard Phelan with his late father Vincent Phelan, who never gave up on his son as he was held hostage in an Iranian prison. Today's News in 90 Seconds - September 3rd 2025 A judge warned him he may die in the jail. But determined to secure his freedom, Mr Phelan launched a campaign from his prison cell. His father Vincent Phelan hand delivered a letter to the Iranian Embassy in Dublin calling for his release. Mr Phelan befriended a political prisoner, Taj Muhammed Khormali, eventually executed on April 8, 2025. “Sometimes you heard them crying,” Mr Phelan said, of the prisoners condemned to death. “You don’t know when you’re going to die, it could be tomorrow morning or two years time,” he said. “I imagined my health would give up,” he said. “I wasn't in good health, I had high blood pressure, HIV… I take medication to avoid stroke. I take tablets for depression. My mental state was very fragile. I really had very black thoughts." He told the documentary he went on hunger strike but was forced to relent when his father begged him to stop. "Please don't do this to me, I want to see you alive,” his father wrote. “If my dad died while I was in prison, I’d have gone back on hunger strike,” Mr Phelan, who still suffers from PTSD, said. The tide only began to turn when President Michael D Higgins wrote twice to his father, promising he would do all he could to assist. The family then pressured the Irish Government via the media on its plans to open an Irish embassy in Tehran. This led to Irish-French negotiations with Iran, with Mr Phelan’s release being the linchpin to future embassy plans. “If I’d had my visa and my Irish passport, I’d not have been arrested,” Mr Phelan believes. He was finally released in May 2023 and flown back in a medical bed to Paris. His husband, Roland Bonello and family, greeted him at the airport. In October, 2024, Vincent Phelan finally got to meet President Higgins at Áras an Uachtaráin, with his son. But just one week later the 98-year-old passed away. “My dad was so proud he got to see Michael D. The next day he had an accident and passed away a week later, shortly before his 99th birthday,” he said. “But he got to see the president and got letters from the president. He had a good life, an unusual end of life because of me. It was a full life.” Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: What to Watch: Industry Sanguine on Holiday Sales

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily U.S. retailers are looking for consumers to stay resilient and expect low-single-digit sales gains and minimal impact on prices from tariffs this holiday season. Senior Editor, Retail Retailers are feeling pretty good about the holiday 2025 season, even though shoppers are likely to shorten their gift lists as they fret over tariffs, the economy and geopolitical turmoil. Retailers, partially lifted by inflation, expect on average low-single-digit sales gains for the holiday season, slightly under last year’s 4.2 percent sales growth. Here’s why: Number one, Americans’ spending behaviors belie how they feel about the world and their personal finances. Consumers continue to show shopping resilience while purchasing selectively and cautiously for deals. The back-to-school season has been good and widely seen as a barometer for the holiday period. Tariffs shouldn’t jack up merchandise prices too much, at least not for the rest of this year, as major retailers absorb much of the higher costs of importing. Related Articles Retail What to Watch: How Saks Global Is Consolidating, Integrating and Reshaping Its Luxury Operations Wellness A GLP-1 Pill Is Coming to Shake Up the Weight Loss Drug Market In addition, retailers are focusing more on value, price, private labels and investments in AI and digital tools to enhance service and personalization. Furthermore, the stock market is holding up, interest rates are seen coming down, and the end of the de minimis exemption for goods valued under $800 — which allowed retailers, including Chinese mass merchants, to sell their wares directly to U.S. consumers without incurring extra costs — should make U.S. retailers more competitive. You May Also Like More significantly, retailers have been extending their holiday marketing, many launching campaigns around Halloween, some even promoting “Christmas in July,” after importing holiday goods earlier this year. Macy’s ran a “Black Friday in July” sales event for five days starting July 23. It also marketed a “Christmas in July” sale on July 25 for the first time, offering holiday and general merchandise, according to a news release. For some consumers, “Christmas in July” is not just about saving money, it’s also about saving time and avoiding the holiday rush for popular items. Like last year, there are 27 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas in 2025. Sources told WWD they expect mass merchants, discounters, off-pricers, warehouse clubs, electronics stores and selected apparel specialty retailers to do well during holiday 2025. Walmart has an upbeat outlook on the season, based on steady back-to-school shopping. The company raised its forecast for sales gains this year to 3.75 percent to 4.75 percent, up from the previous forecast of gains ranging from 3 percent to 4 percent. “Back-to-school is usually something of an indicator of how the holidays will go, and we feel good about how it went for us in terms of units and dollars sold and inventory sell through at both Walmart and Sam’s Club,” Doug McMillon, president and chief executive officer, said during a second-quarter conference call with investors and industry analysts. “Our top back-to-school items had a lower price than last year, and we offered a basket of everything students need for their first day of school for under $65. “We had our Walmart U.S. store managers together last week for our holiday planning meeting, where they got to see many of our new items, and pricing for the upcoming season. We liked what we saw and heard, and we like our position for the back half of the year. We’re expecting to have a good holiday season at Walmart,” he added. “It should be a good, solid holiday season,” said Stephen D. Lebovitz, president and CEO of CBL Properties. His outlook, he said, is “definitely more positive now than if you would have asked me the same question in April or May.” He said U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent pause on China tariffs for 90 days, and locking in some trade deals in Europe “gives the retailers more clarity on what they are paying for goods, more confidence in ordering inventory and being stocked correctly for the holidays. Also, the economy has continued to perform well. The stock market is up. Consumer confidence has hit some low points, but the degree to which we see consumers shopping would suggest otherwise.” Asked when he thinks retailers will kick off their holiday campaigning, Lebovitz said, “I don’t think it can start any earlier than it has in recent past seasons. Once we finish Halloween, holiday starts ramping up. It’s hard to imagine it accelerating anymore.” The National Retail Federation predicts holiday sales gains of between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent over the 2024 holiday season; Deloitte forecasts 3.1 percent growth. Somewhat less optimistic is Marshall Cohen, chief retail adviser at Circana, who sees retailers posting flat to 2.5 percent growth for holiday 2025. He said that’s based on current trends; consumer behavior from last year; how the calendar falls; the propensity for travel and other expenses cutting into retail spending, and some elevated prices. “Retailers will absolutely push for an early start [to the holiday season] and consumers will respond because they are thinking about price increases and supplies running out. You will see an early start form a promotional standpoint. Then there will be a post-Black Friday lull and a surge in shopping in the last week, but that lull after Black Friday is getting deeper,” he said. Asked if the back-to-school season is a barometer for how the holiday season plays out, Cohen said, “It is sometimes an indication of good things, it tells you the willingness of the consumer to engage, look for a deal, buy higher price or new product, and where and how the consumer is shopping. Back-to-school is definitely a strong indicator of things to come but not necessarily foolproof.” “We have always felt that the back-to-school season is a good but imperfect predictor of subsequent holiday sales,” said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, the consulting and research firm. He said he’s “cautiously optimistic” about the holiday season, partly because shoppers have shown resourcefulness and resilience ever since the COVID-19 bounceback by retailers in late 2020. “There are four key macro ingredients to a successful holiday landscape,” Johnson explained. “There has to be solid disposable personal income growth, which year-to-date is up 4.5 percent which is solid and consistent with overall holiday sales of between 4 and 6 percent, in nominal numbers.” Factoring in inflation, 4.5 percent comes out to 1.6 percent to 1.7 percent real sales growth, he added. “The second macro factor is that consumers have money in hand to spend — the dry powder. We believe the personal savings rate is a nice solid 4.7 percent and that compares to last year’s 3.8 percent. “The third factor is you have to have newness, in both format and fashion. We are seeing a lot of new openings by stronger players,” Johnson said, also pointing to the teen market with such players as Abercrombie & Fitch partnering with the NFL. “Retailers doing joint marketing do bring some newess,” he said. “The fourth macro factor is there has to be a catalyst that can trigger growth. We think the rebound in the housing market, which just bottomed out, will gain momentum while interest rates slide down further. Once the interest rate hits 5 percent, housing will take off,” spurring sales of home improvement merchandise, consumer electronics and major appliances, he said. On the fashion side, Johnson expects athleisure and footwear to shine this holiday season, including such brands as Free People, Alo and Vuori, which deliver newness. “Strong and consistent transaction growth, not footfall necessarily, is the hallmark of all superior retailers. Look for them to be the winners this holiday season. So it’s Home Depot, Lowe’s, Costco, TJX Cos., Walmart. They all know how to drive growth, and the bigger you are, the more likely you are able to motor through whatever tariff tides come your way. They will work out deals to protect their customers. A lot of them will take cost pressures off the consumer and move it up the value chain,” Johnson said.

Title: BlackRock Holds Back on XRP as ETF Rumors Heat Up for Cardano, Polkadot, and Chainlink

BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has opted not to file for a U.S. spot XRP ETF in 2025 despite the SEC reclassifying XRP as a digital commodity and settling its lawsuit with Ripple. The decision comes as competitors such as Grayscale, Bitwise, and 21Shares aggressively pursue XRP ETF approvals, with market analysts projecting inflows between $4.3 billion and $8.4 billion by year-end. Instead, BlackRock remains focused on its dominant Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF products, citing limited institutional demand for altcoins. While the firm stresses caution, critics warn that hesitation could cost BlackRock market share as rival funds attract institutional investors seeking diversified crypto exposure. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) is becoming one of the hottest altcoin stories of September. Grayscale filed an updated S-1 with the SEC for its proposed Cardano ETF, boosting approval odds on prediction market Polymarket to 87%, up from 63–75%. The proposed fund would trade on NYSE Arca, holding ADA directly with Coinbase Custody providing security. Analysts believe an approval could propel ADA’s price well above $1.00, with potential gains of 40–55% if institutional inflows materialize. Beyond ETF speculation, Cardano continues to build fundamentals with ecosystem upgrades such as smart contract enhancements and the Midnight privacy protocol. Polkadot (DOT) and Chainlink (LINK) have also captured investor attention amid ETF buzz and ecosystem progress. DOT, trading around $3.76, has been resilient, with analysts forecasting steady growth toward $4.20 this year and $6.99–$8.45 in 2026 as adoption of its cross-chain technology expands. Chainlink, on the other hand, surged past $23 in late August after the U.S. Department of Commerce announced it would publish official economic data on-chain using Chainlink’s oracle network. Bitwise also filed for a Chainlink spot ETF, further fueling bullish sentiment. Analysts see potential for LINK to retest highs near $30 if momentum holds. With ETF speculation filling the market, BlackRock’s conservative stance on XRP contrasts sharply with the aggressive push by rivals into Cardano, Polkadot, and Chainlink. As SEC decisions approach this fall, the outcome could redefine institutional participation in the broader crypto market.

Title: OpenAI buys software testing startup Statsig for $1.1B and creates a new role for its CEO

UPDATED 21:39 EDT / SEPTEMBER 02 2025 by Mike Wheatley OpenAI said today it’s buying Statsig Inc. in a $1.1 billion deal that’s just as much of an acquihire as it is about bringing the product testing startup’s technology into its fold. As part of the deal, Statsig founder and Chief Executive Vijaye Raji (pictured), who previously worked as a software engineer at Meta Platforms Inc., will join OpenAI as its new chief technology officer of applications, a new role for the company. He will report directly to OpenAI’s CEO of Applications Fidji Simo, who joined the company from Instacart earlier this year. “As part of this transition, we’re acquiring Statsig, one of the most trusted experimentation platforms in the industry — powering A/B testing, feature flagging, and real-time decisioning for some of the world’s most innovative companies, including OpenAI,” the company said in an announcement. The $1.1 billion price tag matches the valuation of Statsig following its most recent $100 million funding round in May. Because there’s no premium being paid, that suggests Statsig and its investors are confident that OpenAI itself will continue to grow its value. The deal needs regulatory approval to proceed, but that’s expected to be a formality. Once the deal closes, Statsig will continue to operate as an independent entity at its Seattle-based headquarters, serving its existing customers, which include OpenAI. Statsig’s employees will be given the option to transition to OpenAI if they wish. Founded in 2021, Statsig helps customers including OpenAI to test new software features with select groups of users and gather feedback so companies can decide if they need to tweak anything, roll it out as it is, or cancel the new feature completely. The startup counts 155 employees on its books, and after its latest funding round said it plans to grow its team to around 200 by the end of 2026. It’s not clear if it’s still planning to do so. Raji has previously made headlines for implementing what is a relatively unusual policy these days of insisting that all staff work at the company’s office five days per week. By prohibiting remote work, he claims to have created a culture that fosters greater collaboration, speed and innovation. “Working with the incredible team at OpenAI to build AI-powered experiences at scale for people and businesses is a rare and meaningful opportunity,” Raji wrote in a blog post. “Doing that with the help of tools we built at Statsig makes it even more special.” There’s a growing trend among not only enterprises but also software vendors to snap up anyone who’s considered as a “hot AI talent”, said Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. Meta Platforms Inc. ignited the trend in June, when it made a string of moves in quick succession to secure the services of former Scale AI Inc. CEO Alexandr Wang, former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman and then Safe Superintelligence CEO Daniel Gross. “Google has also made moves to bring aboard more AI talent, and now OpenAI is playing the same game,” Mueller said. “Hiring or acqui-hiring talent is the way to go now, and this is how OpenAI’s purchase of Statsig will be seen. But Statsig also provides some valuable capabilities in the area of A/B testing which should be useful, and that points to the growing ambitions of OpenAI in the consumer space.” S. “Soma” Somasegar, managing director of Madrona Ventures and an early investor in Statsig, said in his own blog post that the startup is a natural fit for OpenAI because of its “world-class product velocity” and its obsession with helping customers. He added that Statsig’s data-driven approach has helped it to become one of the leading intelligent application design companies, and believes that OpenAI will help it to “extend its impact while keeping its mission front and center.” OpenAI recently closed on its own, much bigger fundraising in March, which saw it collect $40 billion from investors, bringing its valuation to a sky-high $300 billion. The artificial intelligence giant wasted little time in putting that money to use. Just two months later, in May, it snapped up Jony Ive’s AI devices startup IO Products Inc. for around $6.4 billion to support its efforts to “create a new generation of AI-powered computers.” OpenAI was also said to be interested in buying the generative AI coding startup Windsurf for around $3 billion, but the negotiations apparently broke down. Then, in July, Google LLC managed to entice Windsurf’s co-founders Varun Mohan and Douglas Chen to join its own AI team, as part of a $2.4 billion technology licensing deal. Days later, another AI coding startup called Cognition AI Inc. swooped in to acquire Windsurf, minus its co-founders.

Today, we have the most exciting, the most brilliant, the most notorious Mordy Oberstein on the show. And we’re diving into a provocative topic that should be on every brandbuilderss radar. And that is why brands should stop relying on Google. We’re gonna unpack that with Mordy. Who’s Mordy? He’s a voice many of you will know from the SEO world, if you’re from that space, because he’s a previous head of SEO branding at Wix. He’s the host of multiple marketing podcasts. He’s one of the sharpest minds out there when it comes to decoding search algorithms and the shifting landscape of online visibility. But today, in this episode, it’s not your standard SEO chat, although there’s a place for standard SEO chats, nothing against those. But today on JUST Branding, we’re going to be focusing in on branding and SEO being found online in the age of AI, with the rise of large language models, can’t even say that, LLMs. What does that mean for Discovery, for your brand? What does that mean in terms of traditional thinking about Google, about SEO, about ranking? And what kind of does that mean in terms of your brand? What it might mean in terms of holding your brand back if you’re not embracing some of these new ways of being found? So with all that kind of in place, Mordy, welcome to the show. Wow, that’s quite the intro. Also, like, I’m notorious. Nice, I’m notorious MOB. Yeah, well, you know me, I like to, you know, I like to give us some zip and some vigor. And also, you know, you definitely are notorious. And, you know, I’m thrilled to have you on the show. And so is Jacob. So welcome. Listen, let’s start off with perhaps a provocation. Why shouldn’t brands rely on Google anymore in your view? Because they never should have to begin with. Tell me more. So first, if you’re talking about building a brand, and I’m sorry to tell you, if you’re coming from the SEO space, you’re listening to this, this is going to sound like a heresy. If you’re not, you’re like, this makes good natural sense. Google search is a hard way to build brand. I feel brand is a lot about consistency over time. And search is all about not consistency over time. You don’t know where you’re going to wait, where you’re going to show up, when you’re going to show up. It’s hard to build that consistency, to really build that presence, to really build that connection with your audience through the medium of Google search. That’s hard. I’m just saying it can’t happen or doesn’t help your brand, but building a brand that way, that seems backwards to me. Sure. So how would you put it the other way around? What would you say the focus should be before we dive back into the backwards? So Google always has been, and this is where I think it’s becoming okay, what kind of vehicle? But it’s a vehicle. It’s a vehicle to help you be found. It’s a vehicle to help you spread your content. It’s a vehicle to do a lot of different things. And the conversation around what is Google from a search and traffic point of view has shifted back to, okay, it’s a vehicle, it’s not a be-all end-all. What type of vehicle is it? Is it an AI, I don’t know, 2025 Audi? Or is it a 1987 Chevy? How reliable is it? Yeah, let me ask you about that because, as I said in the introduction, we’re seeing the rise of AI and lots of different things that are coming around. I mean, if we just keep it specifically to Google just for a second, what are the big shifts that you’re seeing in the way that Google itself is working? The biggest shift that I can point to was August 2018. There’s a thing called the MEDIC update. So Google has been doing, so Google has an algorithm, and every once in a while it presses a button and updates this algorithm. Starting in March of 2018, they started to announce what they call core algorithm updates. So they’ve always had core algorithm updates, but a Google spokesperson wasn’t announcing them each time. In March 2018, they started to announce these things. The biggest and most famous one of them is what we call the MEDIC update, which is really the August 2018 core update. It’s a really annoying name to say. Predominantly because it hit what’s called the YMYL space, your money, your life, health, things that impact your health and finances. And what we saw happening with that algorithm was Google was better able in new ways to understand content quality. And since then, it’s been progressively trying to rely less on, to put like, SEO stuff, well, links, all that kind of like SEO stuff, and predominantly on, is the content across the website, not just the web page, is the content across the website good quality? And it’s made certain shifts, it has made certain jumps, and it redefines what quality is. For example, Google has actual raters, I don’t know if people know about this, there are people called quality raters, and they’re paid by Google to look at content, look at a web page, say, is this good or is this bad? Obviously, like, completely oversimplifying this. And they have a set of guidelines called Google’s Quality Raters Guidelines, or the QRG, because we like abbreviations in SEO, everything’s got to have an abbreviation. The raters’ guidelines change over time, and of course, SEOs fight about everything, and is Google using these things that it’s telling its quality raters to look at, is it using it in the algorithm or not? So certain SEOs, no, certain SEOs, yes, certain SEOs, like myself, who cares? Obviously, it’s what they want. So sooner or later, they’re gonna start interjecting it at some point. But those, you can see how Google defines quality content shifting. And it makes so much sense because everyone looks at this like, oh, it’s an AI issue. Right now, it’s happening. It’s not an AI issue. It’s a perfect storm. Google has something that’s called EAT, and I swear I’ll stop with acronyms. It stands for Expertise, Authoritativeness and Trustworthiness. It’s basically a fancy way of saying, is your content not rubbish and is it good? And in whatever year, Google added an extra E for experience, like two or three years ago. So now it’s E-E-A-T, Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Why Experience? And Google wrote a whole blog post. You don’t have to, I’m not like making like, oh no, why do they do that? They have a post about why they did this. And they said, because we see that people are looking for more firsthand knowledge among the search results. That’s Google saying, we have the world’s largest data set and we’re really good at predicting where people are, how they’re behaving and where they’re going. And we see they’re going to TikTok. And that our interpretation of that is they want more firsthand knowledge. So what Google then did was that doesn’t, by the way, that doesn’t exist on the Internet. Because Google didn’t ever incentivize that. Google incentivized for years five ways to show that I have no actual human experience, but we’ll tell you what I think anyway. And it needed to somehow pull that content in. So a fire hose read it onto its result page. And that’s when the whole thing kind of like went topsy-turvy. Because Google’s trying to add content that it didn’t have, and the only way it has is Reddit. And Reddit, I don’t know if anybody likes it, is a sewer. And it literally like just superimposes sewer onto the SERP. Ah, I did another acronym, Search Engine Results Page, the Google page. And then on top of that, now you have the whole AI thing. So it’s a disaster. The perfect storm. The perfect storm of mess and algorithms loving it so far. A couple of other quick things. And so, in relation to the AI overviews that you now start to see, so is that coming from Reddit or is that Google’s own AI engine? How’s that working? So now you’re stuck. Like now, I’ll Google, I’ll say, best place to get a coffee mug. And instead of it going to, first of all, Google will do a show like a landing page that wired.com used to have because everybody should ring for everything. That makes sense. That started to change as a different conversation. And a lot of people, a lot of the rankings you hear people say they’re losing. HubSpot is an example. HubSpot lost all its rankings. HubSpot lost all its crap rankings that don’t actually matter. HubSpot lost what’s the best coffee mug. As that’s happening, it’s harder for me to even rank because what’s showing up for best coffee mug used to be my website. Now it’s Reddit. And everyone telling me where the best coffee mug is. Now on top of that, you have AI overviews. And AI overviews are a mess. They’re pulled in. It’s an LLM. So it’s pulled in from content across the web. They do cite. It’s… I’m going to say something controversial. Is that OK to say anything? Yeah? Sure. Go for it. AI overviews are basically like a bastardized product. And they were never meant to come out. The only reason AI overviews exist is because Chad GPT and Bing beat Google to the punch. There was a famous conference that Bing announced co-pilot. Google had no idea it was coming and they were caught off guard. Google then ran, like, their own event a month, a month, like, two weeks later in Paris, showcasing a bunch of stupid things no one actually cared about. And that’s when the conversation of, ooh, it’s Google dying, started to come out. Two months after that was Google’s big conference, Google IO. They just had one relatively recently. This is IO. 2023. And they announced what was called back then SGE, Search Generative Experience. What is with all the freaking acronyms? SGE became AIO reviews. Why did they announce SGE? They didn’t roll it out. They just announced, like, here’s what it’s going to look like. Because they were getting killed, their stock was getting killed. Because Bing beat them to the punch. ChatGPT beat them to the punch. They had to announce something. Fast forward a year later, they already announced this thing. They have to release it now. Because, like, now what? You announced it a year ago and it’s your next Google IO big conference thing? You didn’t, you’ve done nothing? Got to announce it, otherwise the stock’s gonna crash. So they released it. And that’s why we have AIO reviews. What they really want to release, what they announced this year, which is AI. Mode. AI. Mode is more of a one-to-one competitor with Chad GPT, it’s better in general, it’s still a mess. So check this out. Google is running parallel products that cannibalize each other, on purpose. And at some point, somebody big is gonna lose their job over it. Wowzers, wowzers. All right, okay. Well, pause, pause, pause. Okay, we got a lot of brand builders on the call, right? Listening in on the call, on the show, listening to the show, right? It’s not cool. They’re not calling in. Don’t worry. No, can we take South of Staten Island? I would love to have a call. Yeah, absolutely. It would be great to do a call-in. Sometimes, hang on, actually pin that. We’ll have to do that, Jacob, at some point, do a little LinkedIn call-in or something. But I think what I want to ask is just bring it back down to brand builders just for a minute. In your view, then, what does all of that mean for discoverability, right? Because that’s ultimately, you know, people building brands, they want to make sure that they are salient, they’re in the minds of people, you know, searching for what they’ve got to offer. And obviously, we all hit Google mostly to get to that, you know? So, what does that mean? What does that mean to brands in all this mess and confusion and AI robotics that you’ve been talking about? I always want to be able to roll my Rs and I’m just sitting here jealous. I’ve totally lost it, like you lost it, I don’t even know what to say now. What does it mean to brands? Yeah, so, first of all, for brand builders, this is great, I’m a weirdo. I’ve sat on both the performance side of marketing and on the brand side of marketing. So, I see both sides disturbing. This is great for brand builders. What makes this difficult right now is that you’re dealing with a company who’s not functioning logically, right? They’re not functioning. By the way, if you want, there’s a great interview with The Verge and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, I highly recommend you watch that if you really want to get a nerd’s eye view kind of thing. But they’re not functioning. I want to say a lot. They are functioning rationally, but their context of what is rational, what’s not rational is in a different orbit than us. They’re functioning for their stock price, and they’re functioning in a way that it’s hard to end up saying, what does this ultimately look like? For example, you’re currently running two products. One of these are going to die out. AI Overs are going to die out. It’s very clear. Who’s pretty much basically said it. And they’re going to move to what’s AI called AI Mo, which if you’re in the US, you now have access to it. If you’re not in the US, you can’t see it. But it’s more like a chat GPT-ish kind of thing. So you need to figure out, okay, we want to know is you need to be able to read what the hell is actually going on. Where does this end up? And what does it end up looking like? Because if you’re just chasing like, okay, we need to get into the AI overview. Well, that’s going to go away. Okay, we need to get into AI mode. Okay, so question, if AI mode, which is currently a separate tab, you know, like on Google, you have tabs for images and videos, a separate tab, AI mode. If it replaces AI overviews, there’s not going to be a separate tab for AI mode. As someone who’s worked on products, do you know why there’s a separate tab on the left for AI mode? Because they couldn’t figure out a way to run both products in the same place. And the guy, well, the best place to put it is on the left-hand side up there. It’s not like a strategic decision. It was just a mechanics problem. How does that end up getting integrated into the main SERP, into the main result page? My advice, there are multiple corrections that need to happen. And one correction is that this stuff is very expensive and it’s not going to last for free forever. I always knew it was a data center that cost the most money. I didn’t realize what part of it cost the most money. It’s cooling the data centers. The water cost the most money. And yeah, I didn’t know that like two weeks ago. Someone told me. Right? Super interesting. It can’t last for free. The only reason it’s lasting for free right now is because all of these companies are now, their bottom line is their stock price. At a certain point, the hype dies down and the ability to pump up that stock price with whatever new hype dies down with it. So now you have to switch to a cost flow, I’m sorry, cash flow model. Then this thing comes crashing down, because how do you keep offering for free? They have to monetize it, which they haven’t been able to figure out how to monetize it. So you know, that’s one, you know that it can’t end up looking this way because they haven’t been able to monetize it yet, and they have to figure out how to monetize it. They need to figure out how to bring costs down, which they announced we brought costs down, and then they need to figure out how to monetize it in a real way. I think it’ll probably end up like YouTube, where I run five prompts, and then a big interstitial ad comes up. I got to watch a video or whatever it is, then click skip, and then I get to ask Google the rest of my prompts. The second part of that is, does the AI hype last forever? And I swear I’m going to answer your question. If you think the AI hype lasts forever, then fine. Just optimize to get into whatever this thing is right now. And we can talk about what that would actually mean. If you think the AI hype is not going to last forever, like, any hype cycle, it’s going to die down. I feel like it already is. Now we’re talking about agendic AI. Like here, please take my wallet and spend money all over the internet for me. That’s exact. Sure, that’s a good idea. You already see like the AI, LLM generation, content generation, kind of dying down a little bit, and there’s more and more pushback. My wife’s a great example. She’s a nurse. She went to a conference about how to, what to know about AI as a nurse and she was like, I can’t believe this crap is going on. The world is doomed. So people are more skeptical also. By the way, when you know, people sitting around the dinner table saying, hey, SAI stuff is great, huh? And then when they have to hand over their credit card so it can buy new pants for it online, I don’t know how like, yay, hey, great. It’s gonna be the same way. Like people are funny when they have to open, they hand over their credit card number, which means, and Google was asked this in the interview I referenced, wow, I’m really going like full circle on full circle on full circle. And their CEO said he doesn’t think that the era of exploration is over, meaning I just want an answer and I’m done. But that’s what AI currently does. And I’m a former teacher and I’ll tell you, like, I don’t believe that. I don’t believe that human mind is constructed. I don’t want to know anything. Just give me the answer on what I’m done. What I’m done. For certain things, it definitely wants that. For certain things, you want to be able to explore more things. I had like a small medical issue. I don’t know, like, come on. It’s like, no big deal. I’m fine. I didn’t want the typical answers and the typical websites Google was giving me. I wanted to go a little bit deeper and explore. So what I think the AI is going to end up looking like, and this is probably a good point to, like, discuss, when Google announced Gemini originally, which is their AI property, they showcased, they can’t do it yet. They have experimented with it a little bit. It showcased an example. If I ask it one question, I get one set of results that formatted one way. So if I ask it, like, what’s a great idea for a nine-year-old girl’s birthday party on the beach? And the layout and the type of results match that type of query, of search. Where if I ask it, what’s the best beard to, what’s the best brush to brush my beard with? It might list a totally different set of examples, and in a different layout all together. I think that’s where we’re heading. We’re headed to a place where it’s almost like a content portal. It’ll give you a summary, whatever you want, the LLM. You could explore more, but it’s going to open entry points so that you can explore deeper, which means that we’re about to enter an era, I think, of not expansion, the web is shrinking, which is another point we could talk about, but refinement. And if you want to, if you want your brand to align with what’s happening and getting into these LLMs, it’s about honing down that brand identity so that people, first of all, that you know who the hell you are, which is a whole conversation we can talk about is a mess, so that your audience knows who you are, so they can start talking about you across the internet, and then the LLMs can pick up on all of that. sponsored message Wow, there’s a lot there. There’s a lot of time back. Just a quick reminder, the Brand Builders Summit is back this September 16 to 19. It’s free online and features 40 branding legends covering strategy, design and business. Head over to brandbuilderssummit.com to grab your free ticket. Now back to the show. Mordy, I have to ask about this shrinking internet thing, because as far as I understand, like the internet is like just getting spammed with so much content that it’s just like expanding. And so I’d love to hear your take on that. So this is great. I mean, it’s not great. Depends how you look at it. It’s interesting, put it that way. So, the verge, I forgot his name, Vilai Patel asked Google this question. He asked the CEO of Google this same question. He said, is it harder for people to get traffic? Are things just seem to be like constricting? He goes, no, we’re in an expansionary era right now. And his answer back was, there are more web pages than ever. That’s not what he asked. He asked more traffic. Yeah, there’s definitely more web pages than ever. There’s not more traffic than ever. So, I have data in this. I used to be the head of ComBit Center, which I still consult for Center, which is like an SEO data tool thing. I still spill the beans that I’m talking about doing next week, but maybe this is not going to come out before then. So, I’m not spilling beans, tea. I don’t know what people say anymore. But basically, the data shows and they talk about this in the interview. The web is kind of just plateaued. Like, you always think about it, the web should be like the stock market is always going up, which if you’re ever in the stock market is not how it works. Since COVID, so COVID was the peak, you could see web traffic, however you slice it, whether it’s like total traffic across the web, average monthly visits a site is going to get, comes down after 2021 or the middle of 2021, and it levels out. Over the course of 2024, there’s a 2% difference between where it was in 2021, meaning it’s leveled out and we have 2% growth in three years, which is nothing. 2% is like what I have in my milk. That’s not growth. So we’re pushing more and more and more content out there, more content than ever. And it’s stagnating, which to me says that it’s shrinking because we’re propping it up with all this content and it’s still not growing and it’s still stagnating. All right. Curious. Bad news for the bears, I guess. Yeah. Good news for your brand though, I feel like. Why is that? Because if you can double down and have some real identity, people understand who you are, they can connect with you, you have some kind of reason to exist that has a level of depth, a level of meaning to it. And you’re refining that. First off, you’re so far ahead of the curve right now. And you can stand out because no one’s doing that. But you can’t get found in search, so is it relevant anyway? Yeah, there’s a lot of ways to get found. sponsored message Yeah. Well, let’s talk about traditional SEO, because we’ve talked about AI and Reddit just pushing out results further and further on the page. Is there any room for traditional SEO? Has it evolved into anything else? What’s your take? It depends, is always the SEO answer. If you’re a technical SEO, so you’re somebody who makes sure that you’re working for CNN, I don’t know, or one of these big news websites, thousands and millions of pages, and you’re making sure that their pages can be crawled and indexed by Google, they’re served quickly to users, all those technical things, that’s very much still a job. Like in and of its own right, regardless of any of this, you need someone to make sure that all of these bots can come access, crawl the page, and do whatever they do with it, whether it’s an LLM bot or whether it’s Google, whether it’s Bing, whatever it is. So that’s definitely still a thing. The traditional SEO of going out there and like, you know, we’re going to change the heading on the page and we’re going to go after SEO keywords. I think that was stupid for a long time. I think it’s really stupid now. And for a variety of reasons. One is that’s not how LLMs work. Let’s assume for a second that there are no more links on the page. Everything is just the AI answer. The LLMs, ChatGPT isn’t looking at you like Google’s looking at you. Google’s looking at you, your page, the rest of your pages to make sure that they’re all quality. So not sending the user to a bad website, which has one great page, but a decent site overall. Chat GPT is like a much more fanned out, wider lens kind of angle on the Internet. And how does the Internet understand you? Which comes much more valuable, much more valuable what other people are saying about you than what you’re saying about yourself. I’ll give you an actual case. First off, that was always Google’s main thing in the algorithm. Their whole difference way back in the day was, you know, Yahoo, Alta Vista, all those Ash Jeeves. The reason what made Google better was Google was looking at links and was looking at links like a vote of confidence. If somebody is linking to this website, it must be they like this website. So it was always more important what other people said than what you were saying yourself. What happens in LLM land is, if it’s just me talking about myself and I’ve seen cases like this, so if I ask whatever LLM, AI mode or ChatGPT, a really niche question about my brand, it’ll pull up what I have on my website and it’ll source me as the source. That’s not what you want. You want other people seeing you as the source and writing about you, because when they broaden out a little bit, let’s take this podcast. If I, on your website, have, you know, JUST Branding Podcast, all the information about it. And if I went to ChatGPT and said, tell me everything I need to know about JUST Branding. So, Google, Google, well, Google possibly be using AI mode or whatever, would source your website and would show you everything about it. But then if I zoomed out and said, what are the best branding podcasts? What you wrote on your website is now not nearly as important as what everybody else is running on their websites about you. And I think that’s where SEOs are having a hard time, because it doesn’t become the website anymore. On that note, right, folks, please just, you know, jump on your websites and say something nice about JUST Branding, just putting it out there and that would be helpful. But no, no, absolutely fascinating. I like that idea of like a wider lens, like it’s going to become, I guess what we’re saying here, and I think this was always the case with Google, like and search just generally for brands. It’s stopping you faking stuff, isn’t it? It’s top, you know, everyone’s trying to play the game. And this was my impression of SEO, like, you know, over the last 20, 30 years as it came online. And it was like, oh, the meta tags, keyword searches. You know, it was all very technical, but why were we doing it? We were doing it to play the game, to play the algorithm, to get ourselves higher up in the rankings. And as you say, Mordy, like that’s completely changing. And I know, you know, I actually wanted to kind of ask you, Jacob, something about that, because I know over the years, you really did play that game, if I can call it that, really, really well. You’re probably one of the best kind of SEO experts that I look to, you know, in our space, in the branding space. In fact, a little quick, tiny segue here, a little story. So many people won’t know this. Shall I tell this story, Jacob? Yeah, go for it. I’m telling it real quick. So I used to run an agency, okay? And this is maybe going back 20 years, right? A creative agency. And we used to, I used to have someone on my team and they used to look at search engine rankings of our company’s kind of rankings. And so for example, we’re looking at phrases like graphic design, you know, that brand identity design, that kind of stuff. And we had like a selection of 20, 30 hit, hit, you know, key phrases we wanted to rank for globally. And I used to keep going into these meetings every month as the founder and director of the business. And we kept getting knocked off. We were number one for ages on some of these phrases. We kept getting knocked off, kept getting knocked off. And the same kind of website kept knocking us off. And that website was JUST Branding, not JUST Branding, JUST Creative. So I used to like, and I’m like, who is this JUST Creative? So I used to, I found it’s this Jacob Cass, absolutely hate his guts, like keeps knocking me off, keeps knocking me off. And then eventually I sold that business and moved on and reached out. I was reaching out to people who I admired and, you know, I reached out to Jacob and he was so generous to kind of start a conversation. And that eventually led to this podcast starting. So just a little little side side there. Jacob, I know you were very successful and then, you know, things changed. So I wondered if you could kind of put a highlight on it. Mordy, so just for context here, a couple of years ago, we probably peaked at about a million page views a month for our design blog called JUST Creative. And we’re running an affiliate model. And also we had a lot of articles for designers and creatives focused on logos, branding. But we also had a segment focused on, you know, best laptops for designers. And it was like listicle articles. And it was very heavily focused on affiliate revenue through partners like Amazon and Vado and creative marketplaces. So we scaled that. I had a team of about 10 people. It was like hockey stick growth for a number of years. And then it all came crashing down, lost like 95% of the traffic. We tried to rectify it, but the game just totally changed. Google pushing up or removing affiliate-driven sites, pushing folks like Reddit and even LinkedIn and community forums that are being buried on the internet up number one. And like we just got pushed back to pages like far below. Oh man. That’s rough by the way. It was rough. Yeah, I’m feeling like the pain. That’s so hard. Yeah, so I wasn’t the only one, but that kind of pivoted me into, well, not forced me into a corner, but it made me pivot to other things, right? Because that was a big passive income stream and it’s where a lot of my client leads came from. It was all organic. I didn’t have to do outreach or anything. So I’ve got to mention that. Yes, we had the blog, but it was also a lead pipeline for my whole business. So things just had to change and we moved to social and so forth. That’s what’s hard about it though, because it does like when organic performs, organic is great. It’s slow, it’s steady, it’s consistent. You don’t have to do much. It’s there and it’s there and it’s doing its thing, but you really are at the mercy. So Google, for context, Google had this thing called the product review update, which eventually became the review update. Google went to war. Google went to war with affiliate marketers. Yep, we lost. Everyone lost but Google. Just trying to fight town hall or city hall. You don’t win. Yeah. We fought it for a couple of years and you had some little uptakes and we were back. And then another update comes in like, damn it, we’re down again. So yeah. But yeah, it was a good experience but things have changed. Things are changing and I think what it is is, as I say, you can’t play the system anymore, can you? And it’s a tough one. So with that in mind, I have a question, Mordy. Top tips. You’ve sort of given a few, but if you were to keep it tight, right? I’m a brand builder, I’m in marketing, I’m working with my company. Like, what would you suggest in this new world of perplexity, chat, GTP, Google AI? Like, what should we be focusing on just broadly? Can I give you a real example? I hope they’re not listening. Maybe they are listening. So Wix announced something called Wixel, which I thought was like, it was going to be something else. I remember this product they were building and I was still there. And then I saw, I’m like, no, this is not that. It’s a Canva competitor. I’m like, no, that’s not, you should not be doing that now. What you should be doing is Wix is great. Like my, I’m not saying, like I work, because I don’t work there anymore. I’m saying, because it’s a really good platform and I have my website built on it. Wix is great at being Wix, so be Wix. Stop trying to expand out and I, my whole thing is we’re fine down better into who you are and what you do and do that better. And now, when you do that as a net outcome of that, you start building up cache, right? Like all these things, LLMs, search engines, they’re just, they’re just digital moths. And whoever has the strongest, greatest, best presence possible on the, what they’re going to be attracted to. If you’re spreading your wings all over the place, they can’t figure out, what the hell are you? Are you a website builder? You can have a competitor? Like, what, what, what are you? What are you about? It’s going to be way harder, way harder to get an LM to figure you out. Yeah. It’s gonna be hard for Google. Yeah. The problem with that is, especially in a larger organization, is the internal comps part, is getting everybody on that same page. I always have this thing that SEO should really exist under comps. It doesn’t. SEO exists under performance, and performance kind of does its own thing. And people don’t realize, it’s really, I call my thing Unify. Performance teams don’t talk to brand teams. Those don’t. You’ll have a brand team build out in an LP, and the performance team, the SEO team will manage the blog, and they can be talking about the same product in two completely different ways. And that doesn’t work right now. Everyone needs to be on the same page. There has to be strong identity. When I say like, oh, it’s great, like, you know, the fact that the Internet is constricting, I think that’s a good thing. I think a lot of the content people are creating, what you were saying before, it wasn’t there to help users. It was there so I could rank for a keyword. It was there so I can get traffic. It wasn’t really there to help people. So, the fact that we’re in an era of refinement, I think is a good thing for the user. I mean, not a good thing for digital marketers, but if you will like, in marketing, I feel like there’s always like a motion. It’s very philosophical, like I’m trying to get into Aristodilian like emotions of the world, but there’s always motion. The motion like for the last 10 years is expand, cast a Y net, get more. I think the motion that we’re in now is refinement. AI is going to help you refine what you’re looking for, to help you refine what’s out there, to help you get something that’s more refined and personal to what you’re looking for. And if marketers can get refined and aligned, I think you’re so far ahead of the game. Because people naturally don’t want to refine, they want to expand, and teams have a very hard time seeking up in a real way. So, Mordy, what’s that look like in reality when you say refined, like as a brand or a product? It would be instead of Wix going out, like creating a Wixel as a competitor to Canva, I was saying like, whatever, Canva’s got what it’s got. What do we do to, like, who are we as a website builder? What are we actually really all about? Because I think it’s like, I know it’s not like a silly question, but brands don’t do that enough, I feel like. And when they do do it, it’s usually not with enough depth, and they get distracted. It’s like, why do I see all these companies going after AI this and AI that? In my opinion, it’s just my take. It’s because these companies never really have strong brand identity to begin with. They didn’t really know who they were, and they didn’t know, wait a second, like, that’s not who we are. We have to not stray off. Yeah, we should get into AI, but what’s within our wheelhouse? What’s not within our wheelhouse? And companies getting back on that and figuring, okay, who we are, how do we double down on that? How do we make that better? How do we create services that maybe they’re different services, but they still support that same idea? I remember when I was back at a company called Rank Ranger, they got an SEO rank tracking team. They got about a similar web a couple of years ago. They were dev teams, and dev teams do this, by the way, if you’re listening. They were just building for the sake of building. Google does it all the time. And instead of building a product with a roadmap where one thing built on the other thing that help you create product identity, they were just kind of all over the place. And it worked back then because the internet was so, the industry there was so big, it was fine. I wouldn’t do it like now. Everything needs to be strategic to build up that identity of who you are and what you’re about so that you stand out and that you’re remembered. Can I ask another question, Mordy? So, what do you think about brands investing in… You know, we talked about Google being a middle man, right? Or middle person, you know, a middle being, entity. And therefore, we can’t control it, right? And you talked at the start about, you know, it’s evolving itself, and it probably doesn’t quite know how it’s going to end up just yet either. So, there’s a lot of unknowns if we focused on trying to show up in AI and so on. But what about the flip side of that, which is stuff that we can control? So, what do you think about brands focusing on the stuff that they own, their channels like their email, community building, that kind of stuff? Do you think that that is of value to brands? Yeah, I think it’s all of value to brands. I think it’s what’s valuable to brands. And again, I feel like with this kind of question, there’s so many different… This is my perspective on it. I don’t like how I’m like, this is the perspective, this is my outlook, my perspective on this. If I worked at MailChimp, I would probably say the opposite of this. Yeah, I think email is great. And I think the problem with things like email is, okay, yeah, so I have them, I own the audience. You know, never own your audience. This is a weird way of thinking. But how do you get the email list? Like, there’s like an email list fairy, boop, they have an email list. I think everything always comes back to understanding, again, building up that momentum based on who you are. And you can use, by the way, like, I’ll give you a good example of this, where you can use the LLMs to figure that out. Like, where in my industry is there a ton of skepticism and hesitancy to consume, like to buy the product or the service, that no one else is talking about? And Gatorade is a good example of this. Turns out when you ask LLMs if Gatorade is good or not, like, what should I know about Gatorade? It tells you, yeah, it’s like, yeah, great if you have like a really great workout, but it’s got a ton of sugar in it. And then if you ask Gatorade, which is better? Drinking Gatorade or drinking vitamin water? It’ll say after an intense workout Gatorade, but for most other cases, drink vitamin water. Guess how many times? And that’s a real thing. The LLM is a proxy of the web. And that’s gonna be one of the things to realize. Sometimes AAAA, non-alcoholics anonymous, nor the American Automotive Association. Sometimes AI and LLMs hallucinate, but sometimes they’re actually just serving as a representative of the entire web. They’re saying and summarizing what the web is saying about Gatorade in this case. And if you could pull out Gems, like, huh, when I asked the same thing about Powerade and all the other competitors, this thing about the health thing keeps coming up. But no one, guess how many times Gatorade mentions the word health on their website? Did you say zero? Zero. Zero times. Vitamin water also, zero times. They say that you shouldn’t drink it because it’s from New York. I’m like, I’m from New York and the East River is disgusting. If I was a website in that health drink space, I would use AI and I would use LMS to realize like, wait a second, there’s a brand gap here that we can totally capitalize on and talk about. So it’s less about, do I get into the AI? Do I build on my email list now? What do I do on social? It’s about getting ahead of the things that actually relate to your user concerns and pain points and skepticism and actually getting ahead of and talking about it. And now you want to talk about what’s the best way to distribute that? Is that through email? Is it through running a blog post? Is it if I saw one, it was, I asked AI who makes seatbelts? Random, I know, but it listed a bunch of companies. And then it had other no issues in Google’s AI mode, other notable company and elicited another company. Other notable company is like me asking you like, hey, do you want to go out? And you saying when hell freezes over and then me saying, so you’re saying there’s a chance. Other notable company, like I already saw 10 notable companies. I don’t want the other notable company. If I was that company, I would even start online. I would start like networking in Washington, DC and getting in front of Congress to testify about all the data I have about seatbelt studies and seatbelt safety and using that to create momentum and then case studies and whatever online. So yeah, email is great, communities are great, social is great, search could be great. But unless you have that real brand foundation there to begin with, none of it matters. Nice. So we’re starting to come to the end now, and I just wanted to ask you a couple of other quick questions about the future, a way you’ve hinted at this. But imagine we’re fast forwarding, that’s better, three years’ time, right? What, you know, some of these things have been resolved. What does success look like for brands online? Like, how do we actually imagine the future to be? I mean, we’ve got Alexa, we’ve got Voice, you know, we’ve not even got Clicks anymore, you know, coming into the picture. Like, what does this start looking like in your view? I mean, three years from now, success for me looks like I haven’t lost all my hair. You and me both, man. Yeah, I’m just like telling you straight up. I think it looks like direct traffic, which people, it’s funny because like SEO performance, people always crapped on direct traffic the most, because it is, analytically speaking, a black hole. Anything that’s not, you know, attributed to Google, attributed to social, attributed to a source, just ends up in direct. But to me, direct is also brand traffic, right? Where, like, where was it? Cheers, like, you want to go where everybody knows your name, right? No one ever said you want to go chasing people around the internet like a chicken with your head cut off screaming your name. That’s not the end goal. The end goal is to have people come to you to be a destination. So it’s leveraging all of these things. It’s leveraging people, oh, there’s no more clicks. There’s no more, for them, it clicks for a long time in a lot of things, like Google weather in New York City, Google Yankee score. There hasn’t been a click in, I don’t know, 10 years. So it’s not a new thing. What I think success looks like is I go and I’m like, all right, where’s a great place to get notepads? I need new notepads, by the way. Like I’m too cheap to buy the good ones. I’m waiting to go to the next conference to go to the vendors and steal the good ones, which is sad, it’s pathetic, but it’s my thing. Where do I get a good note? But which conference has the best vendors that offer the best notepads? That’s the conference I want to go to. And I see a thing in the LLM, and I see a thing here, and I see a thing on social, and then eventually, you know what? I keep seeing, you know, I don’t know, like whatever conference, Bob’s conference show up. They’re the ones with the best notepads for free. All right, so let me Google Bob’s notepads. And Rand Fishkin, if you know, if you’re listening, who Rand Fishkin is, but Rand is an amazing marketer. He has originally started one of the SEO companies a long time ago. And he talks about how everyone attributes traffic to Google, because Google is the greatest source of traffic. But that doesn’t mean that’s where it started. You could have saw me on social, Googled me, found my website, went to my website. That traffic analytically gets attributed to Google, but it’s not really Google traffic, is it? Success in the future looks something like that, because the funnel is messy. It’s always been messy. I argue that really, is it a funnel to a certain extent? I think that’s a whole myth. But people see you, they know what you’re about. You have a certain level of identity distinction and they’re coming to look for you. They’re typing your website’s name, forget Google, directly into the browser and going to your website. So to summarize, we should be focusing on being known, right? Not just being found, right? Like work on the basics, work on adding real value out there so that people are talking about you. That wider lens becomes more authentic and true and then we’ll find success, which is what in terms of brand building, brand strategy, the long-term game we’ve always been advocating for as brand builders. But it’s so tough to do, isn’t it? So it’s going to take a bit of readjustment and movement. I want to thank you so much, Mordy, for coming on the show. It’s been really exciting and enlightening. Jacob, anything last from yourself or any final questions from you? I think there was one little question here. If you had one message for brand builders today, what would it be? One message for brand builders today, identity is everything. It’s everything. It will get you so off course if you don’t have it. And if you haven’t tapped into it in a meaningful way, the problems that you’re going to end up with are, you’re going to end up chasing whatever iteration of Google’s AI, whatever is out there. And there will be iteration after iteration after iteration. You won’t have the ability. I hate the Wayne Greskey analogy, like skate towards the puck. You won’t have the ability to do that. Also, I don’t know if Wayne Greskey actually said that or not. I don’t know. Then ask me. All right. Brilliant. And just to wrap up, where can people connect with you? Tiktok. No, I don’t have a Tiktok account. I don’t fall downstairs and I don’t sing or dance. So, LinkedIn. You can find me on LinkedIn, on my website, univitebrandmarketing.com. I’m kind of on Twitter, but not as much as I used to be. Amazing. Well, thank you so much for coming on, Mordy. You’ve been brilliant. The audience have been listening and we want to thank everybody for tuning in as well. We’re ever so grateful.

The company is rolling out a hybrid index called “Mag 7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures,” and it will track “Magnificent 7” stocks, Coinbase’s own shares, and BlackRock’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, according to a blog post. Each of the index’s components are weighted equally, meaning a change in Bitcoin’s price will have a similar effect on the index as a change in the price of Nvidia’s shares. In addition to the chipmaker, the index tracks Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla shares. The index uses BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust and iShares Ethereum Trust ETFs for tracking the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Both products debuted in the U.S. last year, and they have generated billions of dollars of inflows. The company plans on sharing more details about trading the index on “partner platforms,” suggesting that the product won’t be available through Coinbase’s app initially. The index is set to launch on September 22. Decrypt reached out to Coinbase for comment but did not immediately receive a response. Coinbase shares were little changed on Monday at $304.40, according to Yahoo Finance. The San Francisco-based firm’s stock price has rallied 22% year-to-date. This year, Coinbase has leaned into its derivatives arm as an area of growth. In May, Coinbase unveiled a $2.9 billion deal to acquire the options exchange Deribit. It is fairly commonplace for crypto exchanges to offer futures outside the U.S., but amid tension between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the practice has been mired in regulatory uncertainty for years. Crypto exchange Kraken debuted U.S.-regulated crypto derivatives in mid-July. At the time, it said “commodity, fixed income, FX and equity futures” were coming, in a blog post. In March, Kraken said it would buy NinjaTrader, a futures broker, for $1.5 billion. Prediction markets have also been buying firms that offer derivatives in the U.S., such as Polymarket. Last month, the firm said it was purchasing derivatives exchange QCX for $112 million, describing it as a key move for returning to U.S. markets.

Coinbase will launch Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures to create the first US-listed futures product that combines traditional equities and crypto exposure, according to a Sept. 2 announcement. The product will debut on Sept. 22, arriving less than two months after Coinbase began offering CFTC-regulated perpetuals to US customers in July. The hybrid index tracks 10 equally weighted components: the seven largest US technology companies, known as the “Magnificent Seven,” Coinbase’s own stock, and BlackRock’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Each component represents 10% of the index, with quarterly rebalancing to maintain equal weightings. The Magnificent Seven stocks include Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, NVIDIA, Meta, and Tesla. The cryptocurrency exposure is provided through the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) and the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA), offering indirect access to the two largest digital assets by market capitalization. Coinbase positions the product as addressing investor demand for dual exposure to traditional financial instruments and digital assets. The company stated that no US-listed derivative previously offered access to both equities and cryptocurrencies within a futures product. Please add [email protected] to your email whitelist.

The launch builds on Coinbase’s derivatives expansion following its July introduction of CFTC-regulated perpetual contracts for US customers. Those products offer up to 10x leverage with 0.02% fees on major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Coinbase frames the equity index futures as marking “the next evolution of our product suite” and paving the way for multi-asset derivatives that broaden access and efficiency for investors.

September 02, 2025 17:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. Litigation Attorneys Encourage Investors Who Suffered Losses IRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in IRobot between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648 NEW YORK, Sept. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Title: S&P 500 Gains & Losses Today: Kraft Heinz, Nvidia Fall; Ulta Beauty Stock Recovers

U.S. stocks lost ground on the first trading day of September. The S&P 500 ended Tuesday's session down 0.7% as the markets returned to action following the extended Labor Day weekend. The Dow slid 0.6%, while the Nasdaq dropped 0.8%. Chip stocks retreated, with Nvidia (NVDA) slipping 2% in Monday's session. Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here. The labor market is likely to be in focus during the shortened trading week, with investors looking toward Friday morning's release of an August jobs report that could have major implications for Federal Reserve policymakers deliberating possible interest-rate cuts at their meeting later this month. Shares of Kraft Heinz (KHC) tumbled 7%, falling the furthest of any S&P 500 stock, after the packaged food giant announced a plan to separate its North American grocery business from its sauces and spreads unit. The grocery business includes Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles, and Lunchables, while the larger sauce-focused company will remain the home of Heinz ketchup, Philadelphia cream cheese, and Kraft Mac & Cheese. The announcement of the split-up, which the company expects to close in the second half of 2026, came a decade after the megamerger between Kraft and Heinz created one of the world's largest food companies. Alcoholic beverage maker Constellation Brands (STZ) cut its adjusted profit guidance, citing tariff impacts and slumping beer demand. The maker of the Modelo and Corona beer brands now anticipates a 2% to 4% decline in beer sales in fiscal 2026 as macroeconomic uncertainty weighs on consumer spending. Constellation Brands shares sank 6.6% on Tuesday. Shares of Albemarle (ALB), the world's largest lithium miner, lost 6.3%. Baird analysts raised their price target on Albemarle stock ahead of the holiday weekend, highlighting a recovery in lithium prices following capacity cuts by a major producer in China. However, Baird maintained its "underperform" rating on Albemarle stock, citing limited visibility into the dynamics of the lithium market and uncertainty surrounding Chinese government policy. Shares of beauty products retailer Ulta Beauty (ULTA) jumped 8.1%, notching the S&P 500's top daily performance to claw back the heavy losses posted Friday at the end of a volatile week of trading. Ahead of the holiday weekend, Barclays analysts raised their price target on Ulta shares, pointing to the cosmetic company's strong second-quarter results as well as positive strategic initiatives under CEO Kecia Steelman, who took the reins at Ulta at the beginning of 2025. Biogen (BIIB) received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for an injectable version of Leqembi, a treatment for Alzheimer's disease produced by the biotech company in collaboration with Japanese pharmaceutical firm Esai. Whereas patients previously needed to travel to an infusion center for a time-consuming process twice per month, Leqembi can be taken at home via a weekly under-the-skin injection. Biogen shares jumped 5.6% on Tuesday. Shares of fashion company Ralph Lauren (RL) advanced 4.8% to reach an all-time closing high. The company received a boost last week when a dress made by Ralph Lauren was featured in engagement photos released by the superstar recording artist Taylor Swift.

Skip to comments. Posted on 09/02/2025 1:39:58 PM PDT by CFW A federal judge ruled Tuesday that Google can keep its Chrome browser but will be barred from exclusive contracts and must share search data. Alphabet shares popped 6% in extended trading. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled against the most severe consequences that were proposed by the U.S. Department of Justice, including selling off its Chrome browser, which provides data that helps its advertising business deliver targeted ads. “Google will not be required to divest Chrome; nor will the court include a contingent divestiture of the Android operating system in the final judgment,” the decision states. “Plaintiffs overreached in seeking forced divesture of these key assets, which Google did not use to effect any illegal restraints.” (Excerpt) Read more at cnbc.com ...

Title: The Problem Is Solved by Art, Not Science

Time Published: 2025-09-02T20:00:00Z

Editor Solutions Brownstone Institute, Jeffrey A. Tucker So much of what is considered science today is really just art. It’s a subjective interpretation of the meaning of data. Data does not speak for itself. It does not tell you cause and effect. It provides no predictive map for the future. It’s often incorrect or merely a proximate rendering of the full reality. Even the best and most experienced experts and invested stakeholders cannot overcome this problem. The implications of this insight are vast. Let’s start with an easy example. Did you see Gladiator II? It had many of the same actors as the first movie that swept the awards and captivated audiences worldwide. It had bloody fight scenes. It had great music. It had creepy relationships, wicked power plays, feats of derring-do, displays of all kinds of cruelty and heroics, plus CGI of a recreated Roman Colosseum, this time with the floor flooded with water for a sea battle. And yet the movie left audiences with not much. The experience was overall evaporative and the message elusive. The magic was missing. That special story arc of drama that swept us up in the first was strangely absent. At some point halfway through – and speaking as someone who loved the first – it struck me that I could walk away and not really care how it ended. This often happens with sequels. It’s not just because the directors and producers see an easy buck by roping in audiences to throw down for tickets, hoping to relive the experience of the first. Sequels are often a pale copy of the first because the producers, scriptwriters, and directors are themselves not entirely sure why the first one was great. The movie makers can workshop this all day and for weeks. They can gather focus groups. They can talk to experts. They can pay the actors the big bucks. Everyone will have a theory, and they can try to recreate and reboot the thing as best they can. But at some point, no matter how hard they try and with many millions on the line, they leave the magical creative world of art and enter into the mundane task of recreation. With all their efforts, the drama is drained away. No one knows for sure when or how that happens. This example comes to mind in the midst of the continued meltdown over the logo change at Cracker Barrel. It seems obvious in retrospect that eliminating Uncle Herschel (a real person who was the uncle of the founder) and the barrel was a bad idea. It comes at a time of rising nostalgia and deep public suspicion of major corporations and their perceived attack on basic values. Maybe it is not entirely clear why this one logo change would have ignited populist fury in normal times but when you consider the loss of trust in everything, this struck people as deeply offensive. We learn from deeper reports on the decision that it was not arbitrary. The new CEO Julie Felss Masino, hired in 2023, was tasked with bringing back customers and the stock price after it was slammed during Covid lockdowns. That’s a huge challenge for anyone, especially given the roaring inflation that followed the money printing of the period. Julie reached into her communications undergraduate degree and her Master’s of Business Administration and found a possible answer. The goal is to attract a younger generation. She had heard from her social set many times that the union of the word “cracker” with a white guy in overalls has racist overtones. Maybe it refers to cracking the whip. Maybe it is a signal that only whites are allowed. Maybe the overalls suggest it is only for farmers or aging nostalgists. In any case, it seemed obvious to her that an update was in order. Further, the executive team brought in focus groups. They did customer surveys. They assembled all the empirical evidence they could find. In the end, they discerned that they would win more with a change than they would lose from those who would miss the old sign. This intuition was further backed by a plan for interior changes. Down with all the bric-a-brac on the walls and up with a cleaner look of an Apple store. After all, this is where interior design seems to be headed. Shouldn’t Cracker Barrel keep up? And yet, once the announcement was made, the customers and the public were invited to respond. What they saw was one of the few franchises with symbolism that drew on cultural memory and its replacement by the soulless, barren, and deracinated symbolism that has defined so much of what everyone hates about public life today. It suggested that yet another huge corporation was trampling on history, tradition, and meaning. Consumers these days are interested in testing their power in ways akin to voters. They will buy or decline to buy as a way of rewarding or punishing companies that make decisions that affect the aesthetics of public life. We’ve seen this with Jaguar, Bud Light, Target, and many other companies that have run afoul of the emerging public mood that trends toward a kind of restoration. To reward or decline to do so is the very essence of the capitalist experience. It is a manner of taking back power for the people. Companies make mistakes all the time. That’s because marketing is not science. It is art, an extension of human judgment, just like making movies or writing songs. We can flatter ourselves that the answer is always in the data. They can do surveys and focus groups. But often all those techniques can lead managers astray to the point that they land far afield of what could be called common sense. If anyone from Cracker Barrel’s management had entered a restaurant and shown the two images side by side to an average customer, they could have anticipated the uproar. The problem is that ideology is blinding toward reality that any average person can see. The same is true of high-end credentials and impressive resumes. They confer not wisdom but exaggerated confidence in subjective judgment. The career of the new CEO took her from Sprinkles Cupcake to Starbucks to Taco Bell. Surely she has the requisite experience. But what if that experience consisted of working within a tight bubble of influence of people from her social and professional class? After all, she kept trading up in her career and now pulls in $6.8 million a year – not exactly in keeping with the medium family income of the typical customer of Cracker Barrel. The point is that her class and social bubble affected her judgment, as well as those around her. All the data, surveys, and focus groups did not dislodge her prevailing theory that modernization was the key to return to profitability. The test happened in real life: the decision was a calamity. Maybe it pleased BlackRock, which is the largest single stockholder. Maybe it pleased her social set. She was certainly pleased with the decision. But the general public flew into fury. Management and marketing in graduate school is often rendered as empirical sciences. That’s ridiculous but such is the bias of our age. Everyone thinks there is some system, some mechanism, some machine, some data set, that will point the right way. This applies in every area, including infectious disease, pharmacology, government, and thousands of other fields. The belief that the data speaks for itself is the religion of our time. The trouble is that it does not. We are just as controlled by value systems and subjective judgment as were men in the ancient world. All our techniques have changed nothing about this. This week, for example, Brownstone Institute found itself embroiled in a highly technical argument over the RSV shot for babies. An outside committee of the CDC approved it with only two no votes, one member of whom reported real doubts about the data. Sure enough, Brownstone reported the problems, which are highly technical. Then it got worse as more data scientists weighed in. Now there is a genuine question about whether the committee was presented with truthful data. The larger issue is that the manufacturer wanted the shot approved and so did the CDC. The study and data and appearance of science was secondary, a mere veneer to a larger agenda that was driven by a value proposition. They wanted the shot out there. The science was just the excuse. But then it fell apart or, at least, did not hold up to the promise. Now we find ourselves again in the awkward position of having trusted the experts and discovering that this was not a good idea. One of the great books of our age is Tom Harrington’s The Treason of the Experts. He writes from the point of view of the humanities, explaining many of the above points. He explains that everyone is working hard to find the science of what is really an art. This point applies to the healing arts as well. Why did anyone think that locking down society would be good for health? It’s nuts and anyone could have known that, unless the person had a head full of models and maths. The fake science literally blinded the entire world. What’s happened to many brands and to many countries traces to the adoption of a superstition with a scientific veneer. Fortunately, the people have some limited means of making a correction, smacking the fake experts around a bit, and resetting the world to operate in a way that is more humane and intuitively truthful. This could be the next stage of history. With the experts and the science having led us to a place of disaster, the principles, arts, and ethics of old can lead us back to a better place.

CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until September 30, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff.

Title: AI chatbots for doctors are hot. But there’s plenty of value ‘down the stack’ too, argues Corti CEO

Time Published: 2025-09-02T18:28:43Z
Full Content:
Jeremy Kahn is the AI editor at Fortune, spearheading the publication's coverage of artificial intelligence. He also co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. Among the most interesting AI stories this week was an item about a Boston-area startup called OpenEvidence that uses generativeAI to provide answers to clinical questions based data from leading medical journals. The free-to-use app has proved enormously popular among doctors, with some surveys suggesting at least 40% of all U.S. physicians are using OpenEvidence to stay on top of the latest medical research and to ensure they are offering the most up-to-date treatments to patients. On the back of that kind of viral growth, OpenEvidence was able to raise $210 million in a venture capital deal in July that valued the company at $3.5 billion. OpenEvidence is also the same company that a few weeks back said that its AI system was able to score 100% on the U.S. medical licensing exam. (See the “Eye on AI Numbers” section of the August 21st edition of this newsletter.) All of which may explain why, just a month later, the company is reportedly in talks for another venture deal that would almost double that valuation to $6 billion. (That’s according to a story in tech publication The Information which cited three unnamed people it said had knowledge of the discussions.)A lot of the use of OpenEvidence today would qualify as “shadow AI”—doctors are using it and finding value, but they aren’t necessarily admitting to their patients or employers that they are using it. They are also often using it outside enterprise-grade systems that are designed to provide higher-levels of security, data privacy, and compliance, and to integrate seamlessly with other business systems.Ultimately, that could be a problem, according to Andreas Cleve, the cofounder and CEO of Corti, a Danish medical AI company that is increasingly finding traction by offering healthcare institutions “AI infrastructure” designed specifically for medical use cases. (Full disclosure: Corti’s partners include Wolters Kluwer, a huge software company that markets a clinical evidence engine called UpToDate that competes with OpenEvidence.) AI infrastructure is a pivot for Corti, which was founded way back in 2016 and spent the first decade of its existence building its own speech recognition and language understanding systems for emergency services and hospitals. The company still markets its “Corti assistant” as a solution for healthcare systems that want an AI-power clinical scribe that can operate well in noisy hospital environments and integrate with electronic health records. But Cleve told me in a recent conversation that the company doesn’t see its future in selling a front-end solution to doctors, but instead selling key components in “the AI stack” to the companies that are offering front-end tools. “We tried to be both a product vendor for healthcare and an infrastructure vendor, and that meant competing with all the other apps in healthcare, and it was like, terrible,” he says. Instead, Corti has decided its real value lies in providing the “healthcare grade” backend on which AI applications, many of them produced by third parties, run. The backend Corti provides includes medical AI models—which others can wrap user-facing products around—as well as the platform on which AI agents for healthcare use cases can run. For instance, it has built an API called FactsR, which is an AI reasoning model that is designed to check the facts that medical notetaking scribes or clinical AI systems produce. It uses a lot of tokens, Cleve says, which would make it too expensive for general purpose voice transcription. But because of how much is riding on clinical notes being accurate, it can be worth it to a vendor to pay for FactsR, Cleve says.Another example: earlier this summer Corti announced a partnership with Voicepoint, a speech recognition and digital transcription service that is used by doctors across Switzerland. Voicepoint will use Corti’s AI models to help with tasks such as summarization of conversations into medical notes and possibly, in the future, with diagnostic support. To do this though, Corti had to set up dedicated AI infrastructure, including data centers located in Switzerland, to comply with strict Swiss data residency rules. Now, Corti is able to offer this same backbone infrastructure to other healthcare companies that want to deploy AI solutions in Switzerland. And Corti has similar AI infrastructure in place in countries like Germany that also have strict data residency and data privacy rules.Cleve tells me that healthcare is increasingly part of the discussions around “sovereign AI.” This is particularly true in Europe, where many governments are worried about having their citizens’ medical information stored on the servers of U.S. companies, which might be subject to U.S. government pressure, legal or otherwise, to provide data access. “None of these things are doable today, because the majority of all the AI apps are running on OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini, and they are all American companies over which America asserts jurisdiction,” Cleve says.But even within the U.S., strict cybersecurity and patient privacy requirements often mean that using an off-the-shelf, general-purpose AI system won’t cut it. “A lot of customers have requirements like, ‘Hey, we will never want to have data leave premises, or we will never share a tenant, or we will never co-encrypt with our consumer customer on the GPU rack, because we want to know where our data is because we have to prove that to legislators,’” he says. Cleve also tells me that he thinks the giant, general purpose AI builders—the likes of OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google—are unlikely to conquer healthcare, despite the fact that they have been making moves to build models either fine-tuned or specifically-trained to answer clinical questions. He says this is because healthcare isn’t a single vertical, but rather a collection of highly-specialized niches, most of which are too narrow to be interesting to these tech behemoths. The note-taking needs of a GP in a relatively quiet office who needs to summarize a 10-minute consultation are quite different from a doctor working in the chaos and noise of a busy city ER, which are different again from a psychiatrist who needs to summarize not just a 10-minute consultation, but maybe an hour-long therapy session. As an example, Cleve says another Corti customer is a company in Germany that makes software just to help dentists automate billing based on audio transcripts of their sessions with patients. “They’re a vertical within a vertical,” he says. “But they are growing like 100% a year and have done so for several years. But they are super niche.” It will be interesting to watch Corti going forward. Perhaps Cleve is correct that the AI stack is wide enough, deep enough and varied enough to create opportunities for lots of different vertical and regional players. Or, it could be that OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google devour everyone else. Time will tell. With that, here’s more AI news. Jeremy Kahnjeremy.kahn@fortune.com@jeremyakahn Correction, Sept. 3: A previous version of this story misreported the year Corti was founded. It also mischaracterized the relationship between Corti and Wolters Kluwer.

The company said it has begun publicly testing MAI-1-preview, its first large foundation AI model built fully in-house, as well as MAI-Voice, a fast voice generation model that is small enough to run on a single GPU. The new models mark a significant step by Microsoft to reduce its reliance on OpenAI, despite remaining a major investor in the AI company. MAI-1-preview was trained with 15,000 Nvidia H100 chips, according to Microsoft, and will be rolled out for some Microsoft Copilot text tasks in the coming weeks. In the LMArena, a public benchmark for LLMs, the model currently ranks below rival models from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and others. You can read more from CNBC here. OpenAI says it will add parental controls and additional safeguards to ChatGPT. The company said it would, within the next month, allow parents to link their accounts to those of their teenage children, giving them more control over the kids' interaction with ChatGPT. It also said that it would soon institute better safeguards in general, actively screening interactions for signs of emotional distress on the part of users and routing these conversations to its GPT-5 Thinking model, which the company says does a better job of adhering to guardrails meant to prevent the model from encouraging self-harm or delusional behavior. The moves come after a high-profile lawsuit accused the company's ChatGPT model of encouraging the suicide of a 16-year old teen and several other cases in which people allege ChatGPT encouraged suicide, self-harm, or violence. You can read more here from Axios. Anthropic valued at $183 billion after $13 billion venture capital round. The AI company announced that it had raised $13 billion Series F funding round led by the venture capital firm Iconiq, and "co-led" by Fidelity and Lightspeed Venture Partners. A long list of other investors—including Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, Blackstone, Coatue, Jane Street, and T. Rowe Price, among others—also participated. The company, which was previously valued at $61.5 billion in a March funding round, said it now served more than 300,000 business customers and that its Claude Code coding model was currently generating at least $42 million in revenue each month. Anthropic's blog post announcing the funding round is here. X.ai enters the battle for coders with new AI “agentic coding” model. The company debuted its first AI coding model, called grok-code-fast-1, which is supposed to be both “speedy and economical,” according to the company. It is being made available for free for a limited time and is both available on GitHub and through coding “wrappers” such as Cursor and Windsurf. The model is an indication that X.ai founder Elon Musk is serious about taking on OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind across the entire range of AI applications, not just in the consumer chatbot space. It also shows just how intense the competition to capture marketshare among software developers is becoming.

Elon Musk’s AI startup x.AI has filed suit against former engineer Xuechen Li, alleging he stole trade secrets about its Grok chatbot and took them to his new job at OpenAI, Reuters reported. Li was not immediately available to respond to the allegations. The lawsuit follows other legal battles Musk has launched against OpenAI and Apple, accusing them of monopolistic practices and straying from OpenAI’s original mission.Anthropic says it will begin training AI models on user chats unless they opt out. The move is a major shift in data privacy policies for the AI model maker, which also said it was extending the length of time it retained user data to five years. Users can opt out by September 28. Some users and data privacy experts criticized the decision, noting that the design of Anthropic’s “Accept” button could cause many to agree without noticing the toggle that controls data sharing. Others speculated that Anthropic was making the move because it is running out of other ways to obtain enough data to train models that will compete with OpenAI and Google. Enterprise users of Anthropic’s Claude model, as well as government, education, or API users, are not affected. Anthropic says it filters sensitive information and does not sell user data to third parties. You can read more from The Verge here. More evidence emerges that AI may be leading to job losses. Last week in Eye on AI, I covered research from economists at Stanford University whose research indicated that AI was leading to job losses, particularly among entry level employees, in professions that were highly-exposed to AI. This week, more evidence emerges from another well-designed study, this one carried out by the economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Although this study did not look at whether younger and older workers were affected differently, it did examine the link between occupations that had adopted AI most intensively and job losses and found a distinct correlation. The impacts were greatest in occupations that used mathematics and computing intensively, such as software development, and much less in blue collar work and fields such as healthcare that were less prone to being automated with AI. You can read the St. Louis Fed study here. Both the Stanford and St. Louis Fed research suggest that job losses from the implementation of AI are likely to be concentrated in some sectors, and not economy-wide. That said, as good as these studies are, I still think both fail to disentangle the effects of AI from the possible effects of the unwinding of the tech hiring boom that took place during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, many large companies bulked up their software development and IT departments. Major tech firms such as Google, Meta, and Microsoft hired tens of thousands of new employees, sometimes hiring people before there was even any work for them to do just in order to prevent rivals from snapping up the same coders. Then, when the pandemic ended and it was clear that some ideas, such as Meta’s pivot to the metaverse, were not going to pan out, these same companies laid off tens of thousands of workers. I don’t think I’ve seen research yet that can separate the technology sector’s shedding of jobs created during the pandemic from the impact of AI. But I am sure someone is working on it and when they crack that nut, we’ll definitely report it here. Sept. 8-10: Fortune Brainstorm Tech, Park City, Utah. Apply to attend here.

Preventing 'parasocial' chatbots.’ It’s increasingly clear that chatbots can encourage ‘parasocial’ relationships, where a user develops a harmful emotional attachment to the chatbot or the chatbot encourages the user to engage in self-harm of some kind. The parents of several teenagers who took their own lives after conversations with chatbots are now suing AI companies, saying they did not do enough to prevent chatbots from encouraging self-harm. And, short of suicides, there is other mounting evidence of people developing harmful chatbot dependencies.Well, a new benchmark from researchers at Hugging Face, called INTIMA (Interactions and Machine Attachment Benchmark), aims to evaluate LLMs on their “companionship-seeking” behavior. The benchmark looks at 31 distinct behaviors across four different categories of interaction and 368 prompts. Testing Gemma-3, Phi-4, o3-mini, and Claude-4, researchers found that models more often reinforced companionship than maintained boundaries, though they varied: for instance, Claude was more likely to resist personification, while Gemma reinforced intimacy. You can read the Hugging Face paper here.At the same time, researchers from Aligned AI, an Oxford startup I’ve covered before, published research showing that one LLM can be used to successfully screen the outputs of another LLM for parasocial behavior and then prompt that chatbot to steer the conversation in a less harmful direction. Aligned AI wanted to show that major AI model producers could implement such systems simply, if they wished (but that they were too often choosing to “optimize for user engagement” instead.)

A man in his 40s has been arrested after cocaine with an estimated value of €140,000 was seized in Dublin. Around two kilograms of the drug was seized in Blackrock by the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, DMR East Divisional Drug Unit and Revenue officers. The man is currently detained at a garda station in Dublin under Section 2 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996. The drugs have been sent for analysis and investigations are ongoing. Revenue said in a statement that the seizure is part of its "ongoing work targeting smuggling and shadow economy activity". "If businesses, or members of the public have any information, they can contact Revenue in confidence on Confidential Phone Number 1800 295 295," it added. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Former scout leader died by suicide day before trial on sex abuse charges, coroner finds

Time Published: 2025-09-02T17:53:12Z
Full Content:
A verdict of suicide has been recorded at an inquest following the death of a former scout leader who had been accused of the historical sexual abuse of boys in Dublin in the 1980s and 1990s. Neville Kearns (69) died in a single-vehicle collision in Churchtown, south Dublin, shortly after 6am on April 7th last year. He was pronounced dead at the scene. He had been due to stand trial the following day on 113 counts including charges of indecent assault, sexual assault, rape and attempted rape. These related to allegations, made by five complainants, dating back to the 1980s and 1990s. Dublin coroner Dr Clare Keane recorded the verdict on Tuesday, noting the cause of death was thoracic and musculoskeletal injuries consistent with a collision. The inquest heard that when emergency services arrived at the scene they found a red 2002 Toyota Hiace van had crashed into a tree on the wrong side of Churchtown Road Upper. Garda John Culleton said the weather was dry on the morning in question and there was no evidence “whatsoever” of braking on the road. Damage to the vehicle was “concentrated” on the driver’s side, he said. The inquest heard how Kearns was not wearing a seat belt. Emergency services had to remove the door to get Kearns from the vehicle. Paramedics performed CPR, but Kearns was pronounced dead at the scene at 6.34am, the inquest heard. [ The Dublin scout leader who died a day before his trial and the men who accuse him of abuseOpens in new window ] Gda David O’Brien inspected the van after the crash. He said, despite how old the vehicle was, it was “serviceable” and the tyres and brakes were in “good condition”. Gda Culleton said the evidence indicated Kearns most likely turned the van “towards the tree” and the damage caused to the tree indicated the vehicle was “travelling well above the speed limit”. At the time of his death, Kearns was a caretaker at Edenvale Apartments, a gated apartment complex on Grange Road, Rathfarnham, Dublin. He lived in a campervan on the grounds, the inquest heard. The van involved in the collision was a different vehicle to the campervan in which he lived. Biba van Belle, Kearns’s niece, told the inquest she removed his personal belongings from the campervan and a storage facility at Edenvale Apartments following his death. Among the belongings were documents which were later handed over to gardaí. Ms van Belle last spoke to her uncle more than 20 years before his death, the inquest heard. Sergeant Robert Scott from Blackrock Garda station said he spoke to a number of people who had contact with Kearns prior to his death and it appeared Kearns was “trying to get affairs in order”. Sgt Scott told the inquest the documents found in the campervan and shed included a note in which Kearns said he was “tired of it all” and “must bring closure to it all”. A will was found on a table in the campervan, Sgt Scott said, as well as documents showing Kearns’s funeral had already been paid for. These receipts dated from 2020 when gardaí first contacted Kearns about the abuse allegations, the inquest heard. Sgt Scott said gardaí believed the location of the crash was significant as it was close to where Kearns held unofficial scout meetings decades earlier. He said there was “no third-party involvement or anything of a suspicious nature” related to Kearns’s death. He said he believed Kearns had taken his own life. Detective Sergeant Barry O’Connor identified Kearns’s body the following day at the mortuary at St Columcille’s Hospital in Loughlinstown, Co Dublin. Det Sgt O’Connor told the inquest he had met Kearns several times before the man’s death. [ PODCAST: Now he can be named - the Dublin scout leader and the men who accuse him of abuseOpens in new window ] Kearns was a member of the Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland in the 1970s prior to setting up his own unofficial scouting group. One alleged victim told The Irish Times in June how Kearns’s death was “his final act of cowardice”. Imagining what he would have said to Kearns in court, he stated: “You had the opportunity to face up to what you had done, but you chose not to and so you have left a despicable legacy of abuse over decades.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up for push alerts to get the best breaking news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone Listen to In The News podcast daily for a deep dive on the stories that matter © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Why Nvidia and Other Chip Stocks' Slump Is an Opportunity for Investors, UBS Says

Semiconductor stocks are taking a chip out of U.S. indexes to start September—a month that's earned a reputation as the worst for American investors—but for some bulls on Wall Street, that could mean it's time to buy. "We recommend that investors who are underallocated to equities consider phasing in and using market dips to add exposure to preferred areas," UBS analysts said Tuesday, with tech and AI plays among their favorites, while chip stocks dragged on the sector to start the week. Nvidia (NVDA) was one of the worst-performing stocks on the Dow Jones Industrial Average Tuesday afternoon, with shares down nearly 3%. Broadcom (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and other chip stocks were also lower, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) down 2%. Tuesday's slide extended losses late last week, amid uncertainty after an appeals court Friday challenged the legality of the Trump administration's "reciprocal" tariffs, and concerns about America's relations with major trading partners. Treasury yields spiked as bonds sold off, which tends to weigh on the tech sector as higher yields may make growth stocks less attractive. Some investors could also be worried about September's reputation as a tough month for stocks—but that shouldn't discourage them, according to UBS analysts. That's because October and November tend to be strong months for U.S. stocks, they said, with average S&P 500 returns over the past decade of 1.2% and 4%, respectively. Buying in September could help investors position themselves for better performance in the months that follow. UBS also pointed to strong earnings in the second quarter, a robust outlook for AI demand, and expectations of a rate cut later this month as reasons supporting their optimism in the tech sector. "Alongside AI, power and resources, and longevity, we favor US technology, health care, utilities, and financials," the analysts said.

Title: WLFI Slides 15% After Launch As Trump Token Team Eyes Burn Strategy

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. World Liberty Financial’s Trump-linked WLFI token plunged in price after a high-profile debut, prompting its backers to propose an aggressive buyback-and-burn plan to steady the market. According to trading data and market reports, the token briefly traded above $0.30 at launch before falling as much as 15%–30% and settling around $0.21–$0.24 in the hours that followed. Based on reports, the sharp drop followed a large token unlock that added roughly 25 billion WLFI to circulating supply, a move that instantly inflated the paper value of the Trump family’s holdings. That unlock pushed the family’s stake into the billions on paper—various outlets put the tally near $5 billion to $6+ billion depending on the price used. Trading venues including Binance, OKX and Bybit handled early volume, and roughly $1 billion changed hands in the first hour on some platforms, according to coverage of the debut. Reports say early investors were allowed to sell a portion of their holdings, which likely amplified selling pressure as markets digested the newly tradable tokens. In response, World Liberty Financial’s community and team floated a buyback-and-burn program that would route 100% of protocol-owned liquidity (POL) fees from chains such as Ethereum, BNB Chain and Solana toward repurchasing WLFI on open markets and permanently burning those tokens. The aim, according to proponents, is to reduce circulating supply and support longer-term holders. Critics warn that burns funded by fees may take years to materially reduce the massive unlocked supply. Analysts and commentators pointed out a mismatch between headline valuations and the practical reality of supply dynamics. Depending on which price is used, WLFI’s market cap was reported across a wide band—some outlets published peak valuations in the billions, even as price swings kept the effective market cap volatile throughout the day. Reports disclose that the project’s ties to US President Donald Trump and his family have drawn extra scrutiny. Observers say that when political figures hold large token positions, questions about conflicts of interest and regulatory oversight tend to rise faster than normal market noise. World Liberty insists the project is a private venture with governance rules, but regulators and critics have said they will be watching closely. Market participants are now watching vote outcomes and governance updates closely. If the fee-to-burn plan is approved and implemented, it will be measured by how much protocol revenue it can divert into buybacks and how quickly those repurchases can reduce supply.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects.

AI research company Anthropic has secured $13 billion in Series F funding to reach a $183 billion valuation, highlighting investor confidence in its accelerating growth and product strength. The funding round is led by ICONIQ alongside key contributions from Fidelity Management & Research, and Lightspeed Venture Partners, and makes Anthropic one of the most valuable startups in the world. Among the backers are Altimeter, Baillie Gifford, BlackRock, Blackstone, Coatue, D1 Capital Partners, General Atlantic, General Catalyst, GIC, and Insight Partners, among others. The company’s financial performance has surged in recent months. At the beginning of the year, Anthropic reported an annual run-rate revenue of around one billion dollars. By August, that figure had soared to more than 5 billion dollars, a 5x increase in less than 9 months. Anthropic also revealed that it now serves more than 300,000 business customers. The number of large enterprise clients generating over $100,000 in run-rate revenue has grown nearly 7 times in the past year alone. Claude Code, a tool aimed at developers, has emerged as one of its most successful products, generating over $500 million in run-rate revenue. The Series F raise follows a Series E round earlier this year, when Anthropic collected $3.5 billion at a valuation of $61.5 billion. The leap to a $183 billion valuation in just a few months underscores how quickly confidence in the company has grown. Founded in 2021 by former OpenAI researchers, the company has consistently emphasized building systems that are reliable, interpretable, and aligned with human values. With the new capital, Anthropic plans to expand its enterprise footprint, accelerate research into AI safety, and extend its international reach.

Iconiq co-led the round with Fidelity Management & Research Company and Lightspeed Venture Partners, according to the company’s blog post. Other backers include a string of institutional investors, VCs, sovereign wealth funds, private equity, and asset managers, such as Altimeter, Baillie Gifford, BlackRock, Blackstone, Coatue, D1 Capital Partners, Insight Partners, Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, Qatar Investment Authority, and more. “We are seeing exponential growth in demand across our entire customer base,” Anthropic CFO Krishna Rao said in the post. “This financing demonstrates investors’ extraordinary confidence in our financial performance and the strength of their collaboration with us to continue fueling our unprecedented growth.” Anthropic last raised $3.5 billion at a $61.5 billion post-money valuation in March 2025. This latest fundraise comes after reports that Anthropic was nearing a deal to raise between $3 billion and $5 billion in funding at a $170 billion valuation. It also follows impressive growth from the AI startup, which reported a jump in annual recurring revenue from $1 billion to $5 billion over the course of 2025 amid accelerated API usage and enterprise adoption. “Anthropic now serves over 300,000 business customers, and our number of large accounts—customers that each represent over $100,000 in run-rate revenue—has grown nearly 7x in the past year,” the company said in the company blog post. Claude Code is also a developer favorite and one of the main impetuses for Anthropic’s growth. The company said its vibe-coding product already generates more than $500 million in run-rate revenue with usage growing more than 10x in the last three months. But maintaining that growth and competing with rivals like OpenAI, Cursor, and others requires more money, as its CEO Dario Amodei recently confessed in a memo, reported by Wired. He said he wasn’t “thrilled” about taking money from sovereign wealth funds of dictatorial governments, but that it’s difficult to run a business by excluding “bad people” from investing.

It hasn't been an amazing start to the month for stocks. The market is kicking off September in the red, with the Dow dropping more than 500 points on Monday as investors cashed in some of their recent gains and fretted over the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs. But that would be considered par for the course for the stock market, which has historically struggled during the month of September — commonly referred to as the market's weakest month of the year. Historically, the S&P 500 has shed an average 0.7% over the month of September for the last 75 years. In months when the benchmark index lost, the average drawdown for the month was 3.8%, according to an analysis from LPL Financial. But that isn't to say there isn't room for investors to get into or stay in the market, so long as they're willing to stomach some volatility. "Seasonal data represents the typical climate for stocks but not the weather," Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL financial, wrote in a recent client note. "And currently, the weather for the S&P 500 is filled with blue skies and record highs. When accounting for momentum and trend, which we believe is much-needed context, September doesn't look so bad." Here are four ways traders should be looking at the month ahead, according to the combined recommendations from seven investing pros: A stock sell-off this month could be your friend, if you're willing to look at the decline as a buy-the-dip opportunity. In a note to clients on Tuesday, strategists at Morgan Stanley said they remained "buyers of dips should they come" in the coming months, despite weak seasonal trends for stocks. That's partly because the bank doubts the market has fully priced in the bullish impact of the Fed's expected rate cuts, with central bankers most likely teeing up a 25-basis-point cut at the end of the month, according to the CME FedWatch tool. "We push back on the idea that rate cuts are already priced as equity returns tend to be strong during rate cutting cycles, and rate-sensitive areas like small caps are barely off the relative lows," a team led by Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley's chief US equity strategist, wrote. Other forecasters on Wall Street have also expressed faith in the market's long-running upward trend. Speaking to CNBC on Tuesday, Wharton economist Jeremy Siegel said he believed the bull market still had further to go, pointing to incoming Fed rate cuts, strong corporate earnings, and historically normal valuations in the S&P 500 when excluding the Magnificent Seven companies. "September being historically really the worst month of the year. Listen, you know, certainly we could have a pullback," he said. "I still think the bull trends are intact." Now could also be a good time for investors to diversify their portfolio in the bond market, strategists at Société Générale wrote in a note last week. The European bank pointed to a thinning gap between the performance of equities and bonds in recent months. A separate analysis from Apollo Global Management found that investment grade corporate bonds and short-term US Treasurys had been outperforming expected returns in the S&P 500 in recent years, based on the index's forward earnings. "Diversification into bonds is becoming beneficial again, especially in the US," SocGen wrote. In its latest weekly commentary, BlackRock also said it had a strategic, five-year call on bonds. "We are overweight short-term inflation-linked bonds as US tariffs could push up inflation," strategists wrote in a note last month. "The bottom line is that fixed income remains more attractive than the implied yield levels in public equity markets at the moment," Torsten Sløk, Apollo's chief economist, wrote last week. Stephanie Link, the chief investment strategist at Hightower Advisors, said she liked areas of the market that were considered to be less expensive compared to the broader S&P 500 index. Speaking to CNBC on Tuesday, she highlighted housing in particular, given that activity in the sector is showing some signs of ramping up. Existing home sales in the US crept up 2% on a seasonally adjusted year-over-year basis in July, thanks partly to the small improvement in housing affordability, the National Association of Realtors said. Housing stocks have also tended to do well at a time when earnings across the broader market have struggled, Link noted. "I am a big housing bull. I think that we're just starting to see a recovery in housing," she said. "We have maybe a rocky six weeks. So I think you take advantage of that," she added of the broader seasonal weakness in markets. "I think the fourth quarter is going to be very strong. And so I think you want to be buying some of the volatility." Ryan Detrick, the chief market strategist at Carson Group, said he was favoring the market's leading large-cap names as stocks head into their historical period of weakness. That's because there's potential for inflation to climb higher, which means the Fed may cut rates less than markets currently expect. Anticipated rate cuts are a major reason why small and mid-cap stocks have rallied in recent weeks. "What does that mean? Well, I stick with who brought you to the dance. Those large caps," he told CNBC last week, adding that he also had exposure to areas like industrials and financials. "We're not overweight small- and mid-caps here." "You look at the kind of leadership, I love it. What's even lagging, like even more," he added, pointing to large-cap laggards in areas like consumer staples and consumer discretionary. Stocks also had strong momentum heading out of August, which is a positive sign for equities even amid seasonal weakness, Detrick said. At the end of the second-to-last week of the month, 90% of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange were in the green. That's an extremely rare occurrence in financial markets, with only 12 instances of that happening since 1980, he said. "So even if we have a little seasonal weakness, after a 30% rally, I think it's going to be contained," Detrick said of any coming pullback. Jump to

Title: 10 Investment Must Reads for This Week (Sept. 2, 2025)
URL: https://www.wealthmanagement.com/etfs/10-investment-must-reads-for-this-week-sept-2-2025-
Time Published: 2025-09-02T15:53:06Z
Full Content:
The explosion of competition in semi-liquid funds could lead to fee compression, according to FundFire. The ETF market is becoming flooded with “slop”, writes ETF.com. These are among the investment must-reads we found this week for financial advisors. September 2, 2025 What’s Next for Semi-Liquid Funds? Fee Compression “Managers rushing to develop alts strategies for the advisor market have not only been chasing vast sums of high-net-worth capital but also the prospect of higher fees than they can generate from mutual funds or private vehicles. And managers have mostly found investors willing to pay the base fees for semi-liquid alts funds.” (FundFire) ETF Slop: How Wall Street Flooded the Market With Gimmick Funds “Just as AI slop means endless articles, videos, and posts that are easy to create and empty of substance, ETF slop means endless new tickers that deliver little of lasting value. So far in 2025, issuers have launched nearly 700 ETFs, already close to last year’s record with four months still left to go. With more than 4,600 ETFs now listed in the U.S., about 15% of the entire market has been born this year alone. And much of it is slop.” (ETF.com) What Investors Need to Know About Private Assets Managers “Traditional public market asset managers have partnered with alternatives managers to develop strategies. For the managers, it seems like a win-win situation: Public market asset managers get quicker and probably cheaper access to private asset deals and operational insight, while private market managers get an “in” to public market asset managers’ existing retail or wealth channel distribution networks.” (Morningstar) Vanguard Hires Nuveen’s Stout to Head Private Markets Strategy “Vanguard Group hired an outsider to head its strategy for private markets, signaling that Chief Executive Officer Salim Ramji intends to make a bigger push into the asset class.” (Bloomberg) Why You Should Pay Attention to Active ETFs “Active managers long held out on ETFs because of their daily transparency. Some companies went to great lengths to create nontransparent ETFs for this reason. But the benefit of opacity is unclear for investors.” (Morningstar) Why Apollo CEO Marc Rowan says the traditional investing model is ‘broken’ “With the stock market increasingly driven by passive investing and indexing, and dominated by a handful of mega-tech stocks, investors seeking diversification will need to start turning to the rapidly expanding private markets, Rowan told CNBC.” (CNBC) Alts Demand Driving Up Specialist Pay, Divisional Head Hires “Asset managers are ponying up more to hire product specialists as demand for alternative investments intensifies – and they're bringing on additional divisional leaders to support the growing mix of specialists and generalists. Average total compensation for advisor-facing specialists reached $322,563 in the second quarter of 2025, up nearly 13% from a year earlier, according to data from Cerulli Associates.” (FundFire) US sliding towards 1930s-style autocracy, warns Ray Dalio “Hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio has warned Donald Trump’s America is drifting into 1930s-style autocratic politics — and said other investors are too scared of the president to speak up.” (Financial Times) How BlackRock and Goldman Sachs are bringing Wall Street’s hottest asset class to 401(k)s “Wall Street’s largest firms are championing a new cause. They are bringing alternative assets — once reserved for the ultra-wealthy — to the portfolios of individual investors.” (CNBC) REITs Own 570,000 Properties in the U.S. “Data centers had the largest year-over-year increase, up 15% from 2023 to 352 properties at the end of 2024. Retail, storage, and apartment property types all had increases of 30% or more since 2018, with retail up 39%, storage up 33%, and apartment up 30%. Retail also had the second highest annual increase, up 9%.” (Nareit) Related:Social Media, Video Gaming ETFs Outperform YTD Due to Global Growth Prospects David Bodamer Editorial Director, WealthManagement.com David Bodamer covers investments for WealthManagement.com, including hosting the Wealth Management Invest podcast.

Title: What Nvidia's Earnings Could Mean for Broadcom and Other Chipmakers
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/what-nvidia-earnings-could-mean-for-broadcom-and-other-chipmakers-11800514
Time Published: 2025-09-02T15:02:49Z

As one of the primary beneficiaries of the AI boom, chipmaker Nvidia's (NVDA) stock has become a bellwether for industry, with its quarterly results last week offering some clues about what to expect from Broadcom (AVGO) later this week, and other chipmakers. Nvidia's earnings, which came in just ahead of Wall Street's estimates, largely received a bullish reception from analysts, who voiced confidence in demand for its AI hardware, though worries about China sales and geopolitical issues have weighed on the stock. Shares of Nvidia dropped nearly 3% in recent trading, and Broadcom shares slipped 1%, with other chip stocks extending last week's declines as uncertainty about tariffs and America's relations with major trading partners weighed on the major indexes. A diplomatic summit in Tianjin over the weekend with leaders from more than 20 non-Western countries, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Russian President Vladimir Putin, sought to showcase China's leadership amid trade tensions with the U.S. AI chipmaker Broadcom, which Oppenheimer analysts have called the "No. 2 AI franchise" after Nvidia, is set to report its fiscal third-quarter results after the bell on Thursday, and could face some similar challenges related to its large exposure to China—as well as benefit from AI tailwinds. Like Nvidia, Broadcom derives a significant chunk of its sales from China, with the country accounting for roughly a fifth of Broadcom's revenue in its fiscal 2024, though that's declined from almost a third in 2023. Broadcom also claims some of the same Big Tech AI clients Nvidia does, including Meta Platforms (META) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), with their commitments to hefty AI spending expected to benefit the chipmaker. Citi analysts suggested last week Broadcom could also have plans with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Elon Musk's xAI, and Apple (AAPL) in its pipeline. The Citi analysts have a "buy" rating and $315 price target for the stock, which finished Friday's session around $297. Despite recent losses, it has added more than one-quarter of its value since the start of the year. Oppenheimer expects Broadcom could have even further to climb, with a $325 target, still well below a Street high of $350, according to Visible Alpha. Heading into the results, Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Broadcom's stock, anticipating rising sales and profits. All of the 10 analysts with current ratings compiled by Visible Alpha give it a "buy" or equivalent rating. CORRECTION—Sept. 2, 2025: This article has been corrected to reflect the U.S. was not represented at the summit in Tianjin and President Trump did not attend.

Title: Prospective Thames Water rescuers make big promise
URL: https://news.sky.com/story/thames-water-rescue-plan-promises-20-5bn-investment-13423819

A consortium of Thames Water creditors is seeking the agreement of the regulator for its updated operational investment proposals to avert the prospect of being wiped out, should their rescue bid fail. Business and economics reporter @SkyNewsBiz Wednesday 3 September 2025 00:12, UK The group of Thames Water lenders aiming to rescue the company have set out plans for £20.5bn of investment to bolster performance. The proposals, submitted to the regulator for consideration, include commitments to spending £9.4bn on sewage and water assets over the next five years, up 45% on current levels, to prevent spills and leaks respectively. Of this, £3.9bn would go towards the worst performing sewage treatment sites following a series of fines against Thames Water, and other major operators, over substandard storm overflow systems. It said this would be achieved at the 2025-30 bill levels already in place, so no further increases would be needed, but it continued to argue that leniency over poor performance will be needed to effect the turnaround. The creditors have named their consortium London & Valley Water. It effectively already owns Thames Water under the terms of a financial restructuring agreed early in the summer but Ofwat is yet to give its verdict on whether the consortium can run the company, averting the prospect of it being placed in a special administration regime. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Thames is on the brink of nationalisation because of the scale of its financial troubles, with debts above £17bn. Without a deal the consortium, which includes investment heavyweights Elliott Management and BlackRock, would be wiped out. Ofwat, which is to be scrapped under a shake-up of oversight, is looking at the operational plan separately to its proposed capital structure. The latter is expected to be revealed later this month. Sky News revealed on Monday that the consortium was to offer an additional £1bn-plus sweetener in a bid to persuade Ofwat and the government to back the rescue. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Mike McTighe, the chairman designate of London & Valley Water, said: "Over the next 10 years the investment we will channel into Thames Water's network will make it one of the biggest infrastructure projects in the country. "Our core focus will be on improving performance for customers, maintaining the highest standards of drinking water, reducing pollution and overcoming the many other challenges Thames Water faces. "This turnaround has the opportunity to transform essential services for 16 million customers, clean up our waterways and rebuild public trust."

A major challenge for the consortium is convincing officials that it has the experience and people behind it to meet the demands of running a water company of Thames Water's size, serving about a quarter of the country's population.

September 02, 2025 10:00 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, Sept. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO). Such investors are advised to contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980, (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980.

The class action concerns whether Novo Nordisk and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices. You have until September 30, 2025 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class if you purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period.

[Click here for information about joining the class action] On July 29, 2025, Novo Nordisk significantly lowered its sales outlook for 2025. The Company attributed the reduction to “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” On this news, Novo Nordisk’s American Depositary Receipt (“ADR”) price fell $15.06 per ADR, or 21.83%, to close at $53.94 per ADR on July 29, 2025. Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

Title: Texas Suit V. Blackrock Et Al Could Undermine Trump’s Energy Agenda
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2025/09/02/texas-suit-v-blackrock-et-al-could-undermine-trumps-energy-agenda/
Time Published: 2025-09-02T13:59:33Z
Full Content:
ByDavid Blackmon, Senior Contributor. In a move demonstrating that big oil companies aren’t the only targets of energy-related lawsuits, a coalition of state attorneys general led by Texas AG Ken Paxton recently sued major investment firms including BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street. The complaint, filed last December in a Texas federal court, alleges that the defendants illegally colluded to buy up stock in various coal companies and force them to lower output via implementation of internal ESG-focused policies. Mr. Paxton said in a press release introducing the lawsuit that the big investment firms have created a “cartel to rig the coal market, artificially reduce the energy supply, and raise prices,” adding, “their conspiracy has harmed American energy production and hurt consumers.” But U.S. coal prices have dropped dramatically since 2023, and overall coal production has been in decline throughout the 21st century. Despite coal’s decline, America’s mineral energy renaissance has transformed our country’s outlook, enhancing its energy security in the process. Once heavily dependent on foreign suppliers to meet demand, last year the U.S. produced more mineral energy than ever before – and output is projected to increase further this year. This extraordinary turnaround is in large part the result of free markets being allowed to do what they do best: compete. This is certainly the case in the oil and gas business, where thousands of producers ranging from small mom-and-pop operators to the biggest major integrated companies in the world compete in a vibrant marketplace. It has even remained true in the coal industry despite an array of command-and-control interventions enacted during both the Obama and Biden presidencies. Mr. Paxton and some of the Republican AGs who have signed onto the plaintiff coalition have been outspoken proponents of President Donald Trump and his efforts to reverse much of the Biden and Obama regulatory morass. So, regardless of the merits of the complaint, it is at least interesting that the group’s lawsuit proposes a big government solution. That proposed remedy asks that that the government force these asset managers to divest their holdings in coal companies entirely, a move that could strip the industry of nearly $18 billion in capital. That could be ruinous to a sector which has been in decline for decades. It would also present real trouble for Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s goal of delaying planned retirements of more than 100 gigawatts of coal-fired power plants, which he discussed in President Trump’s August 26 cabinet meeting. After all, it costs real money to pay for the upkeep and operations of that many coal power plants. Somebody has to foot the bill, and it won’t be the federal government. Former Texas Governor Rick Perry, who served as Energy Secretary throughout the first Trump presidency from 2017-2021, called the lawsuit "misguided" last month in a Washington Times op-ed. Perry warned that a decision for the plaintiffs would likely undermine Trump's energy agenda, calling the case “not conservative. That’s not pro-business. And it’s certainly not pro-energy dominance.” Surely, there must be more constructive ways to debate energy policy. In fact, the last election served in many ways as a referendum on the Biden-Harris administration’s aggressive green agenda – one that Trump and his cabinet officials say made a mess of America’s energy security. Should the plaintiff states prevail in this case, what would that mean for the many oil and gas companies who adopted many of the same ESG-focused internal policies which these coal companies implemented in their efforts to adapt to the political and market realities of the moment to maximize investor returns? Those companies were advised every day of every week for years to move in that direction by an array of major advisory firms for whose advice they paid millions of dollars. This kind of litigation also raises the specter of the tables being reversed whenever the political pendulum swings back in the other direction, which it inevitably will do. The resulting tit-for-tat governance might chill investment and raise the cost of capital at precisely the time when large-scale energy investments are most needed. During the 2024 campaign, President Trump promised to reinvigorate “beautiful, clean coal” as part of an all-of-the-above energy plan – a laudable goal to meet America’s rapidly growing energy needs. Shoring up resilience and reliability on the nation’s power grids by ensuring the maintenance of adequate 24/7 baseload generating capacity is a major piece of that agenda. Secretary Wright and other Trump officials believe coal still has a big role to play in that space. Achieving the President’s vision will require serious investment by the private sector as government subsidies are gradually removed from the equation, and much of that capital investment must be provided by the defendant firms in this case. Policymakers should be working to unleash capital markets, not jam them up. But, despite that reality, the Trump Justice Department’s antitrust division and Federal Trade Commission tacitly endorsed the lawsuit in July with the filing of a statement of interest, saying the actions by the defendants could reduce competition and raise prices for consumers. This begs the question of who the agencies believe will step in to pony up $18 billion in new capital to fund the ongoing operations of the 100 gw of coal plants Sec. Wright wants to keep in operation if the government forces this mass divestiture. It isn’t as if alternative investors are clamoring at the gates to invest in the coal business these days. Regardless of the ultimate outcome of this litigation targeting Blackrock and other big investment houses, it serves to vividly illustrate the complexities endemic to investing big money in the energy business in the United States today. None of this is simple or easy: If it was, everybody would be doing it.

Title: This 7.2% Payer Is The Cheapest Fund You Don’t Already Own

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Large cap stocks have been crushing small caps in the last few years. That’s, well, unusual, to say the least. And it’s set us up for cheap 7.2% dividends (with upside) from closed end funds. Small caps, of course, aren’t known for big dividends. The benchmark ETF for them, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) only pays 1.1%. But stick with me for a moment and I’ll show you how we’re going to pull this off. Around the time of the pandemic, small caps started lagging the S&P 500 after years of tracking it. Since then, the gap has widened. But there are signs a shift is in the works. “Investors Look to S&P’s Forgotten 493 Stocks as Megacap Tech Wobbles” reads a recent headline from the Financial Times. While perhaps a bit premature, the article does signal a new pivot. Simply put, Big Tech, which dominates large caps and includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META) and Microsoft (MSFT), has been soaring for a couple of years, drawing attention away from the rest of the market. If we look at the concentration of the S&P 500—that is, the percentage of the index comprised of the 10 largest firms—we see a stunning trend. Going by this chart, the 10 biggest S&P 500 firms make up a quarter of the index’s earnings and 40% of its market cap. In other words, Big Tech has been getting pricier and pricier in relation to the rest of the market since 2022. That’s obviously unsustainable in the long run, and it could prompt investors to look for alternatives to the Apples and Alphabets of the world. As they do, small caps are likely to garner more attention, closing the gap with large caps. That would mean years of outperformance for these companies. This Small Cap ETF Is Okay … If this happens, expect IWM to start beating S&P 500 index funds. That outperformance could then reinforce itself as more investors buy, rewarding those who got in early. There’s just one problem with IWM: that 1.1% yield. Lucky for us, there is a small-cap focused closed-end fund (CEF) paying a lot more. It’s been quietly crushing IWM, too. That would be the Royce Small-Cap Trust (RVT), which focuses on smaller companies with promising cash flow growth. In purple above, we see RVT’s total net asset value (NAV) return, which shows the performance of its underlying portfolio so far this year, including dividends. While many investors haven’t heard of RVT holdings such as IES Holdings (IESC), Assured Guaranty (AGO) or SEI Investments (SEIC), these stocks have helped the fund not just profit but outperform. With a near-10% NAV return, RVT is far ahead of the small-cap index’s 6.6%. That means RVT is generating “alpha”: earning more than the index it tracks. At the same time, the CEF’s total market price return is up 5.8%, so investors aren’t bidding up the shares as much as its fundamentals warrant. The result is this chart: RVT’s discount to NAV, which measures the difference between NAV and the fund’s price on the open market, has been widening in 2025 and recently hit double digits for the first time in a year. That’s simply too big of a markdown. This kind of thing happens with CEFs all the time. Often what follows is that investors rush in to fix the mispricing, resulting in capital gains on top of the fund’s income stream. Speaking of income, while IWM yields 1.1%, RVT pays that 7.2% I mentioned earlier. That’s because, like most CEFs, RVT pays out as much of its profits as possible as dividends. This makes the fund and attractive way to invest in small caps, a notoriously volatile asset class. Getting part of our profits as dividends reduces our exposure to that volatility and gives us an income stream we can use however we like. We could even pair RVT with a CEF holding different assets, using the income from one fund to buy the other when it’s oversold, and doing the reverse when it’s overbought. This is the kind of strategy we use in our CEF Insider service, as it helps us secure a large income stream and position ourselves for gains without being overexposed to one part of the market.

Title: St John of God Brothers to end involvement in hospital and healthcare group as new group chief is announced

New CEO Jerry Dempsey St John of God religious order Brothers are to step away from its health and hospital organisation as a new group chief executive was announced today. Jerry Dempsey will take over the St John of God Hospitaller Services Group (SJOG HSG). It includes the St John of God Hospital in Dublin and St John of God Community Services, which deliver intellectual disability and community mental health services at various locations throughout Ireland. It was announced today that Mr Dempsey will bring 25 years of executive management experience with a background spanning healthcare services, pharmaceuticals and environmental services in Ireland, the UK, and the USA. New CEO Jerry Dempsey Today's News in 90 seconds - September 2nd He has “extensive experience leading mission-driven organisations in regulated multi-stakeholder environments where trust, compliance and service quality are paramount", according to a spokesperson. “Previous roles held include Managing Director of Greenstar, CEO of Ashfield Healthcare USA and Chief Commercial Officer of healthcare and life sciences company Complete Laboratory Solutions. Jerry has led organisations through periods of significant growth and transformation while successfully balancing commercial acumen and financial sustainability underpinned by a strong person-centred approach,” they said. “His breadth of experience positions him to professionally progress the ongoing transformation of St John of God Hospitaller Services Group and its affiliated entities, while championing the enduring values of compassion, hospitality and respect that are central to the mission and purpose of St John of God.” A spokesperson said the announcement coincides with further changes in board membership arrangements in line with ongoing governance reforms. The formation of SJOG HSG commenced in 2006 when the Hospitaller Order of St John of God (the Order) began planning for a future where the Brothers would no longer lead the mission, due to advancing age and declining vocations. A series of developments over the intervening years has led to a planned reduction of Order involvement across both the operations and governance of the SJOG entities, they said. “The next phase of the ongoing transition process will see the remaining Irish and UK Brothers now stepping down from the SJOG HSG and SJOG Malawi Boards and transitioning off all remaining entity Boards by the end of 2025. This will mark a pivotal moment in the organisation's evolution, entrusting leadership and governance fully in the hands of committed lay people,” they added. Mr Dempsey said: "I am honoured to take up the role of Group CEO at this transformative time for the St John of God Group. The Order has laid a remarkable foundation for the task ahead with over a century and half of dedicated service and leadership. "I am confident we can continue to fulfill the mission of Saint John of God by building a cohesive, resilient and sustainable future, adapting to emerging requirements and meeting unmet need while delivering impactful, compassionate care to those in need. Ensuring the dignity and well-being of the people we are entrusted to support and helping them to reach their full potential, remains our central focus." Dr Tony Hanna, chair of the board added: “We are delighted to confirm Jerry Dempsey’s appointment as Group CEO. He brings a wealth of professional experience and corporate expertise to this role as we enter a new era in the Group’s development. We acknowledge the invaluable contribution the Order has made over the past 150 years in helping the most vulnerable in our society. We will continue to lead the services with the utmost respect and commitment to that legacy.” In June, Aidan Clohessy, a former school principal was convicted of the indecent assault of six boys over a 30 year period and jailed for four years. He was principal of ST Augustine’s School in Blackrock from the early 1970s to 1993. He entered the St John of God religious order in 1958. In a statement, the Order of Saint John of God said it has “long recognised the need and desire for lay people to exercise greater leadership roles in the governance of the works and services of the West European Province, which includes Ireland”. The Order also recognised that there was a desire of lay people to play an active and leadership role in promoting, expanding and furthering the mission and that lay people would bring "particular and valued experience and expertise in meeting the needs of people and also enhance overall governance”. To support this vision, and mindful of the declining number of Brothers and their age profiles, a process was initiated with the primary aim of ensuring the continuation into the future, of the mission and work of the Order of Saint John of God, it added.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is set to announce its earnings on Thursday, September 4, 2025. Historical records indicate that purchasing AVGO stock prior to the earnings announcement has often been a successful strategy. In the past five years, the stock has recorded positive one-day returns 75% of the time, with a median increase of 3.0% and a peak single-day return of 24.4%. For traders focused on specific events, having a strong grasp of historical trends can be beneficial, although the results are largely contingent on how the company’s outcomes measure up to market anticipations. Two separate strategies may be employed for events of this nature: Consensus forecasts for the upcoming report predict earnings of $1.66 per share on revenues of $15.82 billion. This indicates significant growth from the same quarter last year, which reported earnings of $1.24 per share and revenues of $13.07 billion. From a fundamental perspective, Broadcom has a market capitalization of $1.4 trillion. The company has showcased robust financial results over the past year, achieving $57 billion in revenue, $21 billion in operating profits, and $13 billion in net income. That said, if you're looking for potential upside with reduced volatility compared to holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Additionally, see – Ethereum Play: BMNR Stock To $100? See earnings reaction history of all stocks Here are some insights on one-day (1D) post-earnings returns: Additional data on the observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns after earnings are summarized alongside the statistics in the table below. A less risky strategy (although not useful if the correlation is weak) is to understand the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns following earnings, identify a pair that has the strongest correlation, and execute the necessary trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D exhibit the highest correlation, a trader may position themselves "long" for the subsequent 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Below is some correlation data based on a 5-year and a 3-year (more recent) history. Please note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the relationship between 1D post-earnings returns and the following 5D returns. Also, see – Buy or Fear AVGO Stock? Occasionally, the performance of peers can impact the stock reaction following earnings. In fact, the pricing may begin even before the earnings are revealed. Below is some historical data on the past post-earnings performance of Broadcom stock in comparison to the stock performance of peers that announced earnings just before Broadcom. For a fair comparison, peer stock returns are also represented as post-earnings one-day (1D) returns. Discover more about Trefis RV strategy which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combining all three indexes: the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000), yielding strong returns for investors. Additionally, if you desire upside with a steadier experience compared to an individual stock like Broadcom, explore the High Quality portfolio, which has outpaced the S&P and achieved >91% returns since it began.

Title: No Fireworks, Just Grind: Bitcoin Could Drift To $1M Over 7 Years: Analyst

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. According to pseudonymous Bitcoin analyst PlanC, the road to $1,000,000 per coin might look a lot less pronounced than many expect. PlanC floated the idea that, instead of sharp parabolic runs, Bitcoin could “slow-grind” higher — inching upward over the next seven years and quietly reaching $1 million by 2032. What if the earlier “Bitcoin cycles” were nothing more than the product of a retail-dominated, FOMO-fueled market? What if, from here on, Bitcoin simply slow-grinds up and to the right, with long, drawn-out, uneventful 10–30% corrections and consolidations? And every time we… — PlanC (@TheRealPlanC) August 31, 2025 PlanC argues that long stretches of sideways trading tend to fool people into thinking the cycle has ended and that crashes of up to 80% are coming. He suggested those deep wipeouts haven’t played out every time prices pause. Instead, he envisions recurring, drawn-out consolidations and corrections of roughly 10–30% — messy but manageable — that add up to steady gains rather than headline-grabbing rallies. Not everyone agrees. Jan3 founder Samson Mow has painted a very different picture. According to reports, Mow predicted an “omega candle” that could lift Bitcoin by $100,000 in a single day. $1M #BITCOIN ISN’T THAT MUCH GIVEN ALL THE MONETARY MONKEY BUSINESS GOING ON FOR THE LAST FEW DECADES pic.twitter.com/MzZZXi0mtD — Samson Mow (@Excellion) January 1, 2024 He told Magazine in June that $1,000,000 is “a given,” and he suggested the milestone could come this year or next. That view leans on the idea that sudden, extreme demand imbalances can still trigger explosive moves. Spot Bitcoin ETFs and corporate treasuries are central to the debate. According to reports, several high-profile figures now predict Bitcoin will reach $1 million. Tom Lee has suggested it could hit that kind of figure or even $3,000,000 long term, while Michael Saylor has put $1 million on the table by 2035. Tom Lee says Bitcoin will experience a supply shock, and the $BTC price will reach $3,000,000. Do you agree with Tom Lee? Could Bitcoin experience a supply shock? Perhaps we can add $LUNC to this list.#Bitcoin #BTC #Bullish #TomLee pic.twitter.com/rhHT1yFXTj — TerraNewsEN (@TerraNewsEN) August 24, 2025 Asset managers have joined the chorus. Bitwise forecasts $1.3 million by 2035, pointing to rising US debt and a weaker dollar as drivers. Other voices include Robert Kiyosaki, who sees $1 million by 2030, and Cantor Fitzgerald analysts who also back the milestone. Timelines differ, but institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term case is clearly growing. Meanwhile, Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal warned that many treasury buyers use credit, and if credit spreads widen or risk measures spike, “strong hands” could be forced sellers. Market structure can change quickly when liquidity thins or macro stress appears. Reports have disclosed that institutional flows create a base of demand, but they don’t remove traditional market pressures. Some industry figures view a rapid ascent as a red flag. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz said on Aug. 17 that a million-dollar Bitcoin next year would likely mean the US economy was in serious trouble.

For now, the outlook splits between a blockbuster surge and a quiet climb. Whether Bitcoin delivers an omega candle or inches its way higher, the possibility of reaching $1,000,000 remains central to the debate. If PlanC is right, there may be no fireworks at all—just a steady grind that takes the coin to its milestone over the next seven years. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Noakes: Sell the U.S. Postal Service to UPS

Since its introduction in 1775, the U.S. Postal Service has played a vital role in American history. Recent headlines have underscored the urgency of reform. USPS recently requested a rate hike for stamps and mail services, its sixth price increase in less than five years, placing a heavier burden on consumers while still operating at a multi-billion dollar loss. In contrast, the United Parcel Service has proven itself a leader in safe and effective delivery of mail and goods, as well as the logistics behind the international transportation and delivery management industry. In a world of an ever-changing economy, the shift toward privatization proves compelling because of its relation to market competition and public choice theories. The USPS has been operating at a net loss for decades. According to a Government Accountability Office report in 2021, the USPS has incurred more than $87 billion in losses since 2007. These losses have primarily been driven by its inability to adapt to various climates and conditions. With increased usage of online mail in the past decade, the USPS has seen a significant drop in first-class mail. In 2020, it delivered half as much first-class mail as in 2001. Private companies such as UPS and FedEx have dominated the industry in new shipping standards. The USPS primarily uses its vehicles and contracted air, rail, truck, and ground services. Concerns are growing over its ability to serve rural areas and keep up with urban delivery demand. Meanwhile, private companies have ramped up quick access to deliveries. In 2021, the USPS announced it would slow delivery times for certain first-class mail and periodicals as part of its “Delivering for America” plan, affecting 40% of first-class mail. Though intended to cut costs, this instead alienated what remained of a loyal customer base. Its failure to modernize, along with market competition, shows the USPS should be privatized, promoting growth through private firms’ ability to thrive in environments that demand transportation efficiency and immediacy. Two private companies dominate: UPS and FedEx. Both have grown across international markets and created strong union jobs, contributing to economic growth through faster shipping and receiving. UPS, in particular, generated $100.3 billion in revenue in 2023, making it one of the largest delivery companies worldwide. In comparison, the USPS earned $81.9 billion and operated at a loss of $4.9 billion, while UPS posted a $13.1 billion profit. This is mainly because UPS has adapted to all terrain types, ensuring fast and reliable service. UPS operates the second-largest cargo airline in the world, with 570 aircraft, allowing it to streamline shipping. USPS, by contrast, relies on contracted and commercial carriers, a less efficient model. UPS regularly rolls out innovations like battery-powered bikes in New York City and four-wheel-drive pickups for rural routes. These examples highlight a significant difference between USPS and UPS: adaptability that reduces costs, improves customer satisfaction and creates a competitive advantage. Even as UPS continues to navigate a challenging economic environment, it continues to demonstrate strategic leadership. In its first-quarter earnings report, UPS announced a reduction in its workforce of 20,000 in addition to the closure of 73 buildings. In return, this will save the company $3.5 billion, allowing UPS to come out on top of a shifting economy and competitive industry. While critics may view these cuts skeptically, CEO Carol Tomé emphasized they are part of UPS’s effort to become “more nimble” in a shifting global market. UPS has also announced it is realigning its operations after scaling back business with Amazon, once a major client, while still reporting U.S. revenue growth of 1.4% in the first quarter of 2024. Each of these moves has demonstrated a disciplined commitment to operational efficiency. In contrast, the USPS continues to see a steady decline in optimization. Public Choice Theory, which studies political behavior through economic principles, offers context for this decision. It suggests that political actors — senators, dignitaries, etc. — are often driven by self-interest. A politician may push a popular policy to help re-election, not because it’s best for the economy. This theory also addresses government failure — the idea that public institutions like USPS underperform because they don’t face private-sector competition. USPS’s continued losses support this argument. Together, these elements show USPS’s vulnerability to inefficiency, making privatization the more logical path forward. There are, however, a few counterarguments worth addressing. First is the fear of a monopoly. USPS, UPS, FedEx and Amazon make up the leading shipping players. Removing USPS could leave only three, risking market dominance by one if another fails. This could bring the United States back to a scenario reminiscent of the Gilded Age, when a few companies controlled entire markets. To avoid this, the sale of USPS would require oversight. The Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division would step in to ensure continued market diversity. Unionization is another concern. USPS employees are represented by the American Postal Workers Union, while UPS workers are mainly backed by the Teamsters. Amazon is only partly unionized, and FedEx has little to no union support. The USPS union supports 200,000 members; the UPS Teamsters represent 330,000. A merger could lead to layoffs, as UPS might inherit the USPS volume but not need as many workers. Union leaders and employees would understandably oppose this. Still, a USPS sale could spark more competition. UPS, FedEx and Amazon would fight harder for market share, leading to faster deliveries, lower costs and better service. One could argue this walks a fine line between monopolistic consolidation and competitive expansion. Still, the data speaks for itself: UPS has and will continue to innovate ahead of its competitors. Recent elections have shown Americans demand efficiency and accountability from government institutions, and it is time to apply free-market solutions that reward innovation and responsible management.

Title: Andy Mukherjee: For Reliance, it’s all hands on deck as the group charts its future

Asia’s richest tycoon has summoned all hands on deck to help him steer his $250 billion empire through the biggest geopolitical storm of its five decades as a public company. Friends and family answered Chairman Mukesh Ambani’s call. The CEOs of Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Walt Disney and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund showed up at Reliance Industries Ltd’s virtual annual general meeting (AGM) on Friday, together with he himself, his wife and three children. The 68-year-old patriarch, whose processing of discounted Russian oil seems at the heart of fraying US-India ties, needs all the support he can get. US President Donald Trump has sanctioned the most-populous nation with exorbitant 50% tariffs, allegedly for feeding Russia’s war machine. US officials have not directly accused Ambani. But when White House trade advisor Peter Navarro made a bizarre reference to the Ukraine conflict as “Modi’s war," he puts the largest single buyer of Russian oil in India in a pickle. Also Read: Andy Mukherjee: Why imports of American gas by Reliance make all-round strategic sense “I assure our respected prime minister that Reliance will follow his command with redoubled efforts," Ambani said at the AGM. That show of solidarity with Modi’s call for self-reliance is along expected lines. To say anything else may mean losing political influence. At the same time, though, Ambani can’t afford to annoy the US, which his conglomerate needs more than ever for capital and technology to break into the big league: $1 trillion-plus market valuation. A strategy to weather the squall began to emerge at the annual shareholder meeting last week. Ambani’s older son, Akash, has been tasked with delivering a mega IPO of the group’s digital services business, the world’s largest data firm with 500 million customers. During the pandemic, Alphabet’s Sundar Pichai and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg were among the tech titans who pumped $20 billion into Jio Platforms Ltd. An IPO by June would strengthen the case for their further entanglement. Both made cameo appearances at the Friday event to back Ambani’s upcoming investments in AI. Google will provide cloud infrastructure, while a $100 million joint venture with Meta will develop AI solutions for local enterprises. Also Read: Transformer by Mint | Can Mukesh Ambani pull off a ‘Jio moment’ for AI? The Saudi wealth fund is an investor in both Jio and Reliance Retail. The biggest Indian retailer is not yet IPO-ready, but Isha Ambani, Akash’s twin sister, is building a consumer goods company that will eventually make the stuff that sells on Reliance’s shopping network. That’s where the media partnership with Disney, with 300 million paid subscribers and a near-complete lock on cricket, would come in handy as an advertising vehicle. Disney boss Bob Iger, too, sent in a video message for Reliance shareholders. However, the media business won’t be just about entertainment and commerce. New Delhi has long yearned for its own version of Qatar’s Al Jazeera, a tool to influence global opinion and signal India’s rise. Ambani is promising to step in to fulfil that ambition with news bureaus in major world capitals. This, too, is a message of support to New Delhi, which needs to find its way back into Washington’s strategic orbit even as it normalizes ties with Beijing. It’s also a timely move from a competitive standpoint. The rival Adani group’s legal troubles in the US are making it hard for it to beef up its international clout. Also Read: RIL AGM 2025 | Will Mukesh Ambani’s green push catch up with Adani’s head start? The most crucial project, however, has been given to Anant Ambani. The youngest scion has to attract the capital that Trump no longer wants for US solar and wind projects and create a renewables unit as big as Reliance’s oil-to-chemicals business in five to seven years. It won’t be easy to replicate a refinery operation that has churned out billions. The question is if the 30-year-old, who came to the AGM podium for the first time on Friday, can execute such an audacious pivot. The Adani Group, which has similar plans, will put up a tough fight. Here, the friends who attended any part of Anant Ambani’s wedding celebration last year might prove helpful. Among them is Yasir Al-Rumayyan, governor of the Saudi fund and a Reliance board member, is also the chairman of Saudi Aramco. The state-run oil producer had come close to investing in Reliance’s refinery in 2019. The deal fell apart two years later. Why not put it back on the table? A changed geopolitical landscape and the Saudis’ proximity to the Trump administration may offer a chance to direct Reliance away from Russian oil and towards West Asian crude and US gas, particularly ethane. A lacklustre stock price suggests that investors are sceptical of Ambani’s pledge to transform Reliance into a “deep-tech company." To prove naysayers wrong, now may be the time to dial down the group’s visibility. For the company, it’s truly all hands on deck. ©Bloomberg The author is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies and financial services in Asia.

The Campaign Podcast discusses how agencies are being affected by the increasing AI capabilities of media platforms and whether their role is under threat. Media companies including Meta, TikTok, X, Spotify, Pinterest and others have been advancing their AI capabilities to improve the process of creating and serving ads on their platforms. So where does this leave media and creative agencies? Meta has gone so far as to call itself a “one-stop shop” for advertisers, aiming to fully automate advertising, including the creation and targeting of ads, by the end of the year. After this was reported, Meta’s stock price went up, while those of Publicis, Omnicom, IPG and WPP all took a dip. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said: “Over the long term, advertisers will basically just be able to tell us a business objective and a budget, and we’re going to go do the rest for them.” In this episode of The Campaign Podcast, Campaign's editorial team discusses the threat posed by media platforms’ advancement of AI and how agencies are adapting to maintain their role in the advertising process. Hosted by Campaign's tech editor, Lucy Shelley, the episode features deputy media editor Shauna Lewis and UK editor Maisie McCabe.

September 02, 2025 00:52 ET | Source: Canyon Resources Limited Canyon Resources Limited PERTH, Australia, Sept. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HIGHLIGHTS Ore Reserves Estimate Upgrade Production – Staged development to reduce initial capital Economics1 Infrastructure Investor Webinar/ Conference Call Canyon Chief Executive Officer Peter Secker commented: “The compelling Definitive Feasibility Study outcome and Ore Reserves Upgrade will add to the significant momentum Canyon has achieved at Minim Martap. “We have a world-class bauxite Project on any measure, with scale, a quality resource, and a highly supportive jurisdiction backing a Project that represents a major economic opportunity for Cameroon. “With a project NPV of US$835M and IRR of 29%, in combination with a high grade 51% Al2O3 Ore Reserve places our product at the premium end of the market. “Our staged approach to the development, along with its highly competitive 1st Stage US$96M CAPEX, efficient mining process and US$140M debt financing in place, makes Minim Martap a compelling opportunity for our investors, and we look forward to taking them on an exciting journey with us through the Project’s execution and into production in H1, 2026.” A Media Snippet accompanying this announcement is available by clicking on this link. ASX Chapter 5 Compliance and Cautionary Statement The production targets referred to in this announcement are 100% based on Proved and Probable Ore Reserves estimated at the Project. The current Proved and Probable Ore Reserves utilises 144.0Mt over the 20-year mining plan, which represents a portion of 30% of current global Measured category Mineral Resources estimated at the Project. None of the Inferred category Mineral Resources underpin the production target. It is noted that there is a low level of geological confidence associated with Inferred Mineral Resources. There is no certainty that further exploration work will result in upgrading the Inferred Resources to Indicated status or that the production target itself will be realised. The Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource Estimate have been prepared by Competent Persons, with Competent Persons Statements in Appendix 1. The DFS developed engineering designs to provide costs at a +/- 15% level of accuracy. The Company has concluded that it has a reasonable basis for providing the production targets, forecast financial information and other forward-looking statements included in this announcement. The detailed reasons for that conclusion are outlined throughout this announcement and all material assumptions, including JORC modifying factors (Appendix 3, JORC Table 1, Section 4) upon which the forecast financial information is based, are disclosed in this announcement. This announcement has been prepared in accordance with the JORC Code 2012 and the ASX Listing Rules. All material assumptions relating to production targets and financial forecasts are detailed in this report and the Ore Reserve Statement in Appendix 2 on page 47. Refer also to the further disclaimers and cautionary statements included before the Appendices to this announcement. Leading bauxite developer Canyon Resources Limited (ACN 140 087 261) (ASX: CAY) (‘Canyon’ or the ‘Company’) has released the updated Definitive Feasibility Study (‘DFS’) for the Company’s flagship Minim Martap Bauxite Project (‘Minim Martap’ or ‘the Project’), which confirms the Project’s strong economics and outlines a pathway for the phased development of what is planned to be a major new bauxite producer. The release of the DFS coincides with an updated Mineral Resource and results of an Ore Reserve Update for the Project. The Ore Reserve estimate has been increased by one third to 144Mt of DSO grade ore at 51.2% Al2O3 and 1.7% SiO2, and which will underpin the long-term future of Minim Martap. Located in Cameroon, Minim Martap will be executed as a capital-efficient, staged development by Canyon, with first ore production planned for Q1 CY2026 and first shipment to take place in 1H CY2026. Canyon has commenced early works for the Project, including the construction of the Inland Rail Facility (IRF) that will be used to transfer ore from road to rail, the upgrade of the haul road to transfer ore to the IRF and the procurement of long lead items such as locomotives for rail haul. The Company’s recently announced funding in the form of debt from AFG Bank Cameroon (AFG) (~US$140M), and equity from an options exercise by Eagle Eye Asset Holdings Pte Ltd (EEA) (A$25.4M) will fund long lead items and the Project’s Stage 1 CAPEX of US$96M. RESOURCE AND RESERVE UPGRADE The Ore Reserve estimation, conducted for the Minim Martap Deposit, adheres to the guidelines set by the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources, and Ore Reserves (JORC Code, 2012). The 2025 Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimate for the Minim Martap bauxite deposit as reported by SRK is presented below in Table 1. Pursuant to ASX Listing Rule 5.9.1, the Company provides the following summary in relation to Appendix 3 attached to this announcement. MATERIAL DFS OUTCOMES AND ASSUMPTIONS Economics Minim Martap has exceptional economics, based on its low CAPEX requirements, and efficient mining and logistics that are forecast at US$35/wmt. These factors combine to provide the Project with a pre-tax NPV of US$835M and an IRR of 29%. Figure 2 within the accompanying Media Snippet details the Project’s annual cashflows in real terms. Production Target The current 20-year mine plan and production schedule is based solely on the Proved Ore Reserve (JORC Code, 2012). The Life of Mine Plan (LOMP) provides a schedule of tonnes and grade for ore and waste over time for use in mining cost estimation and financial modelling. The LOMP only includes Proved and Probable Ore Reserves as a source of DSO material. Minim Martap can support elevated grades targeting 52% Al203 for the initial 3-year start-up period, before ramping up to 10 Million Wet Metric Tonnes/Annum of DSO product. The operation will commence at the Danielle Plateau to minimise the required start-up time and capital before transitioning to Beatrice and Raymonde later in the mine life to effectively manage the SiO2 in the product. SiO2 is maintained below 2% total SiO2 for the life of the mine. The start-up period of the mine, due to low rail capacity, will require low machine utilisation from the mining fleet and therefore offer reasonable flexibility and redundancy early in the mine life. Annual bauxite production schedule from the different plateaus of the Minim Martap Deposit is presented in Table 3. The bauxite recovered from the surface mining process does not require any additional processing. The surface miner crushes the ore to the required size as a part of the mining process and this ore is then exported as DSO. Mining method selected and other mining assumptions The selected mining method for the Minim Martap Deposit is the use of surface miners, supported by front-end loaders (FELs) and truck haulage. This method is proven, efficient, and cost-effective for bauxite extraction, with successful use in similar areas like Guinea. Run-of-Mine (ROM) ore will be transported to ROM pads and then off-site via an existing rail line. Waste material will largely be backfilled into the mined-out voids to support progressive rehabilitation, with minimal initial pre-stripping required on each plateau. Cut-off grades were applied to meet a target product specification of 51% Al₂O₃ and ≤2% SiO₂. For the Danielle and Raymonde plateaus, Al2O3 cut-offs were necessary to meet the average Al2O3 requirement. However, as these deposits are naturally low in SiO2, no further SiO2 constraints were required beyond the existing resource cut-off of 15% SiO2. In contrast, the Beatrice plateau contains high Al2O3 and did not require any Al2O3 cut-offs. However, it could not consistently meet the ≤2% SiO2 threshold without significant losses. As a result, material from Beatrice was permitted to exceed the 2% SiO2 target, provided it remained within the 2.5% low-quality SiO2 limit, with blending during production ensuring compliance with overall product specifications. The cut-off grades are summarized below in Table 4: Ore loss and dilution are applied within the mining models. The Danielle and Raymonde plateaus experienced limited impact from dilution due to their elevated Al2O3 cut-off; resulting in the application of a 25 cm loss and dilution approach, which aligns with the operational precision of the proposed surface miners. At Beatrice, a 0.7 m loss-only approach was applied to minimise the risk of reintroducing high-SiO2 material through dilution. The following losses were also applied to account for operational constraints: Mine to Port Infrastructure The development and sustaining capital of the project is detailed below. It comprises a mine camp and mine site infrastructure for Camalco personnel, a haul road construction from the ROM pad to IRF, IRF, Doula Port development, and railway rolling stock. To facilitate the start of this project, Camalco has committed to providing funding for a rail upgrade and will be reimbursed for these upfront funds through offsets against royalties and / or other charges. A working group composed of Ministry of Mines, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Transportation, Ministry of Economy & Planning, Camrail & Camalco is being set up to finalise the form and timing of this reimbursement. The Total Capital Expenditure for the Project is presented below in Table 5: Funding The Company currently believes that there are reasonable grounds to assume that the Project can be financed as envisaged in this announcement, on the following basis: Environmental Approvals The Minim-Martap Bauxite Project involves Extraction of DSO Grade Bauxite from the Minim Martap Deposit, transportation of Bauxite through haul road from the mine stockyard to the Inland Railway Facility (IRF) in Makor for bauxite evacuation, and the establishment of a port terminal at the Autonomous Port of Douala (PAD) for bauxite export. This necessitates comprehensive Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs) to comply with national and international regulations. Separate ESIA studies have been conducted at Mine site, Haul Road, IRF and Port Area. Community The local community strongly supports Minim Martap, recognising the significant long-term economic benefits of the Project. Through the construction and operations of the Project, the Company expects to have a workforce comprised of 97 per cent local people. Along with the macroeconomic benefits of a major resources project for the Cameroon economy, Minim Martap will also contribute to the development of new economic infrastructure and improvements to existing infrastructure facilities. This includes roads adjacent to the Project area and the 800km rail link from the Company’s Inland Rail Facility to the Port of Douala. STUDY TEAM The Definitive Feasibility Study was completed by Canyon with support from specialist consultants as listed below: BAUXITE MARKET Canyon commissioned CM Group to provide an independent assessment of the outlook for the global bauxite market, including a price forecast for the specific grades of bauxite to be exported from the proposed Minim Martap mine in Cameroon. Forecast Prices for Minim Martap Bauxite Under Base, High and Medium Cases, 2026 to 2036 (US$/dmt real 2025, CIF China) is presented in Figure 5. For the purpose of establishing a long-term benchmark base case price, a freight rate forecast of US$17/Dry Metric Tonnes (dmt). Using this freight rate assumption, the base case long-term price forecast for Minim Martap bauxite is US$78/dmt CIF Shandong. NEXT STEPS 2025 2026 THE MINIM MARTAP BAUXITE PROJECT DEFINITIVE FEASIBILITY STUDY OUTCOMES AND ASSUMPTIONS 1.0 Executive Summary 1.1 Introduction Canyon Resources Limited (Canyon) is developing the Minim Martap Bauxite Project (the project) located in Central Cameroon, currently through its 100 percent owned subsidiary Camalco SA (Camalco). Following the grant of the Mining Permit for the Minim Martap mining areas, in accordance with Section 59 of the Mining Code, an entity of the State will be granted 10% ownership of the special purpose Joint Venture Company formed for that purpose, free of charge. The project is located approximately 800 km by rail, north-east of the Douala Port. The project is considered highly prospective for its high grade and low contaminant Direct Shipping Ore (DSO) Bauxite. Camalco aims to produce and export approximately 10 million tons per annum (mtpa) of bauxite utilising Cameroon’s established infrastructure facilities including railway corridor and ports. 1.1.1. Project Description Minim Martap is a Greenfield Bauxite Development project, with mining operations proposed to be undertaken at three (3) plateaus namely Beatrice, Danielle and Raymonde, using surface miners targeting the production of DSO bauxite product with a grade of approximately 51% total alumina (Al2O3) and ≤2% total silica (SiO2). DSO grade mined bauxite ore shall be transported by road for an approximate distance of 42 km to the rail head at the Inland Railway Facility (IRF) located at Makor. From there, the bauxite will be transported by rail to the Port of Douala before transshipment to ocean going capsize vessels. A schematic representation of the project is presented in Figure 1-1 within the accompanying Media Snippet. The proposed project caters for the systematic extraction of Bauxite ore and its transportation, achieved by the upgrading of critical existing facilities including development of a road network from the mine to the existing rail facility 5km south of Makor, revamping of the rail network and development of port infrastructure facilities. This will have a positive impact on the Socio-Economic Development of the local inhabitants along with the generation of a significant amount of foreign exchange by selling of International standard DSO Grade Bauxite ore. For the purpose of preparation of the Detailed Feasibility Study (DFS), Camalco has appointed various agencies to conduct relevant testworks /studies, as presented below in Table 1-1. Table 1-1 - Agencies Involved for Conducting Various Studies DASTUR Engineering International GmbH in association with M. N. Dastur & Company (P) Ltd. (DASTUR) has been mandated by Camalco to integrate the DFS for this project based on the studies conducted by various agencies as mentioned in Table 1-1 above. 1.1.2. Project Location The Minim Martap Bauxite Project is made up of three (3) tenements referred to as Minim Martap, Makan, and Ngaoundal all located within the Vina and Djerem Departments of the Adamawa region in Central Cameroon. The proposed mining areas, defined by the strategic scheduling and pit designs, are within three (3) plateaus (Danielle, Beatrice, and Raymonde) of the Minim Martap Mining/Exploitation Permit as shown in red in Figure 1-2 within the accompanying Media Snippet. 1.1 Geology, Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve Estimation 1.2.4. Geological Overview The project area is located within the Central Cameroon Shear Zone (CCSZ), which is a major northeast–southwest trending structural feature that separates the North-West Cameroon Domain to the north from the Adamawa Domain to the south. The bauxites were formed from the lateralization of the Cambrian granites. Subsequent erosion has resulted in the current landform of flat-topped plateaus separated by deeply incised valleys, with the bauxites occurring within remnant laterites on the plateau tops. The plateaus are very irregular in shape and, especially those in Minim Martap, are significantly elongated subparallel to the structural trend of the CCSZ. The plateau tops are generally quite flat, but the flanks are usually relatively steep. The laterite profile typically comprises a thin soil covering, an iron-rich capping, a leached horizon where the removal of silica and iron has resulted in the residual enrichment of bauxite minerals, and a kaolinitic basal clay horizon. Most of the bauxite Mineral Resource is contained within the leached horizon, which is typically several meters thick. The dominant mineral in the bauxite horizon is gibbsite, with an average concentration of approximately 75%. The other major minerals in order of abundance include goethite, and hematite, with lesser amounts of anatase, kaolinite, quartz, rutile. Boehmite and organic carbon concentrations are very low. 1.2.5. Mineral Resource Estimation The Mineral Resource Estimate as reported by SRK for the Minim Martap, Makan and Ngaoundal tenements as at July 2025 is presented in Table 1-2 in the next page. The total estimated Mineral Resource considering the three (3) tenements amounts to about 1.1 Billion Metric Tonnes. The Mineral Resource estimates have been prepared to a sufficient quality standard and classified in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources, and Ore Reserves (JORC Code, 2012), and SRK considers that the classifications reasonably reflect the Competent Person’s confidence in the estimates. Based on the marketing studies commissioned by Camalco, and the mine planning work completed as part of the DFS, the following criteria have been used for resource reporting: a) Danielle, Beatrice, Raymonde, Agnes, and Alice, which Camalco has identified as the high-grade priority plateaus, have been reported using a ≤ 15% SiO2 cut-off grade applied to individual model cells. b) All other plateaus have been reported using ≥ 35% Al2O3 and ≤ 15% SiO2 cut-off grades applied to individual model cells.Table 1-2 - Mineral Resource Estimate for Minim Martap – July 2025 1.2.6. Mining and Mining Inventory The selected mining method for the Minim Martap Deposit considers the use of surface miners, supported by front-end loaders (FELs) and truck haulage. This method is proven, efficient, and cost-effective for bauxite extraction, with successful use in similar areas like Guinea. Run-of-mine (ROM) ore will be transported to ROM pads and then off-site via an existing rail line. Waste material will largely be backfilled into the mined-out voids to support progressive rehabilitation, with minimal initial pre-stripping required on each plateau. Using appropriate ore loss and dilution factors, the three plateaus considered for mining in the 20-year life of mine plan have an initial extractable mining inventory of 199.5 Mt (Table 1-3). Table 1-3 - Total Extractable Mining Inventory for Minim Martap Deposit The inventory beyond the Ore Reserve estimate (20-year life of mine plan-LOMP) is expected to support further extraction beyond current LOMP, upon 1st renewal of mining permit. The additional mining inventory not considered in the LOMP will include ore from the eight (8) plateaus forming a part of the Minim Martap Mineral Resource. 1.2.7. Ore Reserve Estimation The Ore Reserve estimation, conducted for the Minim Martap Deposit adheres to the guidelines set by the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources, and Ore Reserves (JORC Code, 2012). The 2025 Ore Reserve Statement for the Minim Martap bauxite deposit as reported by SRK, with an effective date of August 2025, is presented below as Table 1-4. Table 1-4 - Minim Martap Ore Reserve Statement – August 2025 The Ore Reserve Estimate is based on the 2025 Mineral Resource Estimate and incorporates several modifying factors, including: a) A required direct shipping ore (DSO) grade of 51% alumina (± 1%) and <2.0% silica (± 0.5%).b) Considerations for ore loss and dilution derived from operational practicalities.c) An economic stripping ratio informed by current cash costs and performance metrics.The previous Ore Reserve estimate for the Minim Martap bauxite deposit, with an effective date of June 2022, was also reported in accordance with the JORC Code (2012). The 2025 update reflects changes due to a new life of mine plan (LOMP) based on the revised inputs: a) Updated Mineral Resource estimate.b) Estimates for ore loss and dilution.c) DSO specifications. 1.2 Mining 1.3.1 Mining Methodology and Mining Models The selected mining method for the Minim Martap Deposit considers the use of surface miners, supported by front-end loaders (FELs) and truck haulage. This method is proven, efficient, and cost-effective for bauxite extraction, with successful use in similar areas like Guinea. Run-of-mine (ROM) ore will be transported to ROM pads and then off-site via an existing rail line. Waste material will largely be backfilled into the mined-out voids to support progressive rehabilitation, with minimal initial pre-stripping required on each plateau. Cut-off grades were applied to meet a target product specification of 51% Al₂O₃ and ≤2% SiO₂. For the Danielle and Raymonde plateaus, Al2O3 cut-offs were necessary to meet the average Al2O3 requirement. However, as these deposits are naturally low in SiO2, no further SiO2 constraints were required beyond the existing resource cut-off of 15% SiO2. In contrast, the Beatrice plateau contains high Al2O3 and did not require any Al2O3 cut-offs. However, it could not consistently meet the ≤2% SiO2 threshold without significant losses. As a result, material from Beatrice was permitted to exceed the 2% SiO2 target, provided it remained within the 2.5% low-quality SiO2 limit, with blending during production ensuring compliance with overall product specifications. The cut-off grades are summarized below in Table 1-5. Table 1-5 - Bauxite Cut-off Grades at Different Plateaus Ore loss and dilution are applied within the mining models. The Danielle and Raymonde plateaus experienced limited impact from dilution due to their elevated Al2O3 cut-off; SRK applied a 25 cm loss and dilution approach, which aligns with the operational precision of the proposed surface miners. At Beatrice, SRK adopted a 0.7 m loss-only approach to minimise the risk of reintroducing high-SiO2 material through dilution. SRK also applied the following losses to account for operational constraints: a) 0.5 m ore loss is applied at the base of the deposit where the orebody comes into direct contact with the underlying clay zone.b) 0.5 m ore loss is also applied at the top of the deposit where the ore outcrops at surface to account for the stripping of topsoil and the potential contamination of ore by organic material during initial mining activities. Considering the above, the total Extractable Mining Inventory for the Minim Martap deposit is presented in Table 1-3. 1.3.2 Pit and Waste Dump Design The Minim Martap Deposit supports a 20-year Life of Mine Plan (LOMP) based on current DSO specifications and applied modifying factors. Appropriate geotechnical and access considerations have been applied and risks relating to these are considered minimal due to the shallow nature of the ultimate pit design. External waste dumps have been provided for minimal initial pre-strip. These dumps are currently located over potential inventory outside of the 20-year life of mine and may result in some sterilization in the short term. The ultimate pit design base was left to align with the base of ore (BOO) as defined by the margin ranking exercise with no additional modification applied. There is a level of uncertainty associated with the location of this interface due to the drill spacing and potential fluctuations between the drill holes and an allowance of loss has been made within the models to account for this. This represents the largest risk to the inventory as presented in this LOMP. SRK considers the risk to the Project to be minimal as there is additional inventory available at comparable grades which can be introduced to the LOMP to supplement the feed if required. The waste material scheduled in the LOMP has an average grade of ~44% Al2O3 and 3.9% SiO2 which presents the opportunity for a lower grade product for the operation. This material has not been selectively dumped or stockpiled in this study but should be considered in future study work to ascertain its future product potential and how to effectively separate the material for future use. Waste dump locations for different plateaus are illustrated in Figure 1-3 within the accompanying Media Snippet and the Life of Mine Plan Inventory is shown in Table 1-6. Table 1-6 – Life of Mine Plan Inventory 1.3.3 Life of Mine Production Schedule The LOMP provides a schedule of tonnes and grade for ore and waste over time for use in mining cost estimation and financial modelling. The LOMP only includes Measured and Indicated material as a source of DSO material. The Minim Martap Project can support elevated grades targeting 52% Al203 for the initial 3-year start-up period, before ramping up to 10 Million Wet Metric Tonnes/Annum of product with DSO specification. The operation will commence at the Danielle Plateau to minimise the required start-up time and capital before transitioning to Beatrice and Raymonde later in the mine life to effectively manage the SiO2 in the product, which can be maintained below 2% total SiO2 for the life of the mine. The start-up period of the mine, due to low rail capacity, will require low machine utilisation from the mining fleet and therefore offer reasonable flexibility and redundancy early in the mine life. The total material hauled from the mine and used as DSO product for the purpose of reporting is summarised below in Table 1-7. Table 1-7 - Ore Summary – Hauled from Mine end as DSO Product Year-wise bauxite mined along with waste removal and the stripping ratio is presented within the accompanying Media Snippet in Figure 1-4 and bauxite production schedule from the different plateaus of the Minim Martap Deposit is presented on the next page in Table 1-8. Table 1-8 - Yearly Proposed Bauxite Production from Different Plateaus 1.4 Mine Site Infrastructure (MSI) 1.4.1 Purpose and Scope of MSI The MSI is designed to provide support for all activities and services for mining operation. Its "battery limit" starts at the entrance of mining trucks from the Pit (excluding ROM stockpiles) and ends at the gatehouse at the beginning of the road towards the IRF (Inland Rail Facility). The MSI comprises various modular, fit-for-purpose buildings and facilities, including dome shelters and transportable office modules.

As part of the development of the Minim Martap Bauxite project, the establishment of a functional link road between the village of Minim, the mining areas (Béatrice, Danielle and Raymonde) and the Makor station is a major strategic issue. This access road is intended to ensure the efficient transport of ore, as well as the movement of equipment and personnel. The total length of the main road is 42 km and that of the secondary branch roads is 15.81 km. The road layout envisaged is given in Figure 1-5 in the accompanying Media Snippet. The geometry of the road has been defined to allow the safe movement of heavy machinery, with a reference speed of 40 km/h. The planned platform is 9m wide, including a 7m carriageway and two 1m shoulders. Longitudinal slopes are limited to 6% with some exceptions to 8%, with minimum radii of curvature of 100 m (80 m exceptionally). The road development work for the road network connecting the Minim Martap Bauxite Deposit to the IRF are structured across six phases, including earthworks for the IRF, new road sections to the IRF, sections overlapping the RN15 National Highway, complementary segments linking Plateau Daniel to the IRF, and roads connecting the Béatrice, Raymonde plateaus with Minim village, all integrated into a unified network. Alibaba has been assigned to construct the haul road. Alibaba is also responsible for loading bauxite in Truck (Total load of truck 80T) from MSI and hauling bauxite towards IRF, maintenance of road, unloading of bauxite at IRF stockpile and loading of bauxite into rail. 1.6 Rail Minim Martap Bauxite Project is made up of 3 Explorations Permits, Minim Martap, Makan and Ngaoundal which are connected to the Douala Port through Rail Network as shown in Figure 1-6 within the accompanying Media Snippet. Minim Martap and Makan Permits are adjacent and are located around 25 km from the Ngaoundal Permit. Overall, they cover an area of 981 Sq.Km. The bauxite ore occurs as independent plateaus. A total of 79 plateaus are recorded. CAMALCO shall finance 4.5 billion CFA Francs (~US$8 million) to carry out the rehabilitation work and around 54 billion CFA Francs (~US$95 million) to build capacity in the existing railway infrastructure, through the construction of around 11 new crossing stations and the extension of existing crossing loops at 29 stations. The above referred rail infrastructure development and rehabilitation expense/ financing will be carried out by CAMALCO, which will be compensated through offsets against royalties and / or other charges (Reference No 00000001/PV/MINMIDT/SG/DM/SDAM/DM/SSEM, Dated 26th June 2025). A working group composed of Ministry of Mines, Ministry of Finances, Ministry of Transportation, Ministry of Economy & Planning, CAMRAIL & CAMALCO is being set up for the above-mentioned compensation. 1.6.1 Inland railway Facility (IRF) The nearest rail head to the Minim Martap Bauxite project is the Makor railway station, with three existing lines and a relatively flat terrain which is ideal for the establishment of the IRF. The transportation of bauxite from the mining area to the IRF location will be done by road trucks. Bauxite will be unloaded onto stockpiles adjacent to the existing rail siding prior to loading into the train ore wagons. IRF shall be developed in stages to meet the requirement of scaling of export volume from 2,1 Mtpa to 10 Mtpa and further for handling Alumina. The development will proceed in following stages: 1.6.2 Railway Network The Douala-Yaoundé-Ngaoundere railway line of Camrail connects Douala port to Ngaoundere. The line between Douala-Yaoundé -Ngaoundere is split in two sections: Transcam 1(Douala – Yaoundé, 264 km) and Transcam 2 (Yaoundé – Ngaoundéré, 620 km) Transportation Plan by Camrail It includes the planning of Regional Project for the Improvement of the Performance of the Douala N'Djamena Rail/Road Corridor (PCDN) and Belabo - Ngaoundere Railway Line Renewal Project (PRBN). Purpose of the Plan a) Douala – Yaoundé b) Belabo – Ngaoundere Axle Load a) Current Current axle load of Douala – Ngaoundere section is 18 T. b) Proposed The proposed Axle load after completion of the track renewal work all along Douala –Ngaoundere is 20 T. Rail Connectivity to Port The take-off of the proposed IRF Rail siding is at Camrail CH: 796+870 km which is about 5.75 km from the Makor station. The proposed IRF line no. 1 connects Camrail at two locations i.e. CH: 796+870 km and CH: 798+823 km. The movement of Bauxite per annum will be 2.1 million tons during Complete Track Renewal (CTR) phase and 10 million tons after CTR. Train Configuration and Loop Extension The train configuration before and after CTR is given as below: a) Train Configuration Before CTR 2L+50W(570 m Train length) b) Train Configuration Before CTR 1L+50W-2L-50W-1L (1140 m Train length) Based on the data provided, most passing loops would be able to accommodate a 539 m-long train, with an exception of Yaoundé, which has a passing loop track length of 434 m. Provision has been made during CTR works for additional crossing loops and the lengthening of existing rail loops to allow for movement of the longer trains required to facilitate the increased ore transportation. The Port’s Rail infrastructure begins from the Port’s right of way near Sandaga Road level crossing, about 1.5 km away from the Bessengue railway station as shown in the Figure 1-7 given in the accompanying Media Snippet. According to the report prepared by Systra, construction of 11 new crossing loops and 29 loop extensions has been proposed for hauling operation of longer train. The port rail network consists of two marshalling yards (Rake-forming stations). Train services run from the marshalling yards to warehouses, port terminals and port operators' industrial facilities and logistics bases. Each of these services function in the same manner as a branch line terminal, and their rail traffic management is the responsibility of the stations of the respective marshalling yards, as below: a) Port Amont The Upstream Port station for the upstream part of the port. b) Port Aval The Downstream Port station for the downstream part of the port. 1.7 Port and Transshipment 1.7.1. Project Purpose and Location The project aims to establish a dedicated facility at the Port of Douala for barge loading of bauxite. For this, three locations were shortlisted and finally one location has been finalized. This preference is mainly due to its readily available waterfront towards both the North and West, existing rail tracks (Corridor 1 and Corridor 2) behind the storage space, and the potential for waterfront expansion. The site is a brownfield port facility, requiring some modification work, for bauxite transportation, and is located over 800 km away from the Minim Martap Bauxite Project. 1.7.2. Bauxite Properties and Climatic Conditions The following bauxite properties and climatic conditions have been considered at the port stockpiling facility: Physical Properties Climatic Conditions Douala experiences a tropical monsoonal climate with high humidity (99% in rainy season, 80% in dry season) and heavy rainfall from June to November. Average temperatures range from 23.33°C (August-October) to 30.56°C (March). Historical data shows average wind speeds of 6.2 km/hour in May, with maximum storm winds reaching 70 km/hour. The port has been impacted by significant storms and cyclones, such as Cyclone Eline (2000) and Cyclone Leo (2018), with Leo bringing sustained winds up to 120 mph. Tidal variation is from +0.6m (MLW) to +2.6m (MHW). 1.7.3. Site Geotechnical and Hydrographic Information Douala's earthquake hazard level is classified as low by the Think Hazard platform. The soil conditions of the selected plot are predominantly sandy formations with a clayey silt matrix, indicating an alluvial origin, where cohesion is not a governing criterion. The topography of the plot shows a mild slope from the North-East wood stockyard towards the South-West river-bank. The Wouri River at Douala Port has a very gentle slope. Recent bathymetry revealed an average channel depth of 8m for navigation, though the far side has shallower drafts (5.5m to 6.5m). Periodic dredging is required for smooth navigation. The anchorage point is located 59 km away due to the mild slope of the navigational channel. 1.7.4. Traffic Projections and Operations The project anticipates a phased increase in traffic: a) Phase 1: Starting with 1.2 mtpa (Million Tonnes Per Annum) in 2026, increasing to 2.1 mtpa in 2027 and 1.7 mtpa in 2028 and 2029.b) Phase 2: Further increasing to 6.3 mtpa in 2030, 7.0 mtpa in 2031, and reaching 10.0 mtpa in 2032. This 10 mtpa level will be checked during the Detailed Project Report (DPR) preparation. The core operations at the port facility include: a) Unloading of incoming loaded wagons. b) Stacking of unloaded cargo. c) Reclaiming from storage and barge loading for transshipment. 1.7.5. Rail Transportation and Wagon Handling Bauxite will be transported exclusively by dedicated rakes from the mine to the port. The selection of wagon type will prioritize efficient unloading at the port and bulk loading at the mine, aiming to maximize operational benefits and minimize the number of wagons, maintenance, and downtime in the overall system. Regarding wagon types, Flat Wagons and Covered Wagons are not suitable for large-scale bulk cargo transportation required for this project. For large cargo volumes, conventional discharge systems include: a) Wagon Tippler arrangements for Top-Open Wagons. b) Track Hoppers and associated tunnels for Bottom-Discharge type Wagons. However, both requires considerable space, deep excavation, major civil works (especially challenging at Douala due to high water table), and a long implementation time. Both systems involve complex mechanical arrangements and control systems. Grafix Engineering Consultant Pvt. Ltd. is conducting a detailed study to explore different options for wagon unloading, stockpiling and reclamation of DSO ore for further loading into the barges. At the initial stage wagon unloading has been planned using crawler or tyre-mounted Mobile Crane (fitted with outriggers) having grab attachment from both sides of the rail siding. Subsequent stacking and reclaiming operation shall be done using pay loaders. However to cater the enhanced production at a later stage, wagon unloading has been planned by using an electric-driven, rail-mounted travelling equipment with a traversing spiral (screw) type vertical unloading arm. Subsequent stacking and reclaiming operation shall be carried out using mechanised stacker reclaimer or travelling tripper and pay loader combination. Two existing rail corridors (Corridor 1 and Corridor 2) are available near the project site. Corridor 2 is considered best suited for the project, particularly for fully mechanised handling, and offers adequate siding length to potentially accommodate a full rake without splitting in earlier stages. However, splitting loaded rakes will become unavoidable at higher traffic volumes. 1.7.6. Storage Capacity and System Efficiency The design principle for the export facility emphasizes ensuring ships do not wait for cargo. Therefore, storage capacity will typically be at least one ship load or marginally higher, increasing with the number of ships to account for random arrivals, equipment downtime, and unforeseen rake disruptions. The conclusions in the Report prepared by Grafix Engineering Consultants Pvt. Ltd relating to the Port Studies: Planning and Design. recommend storage capacity of either 1.5 times the maximum ship size or 1/15 times the annual throughput. Various storage options are considered, with initial stockpile capacities ranging from 0.2 MT to 0.3 MT and final capacities up to 0.5 MT. Some options involve extensive payloader and dumper operations, with stockpile heights initially limited to 6m due to soil properties and practical considerations. More mechanized options involve mobile rail-mounted unloading equipment discharging onto ground conveyors for stacking with elevated mobile tripper conveyors or rail-mounted travelling stacker/reclaimers. One option which utilizes Rail Siding Corridor-2 and a Rail Mounted Travelling type Stacker/Reclaimer, is considered best suited for fully mechanised handling. Barge loader types vary from fixed radial movement loaders to those capable of travelling between multiple berths for greater economy. 1.7.7. Transhipment and Waterfront Operations The facility will handle 10,000 DWT self-propelled barges for transshipment. The target ship size at anchorage is 170,000 DWT, with a loading target of 20,000 tonnes/day using Floating Cranes (provided by others). 24-hour night navigation is possible. The anchorage area is deemed tranquil enough for year-round transshipment, with 320 safe operating days per annum considered for barge movement and ship loading. The selected plot, being at a corner of the water body, has both North and West waterfront access. The West side waterfront is initially preferred for barge loading due to an existing sheet pile front and direct access to the backup area. The existing Wood Handling Jetty on the North side may need to be dismantled to optimize waterfront utilization as traffic increases. 1.8 Environment Social and Community The Minim-Martap Bauxite Project involves Extraction of DSO Grade Bauxite from the Minim Martap Deposit, transportation of Bauxite through haul road from the mine stockyard to the Inland Railway Facility (IRF) in Makor for bauxite evacuation, and the establishment of a port terminal at the Autonomous Port of Douala (PAD) for bauxite export. This necessitates a comprehensive Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs) to comply with national and international regulations. Separate ESIA studies have been conducted at Mine site, Haul Road, IRF and Port Area. 1.8.1 ESMP Budget Separate ESMP budget has been calculated for incorporation of the mitigation measures, identified for individual areas, which has been suitably considered under the cost head of respective unit operations. 1.9 Bauxite Market and Pricing Camalco commissioned CM Group to provide an independent assessment of the outlook for the global bauxite market, including a price forecast for the specific grades of bauxite to be exported from the proposed Minim Martap bauxite mine in Cameroon. This independent assessment notes the following. Forecast Priced for Minim Martap Bauxite Under Base, High and Medium Cases, 2026 to 2036 (US$/dmt real 2025, CIF China) is presented in Figure 1-8 within the accompanying Media Snippet. For the purpose of establishing a long-term benchmark base case price, a freight rate forecast of US$17/Dry Metric Tonnes (dmt). Using this freight rate assumption, the base case long-term price forecast for Minim Martap bauxite is US$78/dmt CIF Shandong. 1.10 Project Execution and Implementation Plan 1.10.1. Implementation Schedule The total estimated time-period for project implementation is estimated at 12 months for stage 1 of the project development from the "Initiation of Project Construction Activities". This schedule assumes that all related studies (Geology, Mining, MSI, Road, Rail, Port, etc.), finalization of project details, financing arrangements, statutory government clearances, and creation of a nucleus project organization are completed before construction begins. The DFS itself is tentatively scheduled for completion by August 2025. 1.10.2. Contracting Model The project will use an Engineering, Procurement and Construction Management (EPCM) model. The EPCM scope includes design, construction, and commissioning of equipment and facilities, encompassing mine infrastructure, transport logistics, road design, project-wide operations/maintenance infrastructure, and contract arrangements with rail/port authorities. The implementation strategy for various packages is based on discrete turnkey mode, where contracts have been awarded to separate agencies are awarded based on their expertise (e.g., main equipment supply, civil work, structural steelwork, utilities). This approach is chosen to balance time and cost for the project, with an optimized number of discrete turnkey packages (four identified). The four packages are: Mine Development and Operation, Hauling Road, Rail Operation, and Port Construction and Transshipment. The total operation of mining of Bauxite, stockpiling, Rail transportation, and Transshipment has been distributed under three (3) major Packages. The Packages and the selected agencies responsible for execution of the packages are mentioned in Table 1-9 as presented below. Table 1-9 : Operation Methodology 1.10.3. Exclusions from EPCM Scope Certain critical aspects remain under the Owner's (Camalco's) team, including mine pit design, mine road network design (except integration), procurement and management of mine pit equipment, performance of mining operations, acquisition of rights-of-way/permits, environmental/ social investigations, community programs, test work, land acquisition, and financial modeling. 1.10.4. Owner's Execution Team and Operational Readiness Camalco's Owner's Project Team will be onboarded gradually, including construction, engineering, HSEC, procurement, and management roles, to ensure a smooth transition to operations. 1.10.5. Participation of Authorities Successful project implementation requires significant engagement and agreement with key Cameroonian stakeholders: a) Ministry of Mines (MINMIDT) for exploitation permits and regulatory framework. b) Ministry of Environment (MINEPDED) for environmental impact assessments, guidelines, certificates, and mine closure plans. c) Ministry of Transportation for road use licenses and right-of-way discussions. d) CamRail (rail service provider) for train control, track improvements, bauxite train priority, crew management, asset management, and infrastructure validation. e) Port Authority of Douala (PAD) for access to the Wooden Terminal, dredging, right of way for conveying systems, and utility connections. 1.10.6. Engineering and Design The EPCM Contractors will manage engineering to deliver contractual requirements within budget and schedule, complying with legislative requirements and recognized codes. The scope includes providing engineering support, participating in change management, supporting construction, providing technical input for procurement, reviewing vendor drawings, and assisting with commissioning and ramp-up. Battery limits for design are clearly defined for Mining, MSI, Road, IRF, Port, and Transshipment. 1.11 Cost and Financial Analysis 1.11.1 Operating Cost Table 1-10 summarises the breakdown of cash costs. Table 1-10 - Summary of Cash Costs Figure 1-9 within the accompanying Media Snippet shows that transport and port operations constitute 82% of the all in sustaining costs (costs of production). Royalties and levies comprise 8%, while mining and waste removal only constitute 9% of all in sustaining costs. 1.11.2 Capital Expenses The development and sustaining capital of the project is detailed below. It comprises of a haul road construction from the ROM pad to IRF, mine camp for Camalco personnel and railway rolling stock. To facilitate the start of this project, Camalco has committed to providing funding for rail upgrade but will be reimbursed for these upfront funds. The Total Capital Expenditure for the Project is presented below in Table 1-11. Table 1-11 - Total Capital Expenditure 1.11.3 Sustaining Capital Sustaining capital costs are included in contractor costs. Contract mining cost and haulage cost from mine to IRF are inclusive of a capital charge and as such, no separate sustaining capital expenditure for the project owner is applied. Arise Port and Logistics, the contractor chosen for port and logistics, includes the maintenance of rolling stock. 1.11.4 Project Economics Table 1-12 presents a summary of key outcomes in the cashflow analysis of the project in real terms and Figure 1-10 within the accompanying Media Snippet shows the annual free cash flow in real terms. Table 1-12 – Summary of Key Economic Assumptions 1.11.5 Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity for the impact of changes in key assumptions, namely bauxite price, mining and other costs, transport and capital expenditure, to the project evaluation was conducted. Each assumption was independently increased and decreased by 10% and 20% to determine the impact on the project cash flow value, as detailed in, as illustrated in Figure 1-11 within the accompanying Media Snippet. From this sensitivity analysis, it is evident that the NPV is most sensitive to changes in the bauxite price followed by transport cost, but with much less sensitivity. Mining operating costs and capital expenditure have the least impact on project NPV.

APPENDIX 2 – ORE RESERVE STATEMENT SRK Consulting (Australasia) Pty Ltd (SRK) has contributed to an updated Ore Reserve estimate for the Minim Martap bauxite deposit, which is part of the Minim Martap mining project located in the Adamawa Province of central Cameroon. The update to the Ore Reserve estimate is based on an updated Mineral Resource estimate, completed by Mr Rodney Brown from SRK (Australasia) Pty Ltd dated June 2025 and a DFS (Detailed Feasibility Study Minim-Martap Bauxite Project) dated August 2025, compiled by M. N. Dastur and Company (P) Ltd and a LOMP completed by SRK (Australasia) Pty Ltd. The project is owned by Camalco SA, a wholly owned subsidiary for Canyon Resources Limited. This Ore Reserve estimate adheres to the guidelines set by the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources, and Ore Reserves (JORC Code, 2012). The 2025 Ore Reserve estimate for the Minim Martap bauxite deposit, with an effective date of August 2025, is shown in Table 1. The Ore Reserve estimate is based on the 2025 Mineral Resource estimate and incorporates several modifying factors, including: The Ore Reserve estimate considers only three plateaus within the Minim Martap concession area: Danielle, Raymonde and Beatrice. There is sufficient ore, at the required product grade, to fulfill the 20-year mine plan that supports this Ore Reserve. The previous Ore Reserve estimate for the Minim Martap bauxite deposit, with an effective date of June 2022, was also reported in accordance with the JORC Code (2012). The 2025 update reflects changes due to a new life of mine plan (LOMP) based on the revised inputs: Figure 1 within the accompanying Media Snippet provides a summary of the conversion from the 2025 Mineral Resource model to the 2025 Ore Reserve estimate. Table 1: Minim Martap Ore Reserve Statement – Effective Date 31 August 2025 Notes: APPENDIX 3 – JORC CODE 2012 TABLE 1 Section 1: Sampling techniques and data (Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections).

Section 4 Estimation and Reporting of Ore Reserves (Criteria listed in section 1, and where relevant in section 2 and 3, also apply to this section.) This announcement has been approved for release by the Canyon’s Board of Directors. Forward Looking Statements and Cautionary Statements This announcement contains “forward-looking statements” and “forward-looking information”, such as statements and forecasts which include (without limitation) financial forecasts, production targets, industry and trend projections, statements about the feasibility of the Project and its financial outcomes (including pursuant to the DFS), future strategies, results and outlook of Canyon and the opportunities available to Canyon. Often, but not always, forward-looking statements and information can be identified by the use of words such as “plans”, “expects”, “is expected”, “is expecting”, “budget”, ‘outlook”, “scheduled”, "target", “estimates”, “forecasts”, “intends”, “anticipates”, or “believes”, or variations (including negative variations) of such words and phrases, or state that certain actions, events or results “may”, “could”, “would”, “might”, or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved. Such information is based on assumptions and judgments of Canyon regarding future events and results. Readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements and information involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, targets, performance or achievements of Canyon to be materially different from any future results, targets, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements and information. Forward-looking statements and information are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, sensitivities, contingencies, assumptions and other important factors, many of which are beyond the control of Canyon and its directors and management. Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Key risk factors (including as associated with the DFS) are detailed (non-exhaustively) in this announcement or in Canyon's previous ASX announcements). These and other factors (such as risk factors that are currently unknown) could cause actual results, targets, performance or achievements anticipated (including in the DFS) to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements and information. Forward-looking statements and information (including Canyon’s belief that it has a reasonable basis to expect it will be able to fund the costs of the Project for its estimated life of mine) are (further to the above) based on the reasonable assumptions, estimates, analysis and opinions of Canyon made in light of its perception of trends, current conditions and expected developments, as well as other factors that Canyon believes to be relevant and reasonable in the circumstances at the date such statements are made, but which may prove to be incorrect. Although Canyon believes that the assumptions and expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements and information (including as described throughout this announcement) are reasonable, readers are cautioned that this is not exhaustive of all factors which may impact on the forward-looking statements and information. Canyon does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements or information, except in accordance with applicable securities laws. Investors should note that there is no certainty that the Project will be feasible and there can be no assurance of whether it will be developed, constructed and commence operations, whether the DFS results will be accurate, whether production targets will be achieved or whether Canyon will be able to raise funding when it is required (nor any certainty as to the form such capital raising may take, such as equity, debt, hybrid and/or other capital raising). It is also possible that such funding may only be available on terms that dilute or otherwise affect the value of Canyon’s shares. It is also possible that Canyon could pursue other ‘value realisation’ strategies such as sale, partial sale, or joint venture of the Project. Risk factors which are set out (non-exhaustively) in this announcement, or in Canyon's previous ASX announcements, highlight key factors identified by Canyon which may cause actual results to differ from the DFS or may otherwise have material detrimental impacts on Canyon and its business. Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimates are necessarily imprecise and depend on interpretations and geological assumptions, minerals prices, cost assumptions and statistical inferences (and assumptions concerning other factors, including mining, processing, metallurgical, infrastructure, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors) which may ultimately prove to be incorrect or unreliable. Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimates are regularly revised based on actual exploration or production experience or new information and could therefore be subject to change. In addition, there are risks associated with such estimates, including (among other risks) that minerals mined may be of a different grade or tonnage from those in the estimates and the ability to economically extract and process the minerals may become compromised or not eventuate. Canyon’s plans, including its mine and infrastructure plans, and timing, for the Project, are also subject to change. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that the production targets, financial forecasts or other forecasts or other forward-looking statements or information will be achieved. Investors are advised that the assumptions and inputs to the financial model may require review as project development progresses. While the Company considers all the material assumptions to be based on reasonable grounds, there is no certainty that they will prove to be correct or that the production targets or estimated outcomes indicated by the DFS (such as the financial forecasts) will be achieved. Given the various uncertainties involved, investors should not make any investment decisions based solely on the results of the DFS. Production Targets and Financial Forecasts derived from the Production Targets This announcement contains production targets for the Project, which are 100% underpinned by the Proved and Probable category Ore Reserves estimated at the Project pursuant to the JORC Code (2012). The estimated Ore Reserves underpinning the production targets have been prepared by a competent person in accordance with the JORC Code. The Inferred category Mineral Resource estimates at the Project have not been included in the Ore Reserves or production targets and have not been included when determining the forecast financial information detailed in this announcement. There is a low level of geological confidence associated with Inferred Mineral Resources and there is no certainty that further exploration work will result in the determination of Indicated Mineral Resources (or Ore Reserves) in relation to that mineralisation. The production targets for the Project and the financial forecasts disclosed in this announcement (including as derived from those production targets) are based on the material assumptions outlined in this announcement and are subject to various risk factors, such as those (non-exhaustively) outlined, or referred to, in this announcement and in previous ASX announcements. These include assumptions and risk factors about the availability of funding. While Canyon considers all the material assumptions to be based on reasonable grounds, there is no certainty that they will prove to be correct or that the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimates are accurate or that the production targets or financial forecasts as indicated in this announcement will be achieved. Non-IFRS financial measures This announcement contains certain financial measures (such as NPV and IRR) that are not recognised under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Although the Company believes these measures provide useful information about the Company's financial forecasts, they should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance or cash flow prepared in accordance with IFRS. As these measures are not based on IFRS, they do not have standardised definitions and the way the Company calculates these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Consequently, undue reliance should not be placed on these measures. Not financial product advice This announcement, and the information provided in it, does not constitute, and is not intended to constitute, financial product or investment advice, financial, legal, tax, accounting or other advice, or a recommendation to acquire any securities of Canyon. It has been prepared without taking into account the objectives, financial or tax situation or particular needs of any individual. Canyon is not licensed to provide financial product advice in respect of an investment in securities or otherwise. Past performance Any information regarding past performance included in this announcement is given for illustrative purposes only and should not be relied upon as (and is not) an indication of Canyon’s views, or that of any other party involved in its preparation, on Canyon’s future performance or condition or prospects.

Title: Understanding Dynamic Pricing in Digital Marketing
URL: https://qqvmedia.com/index.php/2025/09/01/understanding-dynamic-pricing-in-digital-marketing/
Time Published: 2025-09-02T01:23:23Z
Full Content:
Engineering Tomorrow’s Stories. Dynamic pricing is a strategic pricing approach that allows businesses to adjust prices for their products or services in real-time, based on market demand, competitor pricing, and various consumer behaviors. Unlike traditional pricing models, which often set fixed prices for a longer duration, dynamic pricing is highly responsive and can shift frequently, sometimes even multiple times within a day. This flexibility makes it an increasingly popular strategy in today’s rapidly changing market landscape. The roots of dynamic pricing can be traced back to industries where demand fluctuates significantly, such as airlines, hotels, and entertainment. Airline ticket prices, for example, often change based on the season, time until departure, or even how many seats are still available. In the retail sector, online platforms frequently utilize dynamic pricing algorithms to adjust prices according to competitor actions and customer purchasing trends in real time. By leveraging these strategies, businesses can maximize revenue while remaining competitive. Central to the implementation of dynamic pricing are sophisticated pricing algorithms and real-time data analysis. These technologies empower companies to process large volumes of data related to market conditions, consumer behavior, and competitive pricing, allowing for informed pricing decisions. As a result, companies can optimize their pricing strategy to boost sales and enhance overall customer satisfaction. Furthermore, dynamic pricing is not limited to a single sector; it spans various industries, including e-commerce, food delivery, and ride-sharing services. While it offers numerous advantages such as increased profitability and competitive pricing, it also raises ethical considerations regarding transparency and fairness. Employing this strategy requires careful consideration to ensure that customers perceive value without feeling exploited. Dynamic pricing thus represents a balance between optimizing revenue and maintaining consumer trust. Data analytics plays a pivotal role in the successful implementation of dynamic pricing strategies within digital marketing. In a rapidly changing market environment, businesses must leverage various data sources to optimize their pricing models effectively. Key among these data sources is historical sales data, which provides insights into past consumer purchasing behavior and helps forecast future demand trends. Analyzing sales patterns allows businesses to identify peak purchasing times and set competitive prices accordingly. Another crucial data source is competitor pricing. By monitoring competitors’ pricing strategies, businesses can remain agile and responsive to market changes. Tools for price tracking enable companies to adjust their pricing in real-time, ensuring they stay competitive without sacrificing profitability. Additionally, mergers of competitor pricing data with historical sales analytics can uncover opportunities for price adjustments that attract price-sensitive customers while also maintaining margins. Customer behavior insights are equally important in shaping dynamic pricing strategies. Understanding consumer demographics, preferences, and purchasing habits allows businesses to tailor their pricing accordingly. For instance, utilizing customer segment data can facilitate personalized pricing offers, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty. Advanced analytics tools and technologies, such as machine learning algorithms, can analyze vast amounts of consumer data to uncover hidden patterns that inform pricing decisions. Businesses can benefit from various tools designed for data collection and analysis, such as CRM software, price optimization platforms, and business intelligence dashboards. These technologies not only streamline data management but also empower firms to interpret the data accurately and make informed pricing decisions. By harnessing the power of data analytics, companies can enhance their dynamic pricing strategies, improving their competitiveness and maximizing profitability in a dynamic digital marketplace. Dynamic pricing has emerged as a formidable strategy in the realm of digital marketing, offering numerous benefits that can significantly enhance a company’s bottom line. One of the most pronounced advantages is the potential for increased revenue. By adjusting prices in real time based on demand, competition, and other market factors, companies can capitalize on high-demand periods, ensuring they maximize their earnings. This pricing flexibility fosters an opportunity for businesses to respond swiftly to market fluctuations, thus optimizing their profitability. Additionally, dynamic pricing enables better inventory management. Retailers can lower prices on excess stock to accelerate sales or increase prices on high-demand items to strategically manage inventory levels. This responsive approach not only minimizes unsold inventory but also fosters a more efficient supply chain, aligning prices with customer demand and market conditions. Improved customer targeting is another significant benefit of this pricing model. By analyzing customer data and behavior, businesses can tailor pricing strategies to specific segments, resulting in more personalized offers. This capability enhances customer satisfaction and loyalty, ultimately translating to higher sales and retention rates. However, the adoption of dynamic pricing does come with its challenges. Customer dissatisfaction can arise when buyers perceive prices as unfair or inconsistent, potentially leading to brand alienation. Furthermore, the complexity of the algorithms required to implement dynamic pricing can be daunting. Developing a system that accurately reflects market changes and customer willingness to pay can require sophisticated analytics and constant monitoring, which may be resource-intensive. Ethical concerns also emerge regarding pricing transparency. Some consumers may feel manipulated if they discover that they were charged different prices for the same product based on their timing or demographic information. For instance, ride-sharing companies like Uber have faced backlash for surge pricing methods, which have drawn criticism for their lack of clarity and potential exploitation. Real-world examples highlight both the successes and struggles of dynamic pricing in action. Airlines and hospitality sectors regularly utilize dynamic pricing with positive outcomes, capturing peak demand while maximizing revenue. In contrast, businesses lacking a clear strategy may face backlash if customers feel their pricing is arbitrary. Implementing dynamic pricing strategies requires careful planning and execution to ensure success. First, businesses should begin by setting clear objectives. Determining the specific goals behind the dynamic pricing model is essential. These goals may include increasing sales, optimizing inventory, or improving profit margins. Having well-defined objectives allows businesses to measure success effectively and make necessary adjustments along the way. Next, selecting the right technology is key to implementing a successful dynamic pricing strategy. Several pricing software options are available that facilitate data analysis and automate the adjustment of prices based on market conditions. Companies should evaluate these tools based on scalability, usability, and integration capabilities with existing systems. Implementing the right technology can significantly enhance a business’s responsiveness to market trends and customer behaviors. A flexible pricing model should be developed to accommodate the varying demands of the market. It is important to consider external factors, such as competitor pricing and customer perceptions, when establishing price points. Regularly revisiting and updating the pricing model ensures that it remains relevant and competitive. Continuous monitoring of performance is also crucial. Businesses should utilize analytics to assess the effectiveness of their dynamic pricing strategy by tracking sales data and customer feedback, allowing for timely adaptations. Effective communication and transparency with customers is vital in fostering trust in a dynamic pricing model. Customers should be educated about how dynamic pricing works and the factors that influence price changes. Providing clear information can alleviate confusion and enhance customer loyalty. Implementing customer-friendly policies regarding pricing changes can further improve perception and acceptance of dynamic pricing. In conclusion, by following these best practices, businesses can successfully integrate dynamic pricing into their digital marketing strategies while maximizing customer satisfaction and profits.

Title: The Steve Ballmer Interview
URL: https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/the-steve-ballmer-interview
Time Published: 2025-09-01T17:51:27Z
Full Content:
We sit down with Steve Ballmer, the legendary former Microsoft CEO and owner of the LA Clippers, for an epic conversation covering his 34 years at Microsoft. Steve listened to our Microsoft episodes and had some thoughts to share â and boy, did he deliver. Steve takes us point-by-point through the original IBM DOS deal that started everything, how he built Microsoft's enterprise business from scratch, and offers his candid reflections on missing mobile and search. We also cover the story behind âdevelopers, developers, developersâ, the complexities of his relationship with Bill Gates (including a year where they didn't speak), and why he ultimately decided to step down as CEO. Plus, we learn why Steve has held onto his Microsoft stock through it all â giving him arguably the best investment track record in the world over the last 10 years with his net worth growing from $20B to $130B since leaving. And of course, we couldn't resist also talking about his other passion: the Clippers and Intuit Dome. Hit play and get ready to experience the patented Steve Ballmer energy and fun on full display!â Sponsors: Many thanks to our fantastic Summer â25 Season partners: Links: Sponsors: Sponsors: More Acquired:Â Thank you! You're now subscribed to our email list, and will get new episodes when they drop. Oops! Something went wrong while submitting the form Transcript: (disclaimer: may contain unintentionally confusing, inaccurate and/or amusing transcription errors) Ben: David, Steve gave us the signed Clippers jersey with the name Acquired on it. Thereâs only one jersey. What are we going to do about this? David: Should we rock paper scissors for it? You know what? You keep it. Thereâs no Seattle basketball team. Keep it there up north. Ben: All right. Itâll go in the Acquired museum north. David: Great. Ben: Perfect. All right, letâs do it. David: Letâs do it. Ben: Welcome to episode one of the Summer 2025 season of Acquired, the podcast about great companies and the stories and playbooks behind them. Iâm Ben Gilbert. David: Iâm David Rosenthal. Ben: And we are your hosts. Steve Ballmer is, among other things, arguably the very best investor of the last 20 years. It sounds a little funny to frame it that way, but here are the numbers. In 2014 when Steve left Microsoft, his net worth was $20 billion, almost entirely comprised of Microsoft stock. Today, 11 years later, it is a staggering $130 billion according to Forbes. It is incredibly rare to reach this stratospheric level when you are: (a) not the founder of the company, and (b) no longer CEO or even employed by the company. And all of this comes from just one investment decision. Just keep holding substantially all of his Microsoft stock. David: Incredible. We chatted about it with him in the conversation to come. Ben: Now, as most of you know, we did a big two-part Microsoft series last year on the history of the company up through when Steve transitioned the CEO role to Satya Nadella. Steve listened to those episodes and he had some thoughts that he wanted to share with his recollection of how things went down. Things like what made Microsoft so fabulously successful, what his missteps were as CEO. We wanted to share that as a recorded conversation with all of you, so we set up our cameras and our mics at his philanthropy office, Ballmer Group, in Bellevue, Washington, and we pressed record. Weâll go into everything from the misses on mobile, search, social, the huge wins in enterprise and cloud. Steve also reflects on his business lessons learned, he goes into why he stepped down as CEO when he did, and he talks about his relationship with Bill Gates over the years. Of course, we had to talk with him a little bit about the Clippers and the new arena that Steve built and personally owns too. David: Intuit Dome, incredible place. A cathedral of basketball as Steve would put it. Ben: Listeners, if you want to know every time an episode drops, check out our email list. Itâs the only place where we will share a hint of what our next episode will be. Weâll share episode corrections, updates, and little tidbits that we learn from all of you about previous episodes. Come join the Slack to talk about this with us and the whole Acquired community, that is acquired.fm/slack, and the email list is acquired.fm/email. If you want more Acquired between our monthly episodes, check out ACQ2. We just released one with Zach Perret, the co-founder and CEO of Plaid. David: And weâve got some banger ACQ2 episodes coming up. Ben: Yes, we do. Well, as most of you know, we are doing a massive, massive live show at the 6000-seat Radio City Music hall in New York City on July 15th with our friends at J.P. Morgan Payments. There are just a few seats left, so get yours before they are gone at acquired.fm/nyc. The lineup for the night is going to be something very special and we cannot wait to see you there. David: And speaking of, just like how we say every company has a story, every company story is powered by payments, and J.P. Morgan payments is a part of so many of their journeys from seed to IPO and beyond. Ben: So with that, this show is not investment advice, David and I may have investments in the companies we discuss, and this show is for informational and entertainment purposes only. Onto our conversation with Steve Ballmer. Well, Steve, first of all, I noticed you prepared some printed materials here for us. Listeners should know, we didnât ask for this in any way, but at 10:00 PM last night, you sent us a PowerPoint deck and said, I made you some slides. Sorry it got here so late. David and I are looking at each other like we didnât ask you to prepare for this. Thank you for the materials. Steve: Oh, itâs just some stuff that Iâve used with thoughts about how businesses work. I think of this as a time to reflect on things Iâve learned primarily at Microsoft, but also the Clippers about business. I figured, eh, Iâll send them to you. And theyâre PowerPoint. Ben: You mixed a few different templates. Steve: Promotional opportunity. David: Yeah, yeah. Ben: Always a cheerleader. David: Always. Steve: There you go. David: I think the word cheerleader is actually in the PowerPoint deck. Ben: Yes, great. David: Well, Steve, speaking of reflecting, we sit here today, Microsoft is the most valuable company in the world, almost $3.5 trillion in market cap. I think everybody would agree itâs an enterprise company, and thatâs largely thanks to you. Ben: Itâs reasonable to call you the founder of Microsoftâs enterprise business. That is not a narrative that is often discussed. We wanted to ask you, how do you feel about the fact that it basically defines the business today? Steve: Interesting. Very kind. Fathering something, I feel good about that. I think thereâs a lot of truth to that. Of course, there are many fathers to the enterprise business at Microsoft, and I feel both good and bad about it. The truth is, Microsoft started out as a consumer company. We built a very important consumer business. That success translated into the opening to go build an enterprise business. One of my regrets is we lost the consumer muscle along the way. I think the ability to be ultra, ultra. Weâre a great company. Microsoftâs a great company. But to have both of those muscles totally firing, if Iâd been able to sustain that consumer muscle, and I had some ideas about why that didnât happen, but the enterprise muscle, muy macho. It got very big and very strong. So Iâm very proud of that. Itâs also funny when you say consumer and enterprise. What does it mean really to say enterprise? Sometimes it can sound just like backend stuff. The truth of the matter is, Microsoft Office/M365, whatever exactly itâs called today, is super important. It was the foundation for having permission to be in the enterprise, and yet itâs a product that sits right there in front of users. The question is, do you think about users or consumer, and do you think about enterprise or do you think about IT? And then there are developers that span both. Thatâs my mental model. You have products that appeal to consumers that IT can handle, and a platform that lets developers build around those and based around those, whether theyâre building for users, users and IT, or in some instances just for IT people, because there are a lot of tools that are just for IT people. Ben: Well, to contextualize all this, we want to go back almost all the way to the beginning, right around the time you joined Microsoft, and talk about Microsoftâs relationship with IBM. Before the IBM PC and before DOS, can you catch listeners up who werenât around at that time, what was IBM in that era? David: I think you called it to us, and when we were talking to you for research, the sun, the moon, and the stars. Steve: Yeah, I did, I think. Well, itâs 1980 when I got here. The company started obviously in 1975. There were IBM computers and a couple of others. But literally, people would say thereâs IBM and the bunch. The bunch was Burroughsâ UNIVAC, NCR, Control Data, and Honeywell. But they were just the bunch. IBM did the mainframe, and it did the software, and it did the service. It did everything in computing. Everything. Everything. Then you had this little upstart try again called Digital Equipment, very important in our story because Dave Cutler, who was the father of Windows NT, came from Digital Equipment. They were fighting, they were scrappy, they were mini computers, so smaller than a room, but definitely bigger than a PC, if you will. All the initial Microsoft software was developed actually on DEC computers. Digital Equipment equals DEC, and DEC had a nice business, but it was a lot smaller than IBM. If IBM breathed, that was the direction the computer industry would go. IBM was the subject of an antitrust lawsuit, shockingly in 1969, that didnât actually get settled (I think) to shortly after I got here in the term of Reagan. So 11 years theyâd been living because they were that big and bad and mighty. Ben: And what was the result of that antitrust action? What did they have to do? Steve: I donât remember. It may be when they had to unbundle. In fact, I think it was when they had to unbundle the operating system from the mainframe hardware, so people could build IBM-compatible mainframes. Then one day, shortly after I got here, some guys from IBM call and they say, hey, can we come see you? Youâre going to have to sign an agreement that says you can use nothing we tell you, anything you tell us we can use. These guys showed up, and they told us after we signed their agreement that they wanted to build a PC. They were hoping to get the operating system and some of our language software for it. David: And they were coming to you for the language software? Steve: No, they came to us for the operating system. Now why, youâd say. We werenât in the operating system business. We had a card called the CP/M SoftCard or the SoftCard for the Apple II. It was a card that plugged into an Apple II, that ran CP/M, not our operating system. David: Gary Kildall. Steve: Gary Kildall, Digital Research was the name of the company, but we had licensed it to put on this card that plugged in the Apple II. Somehow, IBM thought they could license CP/M. Even though it wasnât our product, they thought they could license it from us. We said, no, no, no, but you can license our language software. But thereâre these guys down in Pacific Grove, California. Bill called Gary Kildall and said, there are some guys, they want to talk to you, theyâre important. Gary went down there and didnât sign the non-disclosure agreement. In the meantime, there was a company here in Seattle called Seattle Computer Products that had a little CP/M clone. Ben: So the licensing of Microsoft DOS, which didnât even exist when IBM approached you about licensing some things, is the single greatest business deal in history. The licensing of that softwareâ David: We made that contention on our episodes. Ben: Well, I just think you look $3.5 trillion later at Microsoftâs market cap. This kickstarted it all. Steve: It was pretty good. Literally good. There was a company that happened to be here in town, Paul Allen and I went down there, and we met with the founder who later came to work in Microsoft, a guy named Tim Patterson. I think we paid $45,000 or $49,000 for this operating system, because we told IBM no, no. We can take care of it. There was a famous meeting amongst me, Paul, Bill, and this guy Kazuhiko Nishi, who ran our affiliate in Japan, where we were talking about this. There was a lot of, letâs just say, four letter words thrown around. Screw them. Screw them is five letters, but you get the drift. Screw them. Letâs just go get this operating system. Screw them. We can do this. Letâs go. That was the theme. David: Kazu was a cowboy. Steve: He was, yeah. Nishi, absolutely a cowboy. So we sold it to him, half of what we paid for it. We said, we can do this 10â20 times. Twenty times $21,000, $400,000 against $50,000 we paid for it. Pretty good deal. It was a little better than that as you said. David: Talk us through the structure and how you guys thought about this. Because you did not make a lot of money directly from this deal. Steve: Nope, we did not. Remember, the key thing was we didnât charge for the operating system on an ongoing basis. We charged for it one time. If you got a new version, we charged another time. We did the same thing for BASIC and everything else, because at the time you could think we were like a substitute for an R&D department, which means we were fixed price. It was only (I donât know) four or five years later that we actually switched to licensing per unit as opposed to just fixed feeâhere it is, pay us once, and weâre done. David: But the ultimate thing that you guys negotiated was a non-exclusive deal. You could sell this operating system and your language interpreters, but also mainly the operating system to other manufacturers. This is IBM weâre talking about here. How on earth did youâ Steve: But IBM wanted this. IBM were experimenting with a different approach. They had said, look. Instead of us building everything all custom, we want to use some industry standard parts, components because thatâll let us be more agile, et cetera. They didnât come in, loath to any of this. They knew that was our business. They know that was Digital Researchâs business. They wanted to use an Intel part versus their own proprietary part. They didnât ask Intel to do them a custom part either. The notion was, weâll move fast. Weâll get away from the IBM bureaucracy by taking this approach. I wouldnât say that was the hardest convincing, if you will in the story. Ben: But what ended up happening after all these yearsâI imagine it only took a few years to see it play outâwas IBM sold a ton of IBM PCs, and DOS was the operation system, and then everybody else adopted DOS because all the application makers, all the software vendors were targeting DOS as the platform. So Microsoft accrued a huge amount of benefit. Steve: You became the point of integration. Ben: Yeah, and the old world IBM wouldâve accrued that platform benefit. Did they see theâ Steve: Well they were selling a lot of computers and making profit also. They wouldâve been making more profit than we were at the time just the way pricing worked. There was a little twisty in here though I should throw at you if youâre curious. These things had something called the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System), which was the lowest, lowest layer firmware, first level software built into the hardware. IBM had its own BIOS, and some applications became BIOS-dependent. Then the question is, who was going to do an IBM-compatible BIOS? We werenât going to get into that game. We didnât want to have that intellectual property, other arguments, but there were people then, that was important. David: Compaq ultimately became the big company. Steve: Compaq became the big company. I donât remember whether they wrote their own IBM-compatible BIOS, but they were the first one to be IBM-compatible. There were plenty of people who ran MS-DOS who were actually not IBM-compatible because they didnât do a compatible BIOS. Ben: I see. IBM thought, oh weâve got some protection from Microsoft, disintermediating us from all the developers and all the potential customers, because targeting our BIOS is going to be important and unreplicable. Steve: The one thing you have to remember is we live in the modern world now. When you say all the developers, that wasnât a long list. Remember, there was no software industry to speak of when we got started. David: This is the creation of the software industry. Steve: There were a couple of software companies that made packages for IBM mainframes, but almost everything was custom. Really, I would say weâfew other companies, but I would say weâdefined what a modern software business looked like. The notion that there could be lots of developers and yeah, there were some, but itâs not like we think today. There were developers doing lots of standard applications. No. There was no licensing model, no business model. Nothing. VisiCalc was around. Ben: So it wouldâve been counterintuitive or required too many mental hops to think, weâre IBM. Wait, are we giving away the future by allowing someone to distribute a wide operating system that ends up being the target that everyone standardizes on? Which eventually created all of modern Microsoft. Steve: Exactly. You canât blame them because there was nothing to build off of, but yeah. One of the things my little PowerPoint here says is luck is important in the creation of great companies. It is. A lot of people always say weâre masters of the universe. We figure everything out. We never have any luck. Itâs because weâre so talented. Sure, theyâre talented people and hardworking people. But most people have a little luck in their story, and this was our big luck. David: Clearly, but when you were negotiating this, signing it, and then those first couple of years before the clone market really took off, did you think that this could happen? Steve: No. I canât remember what year it wouldâve been, but Andy Grove who was running Intel at the time said, yeah, pretty soon weâll be selling 100 million PCs a year. I donât know. Sometime in the 80s. I think it might have even been in the 90s. Bill and I laughed and said, ah, thatâs not going to happen. We invested big time and if it did happen, we said thatâs great, weâre not going to underinvest. But we thought, ah, heâs crazy. This market will never grow like that. I would say we classically underforecast, that was our tendency. Ben: So the deal gets signed with IBM, you end up shipping DOS, it goes on the IBM PC, itâs selling like gangbusters. When did you start to realize, whoa, what we have here is actually leverage over the ecosystem. We actually are becoming the important layer that ties this whole computing world together with the operating system? David: The personal computing layer. Steve: Oh, I think by the mid- to late-80s. You make it sound very strong. No, we didnât feel very strong. There was IBM man. IBM was still the sun, the moon, and the stars. That didnât change. I would say we didnât drop that theory well. Well, into the 2000s. Into the 2000s, Lotus Notes was coming for us, and that was mid-90s and and beyond. But maybe you could say late, but we werenât an enterprise company. If you looked at the enterprise, the enterprise was stillâ¦ David: IBM. Steve: IBM. We used to say we had to hang on to IBM, that if we ever let go they might trample us. We called them the bear. David: Itâs called this riding the bear, yeah. Steve: Ride the bear. You had to stay on. Then of course graphical user interface. Itâs coming out of Xerox Park at the time, Appleâs doing their thing, and thatâs another disruption, could blow everything up. I would say no sense of confidence about controlling the ecosystem well into the 90s before I think any of that, or at least for me. Ben: When did you start to feel like weâre getting out from under the thumb of IBM? And maybe walk us through a little bit the OS/2-Windows world. Steve: Weâve been staying with IBM, they decided they wanted to build something that was sort of their operating system and sort of not. This is 1982â1983. We and they would collectively build part of it. We would be able to license it to others. They would build a value add layer that was a database and a 3270 emulator. Crazy, just saying now. We were going to work on the operating system and what was called Presentation Manager, called that the graphical user interface, and they were going to have rights equivalent to ownership in the code we wrote. Ben: This sounds so convoluted. Steve: It was so convoluted. Man, there was a time when I made 16 trips to the East Coast in 16 weeks, most of them to South Florida, a couple of them to New York, leave on the red-eye, the Delta DASH flight at around 11:00 PM, get into Atlanta around 5:00 AM, get the flight to West Palm Beach at about 7:00 AM, get in and be able to be at a meeting at 9:00 AM at IBM, and then work all day, catch the 7:00 PM flight home, be here about 10:30 PM or 11:00 PM. Twenty-four hours, down and back. If youâre building something together, remember thereâs no real email at the time. We were literally shipping disks back and forth. And then they decided they were going to do the Presentation Manager piece in England. There were also then a lot of flights to England. And then Texas is where the database and communication [...]. David: This sounds so IBM. Ben: This sounds like Boeing. Steve: It was the joint development agreement. It was the price of staying involved with IBM, and it was convoluted. For speed of action, we kept going on Windows, which we had started. David: For listeners, everything weâre talking about is OS/2, the operating system that basically never comes to. Steve: OS/2 and there was OS/2 Extended Edition or something, which it had their edition. David: And Windows was your Plan B. It was like your side. Steve: No, Windows was our plan. They wanted to do this new operating system. We convinced them, you got to have a graphical user interface. We tried to sell them Windows and they were resisting. Ben: Okay, so it almost seems like youâre humoring IBM at this point with yeah, letâs do OS/2 together. We really think the futureâs Windows. Steve: Humor. Ben: Itâs more than lip service. Steve: My job was managing (by then) system software. Iâd shipped when Iâd been the development manager for Windows 1.0. David: Oh, the great videos of you from the Windows 1.0 launch are so good. Steve: But no, thatâs the sales side. I actually managed the engineers because the guy who was doing it wasnât being successful, and we had to ship the thing. Thatâs when I learned some about engineering management from the engineers, basically, had to teach me to be effective. Weâre trying to keep with OS/2, Billâs very frustrated with IBM. Iâm frustrated, but I know my job is to ride the bear. Billâs pushing Windows hard, but we still suspected OS/2 could be the winner because it came from IBM. But we couldnât just stop for three or four years. We couldnât make the mistake we made in the thing that became Vista. We kept going with Windows, we kept going with OS/2, and then May 1990, they come along and shoot us. I was out running with my wife. I stopped. David: Wait, IBM shot you? Steve: Yeah, they divorced us. They threw us out. David: I thought the story was Windows was gathering strength, and you all thought maybe we can step out from the little brother. Steve: No. David: They came after you? Steve: They had a new leader by then, a guy named Jim Cannavino. He was getting frustrated with us because we were still selling Windows. We were still promoting Windows. This was our first antitrust problem. I donât know if you guys know this. The FTC at the time thought we and IBM were working to divide the market because we had done some positioningâwhatâs Windows good for, whatâs OS/2 good for. We and IBM had done that, and then they said, no, you guys are colluding. Thatâs when we first got attention from antitrust authority. Ben: This is even before the per processor licensing issue. Steve: Yeah. That came later. That came with the DOJ. This was an FTC case and they started it in (I think) 1990, maybe 1989, as we were getting our divorce. My wife and I were remodeling our house. We were living in a condo. We stopped on a run, used a restroom or something. I pick up the Wall Street Journal and I read that IBMâs divorcing us. David: All right. Listeners, now is a great time to thank our friends at J.P. Morgan Payments. You almost certainly have seen Steveâs famous 1999 âdevelopers, developers, developersâ chant, which we will talk about with him later in the episode. The ethos, though, of focusing on developers was valid when he said it in 1999 and still holds true today. Like Steve, J.P. Morgan Payments recognizes that supporting developers is a long-term investment. Weâve talked about the $17 billion that J.P. Morgan invests in technology and R&D, and for payments. That means dedicated teams focused on making developersâ lives easier. Ben: Last year, we discussed J.P. Morgan payments developer portal. At a high level, their platform essentially empowers developers to operate securely while abstracting away the complexities of global payments. If you look at the suite of tools available on that platform, the takeaway is J.P. Morgan has continued to roll out more and more technical solutions to effectively accept, manage, and send payments on a global scale. Their APIs come with all the technical documentation youâd expect with detailed testing guides and explaining payments concepts to build your application as you scale your business. David: Letâs say you work at (say) an e-commerce company, for example. You need to restock your products, but your vendor is based in another country. Before any transaction happens, youâd want to use the validation services API to verify account ownership, and ensure that your payment is directed to the correct vendor. Then youâve got to pay them in their local currency and you donât have time to evaluate multiple solutions and stitch together various APIs. So J.P. Morganâs single global payments API can help you take care of all that, including multiple payment rails and methods easily. Ben: And thatâs just one use case. Developers across industries traditionally had to choose between the innovation and flexibility of a FinTech, and the security and scale of a global bank. J.P. Morgan Payments is on a mission to eliminate that choice and offer you both. If youâre a developer working within a FinTech or looking to embed payments within your software, head on over to jpmorgan.com/acquired to learn more about their ever-growing list of APIs. If any listeners remember the meetup that we did after our Chase Center show, weâre actually going to do it again. Weâre planning another meetup the day after Radio City on the 16th. We will share more details soon in the Slack community, but wanted to give folks a heads up in case you were planning for travel, evening of July 16th. A great meetup with our friends at J.P. Morgan Payments. Steve: I pick up the Wall Street Journal and they read that IBMâs divorcing us. Ben: What does that mean? Walking away from OS/2 collaboration? Steve: Yes. David: Basically they kick you out, kick Microsoft out, said weâre taking OS/2 in-house. Steve: Exactly. Ben: So youâre sitting there. Windows isnât powerful Windows yet. Windows is this fledgling idea. Steve: We still had something called the 640K barrier. You couldnât speak to more than 640K of memory. We didnât break the 640K barrier until (I think) Windows 3.1, which I want to say was 1991 or 1992. Ben: So youâre on this run, you see IBM is divorcing us. You donât really have confidence in Windows yet. What are you feeling and what do you think the pass is possible? Steve: Mr. Wizard. Whoa. Shoot. Oh my God. We were so, you could say energized if you like. Scared also works. Itâs like, oh my God. Now we have to confront the bear. David: Youâre already a billion-dollar-business at this point. You end 1992 at $2.8 billion in revenue. Steve: Now IBM, but still. David: But youâre still a pipsqueak. Steve: Weâre still pipsqueak to IBM. And remember, we have no enterprise presence. IBM has all dominant enterprise presence. Ben: Whoâs using Windows and how are you selling to them at this point? Steve: Interesting. Single copies. Some hobbyists and end users. Somebody who says, hey, I really want to use a spreadsheet. And a lot of users in enterprises. It wasnât going through IT. Youâd have a user that would buy a PC on the expense account, probably for the department, buy a copy of Windows, buy a copy of Excel, at an Egghead Softwareâwas a software retailer at the timeâbring them in and use them. Then IT started to get nervous about that. We knew most of the copies, not most, but many of the copies were winding up in businesses. What the hell? IBMâs going to stomp us like a bug. David: Given an assumption that if IBM wants to stomp out this happening, itâs going to happen. If we want a future, we got to play with them. Steve: Yeah. Thatâs why we were âriding the bearâ the whole time because theyâd stomp us out and they divorce us in 1990. Then we say, oh my God. David: So at this point, your business, even though itâs a billion-plus scale, itâs selling to retailers to sell copies of softwareâDOS, Windows, languages, apps. Steve: Not DOS. DOS was always sold toâ¦ David: OEM? Steve: Yeah. Not always, but so much the lionâs share, itâs worth saying it, was only sold because you needed a BIOS, remember? You needed a BIOS, so you had to have the hardware vendor build the BIOS into the machine basically. David: So youâve got that. The OEM business, which was alreadyâ Steve: The OEM business was the biggest part of the business. Then we had this retail business, and there was no notion of enterprise licensing. David: Youâve got no CIO relationships, no enterprise agreement. Steve: We had a couple of CIO relationships. The Air Force was the first big Windows customer. Ben: Your first enterprise customer was government? Steve: Our first big Windows customer, at least as I remember it, was the US Air Force, and they were buying single copies of Windows. When you say government, there are really two governments in this country. Thereâs government and thereâs the military. The military is a much more disciplined, advanced user of IT. Theyâre just better. Theyâre more professionally run than most parts of government. So yeah, it was the Air Force. David: Youâve got a little bit, butâ¦ Steve: Yeah, we had one or two customers just to prove we could actually serve big customers. David: As we understand it, you had this realization at this point. Once the divorce happens, well Iâm going to go figure out how to do what IBM does. You personally. Ben: To put a finer point on it, the thing that we said on our episode, and Iâm curious if itâs true or not, is this was not Billâs passion area, and you raised your hand and said, Iâll go figure out enterprise sales. Steve: Oh yeah. Thatâs for sure true. Bill had passions a lot of places, but heâd say the apps group and what Windows could deliver to the apps quite appropriately, Iâd say thatâs where a lot of Billâs brain cycles went. I had also hired Dave Cutler. Dave Cutler had been the architect of the VMS Operating System for Digital Equipment, we had DOS and Windows, and when we were talking to Cutler about coming here, he says, I donât want to work any toy operating systems. I had to say to Dave, good thing, because we have a toy operating system. But Dave is the key to getting us there. We said, look. You got to build an operating system whose API looks like Windows and whose user interface looks like Windows. Ben: So developers are can be familiar with it and write apps for it. Steve: Yeah. You might make some changes because you have to, but itâs got to be a robust operating system. Itâs got to have a secure kernel. Itâs got to have all of these things. Ben: The product set that you had wasnât really enterprise grade yet. Steve: No, we had a joint development agreement, a joint agreement on LAN manager with a company called 3Com. It wasnât all our stuff. We had a development agreement with a company called Sybase to do the SQL database, because we were trying to figure out all these pieces IBM would have, and we didnât have any of that. Ben: An operating system alone is not going to do it. You need all these other components. Steve: And you want to have backend infrastructure. We started scrambling on that in the 80s. We had all these infrastructure pieces that we had to build if we wanted to sell to (Iâll say) business customers. When you say enterprises, sometimes people think very large companies, but we couldnât sell to companies of 20 people without some of this stuff, or 50 people. David: You talk a lot now about this management concept of building muscle. Is this where this came from of you should always be, you used the phrase in the weight room, building muscle ahead of what you need. Were you and Bill thinking this way in the 80s of, hey, we need to be building up this muscle across all parts of computing and business computing? Steve: Well, Paul Allen, Paulâs the key. Paul is the one who said Bill said weâre never going to be a hardware company. When the Altair came out, the first real microprocessor-based computer, Paul says, okay, letâs write all the software that these things will ever need. Bill and I had a lot of the execution around that, but that was the push. Paul was cracking on me in the early 80s to start building an apps group. Come on, Steve. Come on, Steve. Ben: Itâs not just systems. We need to have applications also. Any code that executes on a microprocessor, we should have a player in that market. Steve: And there was a VisiCalc spreadsheet. Come on, Steve, Word Processor. Come on, come on, come on. Letâs get the talent. Letâs get going. We were doing mostly college hiring at the time, so okay. Then we met this guy Simonyi, whoâd been at Xerox PARC. Ben: Charles Simonyi. Steve: Charles Simonyi, exactly. We met him through a mutual friend at 3Com corporation whoâd been at PARC, and he really was the first leader of the apps business. But we licensed. We worked with other people the way IBM worked with us. We went to Sybase and 3Com and letâs work together. It wasnât exactly a JDA (joint development agreement), but we worked with those guys. The analogy now is a little bit Microsoft working with OpenAI. When the big company works with the new company, how does that all play out over time? But I took over system software in 1984, so thatâs when weâre starting all this stuff. You could say I was a little bit more enterprisey. Ben: Iâm looking at your chart here that you made for us. Youâve got 1992â1998 titled lift-off, and thatâs after the era where you talk about enterprise start. David: And you have your role switching from your role as OS division in the previous era to sales. Steve: The lift-off there though is mostly on Windows and applications. The lift-off isnât really enterprise. It was not until the late-2000s. People would say that you guys might find this funny or maybe you even know it. Customers say youâre not an enterprise company. Youâre not an enterprise company. Ben: As late as when? Steve: Oh, late 2000s. Ben: Really? Steve: Absolutely. Youâre not enterprise-grade, youâre not enterprise-ready. Oh, I heard that so much. Ben: And in 2005. Steve: You had Oracle out there. Remember, there were still mainframes and mini computers. Those things were enterprise-ready. IBM had product, still. You didnât have enterprise support. Our licensing, we had to evolve in the early 90s and then again in the late 90s. No, we didnât have those things. So no, we werenât an enterprise software company. Ben: Thatâs so interesting. Steve: Until it was late 2000s. Certainly, it wasnât before 2005. It wasnât at the beginning of my tenure. We were still trying to prove that we were an enterprise company. Now, I just find it cuckoo that all Microsoft is characterized as an enterprise company, which Iâm not. I think itâs more complicated than that, but Iâm not going to say that thatâs not the primary muscle. For sure it is, but me, the company, I was hell bent and determined to prove we were an enterprise company. Ben: Why was that? Letâs call it 1992, 1993, 1994. Why did you feel itâs so important for us to attack that market? Steve: Easy. Because thatâs where IBM could squish us like a bug. If we couldnât sell our stuff to businesses, only to consumers, we knew that by then weâd only get so far because enterprises wanted some features. Enterprise donât like, okay you can go to computer land and buy a few copies. David: And the consumer market, weâre pre-mobile. So pre-mobile, the consumer market, pre-internet, itâs big, but itâs nowhere near IBMâs market in the enterprise market. Steve: By revenue. No, for sure not. Ben: Weâve talked a lot about the products. Letâs talk about the go-to market motion and this invention of the enterprise agreement. What are the key pillars that you came up with for the enterprise agreement and why did they exist? Steve: Our first software pricing packaging model for the enterprise was not the enterprise agreement. First it was we sold you disks. Second, we came up with this notion of what we called select licensing. You could make your own copies. You just report how many copies you sold. David: Sounds rife with challenges here. Steve: You tell us how many copies, and just pay us what you did. David: The enterprise honor system. Ben: Astonishing. And thatâs of Windows, thatâs of Office. Steve: Windows, typically, by then, came with the hardware. Ben: You were mostly using the OEM channel. Steve: For Windows? Yeah. Even to this day, upgrades and stuff are sold direct to enterprises, but basic computer that comes to an enterprise would have the operating system license to the OEM. We were on, you can call it the honor system, but we just couldnât make people buy disks from us or CDs. Enterprises didnât like that, so we had this thing called select. Select had two problems with it. Number one, very hard to copies of software you print. And number two problem, we were selling upgrades and new licenses. Upgrades were less than half the price of new licenses. What does that mean? The company was headed to a world where its revenue was half of its existing revenue. Ben: Unless youâre growing new customers, new logos, a phenomenal clip. Steve: So it was a real problem-looking thing. Bill and I, weâd always dream of this thing where you get some recurring revenue, and then we came up to say, okay, well why donât we just do a license that you didnât have to count the number of licenses you printed? Just the number of computers. Made life simpler. We said, instead of doing sell you a new license and then God knows when we would sell you another upgrade or whatever, weâll do something that just says, hey look. You sign up for three years, you pay us per machine, and you just pay us the same amount of money each year for three years. It let us jimmy-up the price of the upgrade. We solved the upgrade price problem, and we solved the difficulty of administration problem. And that was the enterprise agreement. David: Was it from the beginning of you get everything? Steve: No, that was a special enterprise agreement. You got all the upgrades during that three year period to the products you licensed. David: But you were still picking and choosing, oh I want Excel. Oh I want Server. Steve: You could. We were encouraging you to buy Office. But we also had this all-you-can-eat license. I canât remember what we called that, but basically then I think you counted the number of employees and you could use any of our software for anybody. We just tried to go simpler and simpler and simpler in the administration. Recurring revenue that didnât decline over time. As much as you wanted to eat, the upgrades, everything. We did want essentially what we have now, which is a recurring services business. But we didnât have the cloud. We werenât delivering things. But weâre already on that path. I think we started the Energizer. You guys mentioned what we do with Energizer, which is where we wanted to run their IT department. Ben: They were a pilot customer for this concept. Steve: Yeah, they were the first customer. I talked them into it. This is beyond the enterprise agreement. This is where we actually want to run their stuff because we did want to get to this recurring revenue thing. Ben: And David was referring to this concept earlier. We talked about it a lot in our Microsoft episode and then on our Epic episode. This genius idea of you will get included in your license, a whole bunch of software, even if youâre not ready to use it yet. If at any point youâre considering buying this different software package from this other vendor who just make this one thing, then they look in their paperwork and theyâre like, oh wait, actually we get that from Microsoft for free as a part of the thing weâre already doing. Letâs just do that. As long as youâre developing a lot of software every year, you can indefinitely just make more and more and more stuff so that your customers donât need to look elsewhere as they expand their software needs. How did that come about? Steve: Letâs start with Office. When weâre selling Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and then we put these things together, people would complain. We didnât always sell Office because people say our users donât use Excel. We donât want Excel included. Okay, we had a licensing option for you. But it became easier and easier. People then departments. Departments always, were in-running IT at the time. Still now, I think. We did sell you things that you might not be using. But it also, if youâre trying the departments, we already got it all for you. You may want something different than this department, but we got it all for you. That was an attractive thing for people. Thereâs an insurance aspect that I learned that IT people really want. They want peace of mind. Thatâs part of what it means to be an enterprise. I want to make sure everythingâs secure. I want to make sure that everything is well-managed. I want to make sure everything is well paid for. I want to make sure thereâs somebody to call if things go wrong. I want to make sure I bought everything. I donât want to look bad because either I paid too much or I have holes in what I bought for people. I view this, and I probably evolved my view to this over time, when you sell the enterprise, you have to provide peace of mind, which is like an insurance policy. Buying more than you might be using or some users are using. Itâs an insurance policy. Ben: And software has zero marginal cost and zero distribution cost. So weâre happy to mail you a few more discs if you need them. Steve: But we werenât even mailing discs by then, because we had the enterprise agreement in place. David: At a certain point along the way, you get to, well I want to say the holy trinity, but I think there are more than three pieces of this. But the real killer suite in enterprises, which is Windows, Windows Server, Active Directory, Exchange, Office, and all of these pieces of software, all work in orchestration to run your enterprise. Your users, they do their email on Outlook, which is part of Office which runs on Windows, which uses Exchange, which uses Active Directory, which is aâ Ben: SQL server. David: All these things. How long did it take to get to that point? To my mind, thatâs when the enterprise is firing on all cylinders here. Steve: That really comes with email boom. Email boom is late 90s/beginning of 2000s. Ben: Because email is the cart that pulled the whole thing. Steve: Oh yeah. No, itâs the locomotive. Ben: Enterprises wanted email. Steve: Yeah. When Accenture became a company, we started a joint venture called Avanade to help do essentially the holy trinity to help install. We needed support infrastructure and partners who knew how to set up the servers, provision email, put all that in. We needed partners and we didnât have enough capacity. Thatâs why we started this thing, Avanade, which is big, big company at this stage, with Accenture, and that was in the 2000s. I went on the board of Accenture. Ben: But all this to say, the way you could pitch an enterprise is rather than any of these other value propositionsâDavid listed off a whole bunch of softwareâyou could say you guys want some email. We have the most reliable, robust way for your enterprise to adopt email, and itâs going to come with all this other great stuff. Steve: And everything was nicely integrated because remember, you needed Active Directory to manage file shares, to manage printers. It was used for a lot of different things. It really did all come together as the integrated proposition. You guys made fun of the notion that we called all that stuff the BackOffice as if that was [...]. No, no, no. Itâs so wrong. So wrong about that. David: We took that as a signal that Bill just didnât care about this stuff. Steve: Oh, completely not right. I wanted to call it the BackOffice because you needed to buy the Office in the BackOffice. The user, the consumer saw the Office and the BackOffice were the things that were in the server rooms/data centers. But a lot of them were server rooms. Itâs the same thing these days. but cloudized. Ben: All right. As we were preparing for this, there are a bunch of big questions that we just desperately want your take on. A big one is around one of your most iconic moments. 1999, the developers, developers, developers speech. Iâve probably watched this clip 20â30 times, almost everyone listening has seen this clip. What is missing from this clip is all the context around Microsoft and whatâs going on in the world at this time, and what you need to accomplish as a leader of this company. Help us set that stage and then understand why you went on stage that way. Steve: Well remember, by this time weâre not through our IBM competition, and we got Linux competition now on the docket because Linux is competing with Windows Server. Linux is competing with Windows, and thereâs a thing called OpenOffice, open source software for office thatâs competing with Office. We have all these things going on. We havenât beat Lotus Notes yet. David: And youâve got antitrust count. Steve: We have antitrust issues (of course) by then. Ben: The culmination of the DOJ suit is happening within 12 months of this moment. Steve: Correct. But itâs clear in all these competitions, the thing you need are third-parties that reinforce what youâve gotâadd value around what youâve got. I could say run on your platform, but Iâll come to that later if you want to what a platform is and isnât, if you want to do that. Itâs interesting, I think. Ben: Yeah, letâs do it. Steve: Particularly since everythingâs called a platform these days. But anyway. Ben: Letâs take an aside here. Give us your definition of a platform. Steve: You could call it anything that is extensible, and itâs the extensibility that âmakes it a platform,â because youâre going to get people to extend the value you add. The question and the reason thatâs important is that applications are platforms too. Not just developer platforms. When people say that they might mean Azure, AWS, or in the old days, Windows or Windows Server or Unix then Linux. Yes, those are platforms. You extend them. But you also extend Office. You add value partners plug in. They write applications. They use the file formats. All of this stuff is platform. Part of the issue (I think) for Microsoft is if you see yourself as just a platform company, platforms need apps. You want to have the top first-party app that runs on your platform. Otherwise your platform canât get good. Office was the best first-party app on Windows, and thatâs how things get good. Outlook was the best first-party app on exchange. There were other clients at one point, by the way. So you really do want extensibility in your apps in addition to your âplatform.â You want to make sure you own first-party app in addition to âplatform.â I think you can get stuck in the mud if you say weâre just a platform company. I think we got it into our corporate mindset that we were âa platform companyâ far more than I ever intended. There were people telling me in the mid- to late-2000s, well we canât do that. Weâre a platform company. I said, yes, we can do that. By 2010, I was just frustrated with myself and my inability to get people out of the, weâre-just-a-platform company. I think to this day you have to think app with platform. You have to think extensibility of the app and the âplatform.â I think we got caught on that. Maybe I got caught on it for a while, and I certainly got caught in my inability to tell people what the company needed to do because people had such a culture then of saying weâre a platform company. Weâre a platform. Now I go back to, developers, developers, developers. Iâm trying to tell people at that time that third-parties really mattered. You got different opinions inside Microsoft. Ben: And what event was this at? Steve: The developer conference, I think. Ben: So itâs for external developers? Steve: External developers. Whoâs Windowsâ number one client? Is it Office or is it all developers? You ask the Windows team, itâs all developers. You ask the Office team, come on, you got to do for us what we need to do. You have to be able to communicate that you really care about developers who are not your own. That you really want these things because they may think, oh, itâs all about running Microsoft Office. We just had to tell people, we want you, we want you, we want you, we want you. I think we got caught in thinking itâs all about third-parties and not also about our first-party apps. Thatâs where you say, are you a, the word âconsumerâ sounds unserious. Are you for users and for enterprises? Which really means IT departments. Or are you for users and not IT departments? And do you allow both all aspects of what you do to be extended by developers? Thatâs the frame I believe in. We had some issues over the course of where we went in the 2000. We can talk about that if you want to. But go back to 1999, come on, we need you guys on Windows. IBM still selling OS/2. Linux is right there on the horizon. Itâs coming like a freight train. Ben: Is the web starting to enter your psyche at all? Steve: The webâs part of that. Weâre trying to get people to write for Windows Server, good point. Weâre trying to get them to extend ActiveX controls, I think. Weâre the part of the browser. We were trying to get our browser to be a platform, embrace and extend I think is what we said. Weâll embrace the Internet and weâll extend with these ActiveX controls. We need developers to do ActiveX, we need them to do Windows Server. Weâre just getting ready on .NET. I have my own wild style. How do you end a speech? You tell people you love them, that you want them. Thatâs the call to action. Thatâs where I think the developers, developers, developers thing came. Before that one, there was a different video that people characterize it. Ben: I love this company? Steve: No, it was my Windows video. I donât know if youâve ever seen that. Ben: Oh, of course, but wasnât that a parody? Donât people misunderstand? Steve: It was for fun. It was just a fun thing. It was not a real speech. Ben: And it was for internal consumption where you were saying, for this low, low price. Steve: Yeah. Thereâs a lot of little nuances in there. Weâre trying to get our people pumped up about Windows. Ben: What I was looking for there is the developers, developers, developers speech is one where you feel like we havenât really won the last battle yet. Weâre still in this death grip for enterprise developers or this death fight against IBM, and yet thereâs now Linux and the web for these more independent or platform-of-the-futureâlooking developers. In some ways, were desperate to sell, to win, to say, hey, we have a great platform here. You need to come use our stuff. Steve: Exactly. I canât remember whether weâre pre-LAMP or LAMP by then. But I donât remember. Thereâs some infrastructure on top of Linux that people are using to write, letâs say theyâre backends not their user-facing code. We had tons of competition. The interesting thing is people say, only think about your customer. Never think about your competitor. I actually think you have to think about both. Ironically, we were pretty consumed with our competitor, which (I think) was essential, and we were pretty consumed about doing new things. But the competitor thing wound up being very important. We have no business. Weâre not in the enterprise. We could lose Windows on the client. The company werenât really self-confident. The DOJ was really self-confident that we were a lock and there was no competition, and life was easy. Thatâs not where our heads were. Now, there is some time in the 2000s where we think extending. We did a slide once called Windows everywhere. We used to use this on all these devices. We became too wed to extending what we had versus jumping to something new because in a sense, we were too confident if we only Windows-ized something. You guys make a point in your episode on us. You guys call it sticking with Windows too long. That may be it, but I donât think we stuck with Windows too long. I think what we did is we tried to put Windows in places that it didnât naturally go, and we tried to be too Windows-ey both in the API and the UI in some things. Ben: Mobile being an obvious. Steve: Windows Mobile, exactly. Ben: And the car. Steve: We did a layer on Windows that when you hooked your PC up to the TV, it had a simplified user interface on your TV. David: Oh, yeah. I remember this. Ben: It wasnât just Media Center, right? It was someâ¦ Steve: Media Center, exactly right. We became convinced to some degree paranoia and some degree confidence. Well our birthright here comes from Windows. Thatâs our permission to enter the area. But then we also, in some areas, it just wasnât going to be extensible. There was both a fear and an overstated confidence in trying to take Windows everywhere. Ben: All right, listeners. Itâs time to talk about another one of our favorite companies, Statsig. Since you last heard from us about Statsig, they have a very exciting update. They raised their Series C valuing them at $1.1 billion. David: Huge milestone. Congrats to the team. Timing is interesting because the experimentation space is really heating up. Ben: So why do investors value Statsig saying at over a billion dollars? Itâs because experimentation has become a critical part of the product stack for the worldâs best product teams. David: This trend started with Web 2.0 companies like Facebook, Netflix, and Airbnb. Those companies faced a problem. How do you maintain a fast, decentralized product and engineering culture while also scaling up to thousands of employees? Experimentation systems were a huge part of that answer. These systems gave everyone at those companies access to a global set of product metrics from page views, to watch time, to performance. Then every time a team released a new feature or product, they could measure the impact of that feature on those metrics. Ben: So Facebook could set a company-wide goal, like increasing time in-app, and let individual teams go and figure out how to achieve it. Multiply this across thousands of engineers and PMs, and boom, you get exponential growth. Itâs no wonder that experimentation is now seen as essential infrastructure. David: Todayâs best product teams like Notion, OpenAI, Rippling, and Figma are equally reliant on experimentation. But instead of building it in-house, they just use Statsig. And they donât just use Statsig for experimentation. Over the last few years, Statsig has added all the tools that fast product teams need, like feature flags, product analytics, session replays and more. Ben: So if you would like to help your teams, engineers, and PMs figure out how to build faster and make smarter decisions, go to statsig.com/acquired, or click the link in the show notes. They have a super generous free tier, a $50,000 startup program, and affordable enterprise contracts for large companies. Just tell them that Ben and David sent you. Letâs jump to this point, but what is the generalizable lesson here? You have Windows, this amazing piece of software with this tremendous multi-sided network effect around it. The logical thing to do is to continue to try and extend it and say, geez, wouldnât it be nice if the next great technology wave was also Windows? Steve: And that worked for us on Windows Server. Itâs not like we didnât have an existence proof that the thing could work. But if youâre going to, in my little deck I gave you. Ben: Yes, please. Steve: If youâre trying to skate to where the puck is, if youâre trying to recognize, what did I call this about capabilities, if youâre a startup in something, thereâs an ongoing business, you just keep enhancing your products. Thereâs a line extension. Okay, weâre going to add networking to Windows. No problem. You still call it Windows. Itâs related. But new, SQL Server for example, was that for a while. It was related because we had a backend platform. Dynamics, somewhat related, our accounting, et cetera stuff. Because there was some enterprisey sales, but it was really new. It turned out the phone was more like a startup, recognizing and thinking about things, and then asking yourself, what capabilities do you need? I say get in the weight room. Youâve got to develop capability. Take a look at a capability we developed that is now essential. We didnât build it for this reason. Hardware design. Microsoftâs a major hardware design company now. I started it out mostly to help client-side devicesâXbox, Surface, phone. And guess what? They use that mostly now in Azure data centers. I think the guy who actually runs hardware design used to be on Xbox. The backend hardware design for the data centerâthe chip, et cetera, infrastructureâIâm pretty sure there were a lot of talent we brought in. Building capabilities is important. We built some capability, but we didnât build enough capability. We didnât see things as different enough. Okay, letâs try to keep the comfortable Windows user interface because people understand it. It wasnât right for the phone. I donât even remember what processors we started out on, but Iâm pretty sure we started out on Intel. Of course that wasnât right. We tried to keep too much consistency, both out of a fear that this was our permission to exist and out of a self-confidence that we had to put Windows everywhere. Ben: So when should a company that has an existing fantastic business say, no, no, no. We cannot extend our existing franchise to this new world. This new world is going to be dominated by some new paradigm where we have no advantage. How do you play that? Steve: And then do we choose to get in? Ben: Exactly. Steve: Then you have to choose to get in. I would say two things were true at the time for us. Ben: And this is specifically about mobile. Steve: Itâs also about something else. Itâs a little bit about search too. There were two things that are true. Number one, you have to be focusing consciously on the issue. Itâs easy to get caught up, thereâs innovatorâs dilemma. Itâs a little different, but you get caught up in what you have, you get caught up in what you get caught up in the capabilities, and thatâs why I say to myself, you explicitly have to think about it. If we hadnât developed a bunch of capabilities we had, AI, if we hadnât built Bing, company wouldnât have capabilities. David: You built some capabilities in online services that willâ¦ weâll come back to that. Steve: We built some important capabilities, but we didnât realize the businesses were enough different to harness those in the new ways. Iâm proud of the capabilities we built. Didnât apply them the way we should have. Where did we learn to build internet-scale infrastructure? Well, some with Azure, some even more than Azure, being even more than Azure to get started. The Office. Whatâs now in M365? The Office backend, because that got critical mass as a cloud infrastructure before Azure did. Even more so with Bing. We developed the capabilities, but then you look at the product and what was our strategy for Bing? Well, thereâs too much based upon Windows integration. You have to say this is a separate part. David: Before the Bing rebrand, it was Windows Live Search. Youâre not going to be Google with Windows Live. Steve: Everything was Windows Live. Itâs now OneDrive. But the file sharing. Googleâs done the same thing. You got to ask where do you run out of gas? Ben: Because you could make the counter argument, shoot, Google is running away with the market. Itâs very good technology. Theyâve perfected the user experience. They have scale. You need scale in this business. Uh-oh, itâs a runaway train that weâre never going to catch. Thank God we have Windows to be able to have some way we can attack them from the side. With Windows integration, maybe that gives us a fighting chance. That didnât end up being true, but you can paint that narrative at least. We canât fight Google head on. Steve: No, I need to tell you something. Look, how late were we to search? The answer is when did Google start? 1998â1999? David: 1998. Steve: Okay. And we jumped in in 2003, I think we pushed. Now youâd say five years is a lot, or you could say five years isnât that much. You could say we had no birthright. Itâs just a completely separate thing. We had no capability. We had nobody whoâd grown up in that world. We had some guys in Microsoft Research who could start getting us there. We took talent that was doing other things in Microsoft. Itâs hard to go get new talent because search is brand new. There were people from Inktomi, Google had sucked them up. So it took us a while to get off the ground. It took us a while even, to be fair, I think this is something both Bill and I debated, not just with each other, but just we kicked around too much, how much âthe verticalsâ in online services would be important versus search and portal is generic. So search and portal is generic. But remember, we had a thing called Expedia. We built a travel site. We built a local information site called Sidewalk. We had a car shopping site. What did we call that thing? CarPoint. How much would the verticals be worth? There was one vertical that mattered, except it wasnât really vertical. Itâs called all shopping. There was all information and all shopping, doing all these detailed specific things. Remember we did a portal. We did that. Then eventually, we did search a few years later. We were just off. We had the wrong thing. Stack ranked in the wrong way, my opinion, with 20/20 hindsight. We were spread too thin. He said, when should you get into a new thing? Well, you probably shouldnât get into five new things if you really only have the talent for one to two new things. Thatâs number one. Scott McNeely of Sun used to have this expression used, âWe got to get all our wood behind one arrow.â Itâs nice to try. I was listening to you guys talk about Amazon and how they, okay, weâre going to try small things, but they also put in small cost structure. We put in big cost structure because we were already all in when we got into something. In this particular case, a few years later, and then what do you do? You get stuck. We have permission to come from behind in a certain way here because weâve got Windows, to your point. Exactly your point. There are lessons to be learned, but for a company thatâs got an established business, being able to get all the way outside of yourself and say, is this really like what weâre doing? Because you really want it to be. You really want it to be. Or does this really require a different approach that all doesnât totally ignore, but doesnât take into account what you own any more than the person starting it afresh. Can you hire new capability or how do you build new capability? Because if itâs not like what youâre already doing, it must require new capability. If itâs exactly like what youâre doing, then youâd be doing it. Ben: And you should be great at it. Steve: And youâd be great at it. Just look. Two models worked in phone. Build the hardware, capture the profit, have a backend monetization system that even lets you pay the phone manufacturer. That worked. Android/Google. Two things worked. Thatâs it. And we werenât in either one. We needed new capability. We needed a new idea. We couldnât use the Windows user interface. There were a bunch of things, but you have to go all the way. Yet we had a Windows everywhere slide. Ben: It was on the slide. I donât understand why it didnât work. Steve: I wrote this thing down here. You get locked in your model. Weâre a platform company. No, weâre an app and platform company. Ben: On our episode, we threw out the idea that Microsoftâs competitor, like the truest form that it should have taken on mobile was not actually Apple. The iPhone is not the bogey. Itâs a pretty different thing. At that point, you were not a hardware company. The bogey was Android. They were monetizing it a different way through advertising and through giving away for free. Microsoft always monetized through licensing revenue. It seems like until Android took off, Microsoft actually did have an opening to become the second mobile. Steve: What year Christmas was this? There was the Christmas of blah-blah-blah year. It was being on time with the stuff we needed for Verizon. There was a Verizon design win because Verizon by now is really feeling itâs getting its ass kicked. David: iPhone launch is on AT&T. Ben: July of 2007. Steve: It mightâve been Christmas even 2008. Ben: Yeah, because the App Store launch next year. Steve: I think Christmas 2008. Possibly even 2009. But I think 2008. Ben: Mobile was this when it started. Steve: It could have even been 2009. But Verizon, the empire had to strike back against AT&T, and there was a window. David: And they went with Troy. Steve: We didnât have our stuff. Look, they wouldâve taken our stuff because they could put pressure back on the manufacturers, but we didnât have the stuff they wanted at the right time. They went Android. Then we kept pushing because I believe in staying hardcore, and then learning and fixing. The problem was we were so locked into our model, it was hard to, to say, hey, weâre going to learn and fix. I donât know where we wouldâve gone with things on phone if I had stuck around. But I probably wouldâve stayed at it. Maybe it would be an Android phone at this stage. Who knows? And maybe not. If you think of yourself as just a platform company, you say we canât do that. If you can think of yourself as an app and platform company with apps that are extensible, ah, then you can say, hey, we actually have a pretty cool user experience that can also leverage some things that we do and can leverage our software skills. Itâs okay to embrace that competitor and extend. But there are so many technologies that are hard to not just popularize, but even get good at unless you have a phone these days. Just take voice. If you want to really be good at voice, you got to get enough signal and youâll get the signal off the phone. You canât say, talking to my PC is sufficient. If you want to get good at maps, there are so many things where being on phones and there are some things even you can make happen by being on cars. I think Tesla gets good at certain things in software because it is a different form of mobile, so they get good at different things. But we missed. Should the company have kept after it? I donât know. Satya knows and Amy and company, they know where they were. But to your original question, big companies deciding, well, itâs not always a mistake to build off what you got, but it can be. Try to get outside of yourself. If you get in, do you have the ability from the top to shake the system and say, no, we started with our old model, but itâs not going to work. Thatâs what I did with Surface. I didnât wind up. It hasnât played out partly. I didnât have as much time with it. There were no high-end PCs that would really compete with Mac. I decided the only way we were going to get there, we couldnât sit there with our OEM model and have it work, if weâre going to have high-end PCs that appealed to users because I wanted us to be a consumer/user company, not just an IT company. Thinkpad had IBM. By then, Lenovo had some higher-end computers. But you never saw them in schools. You never saw them in coffee shops. We needed a high-end PC, and the economics, marketing, and romancing it was not going to be an option for our OEMs. I said we got to go do Surface. Again, would we have tweaked things, done things a little bit better? Part of that, iPad, sure. But the model was not going to work. Ben: Weâve spent a lot of time talking about all these bets that sound very reasonable to make in mobile, in search. We didnât talk about social, but in social and all the dancing you did with Mark Zuckerberg over the years, in Yahoo, in all these things that ended up not panning out, and these were trillion-dollar companies that were built not inside of Microsoft. We talked about one multi-trillion dollar thing that did work with the enterprise. Thereâs another one with Azure. Can you tell us the story of how Azure really got started? Steve: We are in probably 2005â2006. AWS has a little lift off. I think AWS comes to market around then. Itâs not like the cloud is some surprise to us. The Energizer, if you go all the way back to that Energizer thing from the mid-90s, itâs all about the cloud. Itâs before it was called the cloud. Itâs before all the infrastructure that becomes the cloud. Itâs not like we say, oh, woke up one day, itâs oh, thereâs AWS. We didnât wake up one day and say, oh there are backends to applications too. Weâve been doing that with Windows Server and SQL Server. Weâve been in the cloud, blah-blah-blah. But at that point, I think we might have already had Exchange in the cloud as a standard product. Which you have to remember is super important because I really want to give you my sense of what Microsoftâs businesses are. But we didnât have a platform. So I said, we got to do one. Letâs go get Cutler. I say, okay, we got to get Cutler on it. Cutler and I have a great relationship. To this day, we have a great relationship. Heâs a personal friend. Ben: Heâs still writing code at Microsoft. Steve: Heâs still writing code at Microsoft. Ben: Unbelievable. Steve: Cutler and I have been to a basketball game together. Weâve played golf a number of times. Weâve done golf trips together. Cutlerâs a hard ass at work. If he doesnât want to do something, heâll tell you. If he thinks you are wrong, heâll tell you. If he thinks somebody else in the organization is bad, heâll tell you. David: Heâs like a thoroughbred horse. Steve: Heâs very blunt. David: You can run really fast, but you got to get him. Steve: Heâs very blunt, was a great athlete in college. Two sports. I think he played maybe three even in college. But anyway, so I get Cutler, and thereâs a guy working in MSR who I think is underutilized too. This guy Amitabh Srivastava, you guys talk about. I thought he was underutilized doing what he is doing. So grab him, grab Cutler, bring them both onto this project. Is Billy still with the company? David: Heâs about to transition out. Steve: Heâs about to leave, I think. David: Yeah. I think he had probably told you that he was going to leave. Steve: He had told me but hadnât left yet. He was involved until he left. Even then, different nature of involvement. But anyway, I get Cutler and Amitabh to go do this thing. Then Cutler brings some of his (Iâll call) gang, his favorite guys. He brings them over because heâs a magnet for talent, and we get started. We made an explicit decision. I guess you could say itâs also a function of thinking Windows first. I think you guys may have talked about this in your episode. We say weâre going to build Platform as a Service because itâs a Windows platform. Infrastructure as a service a little bit, if you think about it. You are by nature accepting everybodyâs infrastructure. Itâs âby nature,â âmulti-platform.â You become a different kind of a platform because youâre running other peopleâs Linux and whatever. Ben: It doesnât leverage Microsoftâs strength of owning the Windows franchise if youâre just going to be infrastructure. Steve: No, it doesnât leverage our strengths in the sense that weâve got great low-level operating system people. We have all the talent to go do it, and it was explicit we wanted to do Platform as a Service. We said: (a) theyâre doing it, (b) itâs all about the developers. If itâs all about the developers, then you got to have Platform as a Service, not just Infrastructure as a Service. Ben: Well that assumes that the developers targeting Windows Server are still a big, strong, important, relevant developer group. Steve: Which they were and they werenât. Windows Server had a strong developer group. Unix had a strong developer group. On the front end, Windows was definitely stronger. On the backend, Unix was definitely stronger. Ben: But on the front end, by 2006â2007, the web was clearly the emerging developer platform of choice. Steve: Absolutely emerging. Not fully emerged. Emerging. Ben: I would challenge you to say, in 2006 what amazing Windows apps were coming out that would sweep the world and go get a hundred million users because they were great apps? Steve: Hard for me to remember. I think if you go to the field of productivity, the answer is yes there were still. The problem is if you left the areas of productivity and gaming, I think the answer was no. The web wasnât good for a number of things for IT because people didnât feel like they could count on the connectivity. Either the amount of bandwidth or latency or just itâs very existence. We are still at that point. Iâm not saying fair. We were right in the way we thought about. Not saying that. But Iâm also saying there was still a great Windows developer ecosystem. It didnât go from a lot 1999 to nothing by 2005. Ben: Totally fair. Steve: And then on Windows Server, Unix was stronger on the backend. Of course, weâre trying to make Windows strong and weâre trying to get to the cloud. Then weâre learning more things about the cloud from both Exchange in the cloud and Azure in the cloud. How do you make it easy to provision? Whatâs the speed of provisioning? What do you do to serve developers? The notion that you give them a set of free usage and then let them embrace. Developers have two aspects too. There are developers who are not part of enterprises and theyâre developers who are. The developers who are not part of enterprises need a whole different sales motion. You can call them consumer developers, not developers of consumer apps. Theyâre not like big corporations in terms of the way they use. Students are an example, but there are plenty of others who are trying to do startups and blah-blah-blah. In any event, we get going. Weâre learning how to do the things. Weâre building capability for sure in the cloud through both products. By the time I leave, we have some momentum with Azure, but some momentum. The big momentum really is in the last 11 years since I left. David: Well, I think youâre bypassing and underselling here. It really struck me as you were describing the challenges around with a big company like Microsoft, and attacking wildly different vectors like mobile, search, hardware. Azure was that. The cloud was extremely disruptive. The server and tools,what you were doing. Steve: It was extremely disruptive, but it wasnât. Yes and no. The things we understood were translatable. Now, getting the company, people get locked into a model. David: Well you had to replace server and tools. Leadership to make this happen. Steve: Well IT accept things that run in the cloud. That was not obvious back in 2008â2009. Itâs not like Amazon was an enterprise company at the time. It was mostly for startups. Thatâs who was using AWS at the time, so no. I do agree with you. We had to shake up our internal culture. This was my basic message. God dang it. This is our future. We can preserve and enhance these businesses. We can take more value out of the system because the customers donât have to set up their servers anymore. They donât have to do all this work. Essentially, money that wouldâve been spent on people and hardware will get spent with us. Come on, weâre going to do this. It was hard for me even telling our people there was still La RÃ©sistance, as they say, and thatâs why I did the speech at UDub, where we talked about the fact that weâre all in on the cloud. It was partly a reminder to people, get with it or get out of it. Get out of the way. Ben: Making an external speech to communicate something to your internal employees. Steve: In a big company, man, Iâll tell you. Some of what you have to do because people believe the newspaper more than theyâll believe an internal email. Ben: People always talk about how the think different campaign that Steve Jobs did was for Apple employees as much as it (in fact) way more than for the general public. Going back to the core initial start of Azure, I find it very interesting that Microsoft had a business called server and tools business, and that is not where Azure started. Azure started as an incubation by Ray Ozzie with a completely separate team than your existing actual product group selling server and tools. Steve: But thatâs a classic thing. It shouldnât be mind-blowing. Windows and Windows NT were in different groups, too. Sometimes in order to protect the baby while it grows up, you canât put it with the thing thatâs established. You could say itâs part of the issue with Windows, when we tried to use Windows on things for which we probably should have started. David: I was going to ask you, would it have played out differently if youâd taken this approach with mobile? Steve: We did break it out, but we constrained it with Windows. We broke Windows NT out and constrained it with Windows. It worked fine because Windows belong. How you do those incubations, in this case I just said, look. Itâll get probably subsumed. I donât know. Partly, Ray wanted some operating control over the thing, and putting it under [...] wouldâve made it harder for Ray. Obviously, it was less palatable. Iâm not sure Cutler wouldâve gone to work on it if it was all server tools. But it was the right thing to do even though it was âpart of the future of server.â It was the future of server and tools, essentially. Ben: And so this is pretty lost in the common narrative. If this is 2006, that is 7â8 years before you left Microsoft. Steve: Yeah, eight years. Weâd been working on the cloud since Energizer. Weâd been working on Azure for eight years. People think everything in tech gets popular in 10 minutes. Ben: People think Acquired was founded two years ago. Steve: Good point. David: Different scale. Steve: When was OpenAI actually founded? David: 2016, I think. Steve: So seven or eight years after it really became something. Fair to say. I give them all the credit in the world, seven or eight years. Most things take a while. Even things that are âoh, they just burst on the scene.â People have been sweating blood, sweat, and tears for years before these things get lift-off, as I call it my little deck here. We were starting to get lift-off, but yeah, eight years. We had more in on Exchange. Most businesses are zero trick ponies. Ben: You never create a billion dollar business. Steve: Yeah. You might create something that goes nowhere. You might create whatâs essentially a feature for somebody elseâs business and get acquired. You might. I call that zero tricks. Then you get a one-trick pony. One-trick ponies are amazing. People should be in awe of one-trick ponies. David: One-trick ponies are $50â$100 billion market cap companies. Steve: Or it could be more. David: Yeah, or more. Theyâre not many one-trick ponies. Steve: I might argue that Googleâs a one to one-and-a-halfâtrick pony. Still, if you just look at its revenueâ¦ Ben: 80% search ad revenue, something like that. Steve: YouTubeâs half a trick you can call it a psychic trick, but itâs, itâs not clearly a second trick. And theyâre huge. They have great market cap. TSMC. You did an episode on them. Theyâre a one-trick pony. A very successful one-trick pony. Nvidia is a one-trick pony. Ben: Well, gaming and AI. Steve: Okay, Iâll give them two tricks. David: Two-trick pony but the first trick was not that big. Steve: You can decide whether to call it a trick or not, but Iâm not taking anything away from Nvidia, and I should know the company better. But, so you say one-trick ponies. Theyâre amazing. Everybody should be in awe of a one-trick pony. Now, two-trick ponies, ooh la la. Those people tend to go down in business history, especially those tricks stay alive for a long time. IBM was a one-trick pony. Microsoft two to two-and-a-half tricks. David: All right, give us your trick accounting. Steve: Okay, you could do it a little differently. Iâm going to call the desktop business, which I include Windows and Office, and the server/enterprise business, BackOffice. Two tricks. Now, both tricks could have died if they didnât get moved to the cloud, and I knew they could die. But theyâre two tricks. Two different revenue models, two different licensing models, essentially different sales motions. Even the way Microsoft sells those stuff. I donât know about today, but when I left, they were different muscles. One account manager, two different muscles. Because one youâre selling applications, and one youâre just selling, hey, this is to serve your users. You need an AD account, an Exchange account. Itâs exactly Windows. Thatâs what you need. This is what M365, you could call the modern translation of those two things are the Windows OEM business and M365, and Azure. Then you could say, is gaming its own trick? I call it a half a trick. Just like you two. Itâs half a trick. Ben: This is an update since we last talked. I feel like we had a conversation at one point were we both landed in unclear how profitable that business is for Microsoft relative to other. Steve: I could call it a half trick, or you could say it could be a trick. Look, I would say Microsoft is optimistic itâll be a full-on trick. I ran into Phil Spencer at the golf course and heâs a real optimistic guy. It could be. David: Iâll give you this. If we call NVIDIAâs first trick a full trick, then Xbox is a full trick. There we go. Steve: Whatever you want to call it. You said itâs a small trick and I think thatâs probably right. Thatâs amazing. Amazonâs a two-tricker. AWS and the store, theyâre two-tricker. Appleâs two-tricks. Ben: Whatâs your trick accounting there? Steve: Mac and mobile, if you want to say itâs high power consumption and low power consumption. Ben: Is it fair to call services a third? By my estimates, their profit dollars from services have now eclipsed iPhone hardware profit. Steve: I consider it just part of the trick. David: If you go by your platform definition, itâs part of the platform. Steve: I call really a trick, theyâve just monetized it. Itâs like us adding things to Office and redoing the EA. Ben: Itâs a monetization model. Steve: Itâs an additional monetization model, but itâs not a new locomotive. A locomotive is the business that can pull the cabooses, and the locomotive remains the phone. The services business go away pretty quick if the phone volume fell apart. Itâs additional, very importantâ¦ Ben: But not uncorrelated the way that AWS andâ Steve: No. And I think Mac versus everything iOS is also uncorrelated. David: Yeah. I get the sense you really wanted three tricks. Steve: Abso-fricking-lutely. Ben: Whatâs the one that eats you up inside? Which one do you think you were closest to getting that you didnât get? Steve: Not social. Forget social. Ben: Doesnât feel Microsoft-ey. David: You wanted to buy Facebook. Steve: Iâm going to tell you why. Weâre still on the Paul Allen strategy. Weâve got to do all the software that these things will ever need. It was still of the mindset that said, and thereâs an arrogance to that and thereâs a hunger to that that says thereâs just nothing we shouldnât do. I donât think that was a good mindset by the time I took over, and yet it was still baked in with Bill, baked in with me, and I think that was a mistake not focusing. This is like asking me to pick between negative children. I donât know. But the phone because it was a client-side device, or search because it was a productivity tool. Both of those were Microsoft big businesses. The desktop, the phone, or office, client-side devices, we had done well with a certain model. Client-side devices, our mind should have been able to wrap around, but we had to tell ourselves it didnât look the same. Technology didnât look the same, nor did business model. Ben: Then business model astonishingly for search. Advertising, call it 2005. I think Google was making more money off of a PC user than Microsoft was because their business model generated more search revenue. Steve: By 2005, I donât think so. Not later on, I think so. But not by 2005. I would suspect not. You can go check that. Ben: But isnât that astonishing? That of the pie. Steve: And for enterprise PCs, PCs bought by businesses, it certainly wouldnât have been the case. For consumer PC, it could well have already been the case. It actually is a notable difference because of everything else. Our post sales monetization was with applications. Weâre with ads, but it was a new productivity app. We put Office on the back by then. We wouldâve had to put productivity elsewhere, in the sense that we missed a major productivity area. We were in the productivity business and in the client area, and we missed a client device. Those are the two. Nothing else we met, we âmissed.â David: You had an opportunity for four-tricks, and you got two. Steve: Yeah. Part of the problem was particularly, we didnât see mobile as a different trick. We thought of it as underneath the Windows trick, if you will. But it means you can go through. I donât know that I could come up with a three-trick pony for you. Itâs possible that at the Elon level, the Musk empire could have three tricksâcars, connectivity, andâ¦ Ben: In finance, you can do it. Steve: Finance, I donât think there are multiple tricks. You could say asset management versus theâ¦ Ben: Investment banking is different. Steve: Maybe. I donât know. Iâm not convinced. But I hear you. Possible. David: Well, I think this makes sense because Microsoft is the most valuable company in the world with two. So if anybody have threeâ Steve: If you look at the most valuables, youâre not going to find threes. Ben: Thatâs a good point. Sony is nowhere near the market cap of these companies, but itâs pretty evenly diversified across their five segments, from gaming to consumer electronics. David: Movies, music, finance. Ben: Yeah. They have a remarkable diversified. Steve: They bought businesses in multiple areas, but I canât call Sony Pictures a trick. Itâs just not big enough. What you can acquire to start a trick, that part thereâs no pride. Pride in having a trick that starts with something small. David: Androidâs a good example. Google bought Android, but thatâs a trick for them. Steve: Well, Androidâs not a trick. You highlighted it. Android is a piece of the search trick. Ben: Itâs a lead gen. Steve: Exactly. Lead generation for search. Yeah, thatâs right. Ben: Okay. Listeners, now is a great time to thank one of our longtime friends of the show, but actually first time sponsor, Vercel. David: Vercel is an awesome company. Over the past few years, theyâve become the infrastructure backbone that powers modern web development. If you visited a fast, responsive website lately, thereâs a good chance it was built and deployed on Vercel. Ben: The reason for this is Vercel has completely reimagined the entire web developer experience. In the old world before Vercel, if you were a web developer, you basically had two completely different jobs you had to do. One was write code, and then you had to deploy the code to your production infrastructure, which (a) was not a simple task and distracted you from what you were really good at, and (b) usually introduced all sorts of bugs and reliability or latency issues that you had to iron out. David: Vercel did away with this distinction entirely. They built what they call the complete platform for the web, which is a framework to find infrastructure that transforms your code into live, globally distributed production applications automatically. For developers, thereâs no more wrestling with deployment nonsense. You just push your code and it runs, fast. Ben: Itâs a pretty incredible technical infrastructure, which is no surprise because Vercelâs founder, Guillermo Rauch, is himself a pioneering web developer in the modern era. He started Next.js, which is one of the worldâs most popular open source frameworks used by folks like Walmart, the Verge, Nike, Hulu, Anthropic, Claude, the list goes on. David: We did an ACQ2 episode with Guillermo back in February. Go check it out. You canât listen to that and not walk away going, wow, this guy and this company are unbelievably compelling. Ben: Weâll be talking about Vercel all season, including their newest product that is just blowing up called V0, which is an actual AI web developer that you can just ask in plain English to build websites for you. David: Itâs wild. Go listen to the ACQ2 episode and itâll become obvious why Guillermo and Vercel didnât stop at just, oh, letâs eliminate deployment as a barrier to people building fast websites. Letâs also now go eliminate writing code as a barrier as well. Ben: In some cases. Well, if you want to learn more about what Vercel can do for web development at your company and join customers like OpenAI, Granola, Runway, Supreme, Chick-fil-A, Ramp, PayPal, Under Armour, and NerdWalletâgosh, that is a lotâhead on over to vercel.com/acquired, and just tell them that Ben and David sent you. Okay. Weâve been dwelling here in the products and reflecting back on big wins and misses. During your tenure as CEO, can you reflect back on your non-product wins and mistakes? Steve: My biggest hit from my time running sales to president to CEO is establishing us with IT departments, IT professionalsâyou can call that the enterprise, if you willâputting in the framework from a sales and marketing perspective, the staff, Itâs a capability we had to develop. Nobody developed that software model but us. We invented essentially how you do that. Oracle had done some invention, but we came on and did our own invention. We took it to the cloud. We were able to successfully navigate that. From sales, there are product parts to that that let you highlight, but thatâs a big deal and I feel very, very proud about that. From a financial standpoint, everybody likes to say we about tripled revenue and about tripled profit. The truth is, we dramatically increased profit more than a triple. People forget there was a major change that came along early in my tenure. Thatâs the move to have to expense stock options. If you had restated our books to the time I actually took over, stock option expense would have reduced profits notably. Stock options were unaccounted for. If you look at what starting profitability wouldâve looked like if stock options had, it wouldâve been lower, and the multiple over my tenure wouldâve been much more than three. Ben: Okay, so three plus times in revenue. Steve: I think you might say three in revenue and probably closer to four plus, five maybe even on profit. About the same time the dot-com bubble busts. You have two problems. Number one, now weâre showing our books all this expense for stock options. Okay. But people donât value those things what we have to expense. And the stock is flat, so they value them even less. David: This is a really insidious problem. Steve: You got to get rid of stock options. We transition then from stock options to stock awards, which if you notice, I think we were the first to make that as a major transition, but everybodyâs made the same transition with the exception of a few senior executives, options are not the primary form of compensation. Little different in startups. But when you look at larger companies, everybodyâs, David: Even startups are now doing RSUs. Steve: RSUs, and we had to start that. David: I didnât realize that Microsoft started that. Steve: You can check, but I know we moved before most of the tech companies. Ben: Itâs a tough thing to have to inherit right at the beginning of your tenure, coming off of an already all-time high multiple of the stock price. Steve: The dot-com bubble bursting meant our stock price burst intoâ David: But I think to your point, what youâre saying is this became an employee motivation cultural issue. Itâs not just stock price. Steve: No. We had two problems. Before the dot-com bubble burst, you have everybody saying, oh, maybe we should go to a dot-com company because weâre going to make a lot more money. Then the bubble burst and everybody says, Iâm certain you guys [...] see the movie Oklahoma, but thereâs a song, Pore Jud is daid. Ben: Poor Jud is Dead, absolutely. Steve: A candle lights his haid. That was the way people felt about stock compensation. And not just at our place. People were down because everybody thought they had a ton and then they thought they had less. It was a real employee morale issue in the early 2000s. We had to really sell the stuff in. Thatâs a big thing I had to work on. Obviously the antitrust issues. David: When you took over as CEO, what we said in our episode was that was actually your number one priority, was just end this. Steve: It was right up there, yeah. It was up there. I think when I took over, Iâm not even sure we saw a path to resolution, but having it an overhang. Iâll give you a story because it was after I took over as CEO. We had an executive retreat. We did it down in Bend, Oregon. I canât remember the name of the lodge. Sun River, I think. We all fly down there. We rented a plane to fly everybody down there. I donât know how many people by then, it was probably 80â90, something like that. The first session was supposed to be a reportâwe did thisâfrom the field. What are people seeing out there? Whatâs the environment? And this guy, Orlando Ayala, was running sales at the time. He gets upâthis is probably 2002-ish, 2001â2002; weâre still in the throes of the thingâmy name is Orlando Ayala. Iâm a proud Colombian. I am not a proud Microsoftee today. Our integrity is under assault. My personal integrity feels like itâs under assault. Now, he didnât blame us for having behaved badly, but he highlighted the thing thatâs on everybodyâs mind, which is it wasnât just a business issue that needed to be taken care of. It was a culture issue. It was bothering people, particularly senior people, very personally. I had this whole agenda, had to blow the thing up and reorient to address that elephant in the room. It was not where I was going with this thing. Completely remap, change the breakout sessions, focus in on this issue. Bill was not happy with the whole thing. Bill bore the weight of the antitrust thing very hard because for him, I think it also felt like a personal attack. Everybody took it personally. Bill took it even more personally because he was the face of vilification, if you will for this. But itâs a reminder that it was a cultural issue to take care of, not just a market issue. People focus in on the, oh, were you moving slowly? Yeah, there was some of that too. People say, oh, I wonder if we can do this. That was an issue. The cultural issue I think was even bigger. He said, yeah, we got to get this thing resolved. Then there was the order to break us up. I forget what year that was. David: You were going to run one company and Bill was going to run the other company. Steve: We never really got to the point of really planning that through. David: But thatâs what the federal government ordered. Steve: They ordered it split. They didnât say who had to run which company. Ben: I think it was just that you couldnât be at the same. David:: You couldnât be at the same company. Steve: I think it was, I would run operating systems and Bill would take applications. It just gives you a sense of where each of us were associated within the mind of the company. Ben: So thatâs your starting place as youâre taking over as CEO. The dot-com bubbles bursting, antitrust is dominating the companyâs culture and the external narrative. You have this big accounting headache that you now have to deal with that affects the way your profitability has shown. But then thereâs a decade after that where you triple the business, but the stock price is flat. Why didnât Wall Street get? Steve: Iâm going to give you three reasons. Reason number one, and itâs material. Bill and I, and then me and Bill when I became CEO, we always were trying to tell people, donât get our stock price too high. Donât have too big expectations for us. We never wanted people to feel like they got cheated buying our stock. Partly, probably weâre trying to lower the expectations on ourselves. I never thought of it that way. I donât think Bill did. But essentially that was part of it. So we do this financial analyst meeting every July, and weâd always warn people donât get too excited. Thatâs one. As part of that whole theme, Bill never went to a quarterly analyst call, and I never went to a quarterly analyst call. If you really think about it, part of morale is the stock price. It is. It took me a while to realize that, but I then never broke my pattern. Itâs like going to the newspaper every day. You donât sell stock every day, so you really should only care what the stock price is when you sell stock. But people go every day and itâs like, oh, did my team win last night? Itâs like going to the sports section, say how did the Clips do last night? So talking more regularly to investors and talking not pie-eyed but a realistic view. We gave no guidance. I had to fight people. They wanted to give guidance and I didnât want to give guidance. Why? Just deliver the results you get? There was a bit of a Buffet style thing going on, because Bill and Warren were very good friends and Warren didnât go to quarterly calls, I donât think. But heâs warned. David: I donât even know if they do quarterly calls. I donât think they do. Steve: If they do the annual meeting, obviously. Letâs call that a first reason. A second reason is yes, I did take over when the stock was ridiculously too highly priced. Ben: But that normalized within a year or two. Steve: The bubble burst. It normalizes some, but it creates another narrative about things. Next, I was hardcore about telling people Iâm going to spend to do the things we need to do to succeed. David: Thatâs not what Wall Street likes to hear. Steve: No, but I was viewed as a spender, and I was much louder on this than Satya is on anything financial, because itâs how Iâm programmed. Heâs programmed a little differently. And Amy is more balanced. Sheâll talk about balance, and I would say weâre going to win with Surface, whatever it is. Ben: If I could paraphrase my view of it, you were willing to say, weâre going to spend whatever it takes. Amy goes and says, Iâm going to account for every dollar of spend real tight and make sure that every dollar demands a return. Steve: Yeah. I had no credibility in terms of what some investors wanted to hear. And my actions were consistent with that. Itâs not like they were inconsistent. Then lastly, people did worry about the future of a couple of our franchises, most notably Windows. You get all these things, narrative, transition from high price, some issue about franchises, and me being a big spender, no wonder the stock stayed flat. By the end of my tenure, it was even bothering me. David: When did it start to bothering you? Steve: Towards the end. At some point I just got too tired. But by then, it was also probably hard for me to reset that dialogue, for me to go to investors and say, aha, Iâm a changed man. Iâm not going to spend anymore. Nobody was going to believe that shit. They just wouldnât have believed it. You canât come in and say, well, Iâve been a certain way for about 30 years, but hey, Iâm a new man. Iâm reformed. That doesnât work that way if youâre a spender. David: I worship at the altar of capital allocation now. Steve: If youâre a spender, youâre a spender. If youâre not good with investors, theyâre not going to buy in overnight that youâve changed. I didnât intend it that way, but thereâs a certain disrespect by not going to quarterly calls. With hindsight, people arenât going to say, oh, he is showing up. Heâs a changed man. He used to tell us the stock price was too high or worry about it. Now heâs going to tell us, no, the stock should be okay. It should be higher. No. There was no way to reset the investor view of me. Ben: You need a full rebrand, full clean slate. Some newâ Steve: Well, you probably need a full new CEO. When I wrote my letter of goodbye to the board, I did say, hey, look. This is a unique opportunity. There are a lot of things in our brand, in our image that would only be able to be reset by having a new CEO. People donât walk in and say, oh yeah guys are changing. Itâs hard to change the narrative without the change. Now Iâm not saying that means CEO should go every time thereâs a bad narrative. Thatâs not really my point. But it just gets harder. I may have only been CEO since 2000, but itâs not like I wasnâtâ David: Been there since 1980. Steve: Yeah, I was there since 1980. Essentially, Iâd been the second voice of the company for 20 years. Then for 14, I was the first voice, theoretically. Although that had some complexity too. Ben: I get the sense by the end it wasnât fun for you anymore too. Steve: Thatâs not true. Ben: No? Steve: No. The toughest time was probably the ship of Vista. That was probably the toughest time, that in the early 2000s when I took over. My little sheet here, I highlight that 1998 to 2004 were tough years, plus Xbox. Because thatâs the antitrust. Thatâs where I moved back to be president of the company and then CEO. Bill and I went through a year where we didnât speak. Ben: Really? Steve: Yeah. I think it was basically from some time in about March or April of 2000â2001. Literally, we werenât speaking. I didnât know what it meant to be his boss, and he didnât know what it meant to work for me. I knew he was struggling with the DOJ and all this. When he asked me to be CEO, I said, do you really want me to be CEO or do you just want me to be a figurehead? He said, no, I want you to be real CEO. Okay. That meant something to me. I would probably have said yes even if heâd said be a figurehead. But he said what he wanted and probably him saying to himself, hey, Iâve got to have a transition path. So I said, okay. Iâll do that. Well, he didnât know how to show me a different kind of respect. I didnât know how to show him a different kind of respect. There were things where I just disagreed with him, and now I expected it to go the other way. I was always happy. I was happy being a number two guy. I was fine. Salute. I donât like the decision. I either salute or Iâd body punch and then salute, or body punch and heâd agree with me. Body punch means itâs a slower process. Then we didnât know how to do that. We just didnât know how to do that. After a year, we started talking again. Basically our wives were the ones who pushed us back together. We had a very awkward dinner at a health club down the street here, but we get back together. But we never really got the right mojo. Billâs chief software architect, and I was very deferential then to product direction from Bill. Ben: Heâs working on Longhorn at this point because itâs post XP. Steve: Which was a mistake. Longhorn was a big mistake. I have to take accountability. I was a CEO, Billâs got to take a lot of accountability. It was the mistake of mistakes. Between the company, Bill and I disagreed about whether we should do hardware. That was a big one. We did. Surface was a big disagreement. Phone, big disagreement. HoloLens, big disagreement. David: What about Azure? Were you aligned? Steve: Bill was fine with Azure. The cloud Bill and I had agreed on in the 90s. Energizer, Energizer. I think Energizer could have been Billâs idea, not mine. Pretty sure it was Billâs idea, not mine. I executed, but Billâs idea, not mine. But we never hit it. There were places there should have been more contention. Maybe even during the late 90s. I donât know. But there were certainly places where there should have been more contention. My gut, these are the smart technical guys, Bill, and Iâm trustingâ¦ Ben: Vista. Steve: Iâm beginning to have a pit in my stomach. But we didnât have the right contention. This is not directed at Bill personally, itâs directed at all of this. We had an emperor that had no clothes. That was in Longhorn. It was the emperor that had no clothes. Partly, it was the centrality of Windows and the notion that Windows would say central, therefore people would all want this new stuff. Partly there was too much change all at one time. We didnât do a new operating system, but we were doing a new operating system. It may not have sold it all, but we probably wouldâve done better. Ben: Just not calling Windows. Steve: Well, no. Forget what we called it. Just starting from scratch. Maybe keeping parts of the kernel, but otherwise starting from scratch and throw out all the scruff. Now, I donât think we wouldâve popularized it. If weâd looked at it that way, we probably wouldnât have built it. But by then we were a little cocky about Windows and it was our thing. I donât think we had the right grind in our system there in the early 2000s. Between Bill and I, did we make some good decisions? Yeah, we did make a good decision to do Xbox. Were we doing too many things? Yeah, we were doing too many things. I would say there was probably a voraciousness misplaced by Bill and me. Maybe I had to be deal with some of the pragmatics of hiring people and stuff, so I didnât push back on it. But I probably felt the pain a little bit more in terms of trying to hire people. So thatâs 2000â2004. Then by 2004, Bill was already started talking to me about wanting to be able to go. Then in 2006, we announced that he was going to go in 2008. I also think we screwed that up. You canât have a long goodbye. Long goodbyes are not helpful. David: Yours was short. Steve: Yeah, it was goodbye. I stayed on the board for one more board meeting after I left. That was it. But a long goodbye, nobody knows their role. I think I did some of my very best work after Bill left. If you ask me when do I think I did my best work, when I started, and when I was running sales and evolving this enterprise business. Some when I ran system software, and then the last six years I was there. Thatâs cloud, thatâs surface, thatâs some of the improvements in Windows. I feel really good about my last six years. Bing. I think thatâs when we hired Qi Lu. Do you guys know the story of Qi Lu at Microsoft? Qi Luâs one of the most pivotal things at Microsoft? Why? David: I knew he was important, but tell us the story. Steve: Pivotal in a way you may not even know. First of all, brilliant guy. Great guy. Qiâs talking about leaving Yahoo. Heâs at Yahoo at the time. Qi (I think) went to graduate school with Harry Shum, who had been in Microsoft Research. Harry was now working on search, and he was working for Satya who was running Bing. Ben: Thatâs an amazing sentence all in itself. Oh, Satya the guy who was running Bing. Steve: He was running Bing. Harry says, Qiâs a genius. Weâve got to hire Qi. I donât know if Qi really wants to work for. Well, we got to pick Qiâs brain. We just have to learn from Qi Lu. Okay. Satya, me, Harry, fly down to California and we meet with Qi Lu. We talk to Qi. Qiâs brilliant and weâre learning all this stuff about Qi. Qi leaves the room. God, thereâs a lot. I donât know who throws the idea out at first, maybe Satya. We should hire Qi and I should work for him. Ben: Whoa. Steve: So Harry was all in. Harry worked for Satya who worked for Qi. Now we flipped it around. David: You flipped the Whole reporting structure to hire Qi in the room. Steve: After Qi walked, we talked for about 15 minutes. Then Harry calls Qi and said, do you mind coming back? David: Wow. Steve: I forget where Qi was thinking heâd take his next job. He had a next job in mind. Maybe it was with Baidu. I canât remember. Someplace. David: Then what did he do at Microsoft that made him so impactful? Steve: Itâs the story I just told you. Itâs what it told me about Satya. I love Satya. We were giving him more and more responsibilities anyway. But he told me this guy will do the right thing for the company. Heâll prioritize that. He doesnât have an ego that gets in the way. And Qi did great work. Qi knew about search. He was an old pro at it. Ben: And it started cash flowing billions of dollars eventually. Steve: Eventually. Satyaâs not an engineer by training. Qiâs an engineer. Heâs a PhD in computer science. He had a lot to bring. Satyaâs been great at managing product development, thatâs for sure, but Qiâs digging the bits and bytes kind of thing. But the meeting is the thing that was important. Qi was important, sure, but what Satya and Harry did that day where they just found a guy and said, please Steve, go hire him as our boss. Ben: You donât hear that very often. Steve: No. Ben: What year was that? David: It was after Yahoo, 2008â2009. Ben: Six years before Satya became CEO for five years. Steve: 2009, yeah. And that let me then be able to also say, now I can give Satya more responsibility doing something else. Ben: Why did you move him to server and tools? Steve: We had Qi, so we could probably move him. I thought it would be important to give him other experiences, to try to get him to be able to be CEO. He was on a list of three or four internals at that time, who he said heâd been on a list of guys we had been talking about because we did an annual succession plan thing. The succession plan has two candidates. Itâs what happens if you get hit by a bus and what happens if you get served to term, whatever term feels like. And theyâre different people. If Satya gets hit by a bus, if Satya serves another five years, itâs probably a different person. I think thatâs true in most companies. You got to think about it differently. Anyway I said, hey, get him another experience. He hasnât worked in apps, hasnât worked in server and tools, and it was a good time to switch things around. Bob wound up obviously being super successful because. Bob was running server and tools at the time. I love Bob. Bobâs, one of my favorite guys Iâve ever worked with. Ben: Went on to be CEO of Snowflake. David: Snowflake, yeah. Steve: Absolutely. David: Worked out for everybody. Steve: Heâs done fantastically well, but we moved Satya into that job. He was on a great path, and Qiâs hire made search as stronger, showed just how right Satya was. We talk about this in basketball. Is it all about team first or not? All about team first, which is essential. We were able to give them the additional experiences, which were super helpful in terms of him then taking over as CEO. David: Thatâs why Azure was turbocharging. Ben: All right. Listeners, we want to thank our newest sponsor and friend of the show that we are very excited about, Anthropic. David: Anthropic is the team behind Claude. Whether youâre running a business today or flying solo, Claude isnât just another AI tool. Itâs becoming the central operating system for how forward-thinking companies work. Ben: Listeners, thereâs something you should know. Claude actually helped us create this sponsor read. We fed it a few past sponsor reads as examples, and it came back with basically this before a little bit of tweaking from David and I. David: This itself is a pretty great demonstration of how Claude can be useful and took less time than running upstairs from my studio to grab coffee. Ben: What makes Claude different is the quality. It handles the hard stuff, writing and debugging code to build software, analyzing 100-page documents, managing complex multi-step projects, but more importantly, it does them well. Claude is designed to be more accurate, more trustworthy, and tasteful than any AI youâve ever tried. David: Think of Claude as that impossibly organized coworker, who knows every project, has read every document, and can find that email from six months ago. Ben: But hereâs the game changer. Claude connects to everythingâyour CRM, calendar, email, project tools, internal docs. Claude unifies them all into one place through something called MCP (Model Context Protocol), which everyone seems to be talking about this week. Claude can build any MCP connection you need. You just have to ask. Instead of juggling tools, Claude becomes your command center, pulling data from everywhere, spotting patterns across all your software, and surfacing insights that you would never find manually. David: Itâs super cool. Major companies are already seeing results from connecting all their systems. Snowflake uses Claude to answer key business questions with just English instead of writing SQL. Zoom feeds their meeting recordings into claw to automatically create summaries and action items, turning hour-long calls into clear next steps. Ben: If youâre ready to stop switching between tools and start using AI as your business hub, get started at claud.ai/acquired, and just tell them that Ben and David sent you. We want to talk a little bit about your post-Microsoft term, but letâs leave Microsoft with a final question of why did you resign? Steve: Two or three things. Number one, the phone was very on my brain. When you said, are you having fun? That was the thing that was eating at me the most, was the phone. I decided we needed to flip the model around. Your episodeâs pretty good about all that happened, so Iâm not going to go through all that. I knew we had to do hardware. I knew it. There was just no question. We werenât going to be able to play this Android/search game because we just didnât have the power of monetization that they did. Appleâs Apple, but theyâre going to be two phones. Itâs not like thereâd only be one phone that was popular in the world. This is something you guys didnât put in the episode. I had talked about buying a phone company for a number of years before the Nokia deal. I forget what year it was. I flew to Taiwan and we were looking at buying HTC. They were the biggest Windows phone OEM at the time. Nokia wasnât signed up. I finally just decided, Terry Myers and I, we had 3â4 trips to Taiwan to talk to Peter, look at the organization. I just decided it would be too tough to buy a Taiwanese company, that I would worry too much about the integration. I liked Peter Chou who ran HTC. I donât know if that name means anything to you guysâ¦ David: Yeah, of course. Steve: â¦but Iâd been looking at that thing for two or three years maybe before. Bill and I continued to have all the tension we had about anything that had hardware in it. Itâs not like our relationship was calm. Itâs clear. It had always been bumpy. Even back to the beginning, I almost quit after four weeks because we were in it. Five weeks, maybe. Itâs not like it had ever beenâ David: That wouldâve been a very poor economic decision. Steve: It had never been linear. We had another big fight a year after about financial stuff. It had never been linear. It had helped build Microsoft, but that didnât mean it had always been easy for him or me. The hardware thing was exacerbating our relationship. I thought we really needed to do a phone. Then the board said, no, we donât want to do a phone. I was very transparent with everybody. We brought the manager, you got this right. We brought the management team in. I donât know if it was more wanted to buy or didnât want, but I let everybody speak. Itâs a big decision to be in the phone hardware business. We do the presentation, and the process from there to the time the board says no, I didnât find very respectful. The board didnât ask me to leave. I just didnât find the process very respectful. I probably wonât go into the detail of that. And a lot of it has to do again with my relationship with Bill. I knew Bill didnât love the idea, and I was willing to accept whatever the board decided. I was, no question about that, but the process wasnât very good. I was not happy with the process, but they wanted me to stay. I just decided two things. If weâre not going to buy a phone, thatâs my best shot for a consumer future for the company. Right now, thatâs my best shot. I tried to fire the Yahoo shot, the phone shot. Those were my two things, remember? Mobile and search. I said, look. This might be the right time. We canât make my play here, not out of peak. Itâs just, hey, Iâd thought about this in advance and said, look. If it doesnât work, it doesnât work. If the board doesnât want to do it, fine. So I said, this is a good time. Itâs also a good time because the cloudâs just coming on. Iâm saying to myself, look. Weâre going to have to build new capabilities. Even the way weâre moving to a gross margin to something below 100% gross margin business. We have whole new capabilities. We need to build up around that. I even think of it through the lens of the accounting system. We had these revenue and cost reports. They have to change in the world of the cloud because you really have to get tight on gross margin not on revenue. I donât really pay much attention to Microsoftâs revenue. I pay attention to the gross margin growth. Ben: These days, youâre saying. Steve: Those days. When I said the move to the cloud, I used to say this to analysts, you should expect us, you want us to have lower gross margins going forward, but weâll make it up in volume. That is the whole process of the cloud. Lower gross margins. Itâs like Walmartâs an okay company even though that marginâs, whatever, 1.5%â2%. You just got to make it up in volume. I knew it was a good time to let the new person build from what we had to the next generation of all the machinery that would have to happen to make cloud happen. I never lost my desire to be an end user company. I bemoaned the fact that I couldnât keep us focused on being an end user company/consumer. It killed me. You donât just, ah, I want to be a consumer company. No, you got to find the locomotives, not just a bunch of cabooses. At the end of the day, Zune was a caboose. A lot of the things we invested in were cabooses. We had to find the locomotive. There were only two possible locomotives that made any sense. I didnât have a play that I thought was going to break through anytime soon in search. Mobile was going to be really hard. But I knew in my heart of hearts that without physical hardware, we werenât going to break through there either because of search. Board said no. I said, okay. Bill and I are, itâs not really the board being disrespectful. Maybe it is, but itâs mostly me and Bill grinding. And thatâs never fun when we grind. I say, okay, weâre grinding. I know itâs frustrating for him. Itâs frustrating for me. Weâre grinding. Here goes my idea. Oh, by the way, this is a great juncture point. I said, okay, Iâll pass. Then the board changed its mind. Ben: So why did they end up buying Nokia then after your decision was final? You were out. Steve: Oh, I donât know. Ben: Maybe you donât know. Steve: I donât really know. Iâm not sure they really understood, but I had told them about we had a deep partnership with Nokia and Iâm not really sure maybe guys really understood. I hadnât done a good job explaining how close the partnership was. There was really no, go back to Nokia and see if we can have a bigger partnership. The problem with the partnership with Nokia is they didnât have the money to invest in marketing. We did. They did not have the ability to go deep pockets. We did. But if we didnât have the monetization capability back through the phone, we werenât going to be able to make it work as a partnership because we had to put in the cash and therefore we had to get the return, and it wasnât going to work. David: It reached to a point where you had to buy the company or just cut bait totally on the whole thing. Steve: Yeah, just because the math wouldnât work. What we had to do to be successful was beyond their financial capacity. But if we were going to do what it took to be successful, we couldnât do it on $4 [...] Ben: You needed the margin dollars from the hardware too. Steve: Exactly. David: So you left. You did a pretty incredible thing, or really you didnât do an incredible thing. You held everything. Youâre still the largest individual shareholder in Microsoft. Steve: I think I might be. Other than index funds, the largest institutional investor too. David: And basically besides Vanguard. Steve: Iâm not sure about that part, but yeah, it could be. David: On the one hand I imagine it was very simple and youâve given reasons on other interviews in the past, youâre a loyal guy, et cetera. Just talk us through the emotions thinking about that. I imagine that was not so simple. Steve: No. I leave, then what does it mean to emotionally detach? Because if youâre not there, you have to emotionally detach. You canât say because you donât, you canât control anything anymore. Itâs hard. You donât want to stay quite that emotionally attached because itâs like, oh, I got to get back in and fix everything. But I said, Iâm going to be the best investor. Weâre going to know everything about this company. Iâm going to read everything just like I used to. Weâre going to go to conferences just like we used to. I went to one shareholder meeting and I was a dick in my opinion. Literally one of the shareholder meetings. I was too emotionally attached. Took me about a year to say I just have to emotionally detach. It took some work, but I was able to get there. But Iâm still loyal. Didnât want to sell. Thereâs one. Then we get our philanthropy started and then I do need to do something. We do need some of the asset value to give away. I went through a bit where we gave some away, i.e., we put it into our donor advised fund. I also sold a little bit at the time and I was thinkingâ Ben: This is 2015-ish? Steve: Yeah. It might have been even 2016, something like that. Then because our philanthropy was just ramping up. Connie had been giving away money, but the dollar value was ramping up. Then I said, maybe I should just sell it all. Full emotional detachment. Letâs do full emotional detachment. Because look. It was my baby. Itâs my baby. Iâm not a founder, but I think of myself as a founder. I was there so early and I hired basically everybody. Everybody was a senior leader Iâd recruited. Itâs not true anymore. Now things have changed. Itâs probably only 10% of the people who were there now were there when I was there or something. Higher at the senior levels. I can go through the math and why thatâs true. David: But that wouldâve been a very understandable decision of, you know? Itâs time to just put it all away. Steve: Just emotional detachment. It had nothing to do with money. My only thought process was emotional detachment. I was wrestling. David: Youâre ready to hit the button. Youâre ready to hit theâ Steve: It was wrestling. I was wrestling. Then the lady who works here, ex-Microsoftee who works here in finance, whoâs the woman who really charts whatâs going on financially at Microsoft, she and her boss, whoâs another ex-Microsoftee who used to work with me most closely on the financial stuff, but she says, you canât sell. You canât sell. This is going to be worth a lot more. You canât sell. You canât. Ben: So she effectively made a Microsoft stock pick. Steve: And she was recommending. She has some loyalty too. Itâs not like we have a bunch of Microsoftees here, and itâs not like they lack loyalty either, but it was a little bit loyalty and a lot a pick. I said, look. My loyalty trumps my emotional attachment. I can get through my emotional attachment, but my loyalty. And look. I think of the thing as like a two-headed hydra. I thought about this the whole way. Things could go to nothing or things could explode. Thatâs partly why we tamped on the stock, because we always saw the possibility for either of two radically different outcomes. Then finally I say, look. Iâm not going to sweat whether weâre going to get the downside or the upside. Iâm just going to be loyal and Iâm going to be enough emotionally detached for this to be okay. Ben: Because for you it doesnât matter. Thereâs not a downside that could be so bad that actuallyâ Steve: No, I had enough money off the table that ah, itâs not like my familyâs going toâ Ben: Could still run one of the best philanthropies of all time, even if the stockâ Steve: Connie wouldâve been okay with it. She finds it difficult to give away as much money as we have. She wouldnât have mind a smaller problem to start with. She wouldâve been okay. Ben: Iâve been charting it over the last three years. You guys are giving away almost somewhere in the neighborhood of a billion dollars a year. Steve: Cash out the door. Ben: But your net worth is ballooning every year way faster than you can give money away because of the Microsoft hold. Steve: Yeah, Microsoft hold, but you may be missing one thing on the Microsoft hold thatâs important. And thatâs the size of the dividend check. Ben: Ah. Steve: Between Microsoft and the other stuff I own, the dividend checks are pretty close to what we give away. You can look at the appreciation, but weâre just above the dividend checks now. David: Youâre just trying to shovel the money that is coming in the door, out the door. Ben: So you can fund the whole philanthropy without selling additional shares. Steve: Well, there are two things that are going on. One, the dividend checks are pretty good. And number two, I do have stuff thatâs not in Microsoft. Ben: So you hold, I think mostly index funds outside of the Clippers, is that right? Steve: Yeah, Clippers/Arena index funds. I have one business I invested in with a guy who I went to college with who worked at Microsoft. Itâs called Stagwell Media. Itâs a marketing services company. Call it a modern day ad agency, but itâs not really an ad agency. A guy named Mark Penn. I do have some money thatâs not in index funds, but mostly Iâm in index funds. David: Which that anybody else in the same couple of top pages of lists that youâre on, you must be the only one that operates like this. Everybody else, huge family offices, lots of investments, private equity funds. Steve: Yeah, but I would say probably would find that Zuckerberg is pretty concentrated. I donât know this, but Iâm going to guess you would find, I donât know about Ellison, but obviously some of the guys who own more privately-held businesses pretty concentrated. Ben: Required to be concentrated. Steve: Yeah. Who else? The Google guys I imagine are concentrated, but I donât know that, I canât speak for anybody else. Obviously, Bloomberg is concentrated. David: Well, I think in practice it all works out the same way of, thereâs one thing that is everything. Steve: Yeah. And look. If you sell it, youâre just going to pay capital gains taxes. If youâre really just being a financial monster about it, you got to decide, will Microsoft underperform the index by enough to offset the capital gains taxes. I donât need the money. I got plenty to live on without selling anything. Thatâs number one. Financially, whereâs that money going to go? Some will go to my kids, but most of itâs going to go to the government or to philanthropy. Why would I sell, so we have less to give to philanthropy someday, unless I really think Microsoftâs going to underperform the market by essentially the capital gains rate. Ben: I feel like Iâm watching a live USA facts video right here. Steve: I got this question once. Iâm a member of a country club in LA, and one of the things country clubs do sometimes is theyâll do Q&A with members to entertain. I did a Q&A with a friend of mine at the club whoâd been president of the club, actually, and also as a knows Charlie Munger pretty well. Charlie Mungerâs there as well. Charlie Munger comes up to him beforehand. And to me. I know Charlie through Bill and Warren, and says, if you call on me, I have a question, David: As only Charlie can. Steve: You did a Charlie episode. We do our panel thing, the two of us, and then Q&A. Charlie gets up to the mic, heâs not moving super well, but he gets up to the mic and, oh, Charlie. We can call on you. Charlie says, Steve, Iâm wondering why you held onto your Microsoft stock when your partners over there didnât. I know youâre not that smart. Steve: I said, no, Charlie, but Iâm not loyal. I donât know why Paul and Bill didnât hang on. I donât know. Youâd have to ask them. But for me itâs from the heart thing. And I think itâd be fine. Itâs not going to screw anything up financially. Whatâs the worst thing that happens? Microsoft goes to zero? Probably not, but even if Microsoft goes to zero, me and my family, we can live, we can give away money, itâs not going to go to zero. And Iâm okay any way it goes. Iâm fine. Ben: And are the Clippers and the Intuit Dome fully paid off at this point? Steve: The Clippers are fully paid off. I paid them off the day I bought them. Thatâs not true. I didnât want to sell stocks at the time, so I borrowed some money, which is long paid off. Intuit Dome, we borrowed some money against Intuit Dome. I donât owe any money on it. Oh, thatâs not true. I owe some. I have some margin debt that I use to, but again, itâs just a timing thing. I didnât want to sell stock, so took some margin debt, which as dividends come in, Iâm reducing the margin debt. But the building itself has debt on it. Why? Because to sell the building, letâs say something was to happen to me and Connie (my wife) had to sell, the buyer would have to come up with less cash because it has debt on it. Call it worth X billion and itâs got Y billion on debt on it. Youâre only selling it for X minus Y. Youâre not selling it for X. Meaning the universe of buyers is bigger because it has debt on it. Oh, by the way, I happen to get the debt at a very good time, at a very good rate. Itâs a double value to a future buyer. Thatâs the reason we put that on the building. The margin debt was just a timing issue, if you will. Ben: I feel like weâve done you a great disservice by going into the Clippers and Intuit Dome throughâ Steve: The financial lens. Steve: Now, that I do not own the financial purposes. And I will also tell you, unlike Microsoft, it cannot go to zero. David: Like the asset value? Steve: Not a chance. It is far more secure than Microsoft. Why? David: Not making more of them. Steve: Theyâre not making more of them, and as long as anybody in the worldâs getting richer, the buyer pool will only go up. People donât buy them for their earnings. I wish we had more earnings, but at the end of the day, people are buying them because almost more like a piece of art. Some people donât like negative cash flow, blah-blah-blah, but at the end of the day, I have the Clippers, we have the best market in the world. If you want to want to own a basketball team, other than maybe Miami, the only place players want to play is LA. If youâre a buyer, where do you want to go if you donât live in LA? Where do you want to go? Well, you want to go to LA or you want to go to Miami. You donât want to go to New York in the wintertime. If youâre a foreign buyer, potentiallym, you want to go to LA. That asset valueâwe should get onto something other asset valueâIâm not selling the thing. My estate may sell it. I donât know what Connie and the kids will want, but at the end of the day, that one does not have a lot of volatility. David: Itâs a nice retirement fund. Whatâs been the most surprising thing in your Clippers journey? Steve: Iâll give you two parts of the answer. First is how I relate to that business versus the businesses Iâve known. Number one, there are more similarities than I ever thought. We do version upgrades just like you do. Whatâs a version upgrade? You do major version upgrades over the summer. Thatâs the draft and free agency and trades. And you do a minor version upgrade at the time of the trade deadline. Itâs very simple. David: You got a six month ship cycle. Ben: Your service pack. Steve: A major pack, minor release every year. David: SP1 and SP2. Steve: And oh, by the way, how people like agile now development, guess what? Thatâs called changing the game plan per the coaches are always modifying in that sense. Itâs a little bit similar. Ah, I never thought about that. The business is just like Microsoft. We sell both advertising and thatâs called sponsorship. We sell tickets. David: Software licenses. SteveOh, no. Thatâs only software licenses. We have an OEM business thatâs called broadcast revenue. Itâs 100%. David: Remarkably similar. Steve: Just the terms of business model. We do have a union. Thatâs very different. What that means in terms of the complexity through the collective bargaining agreement, it also covers things like whatâs max salary, what trades can you make, all that very different. You actually really are business partners with your competitors. Thatâs different. You actually get together and talk to them. I never did that when I was at Microsoft. Youâre get together and you talk to them, but youâre trying to compete. If you have somebody who wants to advance through their career, oftentimes the best way for them to advance, they have to go to another team. We have a president of basketball. Itâs not an open job. I donât plan for it to be an open job. I donât want to lose anybody. But if a lot of the career moves people make would be to other organizations. We donât like that. But we want to have the talent. Everybody loves. David: Microsoft, your domain is always growing. Steve: The domain is growing, or number of people, you can move people. Oh, youâre an engineer. Youâre bored. Youâve worked on X. Weâll move you to work on a different product, for example. Itâs different the way you think about people, primarily because of the union, but also there are only 30 head coaching jobs. There just are. If somebody wants to be a head coach and theyâre not our head coach, they have to find a job someplace else. Again, not what we want, but the reality is we donât want people held back in their career. Itâs not like Microsoft where I felt like I could always find a job that somebody should want. Thatâs different. Iâll give you another one to think about. Business likes to say, oh, weâre accountable, weâre agile, weâre this, weâre that. Sports is so much more accountable than business. Itâs like a joke. Iâm being a bit extreme for fun. But every 24 seconds, you get a report card. Basketball shot clock every 48 minutes. You canât say, Iâm going to make it up next quarter. We missed, but I got it next quarter. No. You lost that game, that game is on, you lost comp for the rest of the season. You cannot dig yourself out of that one game loss hole. You canât. Itâs gone. David: And you can probably also be reasonably confident about each individualâs contribution to that win or loss. Steve: Now let me get to that. Your customers know everything you know. Itâs not like you could say back in the lab, you wait until you see what we got in the lab. No. Every statistic we have, our customers have. You want to know how many miles James Harden ran last game? Comes out of the statistical systems. You can find that out. If you want to know how many pick and rolls we ran of a certain type, how they were guarded, and how we did scoring against them? Donât worry, you can read about it. You want to look and see what the dynamics look like on the sidelines? You can just sit there and watch our players and say, oh, I donât know everything. I donât know what theyâre saying, but I can see their body language. Oh, so and so seemed severely charged up. Oh, thatâs great. So and so cheers for their teammates. So and so seemed down. Thereâs almost nothing. We get to watch practice, our fans donât. But the level of accountability is so high. The speed is high. Think of teamwork. Teamwork, man. Itâs all on display. Not only is it on display, but you absolutely know you need teamwork. One star canât bail you out. You may have one star, but then the pieces have to fit around the star. Itâs just the way it is. You know how businesses, you say, okay. Everybody wants to talk about teamwork. In a lot of places that would mean, hey Ben, I donât know. We could work better on this. Then Ben can say, your teamâs doing things wrong. Then we can get back together and talk a little more. Then a month later we can talk about it some more. Probably youâve seen this in some organizations. Ben: And then at some point, weâll talk about it as if it were a great collaboration between our two teams. Steve: And what has to happen in our business? David: You actually got to pass the ball. Steve: You have to actually say it, pass the ball. Or hey, this isnât working. You got to do X. You got to give real time feedback. You canât lolly gag. Ah, well letâs rub each otherâs belly. No. If you want that team to be better, you have to hold one another accountable. Not just the coach. The best teams, the players hold each other accountable, and not just the best player holds everybody else accountable. Everybodyâs got to hold everybody accountable, which really means give the feedback. In Microsoft, we got rid of the value called teamwork. I didnât want that one. I said open and respectful and dedicated to making others better, because teamwork could sound like a treat. Everybody nice, nice. Open? Yes. Got to say whatâs on your mind. Respectful? Yes. But number one, dedicated to making each other better, which I think is what the purpose of teamwork is, as opposed to the word teamwork. Ben: Oh, thatâs interesting. Teamwork is an implementation detail, but thatâs not actually the goal. We donât seek to have an organization full of teamwork. Itâs teamwork because we want some output. Steve: Exactly. I think back to the old HP, Iâm okay, youâre okay. Letâs all be nice to each other. Thereâs a little bit of that thatâs come back into the general narrative of culture today, generations much younger than me. But at the end of the day, if you want to succeed, youâre right. The goal is succeeding. Play well together. In the NBA team, youâre going to know in 2Â½ hours or so, 2 hours, youâre going to know. David: Itâs interesting. Professional sports is maybe like the last bastion of thereâs not room for the Iâm okay, youâre okay, letâs talk this out. Oh, your teamâs talk to my team. Itâs extreme accountability. Steve: Extreme accountability, extreme teamwork. I learned some things that wouldâve been very helpful for me to understand at Microsoft. Iâll give you another one. Reference checking. Everybody does reference checking. How good is the reference checking in most businesses? David: Not good. Ben: Most people call front of sheet references, which has never made sense to me. Steve: Or you call somebody who probably doesnât feel like they can give you an honest answer because they donât want to get sued or blah-blah-blah. Basketball? You should see the amount of reference material we have on a guy before we draft them. People have talked to their old coaches, theyâve talked to their teammates. Thatâs what scouts do. Theyâve watched them play, theyâve been to practices, they know what theyâve talked to references about work at. Ben: Imagine if you could scout your future employees. You could just go hang out at their current job. Steve: Or you talk to their parents. There are so many things. David: The draft choices are such a crucible decision because free agency, you mostly know what youâre getting. They have a body of work. Steve: You can see the body of work. You may know what happens behind the scenes. You may not. David: So thereâs some risk to it, but thereâs a body of work. A draft, you get two choices every year. Steve: Well, we traded some away, but yes. David: But in theory. In aggregate, every team gets two choices every year, and you could choose to deal those choices. And thatâs hugely, hugely impactful. Steve: And youâre dealing with one other thingâmy wife reminds meâboysâ brains donât fully develop until theyâre what, 25? Weâre drafting guys who are 19, 20, 21. Youâre also having to say by everything I know, what do I project that guy looks like? You could say you enter your prime around 27, what do you start looking at though? Youâre going to look pretty good or not by 23, 24, 25. You have to have a progression of what you think happens to the young man when you draft him. The more reference checking, much bigger deal I found. People say, oh, well itâs simple. Itâs sports. The strategy decks I get, 35 PowerPoints, 40 PowerPoints, easily to go through. Okay, hereâs our strategies. What about this? What if? What about this. What do we do here? We have a PhD physicist who is a key part of our analytics group, focuses on our analytics systems. Itâs not like this stuffâs not complicated. It is. Ben: Analytics has become this really big buzzword in sports. Where do you see real alpha actually happening in data science and sports, versus whatâs just table stakes at this point? Steve: There are two ways to use analytics. One is for game planning. Literally, what does this tell us about the best way to guard Anthony Edwards in this situation or these situations? Very helpful for that. Iâd say the data is probably table stakes, honestly. The way you use it, not so much do you ask the right questions? Maybe not. Does coach really understand and embrace? Are the analytics people really able to mind meld with coach so that coaches get the insights they can for game planning? The second is, what about for drafting and trading? Analytics are actually a little less important in that instance. Because they donât really tell you how, if you mix Charlie with Harry, itâs different than if you mix Charlie with Bobby. And Charlie and Harry havenât played together before. So itâs a little different, and they are helpful. We have analytics, for example, and all the kids weâre going to draft, less valuable than on pros because youâre playing against a different level of competition. Do people have differential data? Not much. The same cameras in the ceiling are recording the same games. Most of the analytics data now gets processed through standard software packages that get licensed to everybody. Thereâs a company called Hawkeye Second Spectrum. Basically, theyâve built machine learning layers on top of the raw motion data, et cetera, so every team winds up with the same tools. Doesnât mean you donât need smart guys. It doesnât mean you donât do analysis on top of it. Ben: Has anyone had a breakthrough form of measurement? Is there an example in the last five years of a team thatâs had a great data source emerge? Steve: A different data source than other people have? No, I donât think so at all. Itâs the things people emphasize in terms of what they look at could be different (I think) very much by teams. Theyâre teams at the draft who just have you take a psychological test, you get to interview a set of kids and they might just have you take a test. Other teams, itâs all about the interview. Some people, I donât know if they see psychologists. I donât know. But people will use different techniques to try to do some of that. Itâs a little different from analytics, but it gives you the sense of how do you assess whatâs important. Ben: Fascinating, David: Interesting. How does Intuit Dome fit into all this? Steve: I love Intuit Dome. Since we talked a lot about products, and Iâve been involved in (Iâll say) the visioningâI call myself a visionaryâwhat should this product look like, particularly a number of them, both Windows but also certainly on the backend productsâbackend meaning theyâre not customer visibleâIâd say Intuit Domeâs probably the product for which I had the clearest vision Iâve ever had. I knew what I wanted. It evolved some because we went and looked at a bunch of other arenas. But I had a point of view. I know what user I wanted to make happy. Ben: So I bet a lot of people arenât familiar what is the thesis behind Intuit Dome? Steve: I wanted to make Intuit Dome the best place for the hardcore basketball fan. Ben: And particularly the hardcore Clippers fan, right? Steve: Sure, of course, because weâre the only team that plays there. David: Youâve got another team who plays there every night. Youâre visiting team, but not trying to help them. Steve: Yes, Clipper fans, but weâre going to have the Olympics. Weâll have every Olympic basketball game. And Intuit, I want it to be great for those environments. We have some college games or high school games in there. Basketball, basketball, basketball. You sit in there and youâre a fan. Itâs a live event. Got to have energy, got to have intensity. If youâre a basketball fan, come on, letâs go. So you want it tight. You want to have it reverberating with people who are cheering. Essentially, a whole side of the building is structured more like a college gym. Long and steep, there are no suites on the side. We even built a student section right in the middle. Itâs standing room only. You must stand. Thatâs what you have to agree to if youâre going to be there. You have to agree to stand. You have to agree to cheer. If you donât, weâll find you another place in the building to sit. You canât wear visiting gear paraphernalia on that whole side. Four thousand seats. Will move you if otherwise. Itâs small. Not the number of seats is a little small, but the way we pulled it together, thereâs no hockey. I didnât want hockey. Not that hockeyâs not a great sport, butâ David: Compromises youâd have to make to the arena. Steve: You have to spread it out. You have to spread people out because the rink is bigger than the court. Very different. We have an acre of scoreboard. David: The halo board is unreal. Steve: More statistics. We went 4K from the start. David: I didnât realize itâs an acre. You have an acre of scoreboard. Steve: Between the inside and the outside, itâs almost an acre. Ben: Itâs the largest indoor screen in the world. Steve: For sure. Ben: And what you were describing before is the wall. For any fans or listeners who havenât seen a game there or seen anythingâweâve done interviews about thisâitâs an unbrokenâ Steve: Fifty-one rows, unbroken all the way up. I call it the student section. We call it the swell, Clippers, waves, get it? Swell. The swell is right in the middle. They do a chant before the game starts. Theyâre chanting, theyâre making noise, a bunch will find weird things they want to bring to games. Funny posters. You basically sign up, first-come-first-serve. If youâre not there early, youâre not in the swell, that game. We oversell the section. Itâs $1000 for the year, which is only $25 a game. Hell of a price. Youâre expected to deliver the goods. You have to deliver. David: You got to bring the value. Steve: You got to bring the value. Ben: And the thesis behind the wall, if Iâm understanding correctly, is it should be easy to be a Clipper player, but hard to be an opposing player. Steve: We put it right on top of the visitor side, so it makes noise right into the visitorâs huddle. We put the swell right behind the backboard, so basically when youâre shooting free throws on that end, youâre looking right at the swell. David: And it makes a difference. Ben:. I saw data that said that theâ Steve: Lowest free throw shooting percentage of the league for the visiting team is against the wall. It worked. Thatâs what I wanted. David: What did the other owners think about this? Steve: Weâve had a bunch of people come through and look at the building. Would I be surprised if a number of the new arenas get built donât have a wall. No, I would be, or at least, student section. David: Youâve got a duration of your advantage because not every other team can build or remodel an arena. Steve: But you also have to remember, I took some financial hits on this. We have fewer suites, less revenue, and we only charge $1000 for a season ticket that gets you pretty close to the floor. Ben: And you didnât have any public funding for it, so in terms of the cash outâ Steve: Yeah. California, you canât have public funding for arenas. Thatâs why we donât. Ben: You paid for the whole arena and youâre going to have slower payback on that because you have less revenue opportunity. Steve: But we took a revenue. Definitely we could have made more revenue on that side if weâd done things a little bit differently. But itâs about basketball. We have a lot of toilets. Ben: Three times the average or something like that. Steve: Something like that. Why? Itâs about basketball. Get out and get back into your seat. Donât miss the action. We started out with a lot more concession stands, and then we said, no, no. Letâs just do this completely frictionless. If you register your face, you just walk in, grab what you want and leave. If not, you could just tap your phone on the way in, grab your stuff and leave. Thereâs no checkout. We donât serve eclectic food. Little everything. Same thing everywhere. Why? We donât want you walking around having to look for your favorite food. No, youâre going to get the same great stuff everywhere. It turns out 85% of what gets bought is in five items anyway. Itâs a hamburger, itâs a hot dog, itâs nachos, chicken tenders. Iâm not remembering off the top of my head. David: Is part of the calculus of this for attracting players too? Steve: Sure. If you look at our backend spaces, like our practice facility, ooh la la. David: But Iâm thinking even if your opponentâs going to have a lower free throw shooting percentage in your home arenaâ¦ Steve: Sure. Players have said they think itâs really cool. And thatâs good. Thatâs good. Playersâ offices are also good, i.e., the training area, the practice area, our outdoor pool, sauna, and cold plunge, our weight room, our sports performance center. That stuff, all I would say, are pretty good as well. Very good. Weâve done a bunch of things. We have the best refs room (I think) in the league. We called the refs union and said, what do you guys need? The media area, we said, look. If weâre going to build a new arena, our visiting locker roomâs the best in the league. Best weight room. David: Thatâs your sales pitch to visiting stars. Steve: Exactly. We say, hey, we care, and we care about everybody. Then we make it about the basketball, in and out. Oh, whatâs our artwork? We have public art that is required, some of which is basketball-oriented. But our major piece of public art is a clipper ship whose masks are replicas of basketballs from around the world. Basketball, basketball, basketball. Our art inside the building? We have a high school basketball jersey from every high school in the state of California. It looks like art almost because Itâs nice colors on the wall. Basketball, man. Itâs about the basketball. Ben: This building feels like your personality into a physical structure, the competitiveness, the loyalty, the fixation on what mattersâ David: On the customer? Steve: Yeah, it is. Look, you know how oftentimes startups come about because the founder is in love with some topic and builds the product they wanted to use? I think that happens a lot. I donât think people start back and look at the market, they say, oh, I thinkâ¦ I think Zuckerberg did that, Bill did that, programming, everybody does it. Thatâs what you did. I didnât try to go out and survey. We could have designed for the, let me call it the contemporary audience. We wouldâve had more lounge space. We could have designed for what Iâd call traditional, long-term. Thatâs how I think about it. We could have designed in a lot of ways. I designed for me. In some large measure, guys like me. It turns out Clipper fans are a little bit like me, because some of them are long suffering. The team wasnât good there for a number of years. People are diehard, come up to you and say, Iâm 89, which really means they bought their season tickets in 1989. Theyâve been there and now weâve exploded in the last, whatever, 14 years. We havenât had a losing season. Ben: Hopefully a championship here at some point. David: When are you going to overtake the Lakers? Steve: There are battles in tech where you just have to be patient and long-term. Itâs weird to have a town with two teams. Our goal is to be long-term grinders on that. We want to beat them every time on the court. Itâs okay to have two popular teams. Los Angeles County, for gosh sakes, has the same number of people as the state of Ohio, pretty much.

Ben: Appreciate it. Ooh, David, that was fun. David: Yes, it was. Ben: Iâve always wanted to interview Steve Ballmer. In fact, when I was at Microsoft, I wasnât a podcaster then, but at the time I was such a junior employee. But man, there was a complicated landscape that Steve was navigating between the product set, between developer relevance, between the shifting landscape underneath him, and will Windows be the interesting bet to make going forward? personnel stuff, board stuff, eventually CEO transition. That is not a job I want. David: Itâs fun for us as a show, too. Obviously this is meaningful for you personally, but when we started the show in Seattle in 2015, the Microsoft transition, Steve, Satya, this is what was in the water. This is what we all talked about at Madrona or Seattle in the tech ecosystem. Ben: And itâs not clear that Microsoft was going to be this amazing juggernaut that it turned into. Obviously, Steve had planted some seeds in enterprise and what would become the juggernaut of Azure, but we were early in Satyaâs tenure when we started this show. Everyone had high hopes, he had started to transform the culture, but itâs come a long way. David: Steve knew how great Azure was going to be, but the rest of the world didnât yet. Ben: Yup. So fun. All right. Well listeners, a few things before we wrap. One, New York City.

September 01, 2025 09:04 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Sept. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Law Enforcement Software Market by Offering (Solutions, Services), Deployment Mode (On-premises, Cloud), End User (Police Department, Federal & State Agencies, Correctional Institutions, Law Enforcement Agencies), and Region - Global Forecast to 2030" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The market report comprehensively covers the law enforcement software market, providing accurate revenue estimates and insights into segments by solution type, service type, deployment mode, end user, and region. Stakeholders can leverage these insights for competitive positioning and effective strategies. The report outlines key market drivers, restraints, opportunities, and challenges, keeping industry players aware of the market's current state. It includes a detailed competitive assessment and analysis of key drivers, product development, market diversification, and development in unexplored regions. The global law enforcement software market is forecasted to rise significantly, increasing from USD 20.25 billion in 2025 to USD 32.96 billion by 2030 at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.2% during this period. Enhanced government budgets and favorable policies are key factors accelerating this growth, as several governments prioritize smart policing initiatives to tackle rising crime rates, public safety concerns, and the need for transparency. These initiatives involve applying AI analytics, digital evidence management, and cloud record systems, leading to streamlined operations, improved decision-making, and enhanced community engagement. Despite these opportunities, reliance on outdated legacy systems presents a considerable restraint. Transitioning to modern platforms requires substantial time, technical skills, and financial investment, with integration complexity and expense likely to be major obstacles to the market's growth. Deployment Mode Insights The on-premises segment is projected to hold the largest market share in 2025. Law enforcement agencies favor on-premises software solutions for enhanced control, security, and adherence to data privacy regulations, particularly when handling sensitive information such as criminal records and personal details. This deployment method offers full ownership of IT infrastructure, ensuring data security within agency-controlled servers rather than on external cloud platforms. Regulatory mandates for local data hosting and in-house system management reinforce the adoption of on-premises solutions, promoting data protection and operational control. Service Type Insights The support and maintenance segment is expected to witness the highest CAGR during the forecast period. Agencies increasing prioritize these services to maintain the effective operation of complex software like record management and crime analytics platforms. With ongoing technological advancements and evolving compliance needs, continuous support services become crucial for software performance and smooth operations, driving demand for support and maintenance. Regional Insights North America is set to lead the market share, driven by advanced technology infrastructure, substantial public safety funding, and early digital tool adoption. The U.S. leads in deploying data analytics, AI-powered surveillance, CAD, and RMS for operational efficiency and public safety enhancement, supported by established vendors and increasing cybersecurity investments. In contrast, Asia Pacific is emerging as the fastest-growing market, driven by rapid urbanization, crime rate increases, and national security concerns in countries such as India and China. Despite budget limitations and technological gaps in rural areas, collaborations with global vendors and cloud-based solution adoption are accelerating market growth. Key Market Participants Interviews with CEOs, directors of innovation and technology, system integrators, and executives from key companies led to valuable insights. Significant vendors include Motorola Solutions (US), Axon Enterprise (US), NICE (Israel), NEC Corporation (Japan), Hexagon (Sweden), Palantir Technologies (US), IBM (US), Nuance Communications (US), Esri (US), and Gentec (Canada).

Title: 5 Common Health Mistakes That Cost Your Business Millions
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jodiecook/2025/09/01/5-common-health-mistakes-that-cost-your-business-millions/
Time Published: 2025-09-01T12:00:00Z

ByJodie Cook, Senior Contributor. CEO health directly impacts corporate performance and earnings. Anthony Ng Monica highlights 5 common mistakes leaders make: relying on motivation, all-or-nothing thinking, neglecting planning, ignoring triggers, and seeking quick fixes. Prioritizing sustainable health habits is crucial for business success. Fit and healthy leaders make more money. But if you’re unfit, your business probably is too. CEO health problems are linked with lower corporate performance. Without peak health you’re less good at strategic decision-making, which directly correlates with revenue, profit, and happiness as a leader. Do you feel energised, strong and confident every day? Or is health and fitness something you believe you have to sacrifice for business success? Too many founders think business success comes at a price. But what if that’s not true? Anthony Ng Monica is the founder & CEO of Daily Body Coach, a performance-optimization coaching service for entrepreneurs and executives. A former tech founder with a successful exit, he now brings together elite certified coaches in training, nutrition, and psychology to help business leaders achieve peak performance. Designed to fit seamlessly into demanding lifestyles, the Daily Body Coach program empowers clients to become better leaders, healthier individuals, and more successful in business. From experience working with hundreds of business leaders, including founders of 7, 8 and 9-figure and publicly-traded companies, here are the 5 common health mistakes Ng Monica sees on repeat. “Push harder” screams the personal trainer. But it doesn’t work. It never does. Ng Monica takes a different approach. “The real trick is to identify what you genuinely enjoy, that fits seamlessly into your lifestyle,” he said. “Once you’ve done that, sticking with it becomes effortless and performance compounds.” If you need motivation, you’re doing it wrong. Pro athletes and people with incredible levels of health and fitness aren’t relying on willpower to get them out of bed and into the gym. Instead, it’s part of their identity. They have created habits around the identity of being someone who takes care of themselves. Once you do this, it becomes easier to be healthy than not to be. All-or-nothing thinking is common among entrepreneurs. Business situations are either total successes or complete failures. You’re either having the best day ever or you hit rock bottom, with little appreciation for incremental progress or nuance. The founders Ng Monica works with are no different, but he teaches a different way forward when it comes to health. “Founders already have busy schedules. The moment a founder’s routine breaks (which can be for travel, a date night, or business lunch), everything else follows,” he said. “Without an intentional plan, they’ll fall off. One day turns into five, they’ve been set back and it becomes a grind to get back at it.” One bad day shouldn’t mean everything unravels. You’re better than that. Instead of polarising health and fitness, find the sustainable middle ground where balance is key. “Progress isn’t about perfection. Avoid feeling the need to compensate. Just press ahead with the plan and don’t let a single bad day define your direction” You plan your business goals in quarterly increments. You measure the stats and have progress meetings. You’re always working towards goals. But why isn’t this the same for health? “One founder we work with used to return from every business trip five pounds heavier. But learning how to handle business travel helped him avoid that,” explained Ng Monica. “What we told him was simple. Skip the welcome snacks and plane food (it’s never good anyway). Make smarter choices at the airport.” You don’t need to make progress on your business trips. Just don’t regress. Plan your health like you plan your marketing campaigns. “Have back up plans on Uber Eats or Doordash that you can default to when you don’t have time,” advised Ng Monica. “It takes the same amount of time to eat something healthy versus unhealthy.” “We see a lot of clients want to ‘save calories’ when going out for dinner, so they start restricting their lunch,” explained Ng Monica. “But they arrive at the restaurant so hungry that they have a hard time being rational and making healthy choices. It’s like going to the grocery store while hungry.” This isn’t the plan. Instead of consistently missing your targets and never finding out why, get real. Listen to your body. Apply second order thinking to the structure of your day. If you skip breakfast, how will you feel at 2pm? If you don’t stock your fridge with healthy food, what’s going to happen when you pass a donut shop? It becomes obvious when you think about it. “There are so many companies in the health and fitness space,” said Ng Monica. “But most of what they share isn’t true or helpful.” Most of health and fitness comes down to four simple pillars: nutrition, exercise, sleep and stress. “Unscrupulous practitioners prey on knowledge gaps and weaknesses of people,” added Ng Monica. In business, there are no quick fixes. Everyone wants to get rich yesterday, but the truly rich built their wealth over a number of years. If you cut corners, your customers find out. If you look to score a quick buck, you’ll build a reputation for being dodgy. Health is the same. “Good consistently equals great,” said Ng Monica. “Every time you find a shortcut, you’ll pay for it later.” Don’t create debt for your future self. If you can build a six or seven figure company, you already did the difficult part. You can develop healthy habits in health and fitness. Avoid the six common mistakes costing leaders their company performance. Don’t fall for the motivation trap, find balance instead of operating at the extremes, and plan ahead for an easy existence. Know why you go off track, unlink food from emotions, and stop looking for hacks because they don’t exist. It’s never too soon to take this seriously.

Title: Windows on Arm PCs can now connect to Meta Quest — Microsoft sneaks out Mixed Reality Link update

Mixed Reality Link now supports Windows on Arm, letting Snapdragon X PCs connect to Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. If you have a PC powered by a Snapdragon X processor, you can now connect it to your Meta Quest 3 or Meta Quest 3S headset. Mixed Reality Link now supports Windows on ARM PCs, giving users more flexibility when it comes to using a local Windows PC within virtual reality. It's not clear when Microsoft added support for PCs powered by Snapdragon X processors. The Mixed Reality Link listing in the Microsoft Store states that the app received an update on August 29, but there does not appear to be a change log. A Reddit post by user "Nicalay2" highlighted the new capability. Regardless of whether the feature is brand-new or rolled out previously, it's a nice addition to Mixed Reality Link. Microsoft has worked hard over the years to improve app compatibility for Windows 11 on Arm. Mixed Reality Link is an app that allows you to connect up to three virtual monitors to a supported Meta Quest headset. The app is still in preview and works with the Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S. The app allows you to connect your PCs to your headset wirelessly or through a wired connection and creates a multi-monitor setup that's only visible to you. It's also possible to access a Windows 365 Cloud PC on a Meta Quest headset. Mixed Reality Link was seemingly limited to Intel and AMD-powered PCs until recently. Microsoft's support document for the app still lacks any mention of Snapdragon X PCs, such as the Surface Pro 11. But Reddit user "Nicalay2" was able to connect a Surface Pro powered by a Snapdragon X chip to Mixed Reality Link. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. The Meta Quest 3S is a next-gen VR headset that was designed to be affordable. It features a powerful chipset, comes with next-gen controllers, and supports the best Meta Quest games and apps. One of the main draws of the Meta Quest 3S is its price. Nicholas Sutrich, who leads VR coverage over at Android Central, said "the idea of having a $299 Quest 3 headset seemed preposterous" when discussing the rumored pricing of the Meta Quest 3S. Those rumors turned out to be accurate, and the result was a "triumph", according to Sutrich. The Meta Quest 3S sets the standard for affordable VR, delivering much of the same experiences as its more expensive sibling, the Meta Quest 3. There are some tradeoffs, of course, such as the Meta Quest 3S having a narrower field of view and worse display, but Meta had to trim some features and specs to hit the $299.99 price point. I've reviewed VR headsets and covered the virtual reality space for years, dating back to the awkward days of the Gear VR. I've played the best Meta Quest games, interviewed game developers while battling in virtual reality, and am no stranger to streaming Xbox games through the cloud. The Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition is a special version of the headset with unique coloring and some bundled extras. It comes with a pre-installed Elite Strap ($70 value), an Xbox controller ($65 value), and three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate ($60 value). The Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition is only available for a limited time, but how long that time will be is unclear. Meta sold out of the Xbox Edition of the headset quickly but Best Buy still has stock. Considering the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition is $100 more than the normal Meta Quest 3S, you get quite a bit extra for the extra cash. Sutrich called the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition the "best value in VR," and I agree. Our Executive Editor Jez Corden went hands-on with the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition. Corden said Xbox Cloud Gaming on the Meta Quest 3S is "absolutely awesome" and broke down the partnership that made the device possible. The Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition is an excellent bargain, but if you don't need an Xbox controller or want to grab a headset at a lower price, the standard Meta Quest 3S is available and is also a great option. "The Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition is the best value you'll find in VR today. The Meta Quest 3S is already a value-focused VR headset, but the inclusion of a pre-installed Elite Strap (a $70 value), an Xbox controller (a $65 value), 3 months of Game Pass Ultimate (a $60 value), and 3 months of Horizon+ (a $24 value). That's $119 worth of stuff you're getting for free, plus the fact that there's no other way to get this black-and-green-themed bundle." — Nicholas Sutrich ✅Perfect for: Gamers interested in getting into VR at a more affordable price point that won't mind a little blur and a lower resolution❌Avoid if: You'd prefer paying extra for the Quest 3's sharper image quality, or want the unique design and/or extras included in the Xbox Edition 👉See at Best Buy The Meta Quest 3S is a triumph in every regard. It's an unbelievable bargain at $299, yet it still exhibits the best mixed reality and virtual reality gaming available today. The only real compromises are the lenses and display, which are worse than the Quest 3 but not detrimentally so. — Nicholas SutrichAndroid Central review ⭐⭐⭐⭐ 1/2✅Perfect for: Gamers interested in getting into VR at a more affordable price point that won't mind a little blur and a lower resolution❌Avoid if: You'd prefer paying extra for the Quest 3's sharper image quality, or want the unique design and/or extras included in the Xbox Edition👉See at: Amazon 🔎Price check: $249 at Best Buy (Payment options, no game items) 🤔Alternate deal: Amazon ($394.53, 256GB, Batman: Arkham Shadow) Sean Endicott is a tech journalist at Windows Central, specializing in Windows, Microsoft software, AI, and PCs.

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum showed fresh buying pressure this week after reports that a major Bitcoin whale dramatically increased its Ether holdings, a move market watchers say could reshape short-term flows. According to reports, one of the earliest and most influential Bitcoin whales bought roughly 820,220 ETH over the course of two weeks, a haul valued at about $3.6 billion at current prices. The purchases were logged across multiple addresses and have drawn attention because they represent a large transfer of capital into Ether rather than Bitcoin. Traders say such concentrated accumulation can lift sentiment and draw other large holders into the market. Ethereum’s latest trading performance has mirrored the big move. At the time of reporting, ETH traded around $4,390, with a 24-hour trading volume of $39 billion and a market cap near $538 billion. 🐳 THIS OG BITCOIN WHALE HAS BOUGHT 820,224 ETH WORTH $3.6 BILLION IN JUST 2 WEEKS. HE DEFINITELY KNOWS SOMETHING 👀 pic.twitter.com/iG9Su2BGZE — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) August 31, 2025 The token was up 2% over the previous day. Those raw numbers underline that demand for Ether remains high even as some parts of the market pull back. Derivatives activity tells a more mixed story. Reported data shows derivatives volume fell 14% to $61 billion, while open interest climbed 2.90% to $60 billion. The OI Weighted metric declined -0.0007%, a small drop that indicates a minimal reduction in positioning strength. According to these movements, dealers comment that the market may be consolidating: less new trades but more positions held. Mixing technicals with on-chain data, current forecasts point to moderate upside. Based on the latest prediction, Ether is expected to rise 11% and reach $4,870 by October 1, 2025. Market sentiment is listed as Bullish while the Fear & Greed Index reads 46 (Fear). Over the last 30 days, ETH logged 47% green days and an 9% price volatility reading. Those indicators suggest a market that has room to run, but which still carries meaningful uncertainty. Analysts have offered a cautionary note. According to analyst Ted, ETH’s recent outperformance versus Bitcoin may pause for a brief retest around $4,000 as liquidity clusters are swept and traders reassess exposure. He points to order-book dynamics that often trigger a pullback before new upward moves — a pattern that has played out in prior rallies. $ETH has been holding up really well compared to BTC. But there’s still a chance of $4K retest. Just take a look at huge liquidity clusters and you’ll understand. Just keep one thing in mind: I’m just short-term bearish. pic.twitter.com/D9XIrxr5zq — Ted (@TedPillows) August 31, 2025 Investors and desks say they are watching three things: the flow of large on-chain buys, whether derivatives open interest continues to rise, and whether price holds above key support near $4,000.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Want to avoid burnout? Just hire an 'executive function' coach
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/avoid-burnout-hire-executive-functioning-coach-adhd-white-collar-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-01T08:11:02Z
Full Content:
In 2022, Sage Quiamno was in her early 30s and a few months into a demanding DEI leadership role at Amazon when she hit a wall. Cycles of feeling overwhelmed, procrastination, and frantic catch-up were routinely stretching her already long workdays past the 12-hour mark. Burnout was on the horizon. She knew she needed to make a change, fast. Quiamno found the support she needed from a life coach with unconventional tactics. Unlike many coaches, who guide clients toward overarching personal or professional goals, Quiamno's coach — whom she came to call an "executive function coach" — focused on helping develop skills to better manage her thoughts, actions, and emotions, optimizing her time and energy. Instead of applying an organizational blueprint to her work life, her coach zoomed in on specific pain points like task management and procrastination, helping her build strategies to confront the habits and feelings that were getting in her way. Three years later, Quiamno, who is now 34 and living in Seattle, still meets one-on-one with her coach every other week, in addition to a monthly meeting with a group of other women who are also focused on honing their executive functioning. "This is a long-term investment," Quiamno tells me. Executive function is the blanket term for assorted cognitive skills that help with organization, focus, memory, and self-control. It's the toolkit that lets you plan a multistep project at work and then deliver it on deadline, or navigate conflict with a friend. Harvard researchers have called it the brain's "air traffic control system." Impaired executive function has historically been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD and autism spectrum disorder. That's beginning to change. In the past few years, growing numbers of parents, teachers, and universities have enlisted executive function specialists to help stressed-out students get things done, regardless of whether those students have a psychiatric diagnosis. And now, anxious and overworked professionals are turning to the very same coaches to recoup some semblance of control — and a slew of workplace coaching companies, such as BetterUp and WorkSmart, have taken note and started folding "executive function" into their rhetoric. The trend underscores how, in our age of constant digital distractions, our attention spans and time-management skills just aren't what they used to be. It also points to much larger problems in the way we live and work today. Executive function coaching was virtually synonymous with ADHD when it entered the fore in the mid-2000s. It quickly showed promise. In a 2009 study published in the journal Learning Disabilities Research and Practice, college students with ADHD or impaired learning received one-on-one coaching for 10 weeks, focusing on building perseverance, motivation, impulse control, and other executive functioning challenges. Afterward, the students reported greater autonomy and goal achievement, reduced anxiety, and stronger self-regulation. It wasn't until much more recently that executive function coaching went mainstream. Jesse Ruderman, the executive functioning specialist for the University of Denver's Learning Effectiveness Program, tells me the university hired its first executive function coach in the spring of 2020 to support students who were struggling amid COVID lockdowns. Other higher-ed institutions, such as the University of Minnesota, George Mason University, and Oberlin College, have since implemented similar programs. The pandemic was a turning point for workers, too. J. Russell Ramsay, a clinical psychologist who's a cofounder of the University of Pennsylvania's Adult ADHD Treatment and Research Program, explains that the COVID lockdowns heavily taxed many adults' executive functioning because they removed the "scaffolding" of structured workplace environments that helped designate start and end times. Many people who were previously "struggling but getting by" with undiagnosed ADHD suddenly found themselves unable to cope, Ramsay says. The pandemic also exposed executive functioning vulnerabilities in people who might not meet the diagnostic criteria for ADHD but "have many of the symptoms." Not coincidentally, the pandemic saw a major spike in the number of adults in the US diagnosed with ADHD and being prescribed medications to treat it. A 2024 JAMA study found that between April 2020 and March 2022, nonstimulant ADHD prescriptions jumped by 81% among 20- to 39-year-olds, while Adderall and other stimulants rose by 30%. A separate analysis found that between 2019 and 2023, medical claims for ADHD grew by 101% among 18- to 44-year-olds, 70% among 45- to 64-year-olds, and 60% among adults over 65. The end of lockdown did not, however, make people's struggles go away. Since joining the University of Denver as a coach in 2022, Ruderman reports seeing "significant" year-over-year increases in students seeking his help. He met with 391 unique students in the 2023-24 academic year; last year, that number leaped to 727. He attributes at least some of the jump to the TikTokification of mental health — specifically, a widening pool of content creators who focus on neurodiversity — which has made a lot more people familiar with concepts like executive function. Ruderman says he's had to shorten his appointment time slots to accommodate rising demand. A sudden expansion of executive functioning support for workers suggests the corporate world has seen a similar pattern. Kate Broeking, an executive-functioning-focused workplace coach in Seattle, says that in just the past year, she's noticed more employee assistance programs and coaching companies that explicitly address executive functioning. Some employers, such as Workday, Chevron, and WarnerMedia, are even making these services available to their entire staff as a workplace benefit. Broeking has seen an influx of individual clients in her own coaching practice as well. Why the continued surge in executive dysfunction? The short answer is that modern life is stretching everyone's mental capacity to the brink. The experts I spoke with point to the endless interruptions and cheap dopamine hits of our digital devices as one obvious culprit. Research suggests that the digital world can warp our perception of time, which would logically affect how well we manage it. All the while, the increase in ADHD diagnoses has made more people aware of what executive functioning is in the first place. "The term has become quite prevalent," Ruderman says, noting that people have begun talking about executive dysfunction on TikTok. That prevalence has fed broader self-recognition. "It's really easy to self-diagnose — to identify that one has perhaps some executive dysfunction," he adds. On top of everything else, the pandemic introduced a new age of employment uncertainty that has far from let up. In some key respects, it's only gotten worse. Over the past few years, common wisdom about how to achieve success and security has largely flown out the window. Highly educated domain experts, new MBA holders, and freshly minted Ivy League graduates are among the millions of Americans struggling to land jobs, and the country isn't even in a recession. The tech industry is now in its fourth consecutive year of sweeping layoffs across every level of the corporate hierarchy. Generative AI has destabilized entire white-collar career trajectories, already prompting some employers to reduce head count on the so-far unsubstantiated promise of human-caliber automation. All the while, students and workers face mounting pressure to accomplish more and better with less time and support. "Humans don't like uncertainty," Ramsay says, adding that people with executive functioning challenges tend to like it even less. That's because living with unpredictable focus and feelings can create a lot of self-doubt, which makes external ambiguity even tougher to tolerate. But a heightened sense of uncertainty can also inhibit executive function, even in those who otherwise thrive under pressure. In an era when an ever-increasing slew of distractors constantly threaten executive functioning in work and school — not to mention side hustles, extracurriculars, caregiving duties, and the basics of being human — this vicious cycle can be catastrophic for people's well-being. For employers, poor executive functioning can also be expensive. Chronic stress and feeling overwhelmed are known risk factors for burnout, which drives up sick leave and lowers engagement in workers. New research in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine found that the fallout adds up to $4,000 to $21,000 per employee each year — a $5 million annual price tag for the average 1,000-employee company in the US. And employee leaves of absence appear to have been on the rise. In a 2024 survey by AbsenceSoft, a leave-of-absence software provider, 57% of HR managers reported increased employee leave requests over the past year — the third year in a row that the majority reported an increase. While most workers cited illness or injury as the reason for their absence, nearly half named mental health challenges. Perhaps relatedly, a May 2025 analysis of Glassdoor postings found that employee discussions of burnout were at their highest since 2016, showing a 32% increase from last year. Many workers seem to be hanging on by a thread. Although anyone can fall prey to burnout, research suggests workers with ADHD, autism, and other neurodevelopmental disorders may be especially susceptible. Some companies made strides to bridge these gaps in the years leading up to the pandemic, designing targeted well-being programs that could function as reasonable accommodations for employees with relevant ADA-qualifying diagnoses. Broeking, the work coach in Seattle, led the charge in building Amazon's work wellness coaching program in 2018 before going on to help Microsoft and Google establish similar coaching programs of their own. These interventions were modeled on vocational rehabilitation programs — services designed to help workers with disabilities find and keep jobs — and focused largely on executive function skill-building to boost worker engagement and prevent medical leaves of absence. In larger companies, Broeking worked with as many as 300 employees a year. Workplace wellness initiatives, however, aren't a silver bullet. A 2024 article in Harvard Business Review pointed out that while nearly 85% of major US employers offered wellness programs, worker burnout showed no sign of slowing down. Among other reasons, the authors suggest that well-being programs fall short by focusing on individual outcomes instead of the organizational causes often at the root of employees' distress. Workers want work-life balance and flexibility, clear goals, and consistent metrics for charting progress; research shows that organizations see improved employee health and output when they implement structural changes that better support those needs. Although personalized executive functioning guidance isn't a cure-all, workers still stand to benefit from it. "It doesn't take too much to knock us off track, and executive functioning means knowing how to shield yourself from distractions," Ramsay says. He's writing a book in which he recommends that employers provide executive functioning support for all staff, which he argues would be an asset to everyone — not only those with official diagnoses. Coaching may prove especially handy for navigating the tides of change and uncertainty that now define many workers' reality. When Amazon rolled back DEI programming early this year, Quiamno — the former DEI leader and coaching client — found herself back at the drawing board for her professional road map. She knew she couldn't rely on an employer to steward her career development; she would have to do it herself. Quiamno, who now runs her own consulting business for women-led startups, credits coaching for helping her build the confidence to move forward. "With a one-on-one coach who knows your strengths and your blind spots, there's always something new to learn," she says. "It's an accountability mechanism — a commitment to myself and my growth as a leader." Kelli María Korducki is a journalist whose work focuses on work, tech, and culture.

LATEST BLOG WhatsApp Chatbot Demo Video Updated On Aug 22, 2025 19 min to read Managing Instagram can feel endless. You create posts, reply to messages, engage with comments, and track results. Doing all this daily takes time that many small businesses and creators don’t have. This is where instagram marketing automation helps. It takes care of repetitive work like scheduling posts or replying to simple questions. That means more time to focus on creative ideas and building real connections with your audience. When you automate instagram marketing, you keep a consistent presence without burning out. It also helps you reach more people at the right time. Done right, automation becomes an assistant that works in the background while you focus on growth. In this guide, we’ll go through 10 practical strategies to get started. But first, it’s important to understand what automation means in the Instagram context. Instagram marketing automation means using tools to handle daily marketing tasks on Instagram without doing everything manually. This could be scheduling posts, sending auto-replies to DMs, or pulling regular analytics reports. Think of a small clothing brand owner. She spends hours posting photos, answering “Is this available in medium?” in DMs, and checking likes. With marketing automation instagram tools, her posts go live automatically at the best time, DMs get instant replies with product details, and a weekly report arrives in her inbox. She gains back hours each week while her customers still feel attended to. Automation does not replace creativity. It helps with consistency and scale. Your ideas still matter, but you no longer need to be online 24/7 to keep the account active. Understanding this foundation is important before diving into strategies. Next, we’ll see why relying only on manual Instagram work can hold you back and why automation is becoming necessary for growth. Managing Instagram by hand seems fine in the beginning. You post when you can, reply when you find time, and check results whenever possible. But as your account grows, this approach falls short. Consistency drops, replies slow down, and your audience starts losing interest. This is where automation makes the difference. Posting on time is one of the hardest parts of running Instagram. Missing the best time to post means fewer people see your content. With marketing automation instagram, posts can be scheduled for when your audience is most active. Example: A small fitness coach schedules morning workout tips to post at 7 a.m. daily. While she trains clients, her content still goes live right when her audience expects it. Followers expect quick replies to their questions. Long delays often mean lost interest or missed sales. Automation helps by sending instant DMs or auto-replies to common queries. Example: An online clothing store sets up automated instagram marketing to reply instantly with size guides and delivery timelines. Customers feel cared for, even outside business hours. Tracking results manually takes time and often gets skipped. Automation delivers reports directly, showing what’s working and what isn’t. Example: A local café receives weekly performance summaries in their inbox. They see which posts bring more walk-ins and adjust their promotions accordingly. Running sales or events on Instagram requires constant reminders. Automation ensures campaigns stay on track without daily manual follow-ups. Example: A beauty brand schedules promotional posts and reminders for a holiday discount week. Even if the team gets busy, the campaign runs smoothly online. Manual work limits how much you can grow. Automation makes that growth sustainable. It gives businesses the freedom to focus on creativity and customer experience while routine tasks run in the background. Next, we’ll look at 10 clear strategies to automate instagram marketing and apply these benefits step by step. Automation becomes powerful only when applied in the right ways. Instead of trying to do everything by hand, you can focus on the work that needs creativity and let automation take care of the rest. These strategies show how to automate instagram marketing step by step without losing authenticity. Posting on Instagram looks simple, but keeping it consistent is where most accounts struggle. Missing the right time or skipping days makes your content invisible to many followers. Consistency is the difference between slow growth and steady engagement. A fitness coach plans her content every Sunday. She creates seven posts, schedules them for 7 a.m. when her audience is most active, and spends the week training clients. Her Instagram stays active, and she doesn’t lose hours creating posts daily. By scheduling in advance, you make Instagram work for you, not the other way around. It builds a rhythm your audience can rely on while giving you freedom to focus on other parts of your work. Next, we’ll cover how to automate instagram marketing for Stories and Reels to stay visible daily without spending hours online. Stories and Reels drive more reach than regular posts. They keep you at the top of the feed and capture attention fast. The challenge is consistency. Posting them daily takes time, and skipping days hurts visibility. Automation solves this by keeping your Stories and Reels active without demanding constant effort. A bakery films behind-the-scenes clips of bread-making over one morning. Instead of posting them randomly, they schedule each clip as daily Stories across the week. At the same time, they queue Reels showing recipes and customer reviews. The account stays fresh and visible every day, even while the team is busy serving customers. Automating Stories and Reels keeps your brand in constant view. With a planned flow of content, you don’t lose reach on busy days, and your audience sees you as active and reliable. Next, we’ll move to direct engagement. Strategy 3 explains how to use automated instagram marketing for DMs so every follower gets a timely response. Direct messages are where followers often turn into customers. People ask about prices, availability, or services. Quick replies keep them engaged, while delays can cause missed opportunities. Handling every message manually takes time, especially as your account grows. This is where automated instagram marketing helps. An online clothing store gets dozens of DMs daily asking for sizes and shipping details. With automation, customers instantly receive answers with a link to the store’s FAQ page. The store owner only steps in for custom inquiries. This saves hours while keeping customers satisfied. By using automated DM replies, you stay responsive without being tied to your phone all day. Followers feel valued, and you spend more time on meaningful conversations instead of repeating the same answers. Comments are where conversations begin publicly. They boost visibility, encourage more followers to join in, and make your brand feel approachable. Yet, replying to every single comment manually can be overwhelming. That’s where you can automate your instagram marketing with comment automation. A coffee shop runs a post about a new drink. Many users comment “Looks amazing!” Instead of leaving them unanswered, automation replies with “Thanks ☕! Drop by this week and try it.” This boosts foot traffic and makes followers feel acknowledged. By using comment automation, you strike a balance between staying responsive and saving manual effort. Followers see that you’re active, and your posts stay buzzing with interaction, which the Instagram algorithm loves. Next, we’ll dive into a strategy to help your posts reach a wider audience without extra work. Hashtags act like signboards that direct people to your posts. They increase visibility, help you reach a wider audience, and bring new followers who are interested in your niche. The challenge? Finding the right hashtags daily can take up a lot of time. That’s why you should automate instagram marketing with hashtag research tools. Imagine a fitness coach posting daily workout clips. Instead of spending 30 minutes looking for hashtags like #fitnesstips or #homeworkout, automation suggests trending hashtags such as #fitin15 or #morningburn. This keeps content relevant, helps new audiences find it, and frees up time for creating videos. By automating hashtag research, you simplify discovery while boosting reach. It’s a small step that creates consistent growth without the stress of constant manual effort. Next, we’ll move on to a strategy where you keep your profile fresh without being online 24/7. Tracking numbers is not glamorous, but it’s what tells you whether your Instagram marketing is working or not. Manually checking likes, comments, shares, and reach takes a lot of time and often leaves you with scattered data. By using marketing automation Instagram tools, you can generate analytics reports automatically and focus on making smarter decisions. Suppose a fashion brand runs an influencer campaign. Instead of manually checking every post’s performance, they set up automated analytics. Each week, a report highlights which influencer posts drive the most clicks and sales. This allows them to double down on what’s working and save budget on what’s not. When you automate Instagram analytics, you make faster, data-driven decisions. It transforms your strategy from “post and pray” into a measurable system that shows real ROI. When you’re running a sale, product launch, or event, timing is everything. Many businesses lose potential customers simply because people forget the deadline or miss the offer announcement. With automated Instagram marketing, you can set up reminders that notify your audience about campaigns without having to send them manually every time. Imagine a skincare brand launching a new product line. They schedule automated Instagram stories leading up to the launch, paired with DMs reminding interested followers about early-bird discounts. As a result, sales spike on day one without the marketing team scrambling to post updates manually. When you automate your Instagram marketing with reminders, you don’t just boost visibility—you actively move people from interest to purchase at the right moment. Suggested Reading: How to Add Shop Button on Instagram (A Step-by-Step Guide) One of the most underrated benefits of Instagram marketing automation is the ability to automatically tag users based on their behavior. Manually sorting followers into categories like “hot leads,” “engaged fans,” or “casual followers” takes too much time. With auto-tagging, every comment, DM, or interaction can be tracked and organized for smarter campaigns. Suppose you run a fitness brand. Automation tags users who comment “Join” under your workout challenge post. These tagged leads then receive tailored DMs with challenge details, while casual followers continue seeing regular fitness tips. This way, you’re not spamming everyone, only nurturing those ready to act. By using Instagram marketing automation for tagging, your campaigns become sharper and more personal. Instead of treating all followers the same, you engage each group with what they care about most. Running Instagram ads is powerful, but it can easily burn through budgets if not monitored carefully. This is where marketing automation on Instagram steps in. By automating ad rules, budget allocation, and audience targeting, you ensure every dollar works harder without needing to babysit campaigns all day. Let’s say you run an eCommerce store. You create three ad sets for your new product launch. Instead of manually tracking each one, you set automation rules: any ad with more than 5% click-through rate gets more budget, while low-performing ads pause automatically. The system optimizes spend in real-time, ensuring you only pay for results. With marketing automation Instagram, you don’t just run ads—you run them smarter. Automation keeps campaigns lean, efficient, and consistently optimized for the highest ROI. Instagram automation doesn’t have to live in isolation. When you automate your Instagram marketing by connecting it with other business tools like CRM, email platforms, and chatbots, you create a complete ecosystem where data flows seamlessly. This means no lead slips through the cracks, and every interaction becomes part of a bigger, smarter workflow. Suppose you’re a fitness coach. A user comments on your Instagram post asking about your online training. Automation pushes their details into your CRM, sends them an automated email with a free consultation offer, and opens a chatbot conversation in Instagram DMs. Without lifting a finger, you’ve nurtured a lead across three channels. When you connect Instagram automation with other tools, you move from platform-specific automation to full workflow automation. This is where businesses truly scale, creating a synchronized system that saves time while increasing conversions. Instagram marketing automation helps you save time, stay consistent, and reach more people. Start small, add one strategy at a time, and grow with ease.” Automation can make Instagram manageable, but it should never replace the human side of your brand. Overuse can make your account feel robotic. Misusing tools can even risk account restrictions. The goal is to let automation handle repetitive tasks while you focus on creativity and connection. Here are the best practices to follow: People connect with brands that feel genuine. Automation is great for timing and consistency, but the content itself needs to reflect your voice. If every post feels automated, followers quickly lose interest. Automating everything may look efficient, but it creates distance between you and your audience. Relationships are built on real conversations, not canned responses. If every message sounds identical, people will feel they are talking to a bot. Instagram has strict rules around automation. Tools that violate these rules can lead to reduced reach or account suspension. Many third-party services promise instant followers or likes, but they often break guidelines. Automation keeps your account running, but personal involvement builds community. Followers notice when you reply directly, join their conversations, or acknowledge their support. That kind of interaction cannot be automated. When used carefully, automated instagram marketing acts like an assistant, not a replacement. It keeps your account consistent and efficient while you invest energy in creativity and relationships. This balance helps you scale safely, without losing authenticity or breaking rules. After learning about different ways to use automation, the next step is starting with a plan. Many businesses jump into tools without setting clear goals, and they end up with messy campaigns. To avoid this, you need a structured approach. Think of it like launching a new store: first, you decide what success means, then you pick the right tools, and finally, you expand as your business grows. The same applies to Instagram marketing automation. Define what you want from automation. Are you aiming for better engagement, higher sales, or stronger brand awareness? For example, a clothing brand may want to automate Instagram marketing to reply faster to DMs about stock availability. A coaching business may want scheduled posts to stay consistent. Writing these goals down will guide every step that follows. The tool you pick should fit your goals. Look for features like post scheduling, auto-replies to DMs, and performance analytics. This is where beginners often struggle—using one tool for posting and another for replies creates confusion. An all-in-one option like BotPenguin makes things simple. It handles automated DMs, detailed analytics, and even multi-channel marketing from one dashboard. For a startup or small business, this means fewer tools, less cost, and faster results. Begin with a single feature like post scheduling. Once you’re comfortable, add automated replies, then move to advanced features like lead tagging and campaign reminders. For instance, a local café could start by scheduling daily posts. Later, they can set up automated DMs to answer questions about timings or menu. With BotPenguin, you can scale like this without switching platforms, so the tool grows with your needs. Starting with automated Instagram marketing doesn’t have to be overwhelming. When you set clear goals, pick a beginner-friendly tool like BotPenguin, and expand step by step, automation becomes a natural part of your marketing. This foundation prepares you for long-term growth while keeping your campaigns organized. Instagram marketing gets easier when you have the right automation tool. BotPenguin helps you do more than send messages—it gives you full control over how you engage with followers. Whenever someone texts you, BotPenguin can send a welcome message, FAQs, or resource links automatically. This ensures no DM goes unanswered. Set keywords like “price” or “demo” and let BotPenguin send the right reply instantly. This saves time and improves conversions. Turn post comments into leads. If someone comments “interested”, BotPenguin can instantly send them a DM with more details. Reply to every comment—publicly or privately. Example: “How much is this?” → BotPenguin replies “We’ve sent you the pricing details in your inbox.” Automatically tag followers based on actions (DMs, keywords, comments). This helps you build smarter campaigns for warm leads vs. cold followers. See which replies, DMs, or campaigns are getting the most engagement. BotPenguin generates easy-to-read reports so you can measure ROI. Connect BotPenguin with your CRM, email, or other tools to create full customer workflows, not just Instagram replies. With BotPenguin, your Instagram account can reply, engage, and convert automatically while you focus on running the business.

Each tactic saves time, organizes campaigns, and creates more space for creativity and human connection. But remember, success doesn’t come from automation alone. Real growth happens when automated Instagram marketing supports your effort, not replaces it. Automated tools keep your brand consistent and responsive, while you bring the strategy, vision, and human touch that turns followers into loyal customers. If you’re ready to get started, choose a platform that makes automation easy without overwhelming you. Tools like BotPenguin give you everything in one place—smart replies, scheduling, analytics, and integrations—so you can focus on building connections while automation handles the rest. 🚀 Start small, grow step by step, and let automation be your marketing partner. Your Instagram can scale faster than you imagine when humans and automation work together. It allows small teams to keep their Instagram active without constant manual effort. Automation tools handle scheduling, replies, and tracking so owners can focus on serving customers. Yes. You can pre-plan posts, create automated DM flows, and set rules for ads. This makes seasonal offers or festival campaigns run smoothly, even if your team is busy. It is safe if you use trusted tools that follow Instagram’s policies. Look for platforms that provide human-like automation, avoid spamming, and work within Instagram’s limits. By setting up automated replies for FAQs, order updates, or lead capture. Customers get instant answers, while complex queries are smoothly handed over to humans. Brands can send interactive polls, drip campaigns via DMs, and create automated reminders for product drops or live events. This keeps followers engaged in unique ways.

Title: A former Microsoft worker has been job-hunting for 9 months. He says it feels like companies are 'looking for Superman.'
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/former-microsoft-worker-job-hunt-money-struggles-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-01T07:46:02Z
Full Content:
Before he was fired last December, Mody Khan was earning a six-figure salary as a cloud solution architect at Microsoft. Nine months into his job search, he's at risk of losing his home. "I had savings, and I've depleted almost all of it," said Khan, who is in his 50s and lives in Texas. "I'm in a very tight spot." A new job could stabilize his finances — but despite a five-year run at Microsoft and his prior experience in the tech industry, even landing interviews has been challenging. "It feels like recruiters are looking for Superman," he said. Khan is among the thousands of Microsoft employees who've lost their jobs over the past year. In recent years, Big Tech firms — including Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon — have revamped their performance review and compensation systems to better reward top performers and weed out underperformers in pursuit of smaller, higher-performing teams. Then there are the layoffs. After cutting about 6,000 jobs in May, Microsoft laid off roughly 9,000 more in July. A Microsoft spokesperson previously told Business Insider that the company was focused on reducing management layers and streamlining processes. The cuts have also affected many individual contributor roles. Microsoft isn't alone. Google, Intel, Amazon, and Walmart are among the companies that have also announced plans to reduce the number of managers in a trend dubbed the "Great Flattening." While layoffs across the US economy remain low by historical standards, tech workers have been hit particularly hard. Since the beginning of this year, global tech companies have laid off more than 80,000 workers, according to data from the online tracker Layoffs.fyi. These cuts have come amid a white-collar hiring slowdown. "I've been constantly applying, and I've had interviews, but I've been turned down everywhere," Khan said. Business Insider has heard from dozens of tech workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers. If you have a story to share about struggling to find work, contact this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com, at Signal at jzinkula.29, or fill out this quick form. Use a personal email address, a nonwork WiFi network, and a nonwork device; here’s our guide to sharing information securely. Read more on the topic: Khan said that after immigrating to the US from Pakistan in 2007, he struggled to find high-paying work during the 2008 recession. But over time, his job prospects improved — and he held various tech roles before joining Microsoft in July 2019 as a contract support engineer. He became a full-time employee in May 2020, working as a support escalation engineer. In December 2021, he was promoted to cloud solution architect — a fully remote role he held until his termination in December 2024. Khan's final years at the company were very difficult. He said multiple managers raised concerns about his performance over the years and eventually warned him that his job was in jeopardy. While he made efforts to improve, he said that it didn't seem to make a difference — and that he believes his managers didn't give him the support he needed to succeed. He said he often lacked clear guidance on expectations and would have benefited from more constructive feedback and coaching. At times, he said, it felt like his managers were more focused on "building a case" against him than helping him improve. At one point, he told his wife that if he ever won even a small lottery jackpot, he'd walk away. The pressure had become too much. "I hated going from the bedroom to my home office," he said. "I was under so much stress." Last December, Khan learned he was being fired for performance reasons and wouldn't be receiving severance pay. He was told he could still apply for other roles at Microsoft — and said he later applied to as many as 30 internal positions — but never received an offer. Khan said he sold some of his Microsoft stock holdings but now has only about $10,000 in "survival money" left in his bank account — enough to last him and his wife about two more months. If that runs out, they'd be forced to tap into his remaining investments or 401(k). To make matters worse, they fell behind on their mortgage payments — and if they can't resume payments once their forbearance plan ends in November, they could face foreclosure. The financial toll has also caused his credit score to drop from the high 600s into the 500s in just a few months. Since expanding his search outside Microsoft, Khan has managed to land some interviews, he said, but no matter how well they seem to go, none have led to offers. "I've had so many good interviews where I'm ready for them to say, 'Mody, let's rock 'n' roll' — and then they don't move forward," he said. He added that it's particularly frustrating when seemingly promising conversations with recruiters don't end in a clear rejection — but in silence, leaving him unsure whether he was ever truly considered. "Recruiters contact me, take my résumé, and they ghost me," he said. Khan believes a few factors may be hindering his job search. He's concerned that some employers assume, because of his age, that he's not up to date on the latest technologies. He said that to push back on that perception, he completed an AI certification through the University of Texas. He added that many of his interviewers appeared to be looking for candidates with startup backgrounds, which made him feel like his experience at a tech giant was almost a strike against him. Additionally, he said he believes his Pakistani background has, at times, been an obstacle. He believes some Indian recruiters or interviewers may carry biases that surface during the hiring process, particularly given long-standing regional and political tensions between India and Pakistan. Khan said he continues to apply to roles every week, hoping that one will finally come through. But with the financial pressure mounting and his savings running low, he said the stakes are getting higher. "It's a very, very dangerous situation," he said. Jump to

The partnership, announced on August 29, will see RIL and Meta jointly invest ₹855 crore in a 70:30 ratio to develop Llama-based enterprise AI platforms. | Photo Credit: - Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) shares traded lower by 0.43 per cent at ₹1,351.30 on Monday morning at 11.30 am, despite announcing a joint venture with Meta to develop enterprise AI solutions for India. The stock opened at ₹1,356 and hit a day’s high of ₹1,357 before declining to ₹1,340.60. The partnership, announced on August 29, will see RIL and Meta jointly invest ₹855 crore ($100 million) in a 70:30 ratio to develop Llama-based enterprise AI platforms. The joint venture will offer AI Platform-as-a-Service and pre-configured solutions targeting Indian enterprises and SMBs, with the transaction expected to close in Q4 2025. Brokerage firms maintained positive ratings on RIL following recent AGM announcements. JPMorgan retained its Overweight rating with a target price of ₹1,695, while Kotak maintained Add with ₹1,555 target. Jefferies and HSBC kept Buy ratings at ₹1,670 and ₹1,630 respectively. Nuvama maintained Buy with the highest target of ₹1,733. According to Santosh Meena of Swastika Investmart, the stock decline reflects investor disappointment with the Jio IPO timeline being pushed to H1 2026, later than expected 2025 listing. He noted RIL’s historical pattern of post-AGM declines despite significant announcements. Key AGM highlights included the definitive Jio IPO timeline, launch of Reliance Intelligence subsidiary, and ambitious retail growth targets of 20 per cent CAGR over three years. The company reiterated plans to double EBITDA between FY2022-FY2027 and achieve ₹1 lakh crore FMCG revenue within five years. Analysts remain optimistic about RIL’s long-term prospects, citing its diversified business model and strategic investments in AI and new energy. The company’s New Energy business is expected to potentially match the scale of its O2C operations. Trading volume stood at 45.04 lakh shares worth ₹608.59 crore, with 59.48 per cent deliverable quantity indicating sustained investor interest despite the price decline.

Mukesh Ambani is gearing up for Jio's mega IPO — tipped as the "mother of all IPOs" – but Reliance Industries' 44 lakh shareholders may be sidelined. Unlike the Jio Financial Services spin-off, this listing won't give them direct shares. Instead, they'll benefit indirectly via RIL’s 66.3% stake, which may face a holding company discount from investors seeking direct exposure.

Title: ROSEN, GLOBAL INVESTOR COUNSEL, Encourages Novo Nordisk A/S Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action - NVO
URL: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/09/01/3141946/673/en/ROSEN-GLOBAL-INVESTOR-COUNSEL-Encourages-Novo-Nordisk-A-S-Investors-to-Secure-Counsel-Before-Important-Deadline-in-Securities-Class-Action-NVO.html
Time Published: 2025-09-01T02:30:00Z
Full Content:
August 31, 2025 22:30 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Aug. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: The crash of 2026: a fiction
URL: https://crookedtimber.org/2025/08/31/the-crash-of-2026-a-fiction/
Time Published: 2025-08-31T21:39:55Z
Full Content:
by John Q on August 31, 2025 Looking at the facts, there’s no reasonable conclusion except that US democracy is done for. But rather than face facts, I’m turning to fiction. So, here’s a story about the collapse of Trumpism, crony capitalism and the AI/crypto bubble. Fiction is a relatively unfamilar mode of writing for me, so critique (on style and structure rather than plausibility) is most welcome. The crash of 2026 began with a literal crash. A Tesla robotaxi operating on an open highway for the first time, inexplicably swerved into the path of oncoming traffic. Coming in the other direction was a Cybertruck whose driver, relying on self-driving capabilities, was busy checking his investments on the phone. His instant death spared him from the knowledge of his impending bankruptcy. Tragically, a school bus was following, and its brakes failed (the school district later blamed budget cuts for inadequate maintenance) The driver did her best to steer around the wreckage but the bus overturned and burst into flames. By the time the smoke cleared, there were six deaths, including the busdriver and two children, as well as the occupants of both Teslas. More then 30 schoolchildren were taken to hospital. The images of death and disaster ran on TV and social media for weeks. The reaction was swift. By the end of the day, Tesla’s robotaxis had been taken off the road throughout the US, and demands for retribution were everywhere. Several Tesla dealerships were torched and others closed down. The situation wasn’t helped by a bizarre tweet from Elon Musk, appearing to suggest that the bus driver was a “crisis actor”. By the time Wall Street opened the next day, the financial analysts had done their sums. The legal liability for the disaster would run into billions, enough to wipe out most of Tesla’s cash reserves. And with the robotaxi business gone, there was nothing to conceal the truth of Tesla’s situation: a company with declining sales and margins trading at more than 100 times its current earnings. With the prospect of massive short sales at the opening bell, trading in Tesla shares was suspended. This was bad news for Musk, who faced margin calls and the loss of his holdings in X and SpaceX, both secured by his ownership of 16 per cent of Tesla. But as usual in such cases, he got off easily. Musk turned up soon afterwards on a Caribbean island he had bought through a shell company years previously, along with the government of the nation that supposedly ruled it. No longer the richest man in the world, and theoretically bankrupt, he nonetheless enjoyed the comforts of a mansion and a super-yacht, each with its fleet of servants. The situation was rather different for the owners of the other 84 per cent of Tesla, who collectively faced the loss of nearly a trillion dollars. Those with diversified holdings and no debt took the loss philosophically, as an offset against the massive profits of recent years. But others, who had borrowed to buy both Tesla and crypto assets like Bitcoin, faced disaster, especially when rumors spread that Tesla was about to dump its own massive Bitcoin holding. The price of Bitcoin fell 25 per cent overnight. Longstanding HODLers were not concerned, reminding themselves that Bitcoin had fallen many times before, and had always rebounded. But now that crypto-currencies were embedded into the financial system, there were plenty of players with a shorter-term perspective. They started talking to economists, who almost universally agreed that crypto-currencies were inherently worthless. Traders who had gone all in on crypto suddenly saw the merits of profit taking. Regulators, who had been quiet since the passage of the GENIUS Act, started asking questions. The real disaster came with the exposure of large-scale fraud at Tether, the most prominent of the stablecoins, which were supposed to trade at exactly $1 US. As the volume of investors seeking to quit crypto increased, it emerged that the supposedly ironclad asset backing of Tether had been undermined by a complex web of derivative transactions, allegedly the doing of a “rogue trader”. Once Tether “broke the buck” the run was on in earnest. Wall Street banks found that that they had significant direct exposure to crypto and even more through their counterparties. They went into lockdown, calling in whatever debts they could. The realisation that the multi-trillion dollar valuations of Tesla and Bitcoin had been spun out of thin air led to a harder look at Wall Street’s “Magnificent Seven” now reduced to six. Claims that AI was about to generate massive wealth if only more billions were invested looked silly. Investment in data centers stopped abruptly. Nvidia was the first casualty. Once orders for chips from the hyperscalers dried up, its business was over. The advertising businesses of Google and Meta, and the Amazon retail business, went next. There would be no growth in sales of consumer goods for some time to come. Microsoft and Apple, with real businesses and products, fared better, but their values, based on hyperbolic price-earnings ratios, fell drastically. Crowds of ruined investors, milling in the streets, became violent, and were suppressed by heavily armed and masked thugs, presumed to be ICE, with several deaths. Increasingly violent protests and even more violent suppression followed. At this point, a global financial crisis similar to that of 2008 was now inevitable. There were loud calls for an internationally co-ordinated response. But such co-ordination, already inadequate in 2008, was non-existent this time. Fed Chair Kevin Hassett, appointed by Trump after the removal of Jerome Powell, couldn’t even get his global counterparts to pick up the phone. With less direct exposure to the crisis, other countries sought to protect themselves, imposing exchange controls, and preventing repatriation of funds to the US. Crypto trading was banned in many jurisdictions, and holders of crypto were required to report their positions to regulators. Taken collectively, these disasters threatened to wipe out the entire wealth of the Trump family. Naturally, Trump struck back, announcing the discovery that trillions of dollars in US foreign debt was fraudulent, and would be expropriated. The remaining US public debt, following the plans previously announced by Stephen Miran (chair of Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers) would be forcibly converted into 100 year bonds, at rates to be set by the US. The EU and Canada reacted by freezing US-owned assets. Trading on major stock exchanges around the world was suspended. At this point, global capitalism seemed doomed, along with democracy. But somehow things turned around. With their donors facing ruin, dozens of Republican Representatives and Senators switched sides, throwing control of Congress to the Democrats, who immediately announced impeachment proceedings against Trump. Trump called on JD Vance to expel the traitors from the Senate, but, sensing the ground shifting, Vance temporised. Trump attempted to declare martial law, but was forestalled by Vance and the Cabinet, who invoked the 25th Amendment to remove him. At Trump’s urging, a MAGA mob, including dozens of the masked gunmen now ubiquitous on American streets, marched on the Capitol, planning a repeat of 2020. But this time they were met by the army, with fixed bayonets and machine-gun emplacements. After a brief exchange of fire, the crowd fled, leaving dozens of dead and wounded behind. The Vance Administration lasted only a few days. After seeking assurances that he would not face prosecution, Vance resigned in favor of Jerome Powell, who had been hastily appointed as Vice-President and was seen as the technocrat most likely to restore faith in the US, The fallout was rapid. Facing impeachment and likely criminal charges of corruption, Supreme Court justices Thomas and Alito resigned, while Gorsuch and Kavanaugh decided that their appointments had been improper all along. The five remaining members of the court unanimously overturned the previous finding of Trump’s presidential immunity, and discovered that participation in the January 6 insurrection was in fact treasonous. Facing this catastrophic defeat, MAGA fragmented. A minority of Trump’s supporters genuinely repented of the disaster they had brought on their country and became zealous defenders of democracy. Another group pointed to the feeble statements they had made criticising Trump and tried, with varying degrees of success, to maintain a role in public life. Some of the MAGA base gave up on politics altogether, suddenly discovering that Trump was just as corrupt as the Democrats he had railed against. Others remained loyal to their fallen leader. Republican state governments collapsed as the party fragmented. Trump’s trial proceeded rapidly this time, and he was sentenced to spend his remaining days in prison, along with many of his cronies. There were some scattered insurrections which were rapidly put down, with their participants held in the various detention centres conveniently created by Trump. Now, in early 2028, the world economy is gradually climbing out of the pit created by the crisis. The financial sector, a shadow of its former self, remains largely nationalised, and the disastrous losses in the crypto sector have yet to be resolved. But AI technologies, now in the public domain after the collapse of the hyperscalars. have started deliver significant (though not stratospheric) productivity benefits. Continued declines in the cost of solar power and battery storage have dispelled concerns about shortages of electricity, and have supported new investments in rewiring the economy in the US and other countries. The reconstruction of the US political system will take much longer. President Powell, virtually assured of re-election, has proposed a constitutional convention that would replace the failed two-party system. The first step, already implemented in most states, has been a shift to instant runoff voting in Congressional elections, along with the scrapping of the primary system. But a shift to full-scale proportional representation is expected, with the former Republican party splintering, and socialists gaining significant support in cities and even some rural areas. There is, as Adam Smith observed, a great deal of ruin in a nation. It will take decades for Americans to repair all the damage done by their experiment with fascism. But America has huge resources, both human and natural, and (at least in this fictional account) the traditions of democracy are finally reasserting themselves. { 59 comments… read them below or add one } Alex SL 08.31.25 at 10:55 pm That is a very nice narrative, and it is obvious that a large financial crash is coming. If it is frightening enough to Republicans, it may well end Trump’s administration. Unfortunately, it is otherwise all too optimistic. Among the fundamental constants of the last few decades that have got the USA into this mess are: First, there are never any consequences for powerful and rich people. The only way to see consequences for a powerful and rich person is if they first lose their wealth; that is why Sam Bankman-Fried, Elizabeth Holmes, and Bernie Madoff ended up in prison but Adam Neumann, Elon Musk, and Donald Trump never did, because the former lost their wealth, and the latter did not. God forbid that a billionaire or, for that matter, a former president ever sees repercussions like the little people for breaking laws or doing a war crime. No matter how bad an economic crash, the people who caused it will not feel any consequences. This culture of shielding the powerful and rich at all costs also means that no, the supreme court justices will not resign. That idea is unthinkable to them, as it is to the vast majority of Americans. There is no solution to this problem except a deep cultural change where the American public at large sees billionaires, elected officials, and judges as deserving more accountability than a weed dealer or a shoplifter, because, as the comic book hero goes, with great power comes great responsibility. And I don’t see that happening overnight. Second, MAGA is a cult, and it is not going away even if Trump dies tomorrow or is removed from office next year. They will be back in 2028 or 2030 or 2032 or 2032, and their mission will still be to abolish democracy, to destroy science, to remove minorities from any position of status and responsibility, and to conduct ethnic cleansing. There is no solution to this problem except to purge the Republican party of MAGA, and to make the entire right-wing media ecosystem illegal, and to completely overhaul the US education system, including making home schooling illegal. None of that is going to happen in my lifetime. So, within a few years the goldfish-like memories of the voters will just bring MAGA back under a different name and with a different leader. Third, the Democrats are utterly useless. Even if brought back into power (and it would have to be them, as president Powell is much less likely than president Vance putting Powell back into the Fed to restore faith), they will not implement the reforms outlined in the second-to-last paragraph. They are in their happy place fund-raising and handing that money over to consultants who tell them to go further to the right and seek bipartisan solutions on ethnic cleansing oh sorry immigration. There is no solution to this problem except to purge the Democratic party of centrists, and given the realities of primaries, the byzantine campaign donation systems, and the hilariously undemocratic intra-party governance of the USA, that isn’t ever going to happen. I would love for a better outcome, but realistically, the choice is between (1) fascism and (2) a few years of hapless centrists not solving any of the structural issues that lead to fascism, followed by fascism. Cheryl Rofer 08.31.25 at 11:19 pm This is very good. Thank you, John! John Hamilton Farr 08.31.25 at 11:59 pm Damn that’s good… John Q 09.01.25 at 12:14 am @Alex You’ll notice that all the leading figures except Trump (along with unnamed cronies) get off scot-free. It’s fiction, not fantasy. Seekonk 09.01.25 at 12:29 am Brilliant! Rich 09.01.25 at 1:14 am Too optimistic! Where is the dystopia? Where are the zombies? John Q 09.01.25 at 2:14 am Rich @6 There’s not much point in fiction about a dystopia when you’re already in one. And there’s loads of financial zombies, not to mention Zombie Economics Cheez Whiz 09.01.25 at 3:46 am Well thought out and well done, Mr. Quiggan. I raised an eyebrow over the collapse of crypto, but its likely once money guys get scared enough to look. I raised the other eyebrow at the popping of the AI bubble, but again, a good scare might do it. But when the Republicans went along with Vance giving up the White House, I was out of eyebrows. Republicans willingly surrendering Trump is entirely believeable in this scenario, but giving up power by giving up Vance? This is not our Republican party. The screams from Fox and the Freedom Caucus would deafen the world, and this would be the moment Vance and Theil have been planning for years. Vance might be forced out by a Democratic party that grew a continental-sized spine, but it would be a bloody fight. Dan Strong 09.01.25 at 6:44 am I’m with Alex SL on this one – I enjoyed the story, but it did strike me as hopelessly rosy-eyed. It’s hard to swallow the suggestion that there are, in fact, limits to what the Republican party would tolerate from Trump. Not to mention the idea that the sclerotic Democratics would be able or willing to effectively exploit a political crisis of the right. John Q 09.01.25 at 8:18 am Dan @9 Did you read the opening para of the post ? Mike Huben 09.01.25 at 12:49 pm The most improbable thing (to me) is the resignation of the Supreme Court justices. If anything, resigning would make them even more vulnerable. Not to mention that the right-wing corruption would continue to bribe them, now to stay in office. Dave 09.01.25 at 1:37 pm I believe this will all happen exactly as described, but over a few decades instead of years. nastywoman 09.01.25 at 2:18 pm SOOO BEAUTIFUL!!!! – and we play with most of it already on our game of WOR(L)D DOMINATION with the UTMOST BEAUTIFUL ADDITIONAL SINK of NEW YORK and CALIFORNIA going FULL SOCIALIST (in any Americans Mind) and doing completely their OWN FUN SINK (as Elon would) say – why Elon is currently -actually far, faaar too involved in his WAR against the UK and Germany that he put the US kind of on PAUSE. YES SIR!!! Harry 09.01.25 at 2:41 pm “Second, MAGA is a cult, and it is not going away even if Trump dies tomorrow or is removed from office next year. They will be back in 2028 or 2030 or 2032 or 2032, and their mission will still be to abolish democracy, to destroy science, to remove minorities from any position of status and responsibility, and to conduct ethnic cleansing” It is a cult, but it is a personality cult. Once Trump is out of the way it will fragment, as personality cults often do. This may not be as optimistic as it sounds — there are a lot of very people in the cult who are unstable, angry, and armed. And maybe someone can pull together another personality cult composed of some of the fragments, plus other dangerous forces. I can’t think who, but then in 2014 I had no idea a Trump could. Gwyneth Paltrow? Jerry Brown 09.01.25 at 4:07 pm It has the elements of a story. There are an awful lot of villains and at least some of them get their just rewards. The protagonists need some development. Maybe some more work developing Powell as a reluctant hero. And you have to change the names of course. And sex sells so you want some in there somehow with this bunch. Maybe think George Clooney as the Powell character on the verge of being fired for some Trumped up charge on the eve of the traffic accident. And he gets saved by some unlikely heroine somewhere in the judicial system. Maybe like a fictional Amy Coney Barret type who sees through the Trumped up charges and decides to act in the interest of justice for a change. Stranger things have happened. Laban 09.01.25 at 4:50 pm “a repeat of 2020” You mean a guy in a buffalo head dress being escorted through the Capitol by officers ? I seem to remember far worse unpleasantness in the name of George Floyd, which people seemed quite pleased about. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/trump-flees-to-bunker-as-protests-over-george-floyd-rage-outside-white-house I think the dollar is unlikely to still be the reserve currency by 2100, unless by some miracle the United States can be re-industrialised. I think that’s what he’s trying to do, however imperfectly, but he only has 3.5 years and a nation divided in many ways who have watched living standards fall for decades . China has a high-IQ, hardworking* population which is far less multicultural, and living standards and morale are on the up. It’s not that I’ll welcome our new Chinese overlords. Anyone working in the tourist industry will tell you Americans are much more generous. the point of the Chinese Exclusion Act was basically – “these guys work too hard for too little”. Michael Cain 09.01.25 at 5:57 pm I wouldn’t be so sure that the regular military would respond quickly to a President Vance’s order — based on a 25th Amendment takeover — to deploy and fire on American civilians. Trump has been replacing a lot of high-level officers based on what looks like a loyalty requirement. It seems possible that we would instead get a demonstration of “This is why the Founders didn’t want a standing army.” JimV 09.01.25 at 6:30 pm What I’ve heard recently about MAGA (and believed) is that about 37% of the people in the USA (and maybe elsewhere but with different focuses) are mean sociopaths or worse who enjoy Trump exactly for all the evil things he does, and are going to be with us always, some of them billionaires. So even if things do get better, they will get worse again, and the story, which I enjoyed, has some fantasy in it. (I enjoy good fantasy.) Robert J Berger 09.01.25 at 8:14 pm Loved it, wish it comes true. (the later part with Trump and his Minions in Jail and the country comes to its senses, hopefully we can avoid total economic destruction) Cheez Whiz 09.01.25 at 10:55 pm But those soldiers were chosen for loyalty to Trump personally. With Trump out of the picture where do their sympathies land? Questions like this abound throughout the (optimistic) scenario here, and is why the honest reality-adjacent answer is “nobody knows”. There’s a list of authoritarian personality cults to compare, with a range of outcomes (as I read somewhere) from The People’s Temple to Scientology. Can Vance be David Miscavige? Man has devoted himself to presenting as an empty suit, so who knows. J-D 09.02.25 at 12:15 am Alex SL’s reaction on finding John Quiggin’s story implausible is to make suggestions which are much less plausible. Alex SL 09.02.25 at 12:30 am Harry, These people existed before a Trump candidacy was a twinkle in anybody’s eye. For many decades now, they became school board members to push for creationism, they have worked towards filling the judiciary with Federalist Society hacks, they have carefully built a vast radicalisation machine ranging from local radio across Fox News to Youtube influencers, they have effectively infinity bribe money for elections at their disposal and an entire network of think tanks to influence elected officials, all with the aim of transforming the USA into a white-dominated plutocracy with the civil rights of, at best, the late 19th century. (I think they would not re-introduce racial chattel slavery… probably… but many of the libertarians among them would likely be okay with indentured servitude, as they think that any contract is ethical and acceptable if it is entered into without literally having a gun held to one’s head; they don’t count “if you don’t do this, you will starve to death” as coercion, and the only freedom they care about is that of the wealthy to do as they please with their wealth.) Do you think these people will go away or conclude that they are now in favour of liberal democracy, a welfare state, scientific expertise, and gay marriage once Trump is gone? This authoritarian movement didn’t start with Trump. It merely coalesced around him. It has completely taken over the Republican party. It will stay, and it will come back electorally even if they lose the next two elections, which would in turn depend on ICE not standing guard in front of most polling places to, ahem, “maintain order”. It would take a generational effort to discredit this movement, and there is no sign that any significant, organised counter-movement exists to undertake that effort. Chetan Murthy 09.02.25 at 2:11 am Oof. John, I thought I was pessimistic. Capital controls, expropriation, oof. Not saying you’re wrong. I moved my 401k entirely out of US investment and into European ones. But they’re still housed in a US brokerage, so haha, subject to expropriation and capital controls. Sigh. Goddamn FATCA and FBAR. Chetan Murthy 09.02.25 at 2:24 am Dan @ 9: I would answer differently from John Q. I also -fear- that there are no “limits to what the Republican party would tolerate from Trump”. None at all. In that case, this ends in one of two other ways: civil war in America America collapses and the rest of the world walls it off and goes its own way B/c they’re speed-running the destruction of the systems that keep America working. When those systems fall apart, either the G(r)OPers turn (John Q’s scenario), or there’s civil war, or America descends into some sort of hell. I say this to my European, Asian, and elsewhere friends: plan on a world without America. Plan on it. Hell, plan on a world in which America is your enemy. I’ve lived in America since I was four years old. I’m the sort of American who hasn’t left the country since 2007 (work trip). I spent 3yr in France on a postdoc. Besides that and a few trips for work, I’ve never left the country. I’m -that- sort of American: stay-at-home. A week ago, I booked travel to France to start re-learning French and look around for a place to emigrate to. Maybe it won’t be France. But it’s coming. I regret not having done it in early 2025; it’s time to do it now. We’re falling apart. Maybe not the way John Q describes it, but we -are- falling apart. [As Dan says] Our elites are either complicit or feckless cowards. That’s no way to run a country. Prepare yourselves, prepare your countries. Talk to your elected officials. nonrenormalizable 09.02.25 at 5:16 am Plausible or not, in about 6 months time this post will be the source material which various LLMs will draw upon to inform users that two Teslas had a serious crash resulting in the deaths and hospitalisation of several schoolchildren, and that Tether will have broken the buck. David Eisenberg 09.02.25 at 9:22 am In terms of style, it works really well. It reminds me of one of the “future history” stories I ever read: The Great Nebraska Sea. Laban 09.02.25 at 9:39 am Chetan Murthy 24 Rural France is pretty neat, as long as you don’t expect too much. A very liberal friend lives in a village where le Pen is by far the most popular politician. OTOH, France have perfected lawfare against dangerous parties, as have the UK. Le Pen is banned from standing in 2027, and the SNP found legal problems at the height of their electoral appeal. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Branchform Harry 09.02.25 at 12:38 pm Alex — not sure what I said to provoke that comment really. Yes, it coalesced around Trump. But its a minority of R voters; the primary system and his cult of personality coalesced it. Most R elected officials at the national level will revert to supporting business interests as soon as they dare (a lot of them genuinely fear for their lives, and those of their families). If Vance or someone else can do what Trump has done MAGA will remain very powerful. And maybe they can. I just don’t see who it is. And yes, the Dems seem hopeless, there’s very little opposition. As of now it looks entirely possible that the Trumpists are going to induce the Dems into the error of choosing Gary Numan.. sorry, Gavin Newsom as their candidate. Not saying it isn’t grim, of course it it. But coalitions are coalitions, and this one seems to have required a particular person to bring it together, and that person can’t last long. Remember too that the leading figures in MAGA are a bunch of scumbags who are genuinely driven by personal ambition more than anything, and that’s not a recipe for long term stability. Jacob 09.02.25 at 2:13 pm If US democracy persists, will you decrease your estimate of how good you are at analysing and predicting politics as a result? Mike Furlan 09.02.25 at 2:37 pm (a lot of them genuinely fear for their lives, and those of their families). Rather, I think, an even worse fear, that differing with Trump will hurt their careers. And not just R politicians, the country is run by careerists who are easily manipulated or intimidated by Trump. (Put me in Tim “Apple’s” place, for one example, and I’m not sure I would behave any better. I’m not blaming.) Another explanation is Adrian Tchaikowsky‘s in “Bear Head” that some people are like parasitic insects that invade and exploit ant colonies in a way that the ants have no defense. Chetan Murthy 09.02.25 at 3:49 pm Laban @ 27: I am not yet a refugee. But the way I understand it, “once a refugee, always a refugee”. [esp. since I’m 60] I don’t think I’ll be resting easy wherever I land. It’s just a safe[r] place with the rule of law (for now) and if things start to hot up, I’ll move on. As a famous philosopher once said, “it is what it is”. BigHank53 09.02.25 at 5:38 pm Nvidia would be fine; they make perfectly good products in demand from people who need to do computationally intensive modeling: animators, meteorologists, anyone using CAD. The ridiculous pricing set by crypto miners and AI investors would stop, and they’d have to return to a profile like AMD’s. DOP 09.02.25 at 6:32 pm Alex SL: You wrote: “There is no solution to this problem except to purge the Republican party of MAGA, and to make the entire right-wing media ecosystem illegal, and to completely overhaul the US education system, including making home schooling illegal” So why does homeschooling need to be illegal? Do you have kids? I was never an advocate until I realized we needed that option (virtual public charter for us but full HS for some). You might be falsely associating homeschooling with conservative christians or christian nationalists and while that certainly is often the case, there is a sizable portion of secular non religious families that choose home school or public virtual charters for their own reasons (academic advancement, special needs, etc.). So maybe rethink that? John Q 09.02.25 at 7:08 pm Jacob @29 “If US democracy persists, will you decrease your estimate of how good you are at analysing and predicting politics as a result?” If US democracy persists because of events similar to those I’ve described, an economic crash followed by a Republican split-up, I’ll be looking prophetic. If the Dems win the 2026 midterms, Trump serves out his second term without much more damage to democracy, and Vance is defeated in 2028, not so much. But the loss of my self-esteem as an analyst and predictor would be a small price to pay. And, if neither of these happens, and Trumpist rule continues, I can comfort myself that I am old and on the other side of the planet. IM Merc 09.02.25 at 7:11 pm It’s hard to imagine a description of a financial collapse in 2026 that doesn’t mention the collapse of OpenAI. It’s the center of the AI industry, much bigger than Anthropic, and it might not even make it to 2026. It is due to get a payment from SoftBank this year, but that requires it to shift to a for-profit model from a non-profit (that confusingly owns a for-profit subsidiary), and it has abandoned its plans to do that, because it’s too difficult. If it doesn’t get that $40B payment, it might not even survive 2025. This one company is inflating the AI bubble, and it is poised to burst, which would cause 1/3 of the entire US economy to pop. Yet, in your story the AI bubble seems to deflate slowly, and only after Tesla collapses and cryptocurrencies collapse. You even have Microsoft and Google failing but for reasons unrelated to the AI bubble bursting, which seems implausible. The AI bubble bursting is going to be the focus of the coming economic collapse, not a footnote. I absolutely believe that Tesla is poised to fail. Look at its P/E ratio compared to a normal car company like Toyota and you see how ridiculously overvalued it is. It’s a matter of time before investors admit it’s actually just a car company and not one of the most innovative tech companies. Crypto will probably also collapse, but Ponzi schemes are difficult to predict, and people might push money into Crypto thinking that when the normal economy is collapsing it’s a safe haven. People are dumb like that. Also, Musk being theoretically bankrupt is a fun thing to imagine. But, he’s a centi-billionaire with political and defense-industry connections, those guys don’t go bankrupt, at least not quickly. Cabinet officials would deem his companies too big to fail, and the government would step in to save them, with DoD officials providing cover because of SpaceX. It’s fun to pretend that the Republicans might find a spine and remove Trump from office, but that’s never going to happen. What’s much more likely is that the stress of the collapse of the economy would cause a 79 year old president in poor health to have a heart attack or stroke and die. With their figurehead gone, MAGA and the whole GOP would fragment. The Silicon Valley VCs would have nothing in common with the religious zealots. Trump has made sure there’s nobody to challenge him, which means there’s nobody who could succeed him. nastywoman 09.02.25 at 7:14 pm but on the other hand Trump just posted on Truth Social: ‘In the Transcendental Logic, there is a section (titled The Refutation of Idealism that is intended to free Kant’s doctrine from any vestiges of subjective idealism, which would either doubt or deny the existence of external objects. Kant’s distinction between the appearance and the thing-in-itself is not intended to imply that nothing knowable exists apart from consciousness, as with subjective idealism. Rather, it declares that knowledge is limited to phenomena as objects of a sensible intuition. In the Fourth Paralogism (“… A Paralogism is a logical fallacy”), Kant further certifies his philosophy as separate from that of subjective idealism by defining his position as a transcendental idealism in accord with empirical realism, a form of direct realism!!!’ nastywoman 09.02.25 at 7:37 pm on the other hand Governor Newsom’s Press Office posted on Labor Day: HAPPY LABOR DAY TO ALL, INCLUDING THE SCUM THAT IS TRYING TO DESTROY OUR COUNTRY WITH A SICK WARPED RADICAL MIND, KILLING SMALL BUSINESSES WITH CRAZY TARIFFS, TAKING HEALTH CARE FROM CHILDREN, PARDONING J6 THUGS, SENDING THE “PRIVATE ARMY” TO ARREST GRANDMA, WRECKING OUR BEAUTIFUL ENVIRONMENT, DEFUNDING OUR SCHOOLS, AND DESTABILIZING LONG-STANDING INTERNATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS.

Chetan Murthy 09.02.25 at 11:06 pm DOP @ 33: I’ll give a stab at explaining why homeschooling is …. bad for democracy. First, I’ll note that I’m pretty much a poster child for the absolute bollocks value of public schooling. I spent 6th grade-graduation in Texas public schools. It’s fair to say I didn’t learn much. I learnt so little, I decided the fall of my junior year to graduate early; meanwhile I was working 1-2 fulltime jobs in fast food at night/weekends, sleeping in class all day (when else would I get my sleep — I was up until 2-4am every night working in a Jack-in-the-Box). And yet I had excellent grades. Public school was a waste of time. But OTOH, how else are we to ensure that all children mix with other children — other children who aren’t like them — and learn the basics of our history and our governance? If you leave it to these Christofascist parents, you’ll end up with an army of little Liberty University freshmen-wannabees. As bad as public school in my hometown was, my last year there the little Fascist parents were taking their kids out to send ’em to the Maranatha school. B/c public school was insufficiently -Christian-. My mind boggled even back then. I do take your point that for some children, public school is inadequate: as I described above, I was one of those children (and I neglected to mention that it was a racist hellhole that scarred me for life, that engendered so much hatred in my soul that I’d happy drop a Tsar Bomba on that damn town), but the problem is, you can’t make public policy based on exceptions: you need to make that policy so that you produce the highest percentage of solid citizens possible. I would also argue that when we find public school to be inadequate, it’s almost always the case that more funding would improve the situation. Though of course, in cases like Texas, nothing can be done: just fence it off and cede the land to Mexico: maybe if we give ’em a big payment, they’ll agree to take it off our hands. J Monz 09.02.25 at 11:39 pm Very nicely done. I have no quibbles with the plausibility, because although I may not expect the specific scenario you describe, I am quite certain that the actual events of the next few years will be even stranger and less believable than those you describe. Alex SL 09.03.25 at 12:01 am Harry, Sorry if I misread you, but given your comment at 28, I think we have a very different read on the situation. Maybe the authoritarian, anti-science, eliminatory racists are a minority among conservative voters in absolute terms, but they appear to be the most politically active and the most reliable primary voters. I just don’t see how they will stop primarying moderate “I just want to lower taxes on business” style Republicans in favour of loons just because Trump is gone. The few moderates who are left are in fear not because of the single person Trump but because of those primary voters, influencers, and activists, and they don’t evaporate after Trump. I worry that a lot of the current optimism about the USA is equivalent to a joke I saw in Germany when I was young: a father telling his children at bed time, “in 1933, Nazis came out of nowhere and took over our country, and then in 1945 they all disappeared again”. That is not how it works, unfortunately. The last sentence you wrote is the most convincing argument, I must admit: these people aren’t loyal or competent, so they may yet collapse from in-fighting. Still, even just looking across what people report from MAGA, conservative, and Republican Reddit forums and other social media, the reaction of most voters in that space to recent months can be comfortably classified into two categories: (1) Obviously I would never vote Democrats, because they want to destroy our country, but I am a bit concerned about the Tariffs. Can you fellow cult members explain to me why I should not worry? (2) Dear glorious leader, I fully support everything you do, but now your Medicare cuts are affecting me personally and/or ICE have arrested my (Hispanic) wife, and I am hopeful that now that you have read this misspelled post on a random subreddit, you/DOGE/ICE will make an exception for my family, specifically, while continuing to hurt millions of others, as they should be. Neither of these suggest that Republican voters will ever stop hitting themselves in the face with a frying pan. The first group are caught in a cult where voting anything but Republican is completely unthinkable no matter what Republicans do. The second group is too self-centered, sociopathic, and narcisissistic to be reasoned with. It is frightening to understand that there are millions of people who want to, e.g., make abortion illegal, no exceptions even in case of risk to the life of the mother, because everybody who needs an abortion is a (insert slur here) and needs to be punished, and then expect an exception to be made for themselves, because their situation is totally different, of course; but understand we must, because they vote, and they will vote even when Trump is gone. DOP, I grew up in Germany, and home schooling is illegal there, and I have never seen any problems with that. I understand that it is different if school-age children live in very remote, rural areas where there is no critical mass to run a school, but there are solutions for that in the digital age. I find it extremely unhealthy for society and the children to isolate one’s children from other children, be it for religious, racist, or classist reasons (and would outlaw all private and sectarian schools for the same reason if I could). I also simply do not believe that parents are qualified to teach unless they are certified teachers themselves, and even then they would likely only be qualified in two or three subjects. This means that home-schooling is by definition a minor form of child abuse through educational neglect. If a decent education is available, that is; I am not saying that a medieval peasant had any other choice but to home-school, what with no professional school system being accessible to them. Similarly, if schools fail the students, that is a problem. But the problem is to a great degree caused by allowing wealthy people to remove their children from the public school system, thereby removing any incentive from wealthy people to support sufficient funding for the public school system.

To everyone: can we call a halt to the thread derail of home-schooling nonrenormalizable 09.03.25 at 9:29 am AlexSL @22 and @40: I am very often as pessimistic as you (and JohnQ) about the prospects of democracy in the US, and agree about how the authoritarian/illiberal tendency in American politics has existed long before Trump and will continue long after him. The lone shred of doubt that I have regarding the inevitability of this disastrous future is the essential … stupidity and singularity of Trump’s ascent to power. In almost every election cycle that he is not directly on the ballot, he and his supporters have either lost or failed to capitalize on their position. He seems to attract groups of uninformed and otherwise unengaged voters, at times running ahead of his own party in down-ballot races. As a politician, he also seems exceedingly shameless, proudly ignorant, determined to engage in minor squabbles, and desperate for attention and adulation. This, his personal history, and other attributes have made him catnip for the press in the social media age. While there are other figures who seem to enjoy dominating our conscious hours (such as Elon Musk), no one has quite the same pathological skill of generating stories (ranging from incredibly stupid and petty to those with enormous geopolitical consequences) for the world to consume. If a foreign enemy were to design from scratch a Manchurian candidate to destroy the US from within, they could not have come up with someone with a temperament so unsuited for the office of president while being so irresistible to those covering Washington. So if he were to vanish from the political stage before say, the next midterms, there would both be no draw for the class of voters I described above, and a break of the spell binding the news media. And maybe a good segment of the American public could then push back against any attempts to disrupt a fair electoral process. The MAGA/Project 2025/Federalist society/ICE people will still be around, but without a Trump figure creating endless distractions for them, perhaps the full scope of their work will become much more salient and unpopular in the public mind. They are to some extent a fractured group with different end goals, and could easily splinter when there is no leader around who is (a) somewhat popular with the electorate and (b) is amenable to their views or can be manipulated into implementing them. The danger is that the US has become hooked on the style of Trump — that he has indelibly shaped the office of the president and broadened the political economy so that people accept (and even demand) the same policies and type of leaders afterward. To some extent, this is what happened during the Biden years: the lack of daily disruptions, rambling tweets, and unceasing palace intrigue may have detracted from the sense of Biden as being in charge (on top of his own age and health issues). So perhaps we should expect a succession of mad Caesars in the years to come. Laban 09.03.25 at 10:27 am Please, nothing more like this.

Sorry. nonrenormalizable, I am not that sure I see his ability to generate stories or really to do anything well. He is largely unintelligible when he is talking, he is so transparently corrupt and selfish that he shouldn’t be trusted with organising an office raffle, and he is a famously incompetent businessman. Why is he still so successful? Part of it is certainly the media landscape (e.g., most R voters probably don’t have accurate information on his corruption and many bankruptcies), part is inserting himself into a pre-existing cult (which in turn was created and facilitated by media), and a small part of his support comes from trolls who find it funny to vote for a clearly unsuitable candidate to trigger the libs. The thing is, Trump being so singularly unsuited for office is one of the things that has me worried, because to me, it shows that if US conservatives and swing voters will vote for somebody like that, they (or at least all except the aforementioned trolls) will be even more likely vote for a far-right candidate who is less embarrassing, more focused in his messaging, and more competent at installing a dictatorship than Trump is. You are right, Trump’s character is perfectly suited for destroying the USA, but a different leader might be more suited to creating a lasting dictatorship than he is. mw, I don’t know if you are in the USA, but I have frequently observed that many Americans do not understand the concept of having to defend [good thing] against the enemies of [good thing]. But I don’t understand what is so difficult about this. Free markets tend to collapse unless the government constantly enforces anti-trust regulation, contract law, quality standards, fraud prosecution, etc., using the state monopoly on violence if necessary. Democracy collapses unless those who want to destroy it are stopped, using the state monopoly on violence if necessary. Religious freedom collapses unless those who want to force everybody into their own religion are stopped, using the state monopoly on violence if necessary. My peaceful co-existence with my neighbours only works if any neighbour who starts violently attacking me for not liking my face is stopped, using the state monopoly on violence if necessary. Democracy only works if no one person is so rich that they can buy fifty members of parliament with their pocket change, so we need to avoid enormous inequality of wealth, using the state monopoly on violence if necessary. All of this is basic. J-D 09.03.25 at 11:34 pm The ideal (but unfortunately not feasible) solution to authoritarianism would be … … an army of archangels with flaming swords descending from heaven to set everything to rights. That would, of course, be the ideal natural solution. The ideal miraculous solution would be for everybody to come to their senses without celestial intervention. JPL 09.04.25 at 6:26 am HowardNYC @49: Gee, what’s holding you back? Granted Trump’s bizarro-world way of governing is a reductio ad absurdum, and the SCOTUS’s infamous decision is taken by Trump to mean, “I can do whatever (the hell) I like (like order the completion of the holocaust against the Jews after he helps Netanyahu do the same against the Palestinians and get away with it)”, at least John’s OP was grounded in the expert causal analysis of economic principles, policy and activity. But with daydreaming there are no obstacles to the slippery slide to absurdity. In the OP John has the economic catastrophe triggered by Tesla and Bitcoin, but I would agree with some commenters above that probably the greater danger is the bursting of the “AI” bubble, due to a necessary scaling back of expectations and hype and overexuberance of investment. But there are so many other dimensions that can’t be addressed in a short blog post. Mobs of MAGA voters are mentioned (and people forget that it’s the ordinary MAGA voters, the populace of populism, that is actually calling the shots these days), but would they be inflamed by their leader’s travails, stagflation, the Epstein affair or disillusionment? For a helpful response I would prefer causal analysis and problem-solving, rather than prediction, which in any case has to go through an understanding of the relevant causal laws, but not unrestrained fantasy. (I realize that you thought of your comments as a blurb for a blockbuster, but I hope your BP is OK these days.) nonrenormalizable 09.04.25 at 7:56 am Alex SL @51: Regarding the incoherence and unintelligibility of Trump: I have seen this description a lot over the past decade, and while I think it’s true on a technical and syntactical level (and becomes very apparent when we read a transcription of his contemporaneous remarks), I am perhaps below a certain threshold where I cannot completely dismiss his comments because of his style or the mangling of details around whatever point he attempts to make. It’s a sort of involuntary “sane-washing”, which if I managed to find an off switch for, I would find I would also have to ignore a lot of other less malevolent people in life who aren’t necessarily highly articulate and erudite. That’s also the nub of the problem with the media commentariat, which is exacerbated by the fact that he holds probably the most consequential office in the world — so in quite a few occasions, the import of what he says holds tremendous weight. So even absurdities like the notion of “reciprocal tariffs” have to be parsed for motivation and substance. But the discussion and debate around “what did he mean?”/”this is the stupidest idea ever”/”there’s a kernel of truth here” generates its own news cycle, and Trump produces such content several times a week, if not every day. A 24 hour news network can fill up their programming hiring pundits to explain, contradict, or support any reading of Trump’s assertions. (The essential incoherence at the heart of his words and the instinct for people to find meaning in them is part of his political success. Everyone from socialists to blood-and-soil nationalists hears the core of one of their central tenets in one of his daily complaints, and are tempted into the belief that Trump can be controlled or pushed further along those lines into some action. There aren’t many other politicians who appear as pliable on so many issues, despite his record of betraying those who’ve tried to ride the tiger.) Added to this, Trump’s willingness to engage and comment on trivial things like the Sidney Sweeney ad campaign, Taylor Swift — and who knows what else that I just can’t be bothered to pay attention to — means he forces himself into every conversation or discussion. Whatever you may be interested in, he’s probably said something relevant to it. He was of course a reality TV star himself, and I think that’s how a large chunk of people process him and his presidency. In a lot of ways, this entertainment format has primed us to a figure like him and the way he operates: take an obviously flawed and attention-seeking person, put them in some unlikely position, and watch the chaos that unfolds. Did he have multiple bankruptcies on his record? It’s part of his character. Is he yelling at world leaders in front of the press? Prime-time drama. Sending in the National Guard to Democrat-run cities? Let’s see how that works out. Unfortunately, there are no executive producers to cancel the show before it destroys the country. PeteW 09.04.25 at 8:58 am On topic I hope, this week the regime apparently murdered 11 people in cold blood by blowing up their speedboat. The claim was that they were smuggling drugs – although the maximum penalty for smuggling in the US is NOT execution, summary or otherwise – but any evidence of this now presumably lies at the bottom of the Caribbean Sea, along with their bodies. https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-military-kills-11-people-strike-alleged-drug-boat-venezuela-trump-says-2025-09-03/ mw 09.04.25 at 10:15 am AlexSL @51 I have frequently observed that many Americans do not understand the concept of having to defend [good thing] against the enemies of [good thing]. But I don’t understand what is so difficult about this. Yes, I’m an American, and yes I understand it. But there liberal ways of defending the good and illiberal ways. I recoil strongly from JQ’s illiberal ‘ideal’ proposals as I do from most of MAGA. I do not want to replace right illiberalism with left illiberalism. We tried some of the latter under Biden with the ‘censorship by proxy’ (the federal government strong-arming tech and media companies to suppress unapproved ideas). I found that horrifying (and blatantly unconstitutional). No more of that, please from either side of the aisle. A few months ago, I listened to a podcast history of the revolutions of 1848 with the liberal constitutionalists stuck between monarchist conservatives on one side and socialist revolutionaries on the other.

The writer has millions of square miles dropping 3,000 to 5,000 feet, mostly in the space of a year. I couldn’t help but ask, “Where did a million cubic miles of underlying rock go?” Was there just an enormous void down there? Or more likely, where was the corresponding up-thrust area? The Western Interior Seaway, which was a real thing in the same area during the Cretaceous, took 15 million years to form. reason 09.04.25 at 3:44 pm mw, I suppose I’m wasting my effort here (not sure how good faith your arguments are) but suppressing abuse is not exactly the same as suppressing ideas.

Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer says the robots aren’t coming for your paycheck — and she’s betting big that artificial intelligence will make more Americans upwardly mobile, not unemployed. In a Fox Business interview airing Labor Day weekend, the Oregon Republican-turned-cabinet-chief dismissed anxiety about mass layoffs as AI spreads from factory floors to office cubicles. “There should be no threat of AI displacing the American worker,” Chavez-DeRemer told Fox Business. “What we’re hearing on the ground is AI is here to stay,” she added. “The President wants the United States to be the leader in AI, to win that AI race.” The rosy portrait comes as corporate executives have warned that AI will likely reduce employment rolls in key white collar fields — with some doomsayers predicting a bloodbath of mass layoffs. Chavez-DeRemer, confirmed in March with bipartisan support, argued AI will take the drudgery out of tasks and help workers reach higher-pay roles supervising and operating the new tech. “I’ve been through companies where AI is assisting the American worker,” she said, describing a plant that replaced manual carbon-fiber coiling with 3-D printing. “Now those workers are reskilled and upskilled, and now they’re running the line.” The secretary’s rosy outlook comes as the administration rolls out an aggressive pro-AI agenda that seeks to assert US dominance in the technology, while keeping Main Street on board.

In April, President Trump signed an executive order making “AI literacy and proficiency” a national priority, directing agencies to seed K-12 classrooms, teacher training and apprenticeships with AI content and to expand pathways for lifelong learners. The White House followed in July with “America’s AI Action Plan,” which casts American workers as the policy’s center of gravity and tees up new measures to track AI’s labor-market impact, expand apprenticeships and stand up an “AI Workforce Research Hub” at the Labor Department. Last week, the Labor Department issued guidance urging states to use federal funding for AI-skills training — from prompting and evaluating AI outputs to basic cybersecurity tied to responsible use. The memo explicitly ties the push to the April executive order and spells out how youth, adult and dislocated-worker programs can weave AI into short-term classes, credentials and work-based learning. Leading tech and business figures have been sounding alarms that AI could wipe out up to half of all white-collar jobs within just a few years, with CEOs from Anthropic, Ford, Amazon and others openly bracing for mass cuts. Experts like Dario Amodei and Kai-Fu Lee warn of a looming “white-collar bloodbath,” with entry-level roles in finance, law, consulting and tech especially vulnerable. Former Google chief Eric Schmidt predicts most coding work will soon be done by AI, while Amazon’s Andy Jassy says corporate head-counts will shrink as efficiency improves. The IMF estimates 300 million jobs worldwide could be disrupted, urging governments to pour resources into retraining to cushion the blow. Even AI champions like Sam Altman admit that “jobs are definitely going to go away, full stop,” warning that the transition will be painful before any new opportunities emerge. One study suggests this could already be happening for entry-level workers, whose skills are the easiest to replicate with AI. Economists found that employment for young software engineers dropped 20% between late 2022 and early 2023, according to the Wall Street Journal. Advertisement

Title: Google Investors Surprisingly Chill About Major Data Breach

The stock of Google’s parent company ended Fridayâs trading session relatively unchanged, as investors digested news of a major data leak and broader market developments. Alphabet Inc. (GOOG)âs shares closed at $213.53, up slightly from the day’s prior end price, despite Google‘s global security alert advising its 2.5 billion Gmail users to update their information following a data breach involving one of its Salesforce databases. The company immediately issued a network-wide alert telling users to change their password immediately. Despite all that, investors in Google had either not fully digested the news during Friday trade, or were watching see what fallout might continue over the weekend, before pricing in any hit to the company’s value. Though consumerÂ GmailÂ and Cloud accounts were not directly compromised, the incident has triggered an aggressive wave of phishing and impersonation attacks targeting users across the platform. The leak, which exposed hundreds of thousands of sensitive documents and personal data, has underscored growing concerns about cybersecurity risks facing major tech firms. Still, despite major data breaches at all the tech giants, seemingly in an endless game of round robin, investors continue to believe the potential of these companies outweighs most security concerns. Alphabet said in a statement it is investigating the breach and implementing additional security measures, but the incident has added to scrutiny of data management practices across the industry. âThe safety and privacy of user data are paramount,â it read. âWe are working diligently to address these issues and prevent future incidents.â Meanwhile, investors are still nervously cautious about signs of economic slowdown and Federal Reserve signals hinting at future interest rate cuts. Despite the turbulence, Alphabetâs stock maintained its position, reflecting investorsâ ongoing confidence in the companyâs core advertising and cloud businesses. But questions about data security continue to cloud its outlook. As the debate over digital privacy and cybersecurity intensifies, Alphabetâs response and its ability to restore trust will be closely watched by shareholders and regulators alike. Google sought this week to reassure consumers and investors. The breach exposed thousands of sensitive records, including personal details, corporate documents, and government information. The leaked data spread across multiple sources and was easily accessible via search engines. It includes confidential information such as legal files, financial records, and private communications. Experts warn that such exposure not only jeopardizes individual privacy but also heightens the risk of corporate espionage, identity theft, and national security threats. In its statement, Google emphasized that it is actively investigating the incident and has deployed additional security measures to identify and mitigate the breachâs impact. Cybersecurity analysts warn that the proliferation of data leaks reflects broader systemic issues in how companies handle sensitive information, as the industry remains largely unregulated and prone to cyberattacks. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for stronger data protection standards and increased transparency around data management practices. As consumers and businesses grapple with the potential fallout, authorities worldwide are calling for stricter oversight of data security protocols to mitigate the risks posed by such breaches in an increasingly interconnected world.

Title: KPop Demon Hunters’ HUNTR/X: The Significance Of A VMA Nomination
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/braedonmontgomery/2025/08/31/kpop-demon-hunters-huntrx-the-significance-of-a-vma-nomination/
Time Published: 2025-08-31T12:21:40Z

ByBraedon Montgomery, Contributor. Since its release on August 23, 2025, Netflix’s KPop Demon Hunters has taken the world by storm. With the film consistently ranking in Netflix’s top 10, breaking the streaming service’s record for most-watched film with over 236 million viewers, and the song “Golden” reaching the coveted #1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 , a feat that a female girl group hasn’t achieved since Destiny’s Child released their hit "Independent Woman, Part 1" in 2000, it’s clear that the stars of the animated film, HUNTR/X, pronounced “Huntrix,” are making waves in the industry. Even one of these achievements would solidify an artist's standing, but this girl group has several, and here’s the thing: they aren’t finished yet. With their singing voices provided by EJAE, Audrey Nuna, and Rei Ami, the group was created to go beyond the world of animation. With animation by Sony Pictures Imageworks, dynamic choreography combined with powerful vocals makes Rumi, Mira, and Zoey feel like real K-Pop idols, even though the audience knows they are animated. Their performances, style, and voices, combined with Netflix’s overwhelming streaming power explain why this group quickly achieved chart-topping hits, streams, and nominations since the films' release. The MTV Video Music Awards have been a way to measure the staying power and impact of musical acts and stars in moments that have stayed at the forefront of pop culture history. From Lady Gaga’s meat dress to Beyoncé revealing her pregnancy after performing or Janet Jackson’s tribute to her late brother, Michael Jackson, the VMAs are a night for juggernauts in the music industry to showcase their talent and earn awards for their contributions to the industry. While it might seem unusual that a fictional group could be nominated, let alone win at the VMAs, other groups, especially virtual bands, have performed at and even won awards at the show in the past. The Gorillaz, for instance, are a virtual band and the brainchild of Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett, and back in 2005, they had Noodle, a cartoon and one of the band members, deliver an acceptance speech in a short animation where she called in from a capsule hotel room on behalf of her group members. That same year, the group performed live using hologram technology at the MTV EMAs, where they played their hit song Feel Good Inc. with De La Soul. What started as a passion project turned into proof that virtual acts can attract audiences on real-life stages. While MTV has already confirmed performances, acts like Lady Gaga, Post Malone, Ricky Martin, who will receive the Latin Icon Award, and Mariah Carey, who will receive the Video Vanguard Award, how well HUNTR/X is received could be an indicator for whether or not there is a space for them to perform in the future, as Netflix has already expressed interest in continuing projects set in the world of KPop Demon Hunters. At the VMAs, if past group performances are any guide, anything can happen. Whether HUNTR/X wins or they put on a virtual show with animation, holograms, or a montage of film clips, the nomination itself is a spectacle and something to be proud of. This could be a defining moment in pop culture history, one where Netflix allows its fictional girl group to crossover into the real world. HUNTR/X has already demonstrated its ability to succeed with streaming and merchandise; now, the MTV VMAs might be the launchpad that this world-dominating animated girl group needs to step into the real world and conquer another frontier while its popularity is still at its peak: touring.

The majority of the early adopters wasted their money chasing the promised la-la world. It took a lot of painful efforts in strategising, governance and change management that finally turned these technologies to deliver the benefits. It looks like Gen-AI projects are in the same situation today. Enterprise boards were quick to embrace it for its transformative power, but the latest findings from MIT’s NANDA initiative reveal a sobering truth: Of the hundreds of deployments surveyed, a mere 5% achieved rapid revenue acceleration, while the rest linger in pilot purgatory or total failure. The “GenAI Divide” is real and widening. Why this disheartening pattern? And, more importantly, how can enterprises reverse this? To the experienced eye, the culprits seem obvious: yet-to-mature technology, unclear regulation, or the occasional model hallucination. But the MIT findings suggest the real villain is the flawed integration and huge learning gap. As a general-purpose tool, Gen-AI is great for individual users. For most knowledge workers, platforms like ChatGPT turn productive in content creation, faster search and analysis. But this becomes sort of a liability at scale. They seem to fail to adapt to enterprise workflow and not get attached to proprietary data ecosystems. They miss the finer contextual details to make complex decisions. Therein lies the failure of pilots. * More than half of AI budgets was allocated to sales and marketing tools, and key areas where substantial ROI could be lying were ignored, especially in back-office automation. Imagine how much enterprises would have saved if BPO costs were eliminated or if the reliance on external agencies were eliminated. Even operational excellence could drive better ROI by reducing costs. * Building one’s own solutions succeeds only one-third as often as purchased solutions. Most businesses refuse to believe this and stubbornly pursue in-house development. Partnering with specialised providers makes better sense. * Centralised adoption with innovation teams to drive AI, creates ivory towers. Success correlates strongly with empowering line managers and embedding AI into day-to-day operational decisions. * Employees, starved of sanctioned tools, adopt unsupported solutions like ChatGPT. This leads to compliance and security risks, with governance gaps. Clearly, the evidence is there for enterprises to follow a different playbook and avoid such blunders. (i) Can you anchor AI to one high-stake pain point? Air Canada didn’t deploy Gen-AI for broad marketing tactics but for automating contract review and compliance checks. It found a 60% reduction in legal processing times and delivered measurable cost savings. The few success stories show a common theme: unwavering focus. In contrast, companies that scatter AI budgets across multiple areas without prioritising have seen poor or no impact, leading to scepticism. (ii) Can you first buy or partner and then build? During the COVID-19 vaccine race, Pfizer engaged startups like Concerto HealthAI as partners to use AI in accelerating drug discovery. This buy-and-partner strategy helped in reducing years from research timelines in vaccine discovery using the power of ecosystems. Proprietary AI systems may sound exciting, but when you need a lot of data, going all alone is the loud noise before defeat. Many financial services companies have built proprietary GenAI engines in isolation and ended up halting rollouts and increasing costs, typically associated with the build-it-yourself fallacy. (iii) Can you decentralise rollout to the edges? Unilever has trained SBU heads along with data scientists to identify AI use cases, which resulted in a successful rollout. This way, GenAI was embedded into forecasting and procurement, saving millions in supply chain improvements. AI should not be a cloistered experiment in a central lab. Real transformation occurs when line managers own the integration. A large MNC bank poured resources into its “AI Centre of Excellence” but barred branch managers from influencing pilots, leading to wonderful PoCs that never scaled. (iv) Can you reorganise workflows before AI integration? The shipping liner, Maersk, started with standardising shipping documentation and digitised customs workflows before integrating GenAI for intelligent document processing. This resulted in a 30% reduction in turnaround time at ports. Do not treat AI as a plug-in for processes that are broken. Many e-retailers tend to layer chatbots over chaotic customer service workflows, and this will frustrate both agents and consumers. (v) Can you manage the human angle with foresight? IBM used an attrition-led reskilling model and announced that AI would automate over 7500 roles. It simultaneously invested in upskilling plans for data analytics and AI ethics. By doing both, it contained employee anxieties and kept its brand image of a responsible innovator. In an era when human roles are made redundant, managing panic-driven layoffs is critical and not like the TCS layoffs recently. Mass lay-offs by Meta and Amazon eroded trust and drove talent to competitors, damaging the employer brand. (vi) Can you incorporate governance and metrics? What Microsoft has done with its Copilot for enterprise clients is a case in point. It includes a robust ROI framework, tracking metrics like time-to-task completion and employee satisfaction. This helps in driving AI as a credible performer. Remember the saying, “What cannot be measured cannot be scaled.” Businesses that skirt this issue fake wins, with CFOs questioning the effectiveness of every rupee spent. Tech won’t save you; culture will. The winners? They treat failure like a cheap intern: tolerated, taught, then fired fast. They hype small wins like blockbuster premieres. And Gen-AI? It’s Fool’s Gold – shiny, seductive, yet treacherous. Be reminded: AI won’t replace you, but dumb strategy surely will.

Title: NVIDIA & Magnificent 7: Too Hot To Handle?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/08/31/nvidia--magnificent-7-too-hot-to-handle/
Time Published: 2025-08-31T11:00:00Z

ByBill Stone, Contributor. As the dominant supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) chips, NVIDIA (NVDA) has become the largest company in the world and within the S&P 500 index. Following NVIDIA’s earnings last week, it’s an appropriate time to revisit the attractiveness of large technology stocks with a special emphasis on NVIDIA. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), collectively account for nearly 34% of the S&P 500’s market capitalization. Eight of the ten largest companies in the S&P 500 are technology companies, including Broadcom (AVGO). Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) are the only non-technology companies in the top ten. Investors already appreciate the strong fundamentals of the Magnificent 7, and NVIDIA in particular, with stock returns far outstripping those of the S&P 500. The Magnificent 7 and NVIDIA have achieved total returns of 280% and 1,093%, respectively, since the start of the ChatGPT era at the end of 2022, while the S&P 500 has returned 75%. Based on the past twelve months of earnings and consensus earnings estimates for the next twelve months, the price-to-earnings ratios for all the Magnificent 7 stocks are above the S&P 500. While this ratio indicates that most of these companies have a higher valuation on both measures, it doesn’t answer whether other factors justify that premium. Another way to value companies is by their multiple revenues, which is called the price-to-sales ratio. All the Magnificent 7 are valued at price-to-sales ratios above the S&P 500, with NVIDIA at an almost twenty-seven times price-to-sales ratio. Historical annualized growth in sales over the last three and five years has been impressive for most of the group, but downright amazing for NVIDIA. Likewise, historical earnings per share growth has generally been impressive and exceptional, as seen in cases like NVIDIA. The five-year annualized earnings per share growth rate of the Magnificent 7 demonstrates just how unique these companies have been when compared to the stock market as a whole. Future earnings are the most crucial criterion when considering whether to buy or hold a stock. Consensus forecasts from Wall Street analysts still evidence significant optimism about NVIDIA’s earnings growth prospects, with 39% annualized growth expected from the world’s largest company. Separately, the sustainable growth rate for the group supports the future growth story. The sustainable growth rate theoretically indicates how fast a company can grow without borrowing additional funds while maintaining its existing capital structure. The profitability metrics of most of the Magnificent 7 are impressive. Gross margins represent the profitability after all direct expenses, specifically the cost of goods sold, have been deducted from sales. Operating margins measure how much a company earns on a dollar of sales after paying for the variable expenses, or the percentage of sales converted into operating income. NVIDIA converted almost seventy cents of every sales dollar into operating profit over the last year. While NVIDIA’s gross margin was about 70% over the previous year, it improved to 75% in the most recent quarter. Just looking at a simple high price-to-earnings ratio can be deceiving when analyzing a company with high returns on invested capital (ROIC). It is crucial to consider the return generated on the capital needed to fund a business, since a company with a sustainably higher ROIC should sell at a valuation premium. To put some of the impressive return on invested capital figures for the Magnificent 7 into proper perspective, the ROIC for the S&P 500 is around 8%. Furthermore, most companies in the Magnificent 7 generate substantial amounts of free cash flow, despite investing in growing businesses. The free cash flow margin indicates the percentage of revenue that the company can utilize or distribute to shareholders as free cash flow. NVIDIA is exceptional, with almost forty-four cents of every dollar in sales converted to free cash flow. The free cash flow yield refers to the free cash flow per share generated by a business, expressed as a percentage of its stock price. Value investors, such as Warren Buffett, value a company based on the cash that can be distributed from a business over its lifetime, discounted back to the present. Free cash flow can be a good measure of the money available to owners. A free cash flow yield below that of the S&P 500, such as the Magnificent 7 and NVIDIA, can be seen as investors already pricing in superior growth and durability of free cash flow relative to the market. NVIDIA is particularly notable given the massive increase in its market capitalization, which now exceeds $4.2 trillion, driven by the artificial intelligence spending wave. The consumer introduction of ChatGPT as an artificial intelligence tool in late 2022 coincided with a sharp rise in NVIDIA’s valuation, as the company became the dominant supplier of AI semiconductors. There has been some concern about NVIDIA’s relatively meager beat of consensus earnings estimates last week and less exceptional guidance than has been typical. There were zero sales to China in the quarter due to geopolitical tensions, which made for more challenging comparisons. For example, data center sales, which were impacted by China, declined by 1% quarter-over-quarter, but were up about 12% quarter-over-quarter excluding China, according to TD Cowen. Despite NVIDIA’s less optimistic forward guidance than was hoped, a resumption in sales to China could add $2 to $5 billion in sales. In the short term, NVIDIA’s dominance in high-end artificial intelligence computing appears untouchable, as its next-generation platform is on pace for meaningful production next year. Furthermore, the company continues to benefit from AI demand outstripping supply, alleviating concerns about potential pricing pressures. It appears likely that AI will be a transformative tool for businesses and households, generating substantial economic benefits. Although it is still early, indications suggest that artificial intelligence adoption is continuing at a brisk pace. The capital spending (capex) by AI-leaders, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft, to support complex computations needed to support AI, has seen a massive rise since 2023. NVIDIA reaped significant revenue from this spending as the leading chip provider for AI. Estimates are that capital spending by these four AI leaders will exceed $400 billion by 2026. What if demand for AI services doesn’t meet expectations or the firms are unable to monetize the services at a profitable enough level? Capital expenditures (capex) budgets can indeed be slashed if needed. This downside risk isn’t a forecast, but it must be considered when evaluating NVIDIA and all AI-connected technology stocks. Notably, these sizable capital expenditures are more sustainable than some past instances, because the companies are highly profitable and can self-fund rather than depending on the charity of lenders or additional capital. Though it is nowhere in sight, one must always be wary of some competing technology eventually displacing NVIDIA as a dominant leader. Capitalism subjects companies to intense competition in their pursuit of profits, and the profits generated by technology leaders make them an attractive target. The bullish case for large tech and NVIDIA is bolstered by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). The mega-cap technology stocks, represented by the Magnificent 7, continue to produce earnings and free cash flow at impressive rates. Large technology stocks typically exhibit exceptional profitability compared to the average stock and should therefore trade at a premium valuation. The rise in the stock prices of the Magnificent 7, including NVIDIA, has been supported by robust fundamentals and not just a promise of future profitability. Investors buy or hold companies for their future profits, not their past performance. The past is only significant to the extent that it informs the firm’s future prospects. While one needs to remain mindful of risk, the robust adoption rate of artificial intelligence, combined with companies’ ability to self-fund the massive costs required to build AI infrastructure, implies that the end is not yet here. Investors should be mindful of the risk associated with concentrated holdings, given the remarkable growth of some of these technology leaders.

ByBill Stone, Contributor. As the dominant supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) chips, NVIDIA (NVDA) has become the largest company in the world and within the S&P 500 index.

Consensus forecasts from Wall Street analysts still evidence significant optimism about NVIDIA’s earnings growth prospects, with 39% annualized growth expected from the world’s largest company. Separately, the sustainable growth rate for the group supports the future growth story. The sustainable growth rate theoretically indicates how fast a company can grow without borrowing additional funds while maintaining its existing capital structure. The profitability metrics of most of the Magnificent 7 are impressive. Gross margins represent the profitability after all direct expenses, specifically the cost of goods sold, have been deducted from sales. Operating margins measure how much a company earns on a dollar of sales after paying for the variable expenses, or the percentage of sales converted into operating income. NVIDIA converted almost seventy cents of every sales dollar into operating profit over the last year. While NVIDIA’s gross margin was about 70% over the previous year, it improved to 75% in the most recent quarter. Just looking at a simple high price-to-earnings ratio can be deceiving when analyzing a company with high returns on invested capital (ROIC). It is crucial to consider the return generated on the capital needed to fund a business, since a company with a sustainably higher ROIC should sell at a valuation premium. To put some of the impressive return on invested capital figures for the Magnificent 7 into proper perspective, the ROIC for the S&P 500 is around 8%. Furthermore, most companies in the Magnificent 7 generate substantial amounts of free cash flow, despite investing in growing businesses. The free cash flow margin indicates the percentage of revenue that the company can utilize or distribute to shareholders as free cash flow. NVIDIA is exceptional, with almost forty-four cents of every dollar in sales converted to free cash flow. The free cash flow yield refers to the free cash flow per share generated by a business, expressed as a percentage of its stock price. Value investors, such as Warren Buffett, value a company based on the cash that can be distributed from a business over its lifetime, discounted back to the present. Free cash flow can be a good measure of the money available to owners. A free cash flow yield below that of the S&P 500, such as the Magnificent 7 and NVIDIA, can be seen as investors already pricing in superior growth and durability of free cash flow relative to the market. NVIDIA is particularly notable given the massive increase in its market capitalization, which now exceeds $4.2 trillion, driven by the artificial intelligence spending wave. The consumer introduction of ChatGPT as an artificial intelligence tool in late 2022 coincided with a sharp rise in NVIDIA’s valuation, as the company became the dominant supplier of AI semiconductors. There has been some concern about NVIDIA’s relatively meager beat of consensus earnings estimates last week and less exceptional guidance than has been typical. There were zero sales to China in the quarter due to geopolitical tensions, which made for more challenging comparisons. For example, data center sales, which were impacted by China, declined by 1% quarter-over-quarter, but were up about 12% quarter-over-quarter excluding China, according to TD Cowen. Despite NVIDIA’s less optimistic forward guidance than was hoped, a resumption in sales to China could add $2 to $5 billion in sales. In the short term, NVIDIA’s dominance in high-end artificial intelligence computing appears untouchable, as its next-generation platform is on pace for meaningful production next year. Furthermore, the company continues to benefit from AI demand outstripping supply, alleviating concerns about potential pricing pressures. It appears likely that AI will be a transformative tool for businesses and households, generating substantial economic benefits. Although it is still early, indications suggest that artificial intelligence adoption is continuing at a brisk pace. The capital spending (capex) by AI-leaders, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft, to support complex computations needed to support AI, has seen a massive rise since 2023. NVIDIA reaped significant revenue from this spending as the leading chip provider for AI. Estimates are that capital spending by these four AI leaders will exceed $400 billion by 2026. What if demand for AI services doesn’t meet expectations or the firms are unable to monetize the services at a profitable enough level? Capital expenditures (capex) budgets can indeed be slashed if needed. This downside risk isn’t a forecast, but it must be considered when evaluating NVIDIA and all AI-connected technology stocks. Notably, these sizable capital expenditures are more sustainable than some past instances, because the companies are highly profitable and can self-fund rather than depending on the charity of lenders or additional capital. Though it is nowhere in sight, one must always be wary of some competing technology eventually displacing NVIDIA as a dominant leader. Capitalism subjects companies to intense competition in their pursuit of profits, and the profits generated by technology leaders make them an attractive target. The bullish case for large tech and NVIDIA is bolstered by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). The mega-cap technology stocks, represented by the Magnificent 7, continue to produce earnings and free cash flow at impressive rates. Large technology stocks typically exhibit exceptional profitability compared to the average stock and should therefore trade at a premium valuation. The rise in the stock prices of the Magnificent 7, including NVIDIA, has been supported by robust fundamentals and not just a promise of future profitability. Investors buy or hold companies for their future profits, not their past performance. The past is only significant to the extent that it informs the firm’s future prospects. While one needs to remain mindful of risk, the robust adoption rate of artificial intelligence, combined with companies’ ability to self-fund the massive costs required to build AI infrastructure, implies that the end is not yet here. Investors should be mindful of the risk associated with concentrated holdings, given the remarkable growth of some of these technology leaders.

Title: NVIDIA & Magnificent 7: Too Hot To Handle?

ByBill Stone, Contributor. As the dominant supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) chips, NVIDIA (NVDA) has become the largest company in the world and within the S&P 500 index. Following NVIDIA’s earnings last week, it’s an appropriate time to revisit the attractiveness of large technology stocks with a special emphasis on NVIDIA. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), collectively account for nearly 34% of the S&P 500’s market capitalization. Eight of the ten largest companies in the S&P 500 are technology companies, including Broadcom (AVGO). Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) are the only non-technology companies in the top ten. Investors already appreciate the strong fundamentals of the Magnificent 7, and NVIDIA in particular, with stock returns far outstripping those of the S&P 500. The Magnificent 7 and NVIDIA have achieved total returns of 280% and 1,093%, respectively, since the start of the ChatGPT era at the end of 2022, while the S&P 500 has returned 75%. Based on the past twelve months of earnings and consensus earnings estimates for the next twelve months, the price-to-earnings ratios for all the Magnificent 7 stocks are above the S&P 500. While this ratio indicates that most of these companies have a higher valuation on both measures, it doesn’t answer whether other factors justify that premium. Another way to value companies is by their multiple revenues, which is called the price-to-sales ratio. All the Magnificent 7 are valued at price-to-sales ratios above the S&P 500, with NVIDIA at an almost twenty-seven times price-to-sales ratio. Historical annualized growth in sales over the last three and five years has been impressive for most of the group, but downright amazing for NVIDIA. Likewise, historical earnings per share growth has generally been impressive and exceptional, as seen in cases like NVIDIA. The five-year annualized earnings per share growth rate of the Magnificent 7 demonstrates just how unique these companies have been when compared to the stock market as a whole. Future earnings are the most crucial criterion when considering whether to buy or hold a stock. Consensus forecasts from Wall Street analysts still evidence significant optimism about NVIDIA’s earnings growth prospects, with 39% annualized growth expected from the world’s largest company.

Title: Economic Digest: Nepal’s Business News in a Snap

31 August 2025 Time taken to read : 11 Minute KATHMANDU: Economic Digest offers a concise yet comprehensive overview of significant business happenings in Nepal, presented in easily digestible summaries. The recent developments in Nepal reflect a mix of economic, infrastructural, and regulatory shifts, impacting various sectors. The Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) has rebounded with a 23-point gain, signaling improved market sentiment after a period of significant losses. Meanwhile, discussions around opening the electricity trading market to private players are gaining momentum, with the aim of enhancing competition and market expansion. However, monsoon disruptions have heavily affected the country’s transportation infrastructure, blocking nine major highways and complicating travel. On the regulatory front, the Nepal Rastra Bank has tightened guidelines for banks’ Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) spending to ensure more transparent and targeted use of funds. The government is also making strides to exit the FATF grey list by presenting progress on anti-money laundering measures. At the same time, sugarcane farmers have threatened a national highway blockade over unmet demands, highlighting ongoing socio-economic issues. Additionally, Nepal’s increasing reliance on remittances, record gold prices, and developments in agricultural exports to China underscore the country’s economic dynamics. Lastly, while the life insurance sector shows strong growth, the government faces challenges in ensuring consumer protection and addressing infrastructural funding shortfalls in provinces like Karnali. NEPSE rebounds: Index gains 23 points as market sentiment improves The Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) gained 23.03 points last week, ending a recent downturn that saw a loss of over Rs 378 billion. The index opened at 2,757.97 on Sunday and closed at 2,781 on Thursday, reaching a high of 2,824.85 and a low of 2,730.74. Ten out of the 13 market sectors saw gains, with the ‘Others’ sector rising by 4.57%. Bikash Hydropower saw a surge of 60.98%, while Narayani Development Bank dropped by 44.46%. Total turnover increased by 8.38% to Rs 32.26 billion, and market capitalization grew to Rs 4.647 trillion, leading to Rs 39 billion in investor gains. Nepal explores private sector entry into electricity trading to boost competition Following a report from the government task force, discussions have begun regarding the opening of Nepal’s electricity trading market to private sector participation. Currently dominated by Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), the proposal suggests that private companies could enhance competition and expand the market. If implemented, provisions under the Electricity Act 2049 would allow private producers to sell power domestically and internationally, potentially through platforms like NepEx or direct market channels. Experts believe that private sector involvement could fast-track development and improve consumer access to affordable, high-quality electricity. Heavy rain disrupts nine major highways across Nepal Heavy rainfall has led to landslides and flooding, blocking nine key highways in Nepal, the Nepal Police reported. The affected roads include the Koshi Highway at Bhotkhola (Sankhuwasabha), the Nepal-China bridge in Rasuwa, Pasang Lhamu Highway (Rasuwa), and Arniko Highway (Sindhupalchowk). Other impacted routes are the Kaligandaki Corridor (Baglung), Beni-Darbang road (Myagdi), Jajarkot road (Rukum Paschim), Bheri Corridor (Dolpa), and Gokuleshwor-Darchula road (Darchula). Some roads, such as parts of the Mid-Hill, Prithivi, and Kaligandaki corridors, remain open for one-way traffic. Authorities continue to monitor the ongoing situation as monsoon-related disruptions affect travel across the nation. NRB tightens rules on bank CSR funds: Transparent, targeted spending now mandatory Nepal Rastra Bank has introduced new regulations to ensure that corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds are used transparently and effectively by banks and financial institutions. Banks must allocate a fixed percentage of their net profit to CSR, with at least 60% spent within the fiscal year. Institutions are required to prepare annual action plans and submit semi-annual reports detailing their CSR activities. The funds can be used to support education, health, environmental protection, financial literacy, and skill development for targeted communities. Nepal advances plan to exit FATF grey list, showcases progress in Tokyo Nepal has officially begun steps to exit the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list after being included in February due to insufficient progress in combating money laundering and terrorism financing. At the Asia-Pacific Group (APG) plenary session in Tokyo, Nepal presented updates on its quarterly action plan. The Nepali delegation, led by PM Office Secretary Phanindra Gautam and Nepal Rastra Bank Deputy Governor Dr. Neelam Dhungana Timilsina, highlighted legal reforms, improved monitoring of high-risk sectors, and new coordination mechanisms. The government remains committed to implementing reforms to secure removal from the grey list. Sugarcane farmers threaten indefinite highway blockade from September 10 Sugarcane farmers from across Nepal, who have been protesting in the capital since August 24 over subsidies and government support, have warned of an indefinite blockade along the national highway in Hariwan, Sarlahi, beginning September 10 if their demands remain unmet. Protest coordinator Shyam Babu Ray emphasized that farmers had endured harsh conditions during the sit-in, yet their calls for help had been ignored. The protest, organized by the Sugarcane Producers Federation of Nepal, opposes subsidy cuts and seeks representation in price determination. Nepalis abroad send Rs 4.72 billion daily, driving record remittance inflows Nepali migrant workers sent a record Rs 1.72 trillion home in the last fiscal year, averaging Rs 4.72 billion daily, according to Nepal Rastra Bank. This represents a 19% year-on-year increase and nearly matches the government’s annual budget. The rise in remittances is attributed to increased outmigration, stronger foreign currencies like the US dollar, and a shift from informal to formal transfer channels. While remittances help uplift households, Nepal remains heavily dependent on foreign earnings due to a sluggish domestic economy and low investment levels. Nepal social media listing standoff: Companies resist due to content control rules Nepal’s Communication Minister Prithvi Subba Gurung has criticized social media giants like Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft for refusing to register under the country’s 2080 BS social media directive. Although these companies are registered for tax purposes, they resist the government’s listing due to concerns over strict content control rules. The directive mandates the removal of content within 24 hours of complaints, which has raised fears of excessive government intervention. The Asia Internet Coalition has highlighted the challenges in enforcing fair content review, and the government has issued a seven-day ultimatum for compliance. Life insurers collect Rs 3.27B in first premiums, Shrawan 2082/83 Nepal’s life insurance sector showed strong performance in Shrawan 2082/83, with companies collectively collecting over Rs 3.27 billion in first premiums. Nepal Life Insurance led the way with Rs 103 crore, followed by National Life (Rs 42.37 crore) and Citizen Life (Rs 25.01 crore). Other top performers included Himalayan Life, SuryaJyoti Life, LIC Nepal, and IME Life, reflecting strong investor interest and sector growth. Gold smashes Rs 200,000 mark in Nepal as prices soar Gold prices soared last week, crossing the Rs 200,000 per tola threshold for the first time, driven by global market trends. Prices rose by Rs 3,100, fluctuating between Rs 197,200 and Rs 200,600 per tola. The surge was driven by US interest rate cuts, a weaker Indian rupee, and increased gold purchases by China, India, and Turkey. Analysts see gold as a safe haven asset amidst market volatility. Silver prices also rose slightly, reaching Rs 2,360 per tola. Nepal seeks Chinese flexibility to boost agricultural exports Nepal has urged China to adopt flexible customs policies to ease exports of buffalo meat, dairy products, vegetables, fruits, and herbs. During a bilateral meeting in Kathmandu, Agriculture Minister Ramnath Adhikari and Chinese Customs Deputy Minister Wang Lingjun discussed the proposal. Nepal is seeking to export thermally processed buffalo meat, ghee, butter, silage, and animal feed, and has asked for concessions on citrus fruit standards. China has acknowledged Nepal’s priority status and agreed to establish a joint trade facilitation mechanism. Currently, 34 Nepali companies export agricultural products to China. IBN approves license draft for 669 MW Lower Arun Hydropower project Investment Board Nepal (IBN) has approved the draft license for the 669 MW Lower Arun Hydropower Project at its 66th meeting, chaired by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. The board also endorsed a draft for direct investment in the Arun-3 Hydropower Project in Sankhuwasabha and authorized the issuance of a survey license for the proposed ‘Auto Service Eco-Industrial Park’ project. The decision is seen as a step toward boosting Nepal’s energy sector. Karnali’s bridge projects face funding shortfall, pushed to multi-year plan The Karnali provincial government has allocated Rs 105 million for seven motorable bridges in Rukum West, but the funds are insufficient. Officials have proposed including the projects in a multi-year plan to secure additional funding. The Infrastructure Development Office in Chaurjahari submitted the proposal to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Urban Development, warning that the bridges might remain incomplete without timely approval. The lack of bridges in key areas is disrupting local travel, schooling, and livelihoods, especially during the monsoon. KMC fines distillery after fly found in sealed Mustang Gold bottle Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) has fined Dhanusha Distillery Pvt. Ltd. Rs 200,000 after a fly was found in a sealed bottle of its Mustang Gold alcoholic beverage. The fine follows a consumer complaint and an inspection by KMC’s Agriculture and Livestock Department. The department confirmed the presence of the inedible object after lab tests. KMC also inspected several other establishments, destroying inedible oil found in four restaurants and one sweet shop.
