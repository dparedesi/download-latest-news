Sean Whelan Washington Correspondent They are at it again. It is election time in the US, so tomorrow - barely a year since Donald Trump won the presidency and Congress (just about), it is back to the voting booths for millions of Americans. Most will be voting in local elections, but there are four electoral contests that have national significance - two statewide polls that test to some extent the popularity of the president's agenda and performance, one referendum that could alter the arithmetic in Congress in next year's midterm elections, and one local election contest that tells us something about the current state of the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party has been stumbling, shellshocked and aimless, through the charred rubble of its own post-electoral hellscape and all four elections will tell us about the current state of the party. The Democrats badly need some winners, and are spending big in search of morale boosting victories. They are helped by history, with electoral records showing that the party of the president tends to lose these odd-year elections more than win them and in Donald Trump they have a president who is, shall we say, motivating? The governor's races are being held in New Jersey and Virginia with the state legislatures - House and Senate - also up for election. So it is a full on general election at state level in two prosperous north eastern states, where the Trump factor is playing a role in what is quite tight electoral arithmetic. So what it tells us about Americans' real feelings about the first year of the Trump administration is significant - because it is an actual poll not an opinion poll. But then again it is only two states, so lots of caveats apply in trying to stretch interpretations to fit a national picture. Still, they are important national political barometers, falling as they do half-way between the presidential election and the midterms - they are sort of the "midterms of the midterms". The polling information suggests the Democrats will win both governorships, and should retain control of the State House in Trenton, New Jersey's unloved capital. (On a visit to the state house some years ago I asked a staffer where was a good place to get lunch. "Pennsylvania", he replied, nodding in the direction of the river that marked the state lines). Though the Democrats' lead in the polls is not as solid as it should be in such a blue state, so the political nerds will be watching this one closest of all tomorrow’s electoral contests. The 100-seat Virginia House is also a tight affair, with the Republicans needing just three gains to take back control. However, the current government shutdown may tip sentiment against them as northern Virginia is home to the greatest concentration of federal government employees, who are either furloughed, fired or working without pay. Either way, that is a lot of unhappy voters (and a possible reason for the federal budget standoff not to be resolved before the votes are in the boxes). In both states, the Democrats have plumped for the centre ground as their battleground, the party primaries picking candidates with broad appeal to middle America. In both states, the Democrat candidates are women, both with military or intelligence service backgrounds, who got elected to the US Congress in 2018 and made a name for themselves as part of the new centrists in a party that is often defined by the rhetoric of its leftist extremities (especially by its Republican rival). Both Mikie Sherrill, a former Navy officer and helicopter pilot, and Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA officer, stood out as militantly moderate in the last several congresses. Along with another ex-CIA staffer Elissa Slotkin, they were known to some as the "mod squad", in contrast to the better known 'Squad" of left wingers, led by Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC), the New York representative. Representatives Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib back up AOC in forming the furthest left bit of the Democrats in Congress. Neither of the candidates are out to change the world - at least not in the governor’s mansions. They believe that the first rule of politics is winning elections, so both are campaigning on the things that bother ordinary Americans most - the cost of housing, food and medical care as well as the cost of everything else for that matter. The affordability crisis is their best political tailwind. For Ms Spanberger, the president’s tariffs are giving her some traction with some of Virginia’s farmers - soybean farmers in particular stretched on the rack by China in retaliation: last week's apparent deal in Korea could not have come soon enough for them. In the northern - and richest - end of the state, the Federal layoffs help motivate Democratic voters (the Pentagon, CIA headquarters at Langley and the FBI academy at Quantico just three of the vast array of government agencies in the state). The prospect of AI driven layoffs in the state's very large high tech workforce (Google and Amazon both have huge operations, nestled among the prairie-sized data centres that extend south from the Potomac River) may also help. As does the general term "chaos", used by Ms Spanberger and several other speakers at a campaign event we went to last week in Alexandria (not far from George Washington’s estate at Mount Vernon). Virginia is the only state of the old Confederacy that Donald Trump did not win in the presidential election last year (the state capital, Richmond, was also the capital of the Confederacy). The outgoing Governor, Glenn Youngkin, a successful financier with the Carlyle Group, benefitted from Joe Biden being the incumbent when his election was held. His Lieutenant Governor, Winsome Earle-Sears is running as the Republican candidate, but is not doing well with attack ads claiming she is too right wing for MAGA. Read the latest US stories Ms Earle-Sears, an immigrant from Jamaica who served in the US Marines, looks and sounds much less establishment than Ms Spanberger. That might be part of her undoing in Virginia, at least this time around. And although the Democrats attack her as MAGA, she has a Trump problem: he thinks she is a "phoney". That is because she said in 2022 that he should not run for president again. He has not backed her in this election as a result. Whatever the result, Virginia will get its first female Governor since 1776. President Trump has backed the New Jersey Republican candidate all the way from the primary that cleared the way for Jack Ciattarelli to go again, having narrowly lost in 2021. The polls indicate another narrow loss is on the cards, as the navy pilot-turned lawyer-turned moderate Democrat politician Mikie Sherrill has a narrow lead. The race has been tight enough considering New Jersey is historically a blue state, with registered Democrats outnumbering Republicans almost two to one. However, the president has inadvertently given Ms Sherrill a helping hand in one of his early responses to the government shutdown: promising to hit back against Democrat controlled states he pulled $18 billion in Federal funding from a badly needed new railway tunnel linking New Jersey with New York city. That's just enraged New Jersey commuters, some 200,000 of whom head into the Big Apple to earn their daily bread. As a result of railing against the pulled railway funding, Ms Sherrill hardly has to mention the president and his wider policies at all. The other big campaign issue is, like Ms Spanberger, the cost of living crisis. In particular, the cost of electricity for New Jerseyans, which has skyrocketed since the summer. She is promising to take a page from the president's playbook and declare a state of emergency to stop utility companies jacking up the price as rapidly as consumers (there is a deeper financing issue that defies easy soundbite politics, but that is for after the election). There are also plenty of municipal elections taking place in cities and counties across America. The big cities are the ones that count, and of the top 100 cities in the US, 27 have mayoral elections this year - eight of those jobs have already been filled. However, tomorrow sees 19 races in a list of big cities that pretty much reads like the places that have an NFL franchise in them. But only one of them is getting any attention in America. And internationally. There are many reasons why New York is exceptional, both as a city and as a concentration of media organisations with global reach. However, why should anyone outside of the Tri-State area know who the Mayor of New York city is? Be honest - do you know who the Mayor of Dublin is? Yet the name Zohran Mamdani is known everywhere. This is a testimony to the political marketing skills of the 34-year-old member of the New York State House, who shocked the Democratic Party hierarchy earlier this year when he won the party primary to become the Democratic Party Candidate for mayor. And in this heavily Democrat voting city, winning the primary is as good as winning the election itself. Not that Mr Mamdani is taking anything for granted, running a high energy campaign that has stunned many observers of what is generally regarded as conventional wisdom. The New York mayoral contest is the latest installment in the picaresque political opera that is city hall politics in Gotham. The incumbent Mayor, Eric Adams, was a Democrat until he was charged with taking a bribe from the Turkish government to facilitate planning permission for a new Turkish consulate building. He had to resign from the Democrats, but was pardoned by President Trump. He then stood for re-election as an independent. The Democrats sought a new candidate, which opened the door for the former Governor of New York State, to contest the primary. His father was also the governor, and the perception was he would cruise to the nomination. But time had passed him by - he had to resign as governor back in 2021 because of a string of allegations of inappropriate behaviour from female workers in the governors mansion. He had denied all impropriety and fought back, although acknowledging that standards of behaviour have changed over the decades. Enter Mr Mamdani from stage left. Peddling an unlikely US politics combination of pro-Palestine, far left (by US standards) ideas like free public transport, rent control, a massive public housebuilding drive and low cost childcare - all paid for by taxing the rich, he outflanked Andrew Cuomo and secured the nomination. Mr Cuomo had stood as an independent as well. Mr Trump pressed Eric Adams to drop out of the race (reportedly with offers of a job in the administration - in the meantime the former cop is onside with the Trump law and order agenda). The actual Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa, is a no hoper - the red beret wearing founder of the Guardian Angels subway patrol group has been accused by some of using the platform to promote his own talk radio show. Mr Trump would prefer if Mr Sliwa quit the race too to give Mr Cuomo a chance to become the stop the Democratic candidate. But despite financial backing from the billionaire class - including a reputed $8.5 million from former Mayor Mike Bloomberg - Mr Cuomo is struggling to cut through: not a Republican, tarnished as a Democrat, totally out of touch with the grinding daily concerns of young New Yorkers. They want someone - anyone - to do something about the cost of living in the city. Never a cheap place, prices for housing in particular are stratospheric. Affordable, available housing is the cry of young people and the modestly paid in cities all over the Western world. Especially in those successful big cities that suck in young talent from all over the globe. Their daily struggles contrast with the almost unbelievable wealth of the mega-rich in Manhattan, and their well-heeled servants on Wall Street. So Mr Mamdani - a proudly proclaimed "democratic socialist", is on track to be the mayor of the world’s most capitalist city. A Muslim, he is outspoken on Palestine and in his criticism of Israel and is winning in the city with the most Jews in the world other than Tel Aviv. As French philosopher and public intellectual Bernard-Henri Lévy wrote of the apparent success of someone who does not give wholehearted support to the state of Israel in the Wall Street Journal at the weekend : "If New York falls, the entire free world may again totter on its foundations." Which may explain why there is so much attention on this particular mayor's race. What does it tell us about the Democratic Party? Is the Mamdani way the new way for the Democrats to win? Probably not. What works in New York will not work in New Mexico but it could further bolster the far left as a faction in the party. Success for Mr Mamdani could encourage AOC to have a go at current Democrat Senate leader Chuck Schumer, who faces a primary vote ahead of next year's midterms, when his seat is up for election again. If 36-year-old AOC replaced the 74-year-old, it would position her to be the leading left wing voice in the Senate, leaving 83-year-old Senator Bernie Sanders free to contemplate slowing down a bit (Mr Sanders is the only politician apart from the president who can pretty well expect to fill stadium-sized speaking engagements around the country: he has been on a nationwide speaking tour with AOC). Mr Trump of course is playing his part, calling Mr Mamdani a communist, and threatening to cut off federal money to the city. Mr Cuomo isn’t throwing in the towel just yet either, placing hope in older voters coming out to vote and younger voters doing anything except voting. So the Democrats could come out of the election looking like they have over the past few years - split. The likely victories for moderates in the governor elections balance the likely victory of Mr Mamdani in the mayor's race. Winning, but not setting a decisive course for the party in the years ahead: the Democratic Party brand is still up for grabs. Of course in real politics, governors are way more important than mayors - they even have their own armies in the form of the National Guard. Mr Mamdani only has the NYPD - a force he has a tetchy relationship with and being seen as soft on crime is a serious impediment for many Democratic Party politicians around the country. And while neither Virginia nor New Jersey could be described a national bellwethers - places that mimic the characteristics of the typical American community - their farmland and endless suburbs are a lot more representative than New York City, a place which is quintessentially urban and mentally closer to European style social democracy than anywhere else in America. It is absolutely atypical. So beware the Mr Mamdani hype when it comes to prognostications about the future of the Democratic party. The biggest lesson for the party establishment is not a new one either: beware of the primary elections - the ones where only the hard core party activists come out to vote (the same is true on the Republican side, hence the MAGA capture of that party). As for the fourth electoral test, this is a referendum in California to authorise a Gerrymander to give the Democrats more seats in next year's midterm elections to the US House of Representatives. The referendum on Proposition 50, to be correct about it, was called by Democratic Party Governor Gavin Newsom. He wants to do a Gerrymander in this already heavily Democrat voting state to bring about the near obliteration of the Republican Party representation in the lower house of Congress. Why? Because Texas Governor Greg Abbott is doing a Gerrymander in Texas to slash the number of Democrat seats and boost the number of Republicans the Lone Star state sends to DC. Other Republican led states are also looking at Gerrymandering the maps ahead of next year's primaries - a normal practice here ever since Governor Elbridge Gerry signed off on the first dodgy redistricting in Massachusetts in 1812 (the local rag, the Boston Gazette, ran a cartoon with Gerry's face drawn onto a Salamander, dubbing the slimy creature a Gerrymander - boy did that one stick!). The California Gerrymander is controversial - not just because it could see the 39% vote share the Republicans get in America's most populous state translate into just four seats out of the 52 that California gets in the House of Representatives (down from nine at the moment). The former Republican governor of California and movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger has been back on TV shows in recent weeks arguing voters should terminate Prop 50 on grounds of democracy. As governor he brought in the law that Prop 50 is supposed to overthrow - having an independent electoral commission draw up the electoral maps, not highly partisan politicians. But with Republicans going into next year's midterm congressional elections with the narrowest majority in the House in a hundred years, they are scrambling to counteract the normal drop of 20 seats that all incumbent ruling parties seem to face at midterms. That would see control of the House pass to the Democrats, throwing a big spanner in the legislative works of the Trump administration - hence the rush to get as much done before November of next year. So yes, these are local elections. It is not about Trump. It is all about Trump. Washington Correspondent © RTÉ 2025.

Title: The ethos of the Dublin Six: ‘Classic, timeless pieces that are not going to date’

Irish fashion designers are discovering the advantages of collaboration. It’s what brought the Dublin Six – Jennifer Slattery, Ros Duke Knitwear, Freya Oatway of FAO Millinery, Caoimhe Grant of August Night, Gemma O’Leary of Inner Island and Amy Cahill of Oxmantown Skincare – together to create and style autumn-winter looks combining their respective talents in daywear, hats, jewellery, bags and body products. Their recent show in the restored Dublin’s Civic Trust building, sharing costs of the location, models and make-up, was an exercise in how, in an ever-demanding environment, co-operation and partnership can deliver results. It all began with Slattery and Duke discussing ways they could do a performance with other designers. Duke and Grant had worked together at John Rocha. The venue became a showcase “for our vision and shared ethos”, Grant says, “a one-stop shop where customers could buy”. Their catwalk show, Gathered Forms, after a collection specially designed for the occasion by Gemma O’Leary of Inner Island, was accompanied with music by Megan Nic Ruairí from northwest Donegal. “We wanted to bring some quietness and reflectiveness to our collections because everything is so fast paced. It’s about community over competitiveness and supporting each other. Every piece had a sculptural element to it inspired by art and nature,” Grant says. So who is the customer for the Dublin Six? “It’s the person who loves to support Irish design and who takes her time to choose,” Grant says. “She’s not into trends, preferring classic, timeless pieces that are not going to date, but is still interested in fashion. They are all easy pieces that come together well.” What such collaborations need and deserve is a bigger Irish design shop or location – a rotating space in which everyone has a chance to showcase their work. Such a venue would be a destination for both locals and tourists, creating awareness and visibility of the vibrant Irish fashion scene, which was evident last month at Dublin Independent Fashion Week – notably Ríon Hannora’s Sex Before Marriage bridal collection, Pellador showing womenswear for the first time, Conor O’Brien’s Phantom Thread collection, and Mihai Mar’s knitwear, alongside outstanding collections from Rashiid and the completely self-funded Caolum McCabe show at Henrietta Street. Both Slattery and Duke have had pop-ups recently in Kildare Village and are planning Christmas events in Slattery’s Smithfield shop in December. augustnight.ie, jenniferslattery.com, faomillinery.com, oxmantownskincare.ie, rosduke.com, innerisland.ie Ros Duke and August Night are both stocked in Emporium Kalu in Naas, Co Kildare; Jennifer Slattery in Slow Street in Blackrock, Co Dublin; August Night in Khan in Blackrock, Beo Wellness in Lahinch and Ennis, Co Clare; and Ellen B in Clontarf, Dublin; Oxmantown Skincare in Irish Design Shop in Dublin 2 and Project 29 in Stoneybatter, Dublin 7.

Title: Target layoffs hit almost all corners of the business, from merchants to engineers

Join us Dec. 1-3 in New Orleans for the Digiday Programmatic Marketing Summit The story was first published by Digiday sibling Modern Retail Target’s widespread corporate layoffs this week trimmed down teams throughout the company, leaving some who remain picking up responsibilities from those affected. The layoffs included employees spanning across engineering, product design, analytics, guest experience, creative, strategy, merchandising, HR, operations and legal, according to a Modern Retail analysis of around 60 posts from Target employees who posted on LinkedIn this week looking for work, as well as posts from remaining employees. Employees of the Minneapolis-based retailer were informed Tuesday whether or not their positions had been affected. The company decided to cut around 1,000 team members and to not fill an additional 800 open roles, a Target spokesperson confirmed to Modern Retail. Those impacted will continue to receive pay and benefits until Jan. 3, in addition to severance packages. The move is expected to have a noticeable impact on the workloads and sentiment of those who remain with the company. It will also leave hundreds of people — some had been with the company for decades — without work at the tail end of an economically challenging year. Now, Target faces the tall task of rebuilding morale at a time when the company has faced macroeconomic and geopolitical hurdles, criticism over its pullback of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, several underwhelming quarters, and an expectation of a low-single digit decline in sales this fiscal year. The Target spokesperson said the change impacted leadership roles at about three times the rate of individual contributors. Minneapolis was home to many of the affected workers, though some in other cities and in India were also laid off. No roles in stores or warehouses were affected, the spokesperson said. The spokesperson declined to share exact numbers on how many employees in each city lost their jobs, though the company filed two Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) letters with the state of Minnesota detailing at least 500 jobs lost in downtown Minneapolis and 287 at its Brooklyn Park offices. Just a few examples of the 1,000 people leaving the company, according to their profiles, include a senior product manager who had worked on collaboration tools for employees; a product development scientist who had worked on pet and health products; recruiters who helped staff distribution centers; and a private-label portfolio manager who previously worked as a buyer of products aimed at LGBTQIA+ consumers. A deluge of LinkedIn posts in the days following the announcements underscored how widespread the layoffs were, and how deeply it cut to the core of a tight-knit business community. Target is one of the largest employers in the state of Minnesota, with a large network of alumni in the area. Remaining workers hyped up their now former colleagues and lamented what the layoffs would do to their workloads, while some people who were impacted during Target’s last mass round of layoffs in 2015 gave advice to this new round of job seekers. “There’s this strange mix of gratitude and heaviness that comes with staying while others go,” Camilo Zapata, a senior manager of site merchandising for beauty who is remaining with the company, wrote on LinkedIn. “For those of us still here, the road ahead will bring new challenges, bigger scopes, and the responsibility to rebuild stability for our teams.” Leaders at the company wrote about how they had lost key support figures on their teams. “You can’t downsize this hard and willy-nilly without that work being pushed on others,” one laid-off employee told Modern Retail on the condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation. “My sister teams are really upset I was let go, as well as [further] teams I partnered with.” Similarly, Shelbi Craig, senior market research and insights analyst for Roundel, Target’s retail media business, wrote on LinkedIn about two analysts on her team who lost their jobs. One had only been there for a few months, and the other had been in her role for more than two years. “Losing two people who directly supported my work is a huge shift,” Craig wrote. “I’m deeply grateful to still have a job and a steady income in such a challenging job market, but I also feel the weight of what this means — both for those who are facing uncertainty and for those of us feeling the ripple effects of losing close teammates.” A Target spokesperson said the company did not pursue the layoffs to cut costs and instead meant to create a more agile organization that can make faster decisions. “The complexity we’ve created over time has been holding us back,” Michael Fiddelke, Target’s chief operating officer and incoming CEO, told employees in an email the company provided to Modern Retail. “Too many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life.” However, Truist analyst Scot Ciccarelli estimated that the savings from the cuts could come in at around $90 million to $100 million, according to MarketWatch. To be sure, this was based on salaries from Glassdoor and Salary.com that said the average Target corporate salary ran around $90,000 to $100,000. Bryan Gildenberg, founder and CEO of Confluencer Commerce — who has been monitoring retail companies for decades — said moving to not fill whichever jobs are open is typically a cost-cutting measure rather than one of boosting efficiency. He believes this could be a move to simply improve the company’s financial picture after several underwhelming quarters. “You’re not going to get the most strategic force reduction if you’re just simply trying to not hire jobs that are unhired,” Gildenberg said. “I understand what Target’s trying to say, which is that we are trying to get faster and leaner and this is a way to do that, but it also is reasonably obvious that Target’s got economic pressures on it that it needs to sort out.” In an analyst note, David Bellinger, a director and senior analyst for Mizuho Securities who covers consumer and e-commerce companies, said his firm expects more restructuring activity from Target in the months following the busy holiday period. He said the move is “a difficult first of many steps as [Target] moves from its mediocre era into its turnaround era.” “Adjusting our structure is one part of the work ahead of us,” Fiddelke wrote in his message to staff, then alluding to the same three goals he outlined in August after being named the company’s next CEO. “It will also require new behaviors and sharper priorities that strengthen our retail leadership in style and design and enable faster execution so we can lead with merchandising authority; elevate the guest experience with every interaction; and accelerate technology to enable our team and delight our guests.” Over the coming months, the layoffs will release hundreds of Target employees, largely based in Minneapolis, into the job market. Target is not the only major employer making major changes that impact the region. Paul DeBettignies, founder of Launch Hiring, said he has also spoken with Minneapolis-area workers who were just let go from Amazon and agriculture company Cargill this week. “I’m concerned about the already unemployed folks,” he said. “It just does not help having another pool of — I don’t like to use the word competition, but it’s what it is.” Ted Chalupsky, founder and CEO of The Right Staff, a staffing and recruiting company in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, said his firm is now starting to hear from Target workers who have been laid off and expects to hear from more in the coming weeks. He said that while it’s never a good time to lose a position, he thinks those who have been laid off this month are in a better boat than they would have been had they been in the market a year or two ago. “We’re seeing the job market starting to pick up again,” Chalupsky said, adding that federal interest rate cuts and increased clarity around tariffs have helped make employers more optimistic. “The word that we’re getting back, just in general, from our clientele is that we’re going to see a pickup in hiring over the next two quarters in this market.” Chalupsky said that in 2015, when Target laid off 1,700 people and left 1,400 positions unfilled, many ended up at smaller or mid-sized companies in the region instead of large corporations. He expects the same trend within this round of layoffs. “They ended up actually in better positions,” Chalupsky said. “Many comments that we heard back from these different candidates [were] basically, ‘Gee, if I’d known about this company or this opportunity, I probably would have made this move a long time ago.’” The layoffs come after Target in September began requiring workers to return to its headquarters office three days a week. For some, that means they had to move or at least adopt new routines shortly before being laid off. “As a citizen in the region, I’m kind of annoyed that they would have brought everybody back after Labor Day, and then now have done this,” DeBettignies said. He added that he expects these changes, combined with the controversy around the DEI pullback, to depress worker sentiment at the company and lead to additional departures once the job market heats up a bit more. “I wonder what [Target’s] Glassdoor is going to look like in about 60 days,” DeBettignies said. “It’s not going to be pretty.” Beyond driving immediate sales, brands this year are angling to get into gift guides to help them with SEO and GEO.

That moment when you get out of the surf, you just feel alive and you feel better for the experience, and it’s a very Australian thing and you feel ready to conquer the day. Transcription (Edited): Darren: Hi, I’m Darren Woolley, founder and CEO of TrinityP3 Marketing Management Consultancy, and welcome to Managing Marketing, a weekly podcast discussing the issues and opportunities facing marketing, media, and advertising with industry thought leaders. If you’re enjoying the podcast, please like, review, or share this episode. To be the marketing leader for a major successful consumer packaged goods brand is one thing, but to oversee a portfolio of high-profile, well-loved brands—almost cultural signposts in the market, with decades of prominence—is a major challenge. How do you honor that tradition while nurturing these brands through changes in consumer dietary needs and habits? My guest today has taken on such a challenge at Bega Group. Please welcome the Executive General Manager at Bega Group, Darryn Wallace. Welcome, Darryn. Darryn: Hello, Darren, and thank you for having me. It’s a pleasure to join your podcast today. Career Evolution in Iconic CPG Brands Darren: It’s great catching up. We met when you were at Cadbury, and I’ve followed your career as you’ve built expertise in CPG, beverages, and most recently, dairy. How did you get here? Darryn: I got into consumer goods by chance. I joined Cadbury Schweppes as a graduate in the finance team, which gave me two or three years of grounding in how a business works. I was fortunate to join a company that invested in management experience and learning. I was able to weave my way through many roles, eventually becoming the general manager of marketing at Cadbury, applying the trade to growing great brands. I’ve always had a passion for creating products that the Australian public can love. I’ve zigzagged across categories: confectionery and beverage, and for the last 10 years, dairy, juice, spreads, and staples like Vegemite, Bega Peanut Butter, and Super-Duper ice creams. I’ve been fortunate to work on iconic local brands, but also global brands like Pepsi, Gatorade, and Red Bull. Darren: The portfolio you now manage includes what I call “passion brands.” Vegemite is a cultural signpost. Dairy Farmers, Daily Juice, Pura, and Bega are staples. It must be interesting to apply your global and local experience to these cultural icons. Darryn: If you think about it too long, you can be intimidated. Brands like Farmers Union Greek yogurt (1888), Bega (1899), and Dairy Farmers (1900) are in their third century. You feel a great sense of responsibility and accountability to ensure they remain relevant for today and the next generation. I find it exciting to shape brands with such established heritage and personality to make them modern. The Bega Group is one of the largest agricultural businesses listed on the ASX. We are Australian-owned and local. The ability to be empowered and manage these brands using our local team, local insights, science, and technology is incredibly rewarding. Local Ownership and Relationships in the Dairy Sector Darren: The heavy emphasis on dairy is interesting. Dairy was traditionally connected to the farm, often through co-ops, before corporatization. The industry seems to benefit significantly from local ownership. Darryn: It does. My first impression was that it’s a business of relationships. We run personalized relationships with over 800 farmers across the country who are critical to our success. The market was regulated for a long time, so brands like Big M in Victoria and Masters Milk in West Australia have deep history in their local communities, creating high levels of trust and loyalty. Dairy is an “always on” business. With short shelf-life products, you’re fighting for distribution every day. Our ability to service the market relies on deep relationships because we’re running seven days a week, 52 weeks a year. CPG/FMCG as the Ideal Marketing Training Ground Darren: Many marketers say starting a career in CPG/FMCG is one of the best ways to get hands-on training in the full skillset of marketing. Teams work across product, packaging, pricing, and distribution. Do you feel this comprehensive training is important? Darryn: One hundred percent. I was fortunate to join Cadbury Schweppes when it was integrating businesses, giving it a broad portfolio. As a local business, we had the autonomy to influence what products we made, how we marketed them, where we sold them, and how we priced and promoted them. Cadbury also invested heavily in people, providing training in core marketing disciplines and executive skills like managing change and acquisitions. This comprehensive training has changed over the last 10 years due to globalization. But one of the joys of working with the Bega Group is that we are a local business, which retains the ability to steward brands through a great local team with autonomy over brands and customer relationships. Darren: In global organizations, there’s often more siloing. A strength of CPG/FMCG is a clear understanding of the role of sales to customers (securing pricing and distribution) and marketing to consumers (driving demand) working hand-in-hand—the basis of the Four Ps. Darryn: I have a philosophy I call “removing alibis”—getting rid of excuses so the team can do their best work. Accountability is high. You have to develop the right product with the right insights, explain it to the customer so they stock it, have it come off the shelf, and ensure the consumer likes it enough to buy it again. You learn through doing, and you have no one else to blame. The ability for all technical and specialist functions to work in concert makes the difference. Darren: I find the talk that the generalist is no longer needed overlooks dealing with complexity. While you have specialists (the vertical of the ‘T’ capability), you still need someone with an overview to bring it all together (the horizontal of the ‘T’). Darryn: I grew up in a world that prioritized getting the product right and ensuring availability before promotion or advertising. That generalized capability is really important—knowing which dots to join up. I’m highly dependent on the team and the new skills they bring. I didn’t grow up in the e-commerce era, where for some categories, a third of sales are consumed online. The ability to blend that breadth of knowledge and experience with the art needed in each discipline is key. Product Trends and E-commerce in a Portfolio Strategy Darren: Thirty percent of sales through e-commerce is significant. While people focus on performance media in e-commerce, brand has never been more important. Also, customer experience of the brand has become more important than just the messaging. Darryn: We all shop with our eyes. In a digital environment, products need to “pop off the page and say, ‘Purchase me.'” For food or beverage, it’s the appetite appeal of the images, the relevant words, and being in the right place on the digital shelf. All these disciplines are still focused on making sure we stand out in the most compelling way. We have a large portfolio—more than 30 brands. To manage this, we prioritize eight “power brands” that are market leaders, bring a clear point of difference, and represent over three quarters of our profit. We look after the base and prioritize those eight to make them relevant and future-proof. Darren: Let’s focus on dairy trends. Dairy is ancient, yet we see trends like high fat, low fat, and now high protein. How do you determine whether a trend is a short-term fad or worth tapping into? Darryn: Protein is nearly a mega-trend right now, driven partly by a consequence of COVID. People of all ages are proactively attuned to their health and well-being, consciously focusing on macronutrients. Darren: The focus on longevity and the switch against sugar and carbohydrates have replaced the old low-fat focus, which often relied on corn syrup or high sugar to replace texture. This is now replaced by the need for high protein. Darryn: Flavored milk has taken the next leap. Dairy is a great source of protein, so we can now offer a drink with 30 grams of protein, no added sugar, and reduced fat milk. It brings all the macronutrients of dairy—hydration, calcium, B vitamins, and protein—at a low calorific value. This has become a convenient, enjoyable, and affordable meal replacement. We are seeing the advancement of functionality in dairy. pouch yogurt continues to grow because of its convenience and ease of consumption, with many offering 15 grams of protein. Distribution, Pricing, and the “Always On” Operation Darren: Let’s talk about distribution. I initially thought of your brands as supermarket grocery, but dairy drinks are in every convenience store and servo, plus 30% online. Darryn: I’ve really enjoyed the breadth of customer or channel in dairy. For yogurt, we sell through traditional supermarkets, bulk discounters (Costco, Aldi), online, petrol stations (7-Eleven), health and aged care, and QSR (McDonald’s Happy Meals). Back-of-house yogurt and cream go into most restaurants and cafes. We serve a diverse customer base, so understanding the right offers, pack sizes, and pricing equations for each is vital. Packaging serves multiple roles: providing the correct serve size and representing the brand as a trust mark. Darren: On pricing, the cost-of-living crisis has seen prices on essentials increase significantly, driven by whole supply chain issues, especially energy. Darryn: Inflation has been a real challenge for the Australian public, and dairy has been at the heart of it. We’ve had environmental issues impacting the cost to produce milk, as well as rising costs for transport, ingredients, and packaging. Dairy is a low-margin category, so our focus is productivity first, then pricing to offset costs after all productivity measures. We are deliberate about what price to take, on which products, and how it aligns with household affordability. The last few years have been challenging because you don’t want to take a price that causes consumers to reappraise your brand. Darren: With the short shelf-life of fresh white milk (18 to 20 days is the shortest), there’s little time to move the product from farm to consumption. You’re constantly trying to build a business model that’s efficient and without disruption. This makes it a seven-day-a-week operation—you constantly have to move. Brand Promotion and Distinctive Advertising Darren: For the agencies listening, let’s get onto promotion. You have brands with decades of positioning. What’s your philosophy or approach to advertising for building these brands? Darryn: It’s changed slightly in the last 10 years. We probably don’t invest enough, but where we do, we aim to be noticed and distinctive, leveraging existing assets and fame. For Dairy Farmers, the traditional ad would have shown the farmer, cows, and rolling paddocks, focusing on purity. Our most recent ad shows a cow surfing on a surfboard with people eating different Dairy Farmers products. We are trying to bring more personality and emotion to the advertising and move away from stereotypes. We wanted to capture the emotion of feeling alive and ready to conquer the day. Our advertising is about being brave to do something different. The message, “start the day with oomph,” brings distinctiveness and works well across all aspects of the brand. To me, staying modern, bringing personality to life, and capturing the emotion is the key to building loyalty. Darren: Absolutely. The heritage was good for its time, but being much more consumer-focused—answering the question “what’s in it for me?”—is really important, and your approach does that. Darryn, time has run away from us. It’s been an absolute pleasure, and thank you so much for sharing what you’re doing at Bega Group. Darryn: No, I thank you for being able to spend this time. Hopefully, there are a few nuggets for your listeners to take out of our conversation.

Darren: Hi, I’m Darren Woolley, founder and CEO of TrinityP3 Marketing Management Consultancy, and welcome to Managing Marketing, a weekly podcast discussing the issues and opportunities facing marketing, media, and advertising with industry thought leaders. If you’re enjoying the podcast, please like, review, or share this episode. To be the marketing leader for a major successful consumer packaged goods brand is one thing, but to oversee a portfolio of high-profile, well-loved brands—almost cultural signposts in the market, with decades of prominence—is a major challenge. How do you honor that tradition while nurturing these brands through changes in consumer dietary needs and habits? My guest today has taken on such a challenge at Bega Group. Please welcome the Executive General Manager at Bega Group, Darryn Wallace. Welcome, Darryn. Darryn: Hello, Darren, and thank you for having me. It’s a pleasure to join your podcast today. Darren: It’s great catching up. We met when you were at Cadbury, and I’ve followed your career as you’ve built expertise in CPG, beverages, and most recently, dairy. How did you get here? Darryn: I got into consumer goods by chance. I joined Cadbury Schweppes as a graduate in the finance team, which gave me two or three years of grounding in how a business works. I was fortunate to join a company that invested in management experience and learning. I was able to weave my way through many roles, eventually becoming the general manager of marketing at Cadbury, applying the trade to growing great brands. I’ve always had a passion for creating products that the Australian public can love. I’ve zigzagged across categories: confectionery and beverage, and for the last 10 years, dairy, juice, spreads, and staples like Vegemite, Bega Peanut Butter, and Super-Duper ice creams. I’ve been fortunate to work on iconic local brands, but also global brands like Pepsi, Gatorade, and Red Bull. Darren: The portfolio you now manage includes what I call “passion brands.” Vegemite is a cultural signpost. Dairy Farmers, Daily Juice, Pura, and Bega are staples. It must be interesting to apply your global and local experience to these cultural icons. Darryn: If you think about it too long, you can be intimidated. Brands like Farmers Union Greek yogurt (1888), Bega (1899), and Dairy Farmers (1900) are in their third century. You feel a great sense of responsibility and accountability to ensure they remain relevant for today and the next generation. I find it exciting to shape brands with such established heritage and personality to make them modern. The Bega Group is one of the largest agricultural businesses listed on the ASX. We are Australian-owned and local. The ability to be empowered and manage these brands using our local team, local insights, science, and technology is incredibly rewarding.

Watch CBS News November 2, 2025 / 7:32 PM EST / CBS News Editor's note: On October 31, 2025, correspondent Norah O'Donnell spoke with President Donald J. Trump at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, FL, and this is a transcript of that conversation. They started by discussing the president's recent meeting with China's President Xi Jinping. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, first of all, we get along great, and we always really have. We had the COVID moment, which was not-- attractive as far as I was concerned. I wasn't so happy. But outside of that, we have always had a great relationship. He's a powerful man. He's a strong man, a very powerful leader. And-- we've always-- had the best of relationships, probably the best of-- I could-- I think I could speak for him, just about as good as it gets from his standpoint and from my standpoint. And having that is important because of the power of the two countries. NORAH O'DONNELL: What did you get out of this deal that you wanted? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I got sort of everything that we wanted. We got-- no rare earth threat. That's gone, completely gone. We have tremendous amounts of-- dollars pouring in-- 'cause we have-- very big tariffs, almost 50%. We never had anything in terms of tariffs, although I put tariffs on China, but Biden let it lapsed by the-- by the fact that he gave exemptions on almost everything, which was just ridiculous. But-- we have-- billions and billions of dollars coming in, and we have a very good relationship. I mean, we have-- a great relationship with a powerful country. And I've always felt if we can make deals that are good, it's better to get along with China than not, if you can't make the right kind of a deal than not, because, you know, China, along with many other countries (they're not alone in this), they've ripped us off from day one. They've ripped us so much. They've taken trillions of dollars out of our country. And now they're-- it's the opposite. I mean, we're doing very well with China, and hopefully they're gonna do very well with us. But I do think it's important that China and the U.S. get along, and we get along very well at the top. NORAH O'DONNELL: This trade war, though, was hurting Americans. I mean, our soybean farmers. China had stopped buying the soybeans. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. NORAH O'DONNELL: As you mentioned, they were-- China was withholding these rare earth materials that you need for everything from smartphones to-- to build submarines. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: What-- what was the crucial thing? I mean, how tough of a negotiatior-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, when you say hurting-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --is President Xi-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --it was a temporary hurt. It was a hurt because-- I was takin' in a lot of money from China. We're doing very well against China. And all of a sudden they said, "You know, we have to fight back." And so they used their powers. The power they have is rare earth because of the fact that they've been accumulating it and-- and really taking care of it for a period of 25, 30 years. Other countries haven't. Now we are. I mean, we have tremendous rare earth, and it's going to be-- you know, it's going to be-- it'll be a strength, but it won't really be a strength if everybody has it. Everyone's gonna have it pretty soon. And they were doing it-- on a singular basis. Now-- they use that against us, and we used other things against them. For instance, airplane parts. That's a big deal. They have-- hundreds of Boeing airplanes. We wouldn't give them parts. We were both acting-- maybe a little bit irrationally, but the big thing we had was tariffs ultimately. I said, "Look, if you don't open up, then what we're gonna do is we're gonna impose a hundred percent tariff over and above what you're already paying." And as soon as I said that, they came to the table. We met in South Korea, as you saw, right? A lot of people watched. And-- we made a really good deal. And it was good for them also, I hope. I mean, I want 'em to be good for both sides, but-- we'll be takin' in hundreds of billions of dollars-- in the form of tariffs. You know, tariffs are incredible, because they really give us great national security. As an example-- when they pulled the rare earth on us and the rest of the world, if we didn't have tariffs to fight back, I-- I immediately instituted a 100% tariff over and above what they were already paying. And when I did that, they immediately came to the table. Without tariffs, we would not have had that privilege. We would have-- not have had that right. Tariffs give us national security and great wealth. NORAH O'DONNELL: You talked about those rare earth minerals. Of course-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. NORAH O'DONNELL: --I-- my understanding is about 90% of them come from China. That's their-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Right now. NORAH O'DONNELL: Yeah-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But within a short period of time-- we'll have everything we need for ourselves. You know, we've instituted an emergency program, and we will have-- within a year from now to a year and a half, we'll have everything we need, no matter what kind of a threat is being-- NORAH O'DONNELL: How? How do we do that? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Because we've taken over. First of all, you saw the partnerships w-- we've established with Japan, with Australia, with U.K., w-- with just about everybody, frankly. And we're all doing it together. You know, this wasn't a threat against the United States. This was really a threat against the world. So the w-- whole world has come together, I think, at our behest. And rare earths, in-- within two years, rare earths will cea-- really cease to be a problem. NORAH O'DONNELL: The one thing that China wants but it doesn't have is the world's most advanced semiconductors. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's right. NORAH O'DONNELL: That's what the United States has. Will you-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Chips in particular. NORAH O'DONNELL: Chips. That's right-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. NORAH O'DONNELL: Will you allow the chip maker, Nvidia, to sell their most advanced chips to China-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. No, we won't do that. But-- NORAH O'DONNELL: It's not on the table at all? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --we will let them-- deal with Nvidia. Nvidia's the prime-- company in the world for that. And we will let them deal with Nvidia but not in terms of the most advanced. The most advanced, we will not let anybody have them other than the United States. NORAH O'DONNELL: Because then they would win the AI race. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, they wouldn't win it necessarily, but they would certainly have-- an equal advantage. Right now we're winning it because we're producing electricity like never before by allowing the companies to make their own electricity, which was my idea, which nobody, frankly, had thought of. These massive plants that are being built are building their own electric generating plants along with the plant itself. And that gives them all the electric they need without going to an old grid that's, you know, 150 years old. And-- they're makin' it-- themselves, and then they're selling back any excess electricity into the grid, so we benefit in all ways. But most importantly, it allows the c-- the companies to go immediately forward. We're getting-- approvals done in two and three weeks. It used to take 20 years. And we are leading the AI race right now by a lot. We are leading it by numbers that people have no idea. It's been-- it's been really great. We've been very, very far-reaching for it-- th-- look, that's the new internet. That's the new everything all put together. The AI race is a big deal. NORAH O'DONNELL: Mr. President, you just negotiated this one-year trade deal with China-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yep. NORAH O'DONNELL: But as you know, the Chinese, they think in a hundred years. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: They play the long game, including on our own soil. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We play the long game too. NORAH O'DONNELL: Our own intelligence agencies say the Chinese have infiltrated parts of the American power grid and our water systems. They steal American intellectual property and Americans' personal information. They bought American farmland. How big of a threat is China? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's like everybody else. We're a threat to them too. Many of the things that you say, we do to them. Look, this is a very competitive world, especially when it comes to China and the U.S. And-- we're always watching them, and they're always watching us. In the meantime, I think we get along very well, and I think it's-- I think we can be bigger, better, and stronger by working with them as opposed to just-- knocking them out-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Hmm. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --of the economy. They can produce things that we don't want to produce because it's not really worth our while-- making-- undergarments, makin' this-- you know, certain things. We don't want to do that, and we can buy them inexpensively from other places in the world while we can lead the world in AI, and chips, and lots of other things. Within-- two years from now, we'll have 40% or 50% of the chip market. What's happening here, the biggest companies are leaving Taiwan. They're coming into the United States because of tariffs. If we didn't have tariffs, they wouldn't be doing it because-- NORAH O'DONNELL: In how many years? You think we'll be producing-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think in two years, we'll start opening up plants and we'll have a very substantial portion of the chip market. Right now we have almost none. We should have had a hundred percent. If we had par-- if we had presidents that knew anything about business or knew what they were doing, because, frankly, they didn't. We lost 50% of our automobile business. It's all coming back. We lost a hundred percent of the chip-- you know, it used to be all Intel and other companies. And what happened is other countries came in, and they stole our chip business, and we didn't charge tariffs. If we would have charged let's say a 100% tariff, none of those companies would have left. But they all left. Now they're all coming back, Norah, because the only way they avoid the tariffs is to build in our country. If they build in our country, make their plant and make their product in our country, then it's a very simple thing. They-- they don't have any tariff to pay. NORAH O'DONNELL: Uh-huh. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And that's what they want to do. And so instead of charging somebody a 100% tariff and you can make your product outside, they come in, and they make-- and this is why we have $17 trillion being invested in the United States right now. By the time it-- it-- just to show you how big that is, it's the biggest in history by many times. No other country's been any-- seen anything like it. The Biden administration in four years did less than a trillion. We have 17 trillion-- more than $17 trillion right now, and I'm in my ninth month. By the time we finish up, I think we're gonna have over $20 trillion invested in the United States or to be invested in the United States-- NORAH O'DONNELL: How will that trickle down to the average worker? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Because of jobs, because they're building plants. W-- we're bringing back the auto industry into our country. We lost 58% of the automobile manufacturing business to other countries. You know, we used to be the king of automobile and automobile manufacturing, and now we're not really the king anymore, you know? Within a year and a half, two years, we're gonna be the king again. We're gonna-- the-- the-- as an example, I was also in Japan, as you know, and South Korea. We had-- the biggest Japanese companies are investing billions of dollars in building auto plants in the United States. If I weren't elected-- if I weren't elected, we would be losing all of these jobs. We would be losing far more of the auto industry. We would be nowhere in chips. Our country would have been bankrupt, and we would have had a bigger welfare roll. They would have expanded welfare and forgotten about everything else. Now we're building a country that's gonna be so strong, I don't know if you saw the last numbers in terms of employment. They're all non-government jobs. Not just government. Government jobs are easy. I could-- I could immediately inc-- do anything I want with government jobs. I'd just say, "We're gonna add up-- we're gonna add on a million government jobs," and you're gonna say, "Oh, what wonderful numbers." They don't mean anything. We are building jobs at a level that nobody's ever seen before. But when all of these plants that are currently under construction and to be under construction, when they open, we're gonna have an economy like our country has never seen before, the strongest economy in the world. We're doing very well. By the way, the stock market just hit-- perfect timing for your show, just hit an all-time high. It's hit an all-time high 48 times during the course of my-- nine-month period. But just yesterday, the stock market hit an all-time high. We're doing really well, and everybody knows it-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I ask-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Let's put it this way-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I-- can I ask you-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The smart people know it. NORAH O'DONNELL: Uh-huh. Can I ask you, Mr. President-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The smart people definitely-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --on that point, though? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. NORAH O'DONNELL: When the stock market is doing well, that doesn't affect everybody. Not everybody's invested in the stock market-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It does. Oh, it does, it does. NORAH O'DONNELL: But there have been-- grocery prices are up-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Look, 401(k)s. People have 401(k)s. Their 401(k)s are double what they were a year ago. NORAH O'DONNELL: Uh-huh. But for people that don't have 401(k)s, who are not invested in the stock market-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. But-- but-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --they've seen their grocery prices go up, inflation-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, you're wrong. They went up under Biden. Right now they're going down. Other than beef, which we're working on, which we can solve very quickly. So the beef-- the ranchers have really taken a drubbing over a 30-year period. Because of what I've done, the ranchers have done well. But with that, the beef price went up a little bit. We're gonna get the beef price down very quickly. It'll be very nice, just like eggs. When I first took over, eggs were double, triple, quadruple what they were. This was because of Biden. All of these problems were caused by Biden, whether it's-- the people that came into our country through jails. I mean, they were released from jails. They were lease-- released from mental institutions into our country. These problems are caused by Biden. We had an open border. Now we have a border that's, as you know, absolutely shut other than-- NORAH O'DONNELL: How-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --people are allowed to come into our country, but they have to come in legally. NORAH O'DONNELL: I do want to talk about immigration and some other- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: --domestic issues. But just-- if we could stay on China for just a moment-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: One potential flash point with China, probably the potential flash point with China in the coming years, is over the issue of Taiwan. The Chinese military is encroaching on Taiwan's sea lanes, its airspace, its cyberspace. I know you have said that Xi Jinping wouldn't dare move militarily on Taiwan while you're in office. But what if he does? Would you order U.S. forces to defend Taiwan? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You'll find out if it happens. And he understands the answer to that. NORAH O'DONNELL: Why not say it-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: This never even came up yesterday, as a subject. He never brought it up. People were a little surprised at that. He never brought it up, because he understands it, and he understands it very well. Taiwan is a very interesting case. It's 69 miles away from China. We're 9,500 miles away. But that doesn't matter. He understands-- what will happen. He and I have spoken about it. But it was never even brought up during a two and a ha-- or two-and-a-half-hour meeting we had yesterday. NORAH O'DONNELL: Do you mind if I ask, when you say, "He understands," why not communicate that publicly to the rest of us? What does he understand that-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --I don't want to give away-- I can't give away my secrets. I don't want to be one of these guys that tells you exactly what's gonna happen if something happens. The other side knows, but-- I'm not somebody that tells you everything because you're askin' me a question. But they understand what's gonna happen. And-- he has openly said, and his people have openly said at meetings, "We would never do anything while President Trump is president," because they know the consequences. NORAH O'DONNELL: Less than an hour before your meeting with President Xi, you posted on social media that you instructed the, quote, Department of War to start testing our nuclear weapons-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's right. NORAH O'DONNELL: --immediately. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah-- NORAH O'DONNELL: What did you mean? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, we have more nuclear weapons than any other country. Russia's second. China's a very distant third, but they'll be even in five years. You know, they're makin' 'em rapidly, and I think we should do something about denuclearization, which is gonna be some-- and I did actually discuss that with both President Putin and President Xi. Denuclearization's a very big thing. We have enough nuclear weapons to blow up the world 150 times. Russia has a lot of nuclear weapons, and China will have a lot. They have some. They have quite a bit, but-- NORAH O'DONNELL: So why do we need to test-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --our nuclear weapons? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, because you have to see how they work. You know, you do have to-- and the reason I'm saying-- testing is because Russia announced that they were gonna be doing a test. If you notice, North Korea's testing constantly. Other countries are testing. We're the only country that doesn't test, and I wanna be-- I don't wanna be the only country that doesn't test. We have tremendous nuclear power that was given to us largely because when I was president (and I hated to do it, but you have to do it)-- I rebuilt the military during my first term. My first term was a tremendous success. We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. But my second term is blowing it away. It's blowing it away when you look at the numbers, the stock market, the jobs. Look at the job numbers, how good they've been. And, again, I have costs down. Remember, Biden gave me the worst inflation rate in the history of our country-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I-- I w-- definitely want to talk about the economy, but I just want to make s-- sure we-- we button up this issue-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: --on nuclear weapons. And I want to clarify this-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: Are you saying that after more than 30 years, the United States is going to start detonating nuclear weapons for testing? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm saying that we're going to test nuclear weapons like other countries do, yes. NORAH O'DONNELL: But the only country that's testing nuclear weapons is North Korea. China and Russia are not-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, Russia's-- no, no. Russia's testing nuclear weapons-- NORAH O'DONNELL: So my understanding-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And China's testing 'em too. You just don't know about it. NORAH O'DONNELL: That would be certainly very newsworthy. My understanding is what Russia did recently was test essentially the-- delivery systems for nuclear weapons, essentially missiles, which we can do that but w-- not with nuclear warheads- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it. You know, we're a open society. We're different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it, because otherwise you people are gonna report-- they don't have reporters that gonna be writing about it. We do. No, we're gonna test, because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea's been testing. Pakistan's been testing. NORAH O'DONNELL: Not nuclear weapons, is my understanding-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Of course they have-- NORAH O'DONNELL: North Korea has, but not nuclear weapons-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But they don't go and tell you about it. And, you know, as powerful as they are, this is a big world. You don't necessarily know where they're testing. They-- they test way under-- underground where people don't know exactly what's happening with the test. You feel a little bit of a vibration. They test and we don't test. We have to test. And Russia did make-- a little bit of a threat the other day when they said they were gonna do certain forms of a different level of testing. But Russia tests, China-- and China does test, and we're gonna test also. NORAH O'DONNELL: So we are going to-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Doesn't it sorta make sense? You know, you make-- you make nuclear weapons, and then you don't test. How are you gonna do that? How are you gonna know if they work? We have to do that-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Apparently, we don't need to test our nuclear weapons, 'cause they're the best in the world, according to experts I've spoken with-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: According to me. We have the best, and I was the one that renovated them and built them during a four-year period. And I hated to do it, because the destructive capability is something you don't even wanna talk about. But if other people are gonna have 'em, we're gonna have to have 'em. And if we have 'em, we have to test 'em, otherwise you don't really know how they're gonna work. And we don't wanna ever use them. And in the meantime, I've solved eight wars. I knocked out eight wars. I had eight wars-- I brought a little list for you if you'd like to see it-- but I took eight wars and stopped during an eight-month period, during eight months. Before the ninth month I stopped eight wars. The only one I haven't been successful yet in, and-- and that'll happen, is Russia Ukraine, which I thought actually would be the easiest one because I have a very good relationship with President Putin. But-- we are respected again as a country, and that's the way I've been able to stop the wars. I also stopped them because of trade. NORAH O'DONNELL: Who's tougher to deal with, Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Both tough. Both smart. Both-- look, they're both very strong leaders. These are people not to be toyed with. These are people you have to take very serious. They're not-- they're not walking in saying, "Oh, isn't it a beautiful day? Look how beautiful. The sun is shining, it's so nice." These are serious people. These are people that are tough, smart leaders. NORAH O'DONNELL: And on that note, you talk about Ukraine, that being the one war that you are not able to solve. In August, I mean, you rolled out the red carpet for Vladimir Putin in-- Alaska. But there's been-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I roll out the red carpet for everybody. NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. But is-- but there's been no ceasefire-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think I made-- yes, there isn't-- NORAH O'DONNELL: What's—is he ignoring you? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --because he thinks-- because I inherited a country where he thinks he's winning. That was a war that would've never happened if I was president. He even said that. That was a war that would've never happened. Joe Biden was the president. Joe Biden gave $350 billion to Ukraine, including a lot of weapons, a tremendous amount of weapons, which allowed them to fight, 'cause we make the best weapons in the world. You know, I rebuilt our military during my first term. They used a lotta those weapons in that war. We make the best weapons in the world. Now we make even better weapons. But that was-- NORAH O'DONNELL: So why won't Putin end this war? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --that was-- but-- but Norah, that was Joe Biden's war, not my war. I inherited that stupid war. That should not have been a war. That would've never happened if I were president. And by the way, for four years it didn't happen. There was never even a doubt. Then the election was rigged and stolen, and all of a sudden you see them forming up at the line. And now I come back and I'm gonna get that one solved too. But I brought, I mean, just a little list of-- of-- look at this, wars. How many did I solve? Cambodia-- this is Cambodia Thailand. Kosovo Serbia. Congo-- the Congo and Rwanda. Pakistan and India, that was gonna be a beauty. They shot down seven planes. Israel and Iran, you've heard about that one? Egypt and Ethiopia, that's another beauty. Ethiopia built a big-- dam where there's no water going to the Nile. Armenia and Azerbaijan. And if you take a look, Israel and Hamas, which is a, you know, rough little situation, but it's gonna be-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I do wanna talk about-- I mean, you have branded yourself the peace president. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think I did-- NORAH O'DONNELL: What-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --pretty good. I-- I solved-- those are eight of the nine wars I solved. I-- NORAH O'DONNELL: When-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --you know how I solved 'em? I said, in many cases, in 60% I said, "If you don't stop fighting, I'm putting tariffs on both of your countries and you're not gonna be able to do business with the United--" NORAH O'DONNELL: So why isn't that-- why isn't that working with Putin? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It is working with Putin, I think. I did different with him because we don't do very much business with Russia, for one thing, you know? He's not, like, somebody that buys a lot from us because of-- foolishness. And I think he'd like to be. I think he wants to come in and he wants to trade with us, and he wants to make a lotta money for Russia, and I think that's great. That's what I like-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Can you get it done in a couple months, do you think? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think we're gonna get it done, yeah. I think he really wants to do business with the U.S. But it did work with India, and it did work with-- Pakistan, and it did work with-- 60% of those countries. I can tell you, if it wasn't for tariffs and trade I wouldn't have been able to make the deals. But I stopped, as an example-- India does a lotta business with us. They were going to war. They were gonna have a nuclear war with Pakistan. The-- Prime Minister of Pakistan stood up the other day and he said, "If Donald Trump didn't get involved, many millions of people would be dead right now." That was a bad war he was ready to start. NORAH O'DONNELL: Let's talk about-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Shot down airplanes all over the place. That really-- that was gonna be a bad war. And I told both of them, I said, "If you guys don't work out a deal fast, you're not gonna do any business with the United States." And they do a lotta business with the United States. And they were both great leaders, and they worked out a deal, and they stopped the war. That would've been a bad war. It would've been a nuclear war. NORAH O'DONNELL: I wanna stay on the issue of foreign policy, and let's turn to our hemisphere. There have been at least eight boats in the Caribbean destroyed by the U.S. military-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Fortunately. NORAH O'DONNELL: And now the U.S.S. Gerald Ford, that is the world's largest aircraft carrier, on the way to the Caribbean. Are we going to war against Venezuela? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I doubt it. I don't think so. But they've been treating us very badly, not only on drugs-- they've dumped hundreds of thousands of people into our country that we didn't want, people from prisons-- they emptied their prisons into our compan-- country. They also-- if you take a look, they emptied their mental institutions and their insane asylums-- into the United States of America, 'cause Joe Biden was the worst president in the history of our country-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But why is our aircraft carrier-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Let me just finish. NORAH O'DONNELL: --going down there? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Joe Biden was the worst president in the history of our country. We had the worst inflation, we had the worst of everything. But the worst thing he did was allow millions of people to come into our country that were many-- in many cases, criminals, murderers, 11,888 murderers were let into our country. Venezuela let a lot of those people in. But they were from all over the world. This isn't just Venezuela. They were from all over the world. NORAH O'DONNELL: We are gonna talk about-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And what he did to our country should never be forgotten. He had an open-border process, and people would come in, and I'm not discriminating against tattoos, but people would come in with tattoos all over their faces, and say, "Come on in, come on in, come on in." They let people in that should've never been. Venezuela emptied their prisons into the United States of America. And every one of those boats that you see shot down-- and I agree, it's a terrible thing-- but every one of those boats kills 25,000 Americans. Every single boat that you see that's shot down kills 25,000 on drugs and destroys families all over our country. NORAH O'DONNELL: We will talk about immigration in a moment, but I just wanna talk about the scale of the military operation around Venezuela, because it has been described to 60 Minutes as using a blowtorch to cook an egg. Is this about stopping-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I don't think so. Look-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Is it about-- let me ask you, though. Is it about stopping narcotics? Or is this about getting rid of President Maduro? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, this is about many things. This is a country that allowed their prisons to be emptied into our country. To me, that would be almost number one, because we have other countries-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Well we don't need to blow up boats in order to deal-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Look, Mexico has been very bad to us in terms of drugs, okay? Very bad. We have a closed border right now. You probably noticed that for five months in a row, they have zero-- think of this, zero people coming into our country through our southern border. And it was millions of people a year just a little more than a year ago. Millions of people a year walked into our country totally unchecked, unvetted. We had no idea who they were. And we're never gonna let that happen again. That's what made Biden the worst president, because you know what, inflation I've already taken care of. We had the worst inflation in the history of our country, and now we don't have inflation. It's at 2%. It's-- it's the perfect inflation. NORAH O'DONNELL: Aren't-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But what made him so bad-- well, the weaponization of law enforcement, all of that. Look, he was bad in every way. But the worst thing that he did is allow millions, and millions, and millions of people to pour into our country unvetted, unchecked. And they were criminals, they were murderers, they were drug dealers, they were people from jails, and people from mental institutions. NORAH O'DONNELL: You-- you have had success on immigration, I wanna talk about that in a minute. But on Venezuela-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Big success. NORAH O'DONNELL: On Venezuela in particular, are Maduro's days as president numbered? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I would say yeah. I think so, yeah. NORAH O'DONNELL: And this issue of potential land strikes in Venezuela, is that true? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't tell you that. I mean-- I'm not saying it's true or untrue, but I-- you know, I wouldn't-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Why would we do it? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --I wouldn't be inclined to say that I would do that. But-- because I don't talk to a reporter about whether or not I'm gonna strike. I'm not gonna-- you know, you're a wonderful reporter, you're very talented, but I'm not gonna tell you what I'm gonna do with Venezuela, if I was gonna do it or if I wasn't going to do it. NORAH O'DONNELL: Why do we need an aircraft carrier and all of group--strike group-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's gotta be somewhere. It's a big one. NORAH O'DONNELL: I just think it-- it leads to the suggestion that the United States military is planning a larger operation involving Venezuela. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, we're not gonna allow countries from-- what-- you know, it's countries from all over the world coming in. You know, they come in from the Congo where we just settled that war. But it come-- they come in from the Congo, they come in from all over the world, they're coming, not just from South America. But Venezuela in particular-- has been bad. They have gangs-- Tren de Aragua, do you ever hear of it? NORAH O'DONNELL: Of course-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The most vicious gang anywhere in the world. They cut people's hands off if they call up the cops. You know, they call up the police and they said, "Did you call the police?" "Yes, I did. You took my apartment, you live in my building, you took my apartment." They cut his hand off. NORAH O'DONNELL: I-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: "Don't ever call the police again." NORAH O'DONNELL: I fully underst-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: These are animals. Wait a minute. And they came in from Venezuela. Worst gang-- probably the worst gang, most vicious gang in the world. And you know what I did? In Washington, D.C., we had a lot of 'em. We took care of business. They're gone. Washington, D.C., right now is a very safe place, as it should be. Washington, D.C., be-- before I got here was almost like a crime capital of the world. It's the capital of this country. To me, it's the capital of the world. You see the way they treat me. I go to Japan, I go to South Korea, I go to Chi-- any place I go, and you know what I call that? Respect for our country. They didn't treat Biden that way. When Biden went there-- first of all, he hardly went anywhere. Guy couldn't leave his bedroom. But they didn't treat Biden that way. They had no respect for Biden falling up the stairs going to an airplane three times. I mean, this is a man who should've never been president. This was a rigged election. And we-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I ask-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --have to get back-- we have to get to the bottom of that also, because we don't want that to ever happen again. You see what's going on. We don't ever want that to happen again. Look what happened to our country by having Biden as the president. NORAH O'DONNELL: I-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our country went to hell. And if we-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I wanted to ask you about Israel-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --had another couple of years, if Kamala had won the election, our country right now would be finished. It was a dead country, and now we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. We have the strongest stock market, we have everybody wants to come in. A year ago we were a dead country. Right now we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. Think of that. And I did that in nine months. And it's only gonna get better. NORAH O'DONNELL: Let's talk about Israel, as we're on foreign policy and talking about some of your successes. You got-- on Israel, you got the remaining Israeli hostages out of Gaza. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I did. NORAH O'DONNELL: You arranged a ceasefire, however fragile that may be. Those are major-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's not fragile. It's a very solid-- you know, I mean, you hear about Hamas, but Hamas could be taken out immediately if they don't behave. They know that. If they don't behave they're gonna be taken out immediately. They know that-- NORAH O'DONNELL: How do you get Hamas to disarm? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If I want 'em to disarm, I'll get 'em to disarm very quickly. They'll be-- they'll be eliminated. They know that. Don't forget, you said I got the remaining hostages. I got all the hostages out. But I always said the last 10 or 20 are gonna be tough. But we were tough also, and they let 'em all out. NORAH O'DONNELL: You were tough-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And now, by the way, they're getting-- a lot of the bodies are coming out too. Did you know a lot of the parents-- this is very interesting-- were-- the people that lost their child, you know, mostly sons, but sons and daughters, they knew they were dead, in some cases. Do you know that they were as anxious or even more anxious of getting their child out, even though they knew it was a body that we were dealing with, than the people that had a living child-- a living, breathing child that they knew they were alive, if-- if barely, because the way they lived was so horrible. And-- you saw yesterday four more just came out. We're gonna get them out too. They're buried in many cases. They're buried under rubble. But we pretty much know where they were. But I didn't get just the 20 out. I got all of the hostages out. NORAH O'DONNELL: You pushed the Israeli Prime Minister to make this deal, to get a ceasefire, to apologize-- to Qatar. Can you push Bibi Netanyahu to recognize a Palestinian state? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, he's-- he's fine. He's fine. Look, he's a wartime prime minister. I worked very well with him. Yeah, I mean, I had to push him a little bit one way or the other. I think I-- I did a great job in pushing-- he's a very talented guy. He's a guy that-- has never been pushed before, actually. And that's the kind-- that's the kind of person you needed in Israel at the time. It was very important. I don't think they treat him very well. He's under trial for some things, and I don't think they treat him very well. I think it should-- you know, we'll-- we'll be involved in that to help him out a little bit, because I think it's very unfair. But he's a wartime prime minister. I did, I pushed him. I didn't like certain things that he did, and you saw what I did about that. I also stopped-- you know, I-- we knocked the hell out of Iran, and then it was time to stop, and we stopped. Iran wants to make a deal. They don't say that, and they probably shouldn't say-- no good deal maker would. But Iran very much wants to make a deal. The key to Middle East peace-- I made Middle East peace. For 3,000 years they couldn't do it. I did it. And I did it with some very good partners in Israel. But the key to the Middle East peace was knocking the hell out of their potential-- nuclear. When we, with those beautiful B-2 bombers-- we just ordered 20 brand new ones, the newest and the greatest-- but with those beautiful B-2 bombers, when they went in there and they blew the hell out of that, you know, potential nuclear weapons site-- there were two of 'em, actually. And every single missile hit every single air shaft. You know, they had to go down an air shaft. Every single one of 'em hit their target. And I remember fake news CNN said, "Well, maybe it wasn't as powerful or as good as we thought." No, it was much-- turned out it was actually better. You know the Atomic Energy Agency said the hit was even stronger than anyone ever thought possible. And those pilots did a great job. What they were able to do-- and those machines. But it wasn't only them. They were surrounded by F-22s and F-16s. They were surrounded by F-35s. They were-- do you know we had 52 tanker planes, loading 'em up with jet fuel, because it was a long flight. They flied-- they flew for 37 hours. Of course, I flew for thirty-- 42 hours over the last three days, so I know how they feel. But they flew-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Except there's a bathroom on Air Force One-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --but they were sitting in one seat. I was-- I was able to walk around a little bit. But yeah, they said 42 hours. I've been in the air for 42 hours over a few days-- and that was fine, because we took in trillions of dollars into our country. And we also-- you know what's interesting, Japan took tremendous advantage of us over the years. You know, they sold cars to us, we couldn't sell cars to them. They made a fortune, we didn't make anything, we lost money. But it's the exact opposite now. But you know what? They like us more now than they used to because they respect us now. They didn't used to respect us, and they have great respect for us, all of 'em. Every country has-- including China. China now has great respect for us. They didn't have respect for us when they had Biden and when they had Obama. Obama was a terrible president. Nobody wants to talk about it because they wanna be politically correct. I don't care. He was a terrible president. Our country was-- it really started a very bad downward spiral. Then I stopped it, then we had a rigged election, and then-- what-- what Biden did to our country should never, ever be forgotten. NORAH O'DONNELL: We're still on-- on foreign policy, so I just have another question-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, I'm with-- I'm on all policy. NORAH O'DONNELL: I know you are-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm not talking about foreign-- no, no. I'm talking about everything. NORAH O'DONNELL: Well, I just wanna-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm talking about economy, I'm talking about everything-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I wanted to ask you about the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia is coming to the White House-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's right. NORAH O'DONNELL: --this month. He has said they won't join the Abraham Accords without a two-state solution. Do you believe that? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. I think he's gonna join. I-- I think-- we will have a solution. I don't know if it's gonna be two-state. That's gonna be up to Israel and other people, and me. But-- look, the main thing is you could've never had any kind of a deal if you had a nuclear Iran. And you essentially had a nuclear Iran. And I blasted the hell out of 'em, and no president is-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Are you convinced they have no nuclear capability right now in Iran? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Do you wanna know-- do you wanna know-- they have no nuclear capability, no. Do you wanna know that-- the pilots, I invited them to the White House-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I saw that. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --'cause they were very brave. I mean, I wouldn't have wanted to do it, you know, getting in a plane, and they know you're coming, and you're going right into Iran airspace. And, you know, they're very experts, and you're flying in with machines, these big, fantastic, unbelievable, beautiful wings that carry massive 100,000-pound bombs, and you don't-- I personally-- I can think of other things I'd rather do. These guys are very brave people. They're-- they were beautiful-looking people. They were-- they're real-- I mean, they're real American heroes, and I thought they deserved to be invited. And I invited 'em to the White House, the Oval Office, including the mechanics and the people behind the scenes, I invited-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I saw that. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --a lot of 'em. And they told me something I didn't know. They said, "Sir, for 22 years we've been practicing this route. Our predecessors," obviously, before them-- but "our predecessors and ourselves, for 22 years we've been practicing this hit, three times a year, every year, for 22 years. And you were the only president that let us do our job." I said, "Let me ask you. Is this a job you wanted to do?" "Yes, sir, 'cause it was the right thing." These are really brave people. These are really amazing people, and talented people. When you can hit at midnight with no moon, with no vision, every single air shaft, where that bomb went deep into that mountain and exploded and beat the hell out of it, I'll tell you what, they deserve to come to the White House. I gave 'em all a medal. They deserve to come to the White House. And it was a pleasure to meet 'em. These are great people. We have great people in this country. NORAH O'DONNELL: Mr. President, we've talked about foreign policy, now let's focus on issues here at home-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Okay, sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: --some of that you have already mentioned. We are now approaching the longest shutdown in American history. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Democrats' fault. NORAH O'DONNELL: Under your presidency, we're talking about more than a million federal workers who are not getting a paycheck, including our air traffic controllers. You see there's traffic snarls out at the airports now. This weekend food aid for more than 42 million Americans is set to expire. What are you doing as president to end the shutdown? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, what we're doing is we keep voting. I mean, the Republicans are voting almost unanimously to end it, and the Democrats keep voting against ending it. You know, they've never had this. This has happened like 18 times before. The Democrats always voted for an extension, always saying, "Give us an extension, we'll work it out." They don't wanna give us an extension because they used to think it was good for him, but the polls are turning around because-- not turning around. I just saw a poll where they're down 20-25%. What's happening is the people understand they're losing so much, they call it Trump derangement syndrome. They are losing so much that they don't know what to do. They've lost their way. They've become crazed lunatics. And all they have to do, Norah, is say, "Let's vote." And you can open the-- the economy could open up during our interview-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Is there something you can do, though-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Maybe it did. NORAH O'DONNELL: Is there something you can do-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: All I can do-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --to bring this to an end? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --is give the facts. Here's what I can't do. I can't give them $1.5 trillion so that they can give welfare to people that came into our country illegally. So that prisoners, and that people from mental institutions, and people that are drug dealers get vast amounts of money for healthcare. That I can't do-- NORAH O'DONNELL: So my under-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: What I can do is I can continue to run a great country. We have the best economy we've ever had. I can continue to do that. What they should do-- look, this started a long time ago. I always said-- and you know I've been very consistent-- Obamacare is terrible. It's bad healthcare at far too high a price. We should fix that. We should fix it. And we can fix it with the Democrats. All they have to do is let the country open and we'll fix it. But, you know, people are gonna get an 18-19% increase in Obamacare. It was a faulty program, it should've never been approved. But it was approved. NORAH O'DONNELL: So now that we're in-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If we fix it it'll be-- one of the greatest achievements. But-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But if ending the government shutdown-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --they have to let the country open, and I'll sit down with the Democrats, and we'll fix it. But they have to let the country-- and you know what they have to do-- NORAH O'DONNELL: So your plan-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: All they have to do is raise five hands. We don't need all of ''em. NORAH O'DONNELL: But so you're saying your plan is to tell the Democrats to vote the-- to end the shutdown. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Correct, very simple. NORAH O'DONNELL: And that you will put forward a healthcare plan? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. We will work on fixing the bad healthcare that we have. Right now, we have terrible healthcare and too expensive for the people, not for the government, for the people. NORAH O'DONNELL: But Mr. President, with all due respect-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The people are paying-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --you've been talking about fixing the healthcare insurance plan since 2015-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. And you can't do it because of the Democrats. That's right. NORAH O'DONNELL: Since 2015, you said you'd fix it. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I've been talking about it for a long time. We almost did it. We were one vote short. We woulda had great healthcare. We were one vote short. And coupla Senators that we currently have made the mistake, and they-- they made a big mistake. John McCain made a mistake, frankly. We were one vote short. We woulda had great healthcare. And I've been saying ever since, "We can fix it. It's too expen--" it's got two things. It's too expensive, and it's lousy healthcare. It's too expensive for the people. They're gonna get a very big increase this year. And it's because-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Well, they're gonna get an increase if they don't-- if you don't extend the subsidies. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, no. But the subsidies is part of it. We're supposed to spend trillions of dollars to take care of something that-- that is defective. What I'm saying is, we can make it much less expensive for people and give them much better healthcare. And I'd be-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But where is that plan? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --willing to work with the Democrats-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But where is that plan? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --on it. The problem is, they want to give money to prisoners, to drug dealers, to all these millions of people that were allowed to come in with an open border from Biden. And nobody can do that. Not-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I just-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --one Republican would ever do that. NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I just button that up? Because the extension of these Obamacare subsidies, if they are not extended is that's what the Democrats are pushing for. I know you understand that. Tens of millions of Americans will see their monthly payments double. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, no. It's going to double-- NORAH O'DONNELL: That's a lot. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --anyway. It's gonna double anyway-- NORAH O'DONNELL: My understanding is, it's just the...but can I-- may I just-- my understanding is, if those healthcare subsidies are not expan-- extended, premiums will double for many of the people that are on it. And I was looking into it. Three quarters of these people that will see their healthcare premiums double live in states where you won in the last election. I mean, even here in Florida has the highest number of residents on Obamacare in the country. If those-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And I'm saying we can fix it, Norah. NORAH O'DONNELL: But if the subsidies are not extended, they're not gonna be able to afford health insurance-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Look. It was a defective plan put into line by Barack Hussein Obama, who was a lousy president, not nearly as bad as Biden, by the way, who by the way is building a museum that's, like, four times over budget. It'll never open, built in a neighborhood that-- you know, it's just not gonna work. The neighborhood doesn't even want 'em. NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And it's a disaster. The same guy that did his museum, which is a total catastrophe, came up with a bad healthcare plan. And for the sake of one vote, we would have had, you know, it's so sad thinking back-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But how-- I guess the question is-- I hear you. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If we had the vote, that one vote, we would have great healthcare at a much lower cost, and that's what I want. But I don't want to give $1.5 trillion to prisoners and drug dealers and-- and the people that-- that came into our country from mental institutions. What they allowed to come into our country, and we're getting 'em out, but what they allowed to come into our country, Norah, is horrible. So-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I just-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --ready? NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We can make it good. NORAH O'DONNELL: I don't want to get into a back-- too much of a back and forth on this-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, but here's all I have to do. Open up the country. Open up the country. NORAH O'DONNELL: You mean, end the shutdown-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We only need five of the-- of their votes. We only need five votes, and already a couple of Democrats, a few Democrats are already voting. They want to open up. And we'll fix all of those problems. NORAH O'DONNELL: You're st-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Those problems are much easier than what I just did with solving all these wars. NORAH O'DONNELL: Last question-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We had-- wait a minute, we had nine wars on our planet. I solved eight of 'em. I have one to go, Russia-Ukraine. I thought that was gonna be one of the easier ones but it's not because Putin is tougher than people thought-- NORAH O'DONNELL: You have-- you-- you have helped these government shutdowns in the past when it came about-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I did. NORAH O'DONNELL: And you did it by bringing back-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm very good at it, but I'm not gonna do it by-- NORAH O'DONNELL: You brought members of Congress to-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --I'm not gonna do it by extortion-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --to the White House. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm not gonna do it by being extorted by the Democrats who have lost their way. The-- there's something wrong with these people. NORAH O'DONNELL: So then what happens on November 15th-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Schumer-- Schumer is a basket case. NORAH O'DONNELL: --when the troops don't get a paycheck? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Schumer is a basket case. He's gonna be defeated in the next election by a vast number of people. And he has nothing to lose. He's become-- I just left Japan. He's become a kaz-- kamikaze pilot. This guy-- NORAH O'DONNELL: It sounds like-- it sounds like this is not gonna get solved-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --is, this guy is a kamikaze. He would rather see the country fail than have Trump and the Republicans do well. But the people don't want that-- NORAH O'DONNELL: It's, I know, I hear you. It sounds like-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: So we have a record-setting country right now, and we're not gonna be extorted by a man who's grossly incompetent, who-- who is gonna be defeated by any one of five different candidates. We're not gonna let that happen-- NORAH O'DONNELL: It sounds like this is not gonna get solved. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Say it? NORAH O'DONNELL: It sounds like it's not gonna get solved, the shutdown. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's gonna get solved, yeah. Oh, it's gonna get solved. NORAH O'DONNELL: How? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We'll get it solved. Eventually, they're gonna have to vote. NORAH O'DONNELL: You're saying the Democrats will capitulate? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think they have to. I mean, look, I-- I use the word kamikaze, not freely. I don't like to have to use that word. They are kamikazes, but there are gonna be four or five Democrats that come. We need five. They're gonna come and vote. NORAH O'DONNELL: That's-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And if they don't vote, that's their problem. Now, I happen to agree to something else. I think we should do the nuclear option. This is a totally different nuclear, by the way. It's called ending the filibuster. NORAH O'DONNELL: Did you see John Thune said today they're not gonna do that-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I know John doesn't-- well, John and a few others. But, you know what? The Republicans have to get tougher. If we end the filibuster, we can do exactly what we want. We're not gonna lose power. The theory is, oh, then we'll do it, but then when they get into power someday they'll do it. That's true. But you know what? NORAH O'DONNELL: So you think John-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're here right now. No, I like John Thune. I think he's terrific, but I disagree with him on this point. NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't-- I don't even know-- actually, I don't even know his attitude on the filibuster, but I think we should do it-- NORAH O'DONNELL: He j-- he said today he wasn't gonna do it. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, that's too bad. You know, I mean, I think we're much better off. 'Cause here's the problem. The Democrats will do it in the first week in office. The Democrats, and I told that to John. The de-- and I get along with him great. We've had a great relationship-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Yes. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And I also know there are other Republicans that feel the other way. And I understand that too, but they're wrong. The Democrats will do it. If they get into power and someday I guess they will. Who knows? It's hard to believe when they have men in women's sports, open borders, open everything, a transgender for everyone. The Democrats will do it in their first day in office, and the only reason they didn't do it is because of Sinema and because of a man named Joe Manchin from West Virginia-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Senator Kyrsten Sinema--. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --good man. And they disagreed with it. Now wait. Had they approved it, I think just one of 'em, had they been able to get those votes, you would have had the nuclear option used. You would have had the filibuster ended, and the Democrats would have used it. So I say to the Republicans that want to be, you know, all like, "Oh, well, we-- you know, we're above all that," the Democrats will do it. See, the Republicans have much better policy. We have smart policy. We have great policy. That's how we win. The Democrats are vicious. They're vicious. They have horrible policy, but they are the most vicious human beings on Earth. They are people that weaponize government. They do a lotta bad things. But-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I ask you about-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --the good thing is, from our standpoint, from the standpoint of winning is, they have the worst policy of-- it's hard to believe. Think of it. Open borders, men playing in women's sports, transgender for everybody. I mean, I could go point-- these are not 80:20-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I ask you about the economy-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --these are 99:1 issues. And they don't change. I just watched this morning a show where-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Mr. President, can I ask you about the-- the economy-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, just-- just one thing. I watched a show this morning where a very well-known Democrat Congressman was fighting like hell for men playing in women's sports. They don't change it-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Who was that? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't want to tell. You'll be able to check it. Just check your local TV. NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. On the economy, the signature part of your economic plan is tariffs. The Supreme Court is gonna hear arguments this week on whether you have the authority to impose these sweeping tariffs without Congressional approval. The lower courts have ruled against you. That's why it's at-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, no. NORAH O'DONNELL: --the Supreme Court right now. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Very close rulings, yeah. NORAH O'DONNELL: What happens to your economic plan if the Supreme Court invalidates your tariffs? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think our country will be immeasurably hurt. I think our economy will go to hell. Look, because of tariffs, we have the highest stock market we've ever had. Because of tariffs, 401(k)s at the highest level that-- and this is millions and millions of people that we've ever had 401(k)s. Because of tariffs, I've ended six of the eight wars that I've ended, and it'll end up being used also for the last war in a different way. Because of tariffs and the economy, but because of tariffs, we have a great economy. Because of tariffs, our country is wealthy again. Because of tariffs, tremendously good things happened. Because of tariffs, our country is respected again. Because of tariffs, a president-- NORAH O'DONNELL: So what if the Supreme-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --wait a minute. Because of tariffs, President Xi allowed us to win every single point. He bought billions and billions of dollars of-- of our soybeans, of our everyth-- it was the money they're spending. When I came out, did you see what happened with the farmers? They're having rallies for Trump right now because of tariffs. Because it gives us national security. If we didn't have tariffs, and remember this. Tariffs are used against us. Let me talk about that lawsuit. That lawsuit against us was instituted and backed by foreign countries that have been ripping us off for years. They don't want it because they were rippin' us off for years. And if we lose that lawsuit, they'll continue to rip us off and you're not gonna end up with a country. I think it's the most important subject discussed by the Supreme Court in 100 years. If they don't-- if they take away the power of tariffs from us, and it has to be quick and nimble, you can't have Congress, well, hundreds of people have to look. They can't even agree to continue a country. You can't have Congress here. This has to be quick and nimble. As an example-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Well, you just-- finish that sentence. You said, "If they take away my power to do tariffs," what? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It would be a very sad day for the United States of America. We're making a lot of money. We're respected again all over the world. We have great national security. Let me give you an example. With China, they were, you know, very strongly threatening us frankly with the rare earths. And then I said, "Well, if you're gonna play that card, I'm gonna put a 100% tariff on over and above what you're already paying," which was 55%, which was very high. A lotta money coming in, tremendous money like we've never seen. "I'm gonna put a 100% tariff on everything over and above." And you know what happened? We got a phone call 20 minutes later. "We'd like to talk." If they take away the right to tariff, if they-- if-- if we're forced to use Congress to approve, they can't approve anything. They would be sitting around for years debating whether or not we should use tariffs. If they take-- NORAH O'DONNELL: You want that power. You want that executive power. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You need it to ru-- to protect our country. This is a national secure-- tariffs are national security. If you take away the right to tariff, and remember this. NORAH O'DONNELL: And-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Tariffs have been used against us. NORAH O'DONNELL: Can you just answer that question that tariffs have led to inflation? They have led to an increase in cost of living for most Americans-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They haven't led to inflation. We have no inflation. We have no inflation. Biden had inflation, and he didn't have tariffs. He didn't use tariffs. NORAH O'DONNELL: For the average American-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know why he didn't use 'em? 'Cause he's not smart enough to use 'em. NORAH O'DONNELL: But the companies say they passed on more than 30% of these costs to the American consumer off the tariffs-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Okay, ready, are you ready? NORAH O'DONNELL: Somebody has to pay for it. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. You have to pay, but we don't have any inflation. Inflation is the que-- is the real test of paying. Everybody said, "Oh, if you do tariffs, you're gonna have inflation." So Biden had the highest inflation in the history of our country by far, okay. No tariffs. I have very modest tariffs compared. Let me tell you. These tariffs ultimately are so good that at some point when they're used properly, and I use them more properly than anybody's ever even dreamt possible, think of it. We become rich. We're taking in trillions of dollars. And I have no inflation. And I have total national security. When I put the 100% tariff on China over and above what they were already paying, which was about 55%, so 155%, they came to the table immediately and they made a deal with us that was a very fair deal. That's called national security. And then I didn't make 'em pay the 100%. That would have been instituted. That would have come to fore on November 1st. Norah, Norah, listen to me-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I know our time with you is limited. I hear you. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If I didn't have the power of tariff, we would be-- we would be like a subject nation. We'd be subject to everyone else. Everybody uses tariffs on us. If I wasn't allowed to use tariffs on them, we would be a third rate-- we would be a third world nation. NORAH O'DONNELL: I know your time is limited, so I do want to make sure I get through another-- more of these topics. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: Immigration. I mean, you campaigned on immigration. You largely won the election on a promise to close the border-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Did great job, don't you think? NORAH O'DONNELL: --and you succeeded on that. Illegal crossings at the Southern border are at a 55-year low. Want to ask you about this. More recently, Americans have been watching videos of ICE tackling a young mother, tear gas being used in a Chicago residential neighborhood, and the smashing of car windows. Have some of these raids gone too far? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. I think they haven't gone far enough because we've been held back by the-- by the judges, by the liberal judges that were put in by Biden and by Obama. We've been held-- NORAH O'DONNELL: You're okay with those tactics? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, because you have to get the people out. You know, you have to look at the people. Many of them are murderers. Many of them are people that were thrown outta their countries because they were, you know, criminals. Many of them are people from jails and prisons. Many of them are people from frankly mental institutions. I feel badly about that, but they're released from insane asylums. You know why? Because they're killers. NORAH O'DONNELL: Well, you promised in your campaign that you were going to deport the worst of the worst, violent criminals-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's what I'm-- oh we're doin' that-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --rapists. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, that's what we're doing-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But a lot of the people that your administration has arrested and deported aren't violent criminals. Landscapers, nannies, construction workers-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Oh, no, no, landscapers who are criminals-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --farmworkers. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Now, look, look. NORAH O'DONNELL: The family of US service members-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I need landscapers and I need farmers more than anybody, okay. NORAH O'DONNELL: But was it your in-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We-- and we want to-- we focus on the bad ones, and we've gotten tremendous numbers of bad people. Don't forget. NORAH O'DONNELL: The-- there-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: When you have over 11,000 murderers released into our country, over 11,000, 50% of which have murdered more than one person, we gotta get 'em outta here. NORAH O'DONNELL: Is it your intent to deport people who do not have a criminal record? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have to start off with a policy, and the policy has to be you came into the country illegally, you're gonna go out. However, you've also seen, you're gonna go out. We're gonna work with you, and you're gonna come back into our country legally. Because we have a lotta good people. We have some great people. But, you know, the problem we have, and people don't like talking about-- these are very-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But there isn't-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --wait. These are very smart countries. Their leaders are very smart. They're very street-wise. They might not have gone to the finest schools, but they're very street-wise. They want-- they don't want, they have good people. They want people that are bad out. So they, what do they do? They open their jails. They let 'em out. They get rid of their drug dealers. They let 'em out. But you know who else they get out? The people that are on welfare that aren't working. In other words, they have people that just don't work. They don't want people that just don't work, so they put them into our country. NORAH O'DONNELL: But if someone has been in this-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And we've accepted all of these people because of Biden's open border policy where people would walk in totally unchecked and unvetted, murderers and everybody else. NORAH O'DONNELL: When will you declare mission accomplished on immigration? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, it takes a long time, because, you know, probably I say 25 million people were let into our country. A lotta people say it was 10 million people. But whether it was ten or-- I believe I'm much closer to the right number. Of the 25, many of them should not be here. Many of them. But we're-- we're cleaning up our cities. You know, I campaigned on crime, but I've done a much better job on crime than I thought. You know, the crime numbers are way down, even though we have a lot more people in our country that really shouldn't be here. And many of them are stone-cold hard criminals. When I look at D.C. now, you can walk down the middle of the street. You can have your daughter who's ten years old meet you at the park. She's gonna be okay. NORAH O'DONNELL: In certain parts of D.C.-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: She woulda been murdered. Well, I-- in almost-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I live in D.C. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, you tell me-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Certain parts of D.C. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: How big a difference is D.C. now compared to what it was a year ago? NORAH O'DONNELL: Uh-huh. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Right? I mean, you have to be honest with me. People walk-- people in the White House, they walk up to me, young ladies I've never seen. "Sir, thank you very much." I know-- I-- they don't even have to tell me what they're thanking me for. But when I ask why? He said-- she-- one girl said, "I'd get into Uber and I felt dangerous even in an Uber." They'd attack the car, okay. It wasn't even safe then. "Sir, I now walk to work every day and I walk, I-- I-- I-- I'm so safe. I f-- there's nothing going to happen. 100% safe." And you know that too, Norah. NORAH O'DONNELL: I wanna ask you about the s-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You live here. You know that too. NORAH O'DONNELL: I wanna ask you about amer-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Do you see a difference? NORAH O'DONNELL: --American cities-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You see a difference? NORAH O'DONNELL: --in Washington, D.C.? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yes. NORAH O'DONNELL: I think I've been working too hard. I haven't been out and about that much-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Oh, that's not a fair answer. You see the difference. NORAH O'DONNELL: I get in my car and go to work and I go home-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's good. You don't have to use that one. Don't worry. Don't worry. I don't want to embarrass her. NORAH O'DONNELL: I've been working too hard-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's-- it's like you know what the difference is? Like, day and night. NORAH O'DONNELL: I want to ask you more about some American cities. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: We are about-- we're on the eve a number of big state and local elections. One of the most watched is the one for Mayor of New York City. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. NORAH O'DONNELL:. . . he is, Zohran Mamdani, 34-year-old Democratic Socialist. He's the front runner-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Communist, not Socialist. Communist. He's far-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Some-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --he's far worse than a Socialist. NORAH O'DONNELL: Some people have compared him to a left-wing version of you, charismatic, breaking the old rules. What do you think about that? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think I'm a much better looking person than him, right? NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. Well, former governor Andrew Cuomo, who you know is campaigning for mayor, he recently said that "If Mamdani becomes Mayor of New York City that you will take over New York." Cuomo said this. He said, "He will be President Trump and Mayor Trump. He's gonna take over New York and send tanks down Fifth Avenue." PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Oh, that's so crazy. Look. When I left New York, we were at the-- the epitome of it was a great city. It was doing great. It was a great city, but there were some bad sides, because we had a guy named de Blasio, who was the worst mayor. Like I say Biden was the worst president, de Blasio was the worst mayor in history-- NORAH O'DONNELL: What if Mamdani becomes mayor? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think he's probably gonna make de Blasio look great. I think he will make de Blasio look like one of our great mayors. De Blasio was the worst mayor we've ever had. Now I saw that, you know, but I was sort of leaving during that period of time. I got to see de Blasio, how bad a mayor he was, and this man will do a worse job than de Blasio by far. And it's gonna be hard for me as the president to give a lot of money to New York. Because if you have a Communist running New York, all you're doing is wasting the money you're sending there. So I don't know that he's won, and I'm not a fan of Cuomo one way or the other, but if it's gonna be between a bad Democrat and a Communist, I'm gonna pick the bad Democrat all the time, to be honest with you. NORAH O'DONNELL: Uh-huh. This past Tuesday, while speaking to American troops in Japan, you talked about U.S. cities that are having trouble with crime. And you said, "If we need more than the National Guard, we'll send more than the National Guard." What does that mean, send more than the National Guard? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, if you had to send in the Army or if you had to send in the Marines, I'd do that in a heartbeat. You know, you have a thing called the Insurrection Act. You know that, right? NORAH O'DONNELL: Uh-huh. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Do you know that I could use that immediately and no judge can even challenge you on that. But I haven't chosen to do it because I haven't felt we need it. Do you know that we have a place called Chicago that, with a very bad governor. They threw him outta the family business. He became governor. Do you know that 4,000 people were murdered during his governorship. 4,000 people were murdered during his governorship, and yet he won't let us bring in the National Guard. He won't let us bring in-- in Chicago-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But when you say, "Send in more than the National Guard," what does that mean? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, more would be Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines. NORAH O'DONNELL: So you're gonna send the military into American cities? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, if I wanted to I could, if I want to use the Insurrection Act. Do you know how many presidents-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Will you-- what would be the-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, no. NORAH O'DONNELL: What would-- what would cause you to do that? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Do you know how many presidents have used the Insurrection Act? NORAH O'DONNELL: Tell me. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Almost 50% of 'em. Do you know that some of the presidents, recent ones, have used it 28 times? Twenty-eight times. The Insurrection Act has been used routinely by presidents. I haven't chosen to use it, but if I-- because I've done well without it. But if I needed it, I could do it. And if I needed it, that would mean I could bring in the Army, the Marines, I could bring in whoever I want. But I haven't chosen to use it. I hope you give me credit for that. NORAH O'DONNELL: I wanna ask you about-- another matter. James Comey, John Bolton, Letitia James were all recently indicted. There is a pattern to these names. They're all public figures who have publicly denounced you. Is this political retribution? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You mean, do you think it's bad that I went after a public figure? NORAH O'DONNELL: Is it political retribution? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know what? You know who got indicted, the man you're lookin' at. I got indicted, and I was innocent. And here I am, because I was able to beat all of the nonsense that was thrown at me. I got indicted. They indicted the President of the United States. You know, they impeached me twice and I got out of it quickly and easily? They impeached me twice. These people are scum. And yet, when you go after a dirty cop like Comey or a guy like Bolton, who I hear has, I don't know anything about it, I hear he took records all over the place, who knows. Letitia James is a terrible, dishonest person, in my opinion. Terrible. I just won the case against her. She wanted me to pay $500 million for something I didn't do anything wrong on. And the judge just overturned the-- the decision. So and then you-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Have you-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Wait, wait, wait. And then you tell me about me. Just so you understand, you say I went after these people. These people are bad people. They're dishonest people. NORAH O'DONNELL: No, I was just asking, is it political retribution-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And Comey's a dirty cop. Look, Comey's known as a dirty cop. I'm not known as a dirty person. They indicted me many times, indicted me. They were after me. I'm lookin' at you now. I'm President of the United States. I went through numerous indictments and two impeachments. And you tell me that I went after people? These people are dishonest. Look. Biden didn't have a clue. He illegally used, as you know, a machine, the autopen in order to give pardons to people. The only pardon he signed it looks like was his son, Hunter. He signed Hunter's, so, "Hunter, you're free, con-- congratulations, Hunter." But everyone else, I think those pardons are all just, were just a waste of time. Those pardons-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Did you instruct-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --wait a minute, those pardons-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --the Department of Justice to go after them? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Did I what? NORAH O'DONNELL: Did you instruct the Department of Justice to go after them? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, and not in any way, shape or form. No. You don't have to instruct 'em because they were so dirty, they were so crooked, they were so corrupt that the honest people we have, Pam Bondi's doin' a very good job. Kash Patel's doing a very good job. The honest people that we have go after 'em automatically. But they instructed them to go after me, because the records now have been found. So when you tell me about I went after Comey, Comey's low on the totem pole. They went after the President of the United States. Do you know that they raided my house in Palm Beach, Florida called Mar-a-Lago? They raided my house. I had 78 or 98 FBI agents with arms-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I know how you-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --come into my house. And you're telling me, Norah, that I went after some low-life named Comey, who's judged to be a crooked guy. He lied all over the place. He lied to Congress and did many other bad things. NORAH O'DONNELL: But I was just asking, has this-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: For that, you should be ashamed. NORAH O'DONNELL: No, no. I was just asking, is this-- is this retribution on your part? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, it's the opposite. I think I've been very mild-mannered. You're looking at a man who was indicted many times, and I had to beat the rap. Otherwise I couldn't have run for president. They tried to get me not to run for president by going after me and by indicting me. But even during my term, on a perfect phone call, I got impeached. This call was perfect. Tim Scott, from South Carolina, highly respected, a legitimate person totally legit, he read the tran-- thank goodness we had a transcript of the call. The call I got indicted on, a call on Ukraine of all places, with the President of Ukraine. It was a perfect phone call. Tim Scott said, "I just read the transcript. The President didn't do anything wrong, was perfect." And that was the end of the indictment pretty much. But I had to go through a whole process. You know, the Democrats knew that I wasn't guilty, because they didn't know the-- the call was-- I didn't know either, the call was essentially taped. So we knew exactly what the call. When they found out that the call was taped, Nancy Pelosi went crazy. She said, "You made me go into this mess." She screamed at all these people that made her do it, bad people like Schiff, et cetera, et cetera. So what happened is, she went nuts and just to conclude, and they said, "Let's do it anyway." They did it anyway, and I won very easily as you know. But you can't then accuse me of weaponizing government. They were horrible human beings. They went after the President of the United States. They went after my children. They went into my wife's-- drawers. NORAH O'DONNELL: I know-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They went into my wife's closets. They held the dresses up. She came back. She said, "Oh, what happened? What happened?" 'Cause she's a very meticulous person. Everything's nice and neat. NORAH O'DONNELL: I've heard you talk about it. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: All of a sudden, everything's, like, they went into my office. They took things that I was allowed to have file-- under the Presidential Records Act that I was allowed to have. I had records. I was allowed to have 'em. Only the president's allowed, but I was-- and it was nothing very significant anyway. There was, like, nothing. Wait, just one second. They opened these-- I'm a very meticulous person too. I have files, beautiful. They took the files, threw 'em all over the phone-- all over the floor. They were all over the floor-- and they took pictures of 'em. This is my office. I said, "What the hell? That's not my office." They took files, they threw 'em all over, and they took pictures and they released 'em to the public that this is "President Trump's office. We caught him with all of this stuff," like it was all over the floor in my office. These are crooked people. These are the same. So don't ask me about, "Did you go after?" Letitia's-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Letitia James, in my opinion, and I only say in my opinion 'cause I guess the lawyers would prefer that I say that 'cause I have a much stronger opinion, she's a total crook. She's a low-life. Comey's a dirty cop. Bolton actually helped me a lot because he was crazy. He's the one who want, him and-- and Cheney, a couple people got Bush to go out and blow the hell outta the Middle East and then take-- you know, then leave. And actually, Bolton helped me 'cause every time somebody saw Bolton standing behind me, foreign countries, they conceded. You know why they conceded? 'Cause they said, "Bolton's a nut job. Trump is gonna take us to war." But I don't listen to people that are stupid. Go ahead. NORAH O'DONNELL: And I know my time is-- is limited with you so I want to be respectful of-- of you, Mr. President. The issue of political violence I want to get to, because you were nearly assassinated in Butler, Pennsylvania. Charlie Kirk. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yup. NORAH O'DONNELL: Was assassinated. Pennsylvania Governor, Josh Shapiro's house was firebombed. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Uh-huh. NORAH O'DONNELL: Minnesota lawmaker murdered. What's your message to those on the left and the right who would seek to commit acts of violence? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think primarily on the left. A little bit of both, but I think primarily on the left. I think they have to tone it down. I think they have to approve the shutdown so it's not shut down. I think it's very bad what they're doing. They're hurting people. You know, if you think about it, if people aren't gonna get paid, there're gonna be, you know, a lot of angry people out there. They want to get their food. They want to get the money so they can live. In some cases-- whatever they want to get, they want to get. I think by the Democrats not giving us the votes, I think it's-- I think it endangers both parties. I think it's very bad. There's never been a case like this. This is, you know, this is fairly standard stuff. You do auto-- extensions are almost automatic. In fact, they were virtually automatic. This is the only time they don't want to do the extension, because they're losing so badly that they said, "Maybe we have some leverage." One of the Senators said that. "Maybe this is the first time we have some leverage." NORAH O'DONNELL: I wonder if we're-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But they really don't have leverage, because-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I wonder if we're at a breaking point? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --the Republicans can't be extorted in order to ruin our country. NORAH O'DONNELL: Do you feel like we're at a breaking point? Given everything that you-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. NORAH O'DONNELL: --just said? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. It's been much worse. NORAH O'DONNELL: Because you-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I mean, over-- over history? NORAH O'DONNELL: Well. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's been much worse. NORAH O'DONNELL: Sure, but the political violence that, you know, we just outlined. The number of-- of members of people in public that have been targeted-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, that's-- that's a different question. Yeah, I think-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --that have been targeted. And then I just read that there's now a number of your cabinet secretaries and aides who are now living on military bases. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. Usually when people talk they're not the problem. It's the ones that don't talk, in terms of that. But-- yeah, I-- I think it's-- it's a lot of the rhetoric. Look, they call me a Nazi all the time. I'm not a Nazi. I'm the opposite. I'm somebody that's saving our country. But they call me Nazi. They have talking points, you know? They have just talking points. And the press is-- is largely responsible for it. The fake news, what they've done-- I think one of the greatest terms I've ever come up with is fake news. What they've done to our country is very bad. They have to change around. Now, nobody believes the fake news. Nobody believes 'em. I mean, they've gone, you talk about popularity, you talk about approval, their approval numbers have gone f-- from, like, in the 90s to in the teens now. We need borders. We need fair votes. And you really need a fair press. If you-- and you do, you have some great journalists and great reporters. But you have some terrible, terrible, dishonest journalists. And I see it all the time, because I'll give 'em a story and they'll have it. Even my trip with China, it was so successful. But of all, the Wall Street Journal, they said, Trump Lowers Tariffs. That was the headline. Trump Lowers Tariffs. That wasn't what happened. I lowered tariff-- tariffs in order to get everything that anybody could possibly dream of. The point wasn't lowering tariffs. I put up a high number, I cut it, and I got everything. And yet the headline in the Wall Street Journal, beautiful picture of myself and President Xi, everything nice. But the headline was Trump Lowers Tariffs. That wasn't the story. The story was Trump got everything, got everything. Including world peace. We're respected as a country. We're not threatened right now. And we're not gonna be threatened. As long as we have a strong, smart president, we're never gonna be threatened by anybody. NORAH O'DONNELL: There's been a lotta talk about 2028 and who will be at the top of the-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well. NORAH O'DONNELL: --Republican ticket. Can you set the record straight? You're not gonna try and run for a third term? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I don't even think about it. I will tell you, a lotta people want me to run. But the difference between us and the Democrats is we really do have a strong bench. I don't wanna use names, because it's, you know, inappropriate. But it's too early. We're talking 3 and ¼ years-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But people do like when you start talking about whether you like J.D. Vance or Secretary Rubio-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I do like J.D. Vance. I like-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Or secretary-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --Marco Rubio. I like-- I like so many people. We have an unbelievable bench. We could run two people together. We have a great bench. So I don't wanna start talking about elections. It's too early. One thing I can tell you, the 2020 election was rigged. And a lotta people say when it's rigged you're allowed to do it again. It was rigged. And it's been caught. And they-- and you see the same information that everybody else does. And it's coming out now in spades. But with all of that, we have a great bench. We have unbelievable people. You could go up and down my cabinet, we have great people. They don't. They have a guy that's ruined the state of California, ruined it, destroyed it. And I have a lotta property out there, I can tell you they've ruined the state of California. He has been terrible. Other than he's got a good line of--bullshit, that's all it is. He's ruined the state. And he's one of the people running. Jasmine Crockett, she's a low-IQ person. They say she might run for president, Jasmine Crockett. This is a very low-IQ person. AOC, I watched her speak the other day, almost the first time she was screaming. She was like a crazy person. Her-- she's got-- not a good speaker. Doesn't have, I don't think, but you never know what it is. You never know what it is c-- that can spark an election. When Joe ran first time I thought he was terrible. He was horrible. I-- I won by a lot. The second time he was running he was doing very poorly, he had a bad debate, and they replaced him in the middle the election. That never-- this could only happen to me. They replaced him with somebody, the press got behind her. Oh, they were so behind her. But eventually she failed because she couldn't speak. She wasn't a very intelligent person, in my opinion. But she couldn't speak properly. She could not speak. And actually 60 Minutes paid me a lotta money. And you don't have to put this on, because I don't wanna embarrass you, and I'm sure you're not-- you have a great-- I think you have a great, new leader, frankly, who's the young woman that's leading your whole enterprise is a great-- from what I know. I don't know her, but I hear she's a great person. But 60 Minutes was forced to pay me-- a lot of money because they took her answer out that was so bad, it was election-changing, two nights before the election. And they put a new answer in. And they paid me a lot of money for that. You can't have fake news. You've gotta have legit news. And I think that it's happening. I see-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Mr. President-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --I see good things happening in the news. I really do. And I think one of the best things to happen is this show and new ownership, CBS and new ownership. I think it's the greatest thing that's happened in a long time to a free and open and good press. NORAH O'DONNELL: Mr. President, can I also ask you, we're now at the end of your first year. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. NORAH O'DONNELL: Of this second term. What do you hope to accomplish in the next three years? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I hope I can have the same year that we had. Look, we have been acknowledged to have the greatest nine months. You know, it's nine months. The greatest nine months in the history of the presidency. So if I can keep that going I'll be very happy. Because, you know, what we've done, what we-- I inherited a mess. And I've fixed it, other than it will take a while to get all the criminals, the real criminals, the ones-- the real bad ones, out. But we've gotten a lot of them out. We've gotten a lot of the murderers out. We've gotten a lot of the people from jails out and we've taken 'em back to their countries. In some cases they're so dangerous that we've actually had to put them in our jails because we didn't want 'em coming back. I wanna just keep it going pretty much the same way. I want safety in our cities. Our cities are a mess. And I hate to say it, they're Democrat-run cities. If you take the top 25 cities, they're almost all-- almost every one of 'em is run by Democrats. NORAH O'DONNELL: And to people that say they're-- struggling with the cost of living, expenses-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, cashless bail-- NORAH O'DONNELL: What could you do about that-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, let me just say, cashless bail is a disaster. It's gotta be changed. Sanctuary cities really have to be changed. They're sanctuary, you know what they're sanctuary for? Criminals. Things-- some basic things have to be changed. But one of the things I really have focused on is making Chicago great again. Making-- and we're just getting started in Chicago. But what we did in D.C., where we took D.C. from being so bad to so beautiful, such good-- the restaurants are booming. You can't get into a restaurant. They were closing and now they're all opening every-- you can't get a restaurant now. You can't get into a restaurant. But you c-- if you wanna buy a restaurant or-- or own a restaurant you almost can't find it. I wanna make this happen all over the country. I want it to be like that in New York, in L.A., in Chicago. I wanna do it as much as you can. You know, by the way, Memphis, we're there now. Memphis was a dangerous hellhole. 65% down in crime. And this is after two weeks. We can do it all over the place. It's turned out to be a new passion for me, making our city-- I had no idea we could be that successful. I thought it would take a much longer period of time. Do you know in Washington, in 12 days it was really good. In one month it was close to perfect. NORAH O'DONNELL: And for those that are suffering with cost of living increases and saying they're living paycheck to paycheck-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I'd be very upset with-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Prices are up PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --Biden. Because we don't have any of those problems. We-- we don't have inflation. You know, essentially we don't have inflation. We-- I inherited the worst inflation in the history of our country. We don't have infl-- we're down to 2%, even less than 2%. A couple of items like beef I'm getting down. But our groceries are down-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Healthcare-- healthcare premiums? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I can fix healthcare, give them better healthcare for less money. Obamacare is-- is hurting people. Obamacare was a disaster from day one. I can fix it and make it good. I'd really rather start with a fresh plate, but if it's-- if it's required to keep it, we can make it much better. But it's bad healthcare, and they're gonna get big increases, and that has nothing to do with me. That has to do with the fact that it was originally put into play. It's a shame. But we can make it better. Energy is way down. You know, you're gonna have $2 gasoline very soon. Nobody could believe it. You were at $4, $5, $6, and even $7. Look at the cost of gasoline in California. What it was, I brought it down. The problem is when I bring it down here in California they put more tax. They-- they tax the gasoline to such an extent. No, we're in great shape. This country is in great shape. We're ready to really rock. As I say often-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Are you-- are you-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --we were a dead country. We were a dead country one year ago. Now we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. Leaders have said that to me. Just recently they said that to me. Even President Xi, he said, "I'd like you-- you to be congratulated." He said it so beautifully. "I'd like you to be congratulated on the incredible job you did in bringing back the United States of America." President Xi said that to me. NORAH O'DONNELL: I know we're out of time, but just on that matter, we talked about that-- because I know how closely you follow the stock market. Do you worry about an AI bubble? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I guess. I worry about everything, you know? I mean, you know, I'm a worrier. I worry. But you know what I do? I worry and then I fix it. I fix it. That way I don't have to worry. NORAH O'DONNELL: There's a lotta money behind AI-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, there's a lotta money. And right now I'm taking advantage of it, because we're leading AI. You know, we're leading it by a lot. China's in second place, but we're leading it by a lot. We have the greatest minds of any country anywhere in the world, and we're using that. I'm using those great minds to help us. Now, will something happen later? I guess, you know, something. But it could also be something very good happens. And I hope it's gonna be very good. But if it's not so good, we're protected. Our country is doing great. We're strong. We're solid. We've never been-- I think we haven't been like this in-- maybe ever. Maybe ever. We have a great country, and you should be very proud of it. NORAH O'DONNELL: Mr. President, thank you very much for your time-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you very much, Norah. NORAH O'DONNELL:Thank you. NORAH O'DONNELL: Do I have the opportunity to ask you two more questions? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If you want, if it helps-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. Okay. Two more questions-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That means they'll treat me more fairly if I do-- I want to get-- It's very nice, yeah. Now is good. Okay. Uh, oh. These might be the ones I didn't want. I don't know. Okay, go ahead. NORAH O'DONNELL: Is everybody ready? NORAH O'DONNELL: This is a question about pardons. The Trump family is now perhaps more associated with cryptocurrency than real estate. You and your son-- your sons, Don Jr. and Eric, have formed World Liberty Financial with the Witkoff family. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Right. NORAH O'DONNELL: Helping to make your family millions of dollars. It's in that context that I do wanna ask you about crypto's richest man, a billionaire known as C.Z. He pled guilty in 2023 to violating anti-money laundering laws. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Right. NORAH O'DONNELL: Looked at this, the government at the time said that C.Z. had caused "significant harm to U.S. national security", essentially by allowing terrorist groups like Hamas to move millions of dollars around. Why did you pardon him? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Okay, are you ready? I don't know who he is. I know he got a four-month sentence or something like that. And I heard it was a Biden witch hunt. And what I wanna do is see crypto, 'cause if we don't do it it's gonna go to China, it's gonna go to-- this is no different to me than AI. My sons are involved in crypto much more than I-- me. I-- I know very little about it, other than one thing. It's a huge industry. And if we're not gonna be the head of it, China, Japan, or someplace else is. So I am behind it 100%. This man was, in my opinion, from what I was told, this is, you know, a four-month sentence. But this man was treated really badly by the Biden administration. And he was given a jail term. He's highly respected. He's a very successful guy. They sent him to jail and they really set him up. That's my opinion. I was told about it. I said, "Eh, it may look bad if I do it. I have to do the right thing." I don't know the man at all. I don't think I ever met him. Maybe I did. Or, you know, somebody shook my hand or something. But I don't think I ever met him. I have no idea who he is. I was told that he was a victim, just like I was and just like many other people, of a vicious, horrible group of people in the Biden administration. NORAH O'DONNELL: The government had accused him of "significant harm to U.S. national security"-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's the Biden government. NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. Allowing U.S. terrorist groups to, you know, essentially move millions of dollars around. He pled guilty to anti-money laundering laws. That was in 2023. Then in 2025 his crypto exchange, Binance, helped facilitate a $2 billion purchase of World Liberty Financial's stablecoin. And then you pardoned C.Z. How do you address the appearance of pay for play? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, here's the thing, I know nothing about it because I'm too busy doing the other-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But he got a pardon-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I can only tell you that-- NORAH O'DONNELL: He got a pardon-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Norah, I can only tell you this. My sons are into it. I'm glad they are, because it's probably a great industry, crypto. I think it's good. You know, they're running a business, they're not in government. And they're good-- my one son is a number one bestseller now. My wife just had a number one bestseller. I'm proud of them for doing that. I'm focused on this. I know nothing about the guy, other than I hear he was a victim of weaponization by government. When you say the government, you're talking about the Biden government. It's a corrupt government. Biden was the most corrupt president and he was the worst president we've ever had. I only care about one thing. Will crypto be-- will we be number one in crypto? Crypto has turned out, and in that sense I've been right. Crypto's turned out to be a massive industry, if you wanna call it that. And I'm very proud to say that we are far and away ahead of China and everybody else. Now, China is getting into it very big, right now. If you wanna go after people, you're gonna kill that industry. And it'll be very bad. Tremendous number of jobs. I campaigned positively on crypto, very openly. I campaigned. Biden campaigned against it. When Biden found out that I was getting, like, 100% of the crypto vote, which was a lot, he switched totally and he went in favor of crypto. They were totally in favor. They had many people under indictment. They let 'em all go. They let 'em all go. You know that. Many people were under indictment. Biden was a corrupt president. Biden went all in on crypto at the very end because he thought he could get some votes. It didn't work. They voted for me. I wanna make crypto great for America. That's the only thing. I don't wanna have somebody else have crypto and have China be number one in the world in crypto. Because in crypto it's a kind of an industry where basically you're going to have number one and you're not gonna have a number two. And right now we're number one by a long shot. I wanna keep it that way. The same way we're number one with AI, we're number one with crypto. And I wanna keep it that way. NORAH O'DONNELL: So not concerned about the appearance of corruption with this? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I can't say, because-- I can't say-- I'm not concerned. I don't-- I'd rather not have you ask the question. But I let you ask it. You just came to me and you said, "Can I ask another question?" And I said, yeah. This is the question-- NORAH O'DONNELL: And you answered-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't mind. Did I let you do it? I coulda walked away. I didn't have to answer this question. I'm proud to answer the question. You know why? We've taken crypto-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But just generally speak-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me. We're number one in crypto in the whole world. Other people wanna be. They're fighting like hell to be. But we're number one in crypto because I'm the president. Biden wanted to also, at the very end, you know, he totally switched his thing. You know, Biden was totally in favor of crypto at the end. Do you know that many people that were indicted under Biden for crypto, at the very end before the election, were let go? You know why? He wanted the vote. We are number one in crypto and that's the only thing I care about. I don't want China or anybody else to take it away. It's a massive industry. NORAH O'DONNELL: Mr. President, thank you. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you very much. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. Copyright ©2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

November 02, 2025 19:30 ET | Source: Faraday Future Faraday Future LOS ANGELES, Nov. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today shared a weekly business update from YT Jia, Founder and Global Co-CEO of FF. “Welcome to the 27th issue of our Weekly Report, also our first Half-Year Edition. Many investors have told us that reading this weekly report has already become a habit. It not only records the growth of FF and FX but also represents the process of fulfilling our commitments and co-creating the future together. To begin, here are three pieces of good news to share with everyone: Firstly, FF officially signed a Strategic Advisory Agreement with Chris Nixon Cox, grandson of former U.S. President Richard Nixon and Board Member of the Nixon Foundation, to accelerate the implementation of the company’s “EAI + Crypto” Dual-Flywheel and Dual-Bridge Strategy. We are very pleased to collaborate with Chris, a highly influential figure across the global political and business arenas with strong leadership in investment, policy, and regulatory affairs. We believe these valuable experiences could play an important role in helping FFAI achieve success at this pivotal stage of global expansion. Secondly, global asset management giant Vanguard’s Q3 13G filing showed it held about 7.1 million FFAI shares, up 36 percent from the end of Q2. Thirdly, following the FX Super One Middle East Final Launch, we signed with three B2B partners and received non-refundable deposits and non-binding preorders from them totaling more than 200 units of FX Super One, outperforming the initial target we had set. For the luxury EAI-MPV market in the Middle East, which is still in its early stage, achieving such results in such a short time as a new entrant proves that the groundwork we’ve laid over the past two years under our Three-Pole Strategy is truly paying off. With that, let’s dive into other progress we made this week in the EAI flywheel. On S2-S4 Product & Technology, Supply Chain, Production, and Delivery: The software and hardware upgrades and integration of the EAI F.A.C.E. production version, the most anticipated feature of our Super One, are now underway. The upgraded product could deliver an even more transformative EAI F.A.C.E. experience for our users. On S5 Capital Market and Finance: The team is now actively preparing for the quarterly financial report and the earnings call. We expect to file on schedule and present a comprehensive update on FX’s latest progress during the call. In addition, FF was invited to attend the 3rd Annual Bahamas Summit, where our Global President Jerry Wang delivered an important presentation on FF and FX that received highly positive feedback. The FF team, together with the Qualigen team, also attended the ThinkEquity Conference held in New York City this week, meeting with over 30 investors and receiving broad attention from Wall Street and also the broader capital market. Going to S6 in the Middle East: We also officially announced that soccer superstar Andrés Iniesta has become the first global owner of the FX Super One and our Developer Co-Creation Officer. Further details on our deepened collaboration with Andrés will be announced soon. The renowned football media outlet FourFourTwo ranked Andrés third among the greatest football players of the 21st century, highlighting his historic influence. Our collaboration with Andrés reflects the trust and recognition of a global sports legend in FF’s company and products. A quick look at the Crypto Flywheel: This week, all businesses under the Crypto Flywheel made steady progress. In particular, our Middle East subsidiary received its first FX Super One deposit paid with cryptocurrency, further validating the tremendous value and energy of our Web2 + Web3 meta-chemistry, where both ecosystems empower and reinforce each other. Finally, on Issues, Reflections, and Solutions: Some stockholders have asked why the FX 4 rear design rendering was not shown at the October 28 launch event, as previously mentioned. Here’s the explanation: First, FX 4 is planned to make its debut in the U.S. market, so we decided to keep the Middle East launch focused on its core highlights and made corresponding content adjustments. Second, the overall timeline for FX 4 has been slightly shifted based on our latest strategic planning, and we plan to show its rear design rendering during the time period of the Los Angeles Auto Show in November, subject to securing the necessary agreements. We do look forward to sharing more updates at that time. And that’s all for today, I will see you next week.” ABOUT FARADAY FUTURE Faraday Future is a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company.

Title: Trump’s Industrial Policy: What’s Right and Wrong

Time Published: 2025-11-02T23:25:19Z
Full Content:
In recent months, Donald Trump’s administration has supplemented its globe-spanning tariffs with bespoke industrial policy deals with U.S. corporations. These include the federal government taking equity stakes in Intel, a “golden share” in U.S. Steel, and profit sharing on Nvidia and AMD’s chip sales in China. The deals have astonished and unnerved economic analysts across the political spectrum. Commentators from The Wall Street Journal editorial page to MSNBC have decried them as “unprecedented” and amounting to “socialism,” “corporatism,” or “state capitalism with American characteristics.” In truth, Trump’s actions are rooted in a long history of presidents from both parties taking temporary control or ownership of systemically important companies. However, until now, most of these interventions have been temporary and involved either wartime emergencies or too-big-to-fail corporate collapse. Under Woodrow Wilson, the federal government took temporary ownership of the railroad industry to support troops during World War I. During World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt’s administration directed much of the corporate industrial sector. In 1980, Jimmy Carter’s administration extended loan guarantees to Chrysler in exchange for stock warrants. After the company recovered and repaid its loans, the government earned $311 million in capital gains. During the financial crisis, Barack Obama’s administration provided the auto industry with tens of billions of dollars in exchange for equity stakes and commitments for substantial restructuring. Trump’s moves also build on recent industrial policy interventions by his and Joe Biden’s administrations. Until now, those policies stopped short of the government seeking direct influence over corporate governance through golden shares or equity stakes. During his first term, Trump primarily conducted industrial policy through targeted tariffs and trade actions to promote American industry, and by jawboning corporations to boost domestic manufacturing. The Biden administration went further, providing computer chip and clean energy companies with hundreds of billions of dollars—and detailed requirements for how they could be spent—as part of a long-term post-neoliberal industrial strategy for national security. Those actions were consistent with, though a major step beyond, Trump’s first-term trade policies, just as Trump’s second-term corporate dealmaking is an advance on Biden’s (even if neither president would admit it). So, while Trump’s dealmaking spree is not unprecedented, it ventures into new territory reflecting his strongman tendencies: He has claimed for himself concentrated power to oversee and influence corporate decision-making, authority thus far ceded to him by Congress and the courts. He has operated outside the law through handshake deals that corporations often cannot afford to refuse, endowing the presidency with powerful—and dangerous—economic tools for routine use. This is unlikely to be a mere Trump-era aberration. Presidents typically don’t forego inherited powers. Today’s novelty policies may become tomorrow’s precedent, as the last decade has shown. Some elements of industrial policy with Trumpist characteristics may become long-term features of American governance. But Congress and the judiciary should assert democratic and constitutional control over American industrial policy now and in the future to prevent its abuse and, potentially, its collapse. Here’s a rundown of Trump’s corporate dealmaking thus far: U.S. Steel: In June, the White House greenlit Nippon Steel’s takeover bid for the American steelmaker U.S. Steel. Trump overturned Biden’s blocking of the deal—on the condition that the government receive a “golden share” of the company, allowing it to veto major corporate decisions, such as offshoring jobs and closing plants. MP Materials: In July, the Department of Defense announced an investment in MP Materials, the country’s only active producer of certain rare earth minerals used for military equipment. The deal provided government support for the company, guaranteeing a minimum price for its products and providing a guaranteed buyer—the federal government—for all its output for the next 10 years. The feds also extended a $150 million loan and purchased $400 million in company stock, making it MP’s largest shareholder. Japan: Also in July, the White House announced a trade deal with Japan that purportedly included Tokyo creating a $550 billion investment fund for the administration to use toward its industrial policy priorities, including energy infrastructure, semiconductor manufacturing, critical mineral supply chains, pharmaceutical production, and shipbuilding. Japan quickly contested the administration’s description of the deal, explaining that the investment fund would be nearly entirely composed of loans the U.S. would need to repay. Nvidia and AMD: In August, the administration agreed to allow the semiconductor makers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices to sell certain modified chips in China, reversing national security restrictions. The companies also agreed to give 15 percent of all profits earned in China to the U.S. government. Intel: Later that month, the administration took a 10 percent equity stake in the chipmaker Intel. The deal converted billions of dollars in grants the company was due under the CHIPS and Science Act into equity stakes, making the federal government Intel’s largest shareholder. That conversion also, without any legal authority, dispensed with CHIPS Act taxpayer safeguards that required Intel to reach milestones toward completing new domestic manufacturing sites to receive federal funding. Trump’s economic interventions bear a number of distinctive qualities that expand on industrial policy precedent, but five stand out. 1. Unilateralism: Trump’s industrial policy has been personalist, flowing from and controlled by the president himself. Unlike the Biden administration, which shepherded industrial policy bills through Congress, Trump relies exclusively on executive action. His industrial policy has at times been colored by favoritism and personal relationships. The Nvidia export agreement, for instance, came after meetings between Trump and CEO Jensen Huang. The president himself asked Huang for a share of the company’s Chinese profits. In other cases, bargained-for benefits have been structured to accrue directly under Trump’s control. The Nippon Steel agreement gave control of the golden share not to the office of the president but to Trump himself; only after he leaves office does the share transfer to the secretaries of treasury and commerce. Finally, the (contested) $550 billion pot from Japan would be, according to Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, a fund to be spent however Trump wished—part of “a national security and economic fund managed by Donald Trump.” 2. Public ownership in the absence of a fiscal crisis or national security justification: While direct government ownership of industry is not unheard of in American history, the Trump administration has been uniquely eager to wield it as a routine industrial policy tool. The MP Materials and Intel deals both gave the government equity ownership of private companies, and the U.S. Steel approval netted the government special, powerful veto rights over that company’s decision-making. After announcing the (contested) terms of the Japan trade deal, administration officials even contemplated using the deal’s (disputed) investment fund to build government-owned factories that could then be leased to private companies. 3. Bullying individual companies: Trump has a quid pro quo mentality of wanting a cut of any private gains he feels he has facilitated—he has openly compared his presidential dealmaking to waiving property rights on his real estate for the benefit of a third party, in exchange for a fee. When he agreed to grant Nvidia export licenses to sell modified chips in China, Trump told its chief executive, “If I’m going to do that, I want you to pay us something.” Or as Lutnick described the Intel equity stake, “If we’re going to give you the money, we want a piece of the action.” 4. Leveraging government power: Beyond just flexing the rhetorical might of the presidential bully pulpit, Trump has used the levers of government to offer firms deals they can’t refuse. The administration has created or exploited bargaining power to induce targeted firms to relent to its demands. Under export control regulations, Nvidia and AMD needed the administration’s permission to sell chips in China, forcing them to acquiesce to Trump’s profit-sharing demand. Nippon Steel could not take over U.S. Steel without approval from the government’s foreign investment review committee. Shortly before Intel agreed to the equity deal, Trump ratcheted up the pressure by calling for its executive to be fired and withholding its CHIPS Act grants. Two other examples illustrate Trump’s leverage power plays. In May, he issued an executive order instructing pharmaceutical companies to agree to adhere to “most-favored-nation price targets … to bring prices for American patients in line with comparably developed nations.” The order threatened that the administration would put the squeeze on pharmaceutical companies that don’t comply, through newly authorized competition from drug imports, restrictions on their own exports, antitrust scrutiny, reconsideration of FDA approvals of their drugs, and loss of National Institutes of Health grants. And in August, the administration announced that it would impose high tariffs on semiconductor imports—but would exempt tech companies that made new domestic investment pledges. The administration thus imposed tariffs to create leverage and offered relief from those tariffs to advance its industrial policy goals. 5. Legally dubious boundary pushing: Much of Trump’s industrial policy has operated in legal gray zones. To bypass routine federal contracting and procurement laws that typically require competitive bidding, the administration’s investment in MP Materials relied on a little-used provision of the Defense Production Act authorizing transactions “without regard to the limitations of existing law.” Trump’s profit-sharing deal with Nvidia and AMD flouts prohibitions on export taxes and fees under both the Constitution and federal law. There is also no firm legal basis under the CHIPS Act to convert Intel’s grants into equity (nor was there to withhold its grants in the first place). Trump has avoided legal constraints by relying on “regulation by deal,” rather than legislation or agency rulemaking. (He’s also been firing the regulators who would otherwise shape such government interventions.) Companies have acquiesced to White House demands that may not otherwise withstand legal scrutiny to avoid lost business opportunities, the cost and time of litigating against the federal government, and the general ire of the Trump administration. This has insulated much of Trump’s industrial policy from administrative procedure, due process, and judicial review. Some elements of Trump’s approach are likely to endure. The wraparound support for MP Materials, for example, could well become a model for how the U.S. government cultivates strategically important domestic production. The type of golden share Trump obtained in U.S. Steel could be on the table for future mitigation agreements between the federal government and foreign companies seeking to invest in critical domestic sectors. As I have written for this magazine, there are also compelling reasons for the government to insist on a direct return on its industrial policy investments. Taking equity stakes in semiconductor companies funded by the CHIPS Act was originally a Bernie Sanders proposal. When used in the right context, equity stakes ensure that industrial policy returns upside revenue to the public, instead of merely socializing profits for corporations. External trends may also lend Trump’s industrial policy approach greater staying power. As policymakers seek new revenue sources beyond traditional taxation, they may increasingly look to levers like equity stakes, profit-sharing agreements, and royalties. Congress’s tendency toward gridlock and paralysis has long spurred administrations to seek creative executive workarounds, but the courts have increasingly limited the discretion given to the administrative state. That may steer administrations toward regulation-by-deal as a flexible means for the executive branch to regain power from the judiciary. It’s not hard to imagine where Trumpist industrial policy may be headed. White House advisers have said they will seek equity stakes in other companies receiving federal grants and loans to seed a sovereign wealth fund. Moreover, if Intel cannot right its ship, it may be forced to revisit previous discussions of spinning off its semiconductor factories to a foreign firm like the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. The Trump administration, which has opposed such a move, could, as Intel’s largest shareholder, dictate the terms of such a deal. (Indeed, the Intel agreement included a poison pill to stymie the sale of its foundries.) Plus, any such sale must win the administration’s approval through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. One could imagine the administration negotiating on economic and national security grounds for government ownership of Intel’s factories, which could then be leased to another chipmaker. Trump’s industrial policy toolkit may empower future administrations with different priorities. For instance, federal policies—steep tariffs and national security exclusions—are sparing U.S. automakers from a flood of low-cost, cutting-edge Chinese electric vehicles. A future administration could condition that continued industry protection on American carmakers offering more affordable low-emissions vehicles and ramping up their research and development investments. A future administration could use the specter of the government’s statutory powers to limit or override patents on federally funded technologies to negotiate long-term profit-sharing agreements with artificial intelligence companies. It could also use similar authority to negotiate price reductions from pharmaceutical companies and leverage the Medicare Advantage market to acquire golden shares in health insurance companies, with veto power over major corporate decisions. A future Democratic administration could grant targeted tariff reductions to countries or companies that decarbonize their energy grids and production processes—and dangle extra reductions to those that use American-made clean energy technology. It could use the Defense Production Act’s preemption power to expedite clean energy and new housing development around other legal impediments. If the industrial policy arc from the first Trump administration to the Biden administration is any guide, the next Democratic president will make fulsome use of these kinds of Trump-inspired tools. So sheer inertia may well propel Trumpist industrial policy forward. But there are several stark and urgent reasons Congress and the courts should pump the brakes and reconsider major elements of Trump’s approach. For one, this approach may simply yield worse industrial policy. Absent exceeding care and deliberation, go-it-alone executive branch industrial policy can overreach and implode without the safeguards and democratic legitimacy of operating through Congress. Even if Trump’s deals successfully evade the courts, a subsequent administration could deem some contrary to law and declare them null and void—regulation by deal has far less long-term durability than regulation by regulation, let alone legislation. Such whipsawing will make the U.S. government a less reliable, more tumultuous economic actor. For another, elements of Trump’s industrial policy are a recipe for abuse and corruption. Pay-to-play regimes for exporting sensitive technologies to foreign adversaries jeopardize fair competition and national security. Personalist policymaking is a recipe for cronyism, corruption, and favoritism for well-connected dominant firms. As The New York Times reported, Trump’s family was directly benefiting from billions of dollars of investment in its crypto company by the United Arab Emirates—at the same time it agreed to provide the UAE with highly sensitive and valuable advanced semiconductor chips. It is all too easy to foresee more future gambits redounding to the private benefit of the Trump family (like the Paramount merger with Skydance, which routed $16 million into the Trump presidential library). Moreover, while leverage can be useful for achieving policy aims, marshaling the vast regulatory state as one big pressure cooker to coerce concessions from targeted companies risks undermining other vital policy interests. We’re already seeing that regarding antitrust. Companies seeking merger approvals have won favorable treatment from the Trump administration by making side promises for domestic manufacturing investments. The potential for Trumpist misuse of industrial policy risks poisoning the whole enterprise. That’s where Congress and the courts come in—or where they should. Congress was a true coequal branch during the Biden administration’s major industrial policy programs, shaping and passing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act through normal legislative processes. It could again instill democratic prerogatives and guardrails for industrial policy. Congress could determine when the government should take equity stakes in private companies. It could set ground rules around taking golden shares, like which corporate decisions may be subject to a government veto and which are off-limits. It could set standards around appropriate uses of revenue-sharing deals with the federal government. It could stipulate where the revenue generated from industry policy investments should go and how it should be spent. It could set rules preventing the government from unduly favoring companies where it has taken equity stakes in competitor firms. It could establish safeguards to ensure that industrial policy is not used to enrich public officials. Meanwhile, the courts may need to revisit legal doctrines like standing to ensure that some party can contest deals of questionable legality, like the Nvidia revenue-sharing agreement or the Intel equity swap. If Congress fails to act, it could be understood as blessing Trump’s mode of industrial policy by one-man dealmaking. That doesn’t just invite corruption, but is also a recipe for managerial disaster. The Obama administration’s masterful overhaul of Detroit is arguably less remembered today than the failure of Solyndra. After receiving an Energy Department loan, the solar panel firm’s bankruptcy led to a series of high-profile investigations that ultimately uncovered no criminal wrongdoing or corruption but soured the public on Obama’s nascent clean energy industrial strategy. With Trump’s state capitalism, the hands-off market fundamentalism era is over. The question is whether the government’s new terms of engagement with industry will be dominated by the president or deliberated on by Congress and the courts. Acquiescence by the other branches to Trump’s deals, warts and all, risks heralding the unchecked and unbalanced industrial policy of the unitary executive. Activation by them, however, could lead to a whole-of-government effort to sand away the roughest edges of Trump’s approach to craft an industrial policy that is both powerful and responsible to effectively guide the country forward.

ByRussell Flannery, Senior Contributor. Liang Zaizhong, the son of China manufacturing billionaire Liang Wengen, resigned as chairman of Sany Heavy Equipment International effective Oct. 31, the Hong Kong-listed company said in an announcement on Friday. Sany Heavy Equipment International, whose products include port equipment, named Zhou Fugui, a long-time Sany Group executive, as new chairman. Sany Heavy Equipment International also said Qi Jian would step down from roles as vice chairman Qi Jian and executive director “to enhance the company’s corporate governance structure and strengthen the rotation mechanism of the strategic leadership team.” Qi will remain CEO; Liang Zaizhong will stay on as an executive director. The changes at the top come after Sany Heavy Equipment International’s shares gained more than 45% in the past 12 months; the company said on Oct. 30 net profit rose by 16% from a year earlier to 414 million yuan in the three months to September. Liang Wengen, 68, is the founder and former chairman of Shanghai- and Hong Kong-listed Sany Heavy Industry, a construction equipment maker which has thrived over the years from China’s building and infrastructure boom. China’s richest man in 2011, Liang Wengen currently holds a fortune worth $8.8 billion, according to the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires list. Son Liang Zaizong, 40, holds a bachelor’s degree in computer and management sciences from the University of Warwick. He received a master’s degree in public administration from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in May 2014. Both father and son are board members at Sany Heavy Industry. Sany Heavy Industry just last week sold $1.7 billion of “H shares” that began trading at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Oct. 28 at HK$21.30; they closed at HK$23.38 on Friday. Sany Heavy Industry’s Shanghai-traded shares, known as “A shares,” have gained 21% in the past 12 months. The Changsha-headquartered company, a global competitor of Caterpillar and Deere, said on Thursday net profit in the three months to September rose by 48% to 1.9 billion yuan, on revenue that increased 10.7% to 21.2 billion yuan. Sany Heavy Industry is among a group of Chinese companies trading at mainland exchanges to successfully seek an additional listing at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange this year, making the bourse one of the world’s most important for new offerings this year. Others include Contemporary Amperex Technology, better known as CATL, and Zhejiang Sanhua Intelligent Controls. Cornerstone investors in Sany Heavy Industry’s H share offering included Temasek, BlackRock, Infore Capital, Hillhouse and UBS Asset Management. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index has risen more than 27% in the past year. Sany’s history traces to China’s central Hunan province in 1989 as a small welding materials factory. Other Sany-connected billionaires include Xiang Wenbo ($1.4 billion), Mao Zhongwu ($1.3 billion) and Tang Xiuguo ($1.4 billion). Sany America, Sany Heavy Industry’s main U.S. operation, is headquartered in Peachtree City, Georgia.

Title: The Case Against Quarterly Reporting By Public Companies– Part 1, The Fundamentals

ByGeorge Calhoun, Contributor. U.S. financial regulators will soon modify or rescind the 55-year old rule requiring public companies to issue formal financial reports every 90 days. Surveys of business leaders consistently reveal concerns about the cost and distraction of preparing and managing the short-cycle reporting process. They also provide evidence of a short-term bias in corporate decision-making, linked to the pressures of the current quarterly reporting cycle. There is an acknowledged tendency to sacrifice long-term strategic investments, alter accounting schedules, and incur other financial penalties (e.g., customer discounts for favorable purchase arrangements) in order to meet quarterly earnings targets. Meanwhile, academic and industry studies indicate that semiannual reporting does not impair, and may even improve, company performance, the functioning of financial markets, and the quality of financial information available to investors. Finally, the quarterly reporting regime has created a significant short-term disruption or distortion of trading patterns centered around the earnings announcement – dubbed the “Earnings Game” – characterized by abnormal volatility, evidence of mispricing and market anomalies or inefficiencies, an open door to market manipulation, and disadvantages for small investors in particular. In this Part 1, we will review the “big picture” arguments pro and con. In Part 2, the focus will be on the nature and consequences of the Earnings Game. The United States stands alone (almost) among advanced economies in requiring quarterly financial reports from all public companies. The Securities and Exchange Commission enacted the quarterly reporting requirement in 1970. It has evolved into a highly structured, closely regulated framework which defines how companies communicate with the financial markets. Other countries have experimented with the American model – and then abandoned it. The European Union mandated quarterly reporting in 2004, but rescinded the rule in 2013. British regulators instituted a quarterly reporting requirement in 2007 – and repealed it seven years later. Singapore was quarterly for 17 years until 2020. Japan’s experiment with full quarterly reporting ran from 2003 to 2024. (Only Canada still follows the American example.) The SEC has now indicated that it wants to eliminate the quarterly reporting requirement in favor of semiannual reports by late next year, with full implementation expected by 2028. It is of course controversial. The arguments both for and against the proposed change tend to focus on how reporting frequency might influence the way companies are managed or the way markets function. Both sides often rely on deductions from “theory,” or simple appeals to “obviousness” – rather than hard evidence, which is scarce (for reasons discussed below). In the following sections, we’ll state the case for each side and review the available evidence. The main argument for change is the claim that quarterly reporting encourages “short-termism” – a tendency for companies to sacrifice long-term growth and investment in favor of short-term measures aimed at boosting quarterly results. This was the rationale for ending mandatory quarterly reporting in the EU. The EU even sees a “problem” with companies that continue to issue quarterly reports voluntarily. Regulators are said to be considering “more draconian measures, including ways to discourage or ban listed companies from reporting on a quarterly basis” even when they are not required to do so. UK regulators followed the recommendations of the Kay Report (authored by the prominent economist John Kay), which defined short-termism as “a tendency to under-investment, whether in physical assets or in intangibles such as product development, employee skills and reputation with customers” and sought ways to “reduce the pressures for short-term decision making that arise from excessively frequent reporting of financial and investment performance (including quarterly reporting by companies).” American critics of “quarterly capitalism” have included Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton (who coined the phrase), and Joe Biden, who wrote in 2016 that – Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan, and Warren Buffett have criticized the “short-termism that is harming the economy” driven by an “unhealthy focus on quarterly earnings.” Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, blames “today’s culture of quarterly earnings hysteria” which is “totally contrary to the long-term approach we need.” David Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs, believes investors “can get adequate financial disclosure in two reporting cycles and it frees up both time and economic opportunity to really focus on the business and take a longer term view.” Norway abolished quarterly reporting in that country in 2017, and the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund ($1.8 Tn) has proposed eliminating quarterly reporting for all public companies everywhere, citing the “risk of companies prioritizing short-term profits and the meeting of analyst forecasts over long-term investment, value creation and sustainable development.” The former Chairman of Temasek, the Singapore sovereign wealth fund, cited the problem of short-termism among investors: “Issuing three-monthly updates on corporate performance does not improve transparency but does encourage investors to take a damagingly short-term view of their equity holding.” The President of the New York Stock Exchange focused her comments on the “burdensome” cost of preparing and managing short-cycle financial reporting. So, too, Nasdaq – Many leaders of nonfinancial firms believe that eliminating this short-term bias would improve business operations. Unilever’s CEO said that after the company stopped issuing quarterly reports – The Vice-Chairman of General Motors concurred: “The search for quarterly earnings is the father of many, many bad product decisions.” In sum, advocates of less frequent reporting argue that the current quarterly cycle tends to distort business decision-making, and thereby harms investors. It may even constitute a “threat to America’s enduring prosperity” (to again quote former President Biden). Traditionalists in the financial establishment generally line up against the proposed change, and their opposition tends to be categorical. The Wall Street Journal called the proposal to abandon the quarterly reporting cycle “wrong in every possible way.” They dismiss the short-termism argument out of hand – “utter tosh”(again, The Wall Street Journal). The general success of American business, and strong equity market valuations, are reason enough to reject it. Robust capital spending is also seen as proof that short-termism is a myth. Advocates of the status quo are worried about the negative consequences of less frequent reporting. Their arguments are based on classical Finance Theory. For example, the stock market (in theory) aggregates vast quantities of information about each company – its assets, its performance, its prospects, its customers, its competitive position in its sector, its role in the global economy – to calculate the correct current price and value of the company’s shares. Prices serve as signals to direct the proper allocation of capital. More frequent updates must always be preferable… because… well, more information must be better than less information, right? “Less frequent reporting would lead to less information and riskier markets,” as well as “greater volatility in securities prices.” It would impair price discovery, and render markets less “efficient.” Distorted asset prices would cause capital misallocation and trigger a cascade of evils – Other consequences of eliminating quarterly reporting could include: In sum, opponents of change see the quarterly reporting cycle as a critical guard rail that, if removed, would alter the way markets work and the way public companies are managed, to the general detriment. Many of these arguments are conjectural. For example, I know of no way to measure “market discipline” or to empirically estimate “misallocation of capital” on a quarterly or half-yearly basis. Moreover, because all U.S. public companies have been required to report quarterly since 1970, there is no recent comparative data. Some studies have tried to reach back to find a point of reference before the rule change, in, say, the Eisenhower era. However, the economy is much changed since then, as are the accounting and tax rules, the technology base, the financial markets, and management practices. 70-year-old data is just too stale. In other countries, however, where quarterly reporting is no longer required, some companies still do report voluntarily on a quarterly basis. EU firms are currently divided more or less equally between quarterly and half-yearly reporters, which sets up a plausible A/B comparison. (We will look at some of this data below, but there is an important caveat. Decisions about reporting frequency are not random. Many confounding factors are involved, including company size, the behavior of peers in the same sector, seasonality of the business, and management style.) The UK provides another natural experiment. Prior to 2014, quarterly reporting was mandatory. Today, “almost all” UK companies report semiannually. This sets up an interesting Pre-Post test (although there are possibly important differences between the two time periods). All that said, and with the appropriate caveats – the non-U.S evidence supports a surprising conclusion: Analysts have compared quarterly and semiannual reporters in the EU and UK on the basis of: The only recent study of the effect of reporting frequency on fundamental business performance comes from Goldman Sachs. Analysts compared the business performance of quarterly reporters and semiannual reporters in the EU Stoxx 600 index, and found little difference in return on equity, average net profit margins, and earnings per share growth. On the central question of short-termism, one approach is to look at levels of capital expenditure. Long-term investments should draw down earnings and net cash flows in the short term. A short-term bias would show up as a lower level of such investment at quarterly reporters compared with firms which do not report as frequently. The UK offers a double test – first imposing a mandatory quarterly reporting requirement in 2007 and then removing it in 2014. A study for the CFA Institute found that when quarterly reporting was imposed in 2007 it “had no material impact on the investment decisions of UK public companies.” When the mandate was lifted seven years later – A 2023 “Pre-Post” comparison in the UK examined the effect of reporting frequency on the quality of accounting information included in financial reports. The result was “counterintuitive.” An earlier study (2010) looked at the quality of information from the investors’ perspective. The result was also contrary to theory-based expectations. The previously cited Goldman Sachs study found essentially no difference in the price-earnings ratios for quarterly vs semiannual reporting companies in the EU sample. A 2010 study assessed “share price informativeness” for quarterly and half-yearly reporters in several EU markets – a measure of pricing accuracy and market efficiency based on the speed with which share prices anticipate, capture and reflect new earnings information – the efficiency of the price discovery process. It was unaffected by reporting frequency. The same study looked at the surprise caused by the earnings announcement – conceptualized as the difference between investors’ earnings estimates and the actual results. It is measured by the level of abnormal volatility and trading volume on the announcement date. It turns out that earning surprises are not dampened by more frequent reporting. And – Surprise reflects a disconnect between investors’ expectations and reality as revealed in the earnings announcement. It can be seen as an indication of the degree of mispricing in the market ahead of the earnings date. By this measure, quarterly reporting is associated with greater mispricing prior to the earnings release than semiannual reporting. This is a powerful and important deduction from classical Finance Theory. It is likely true, to some degree, and is often repeated as an article of faith. It justifies the quarterly cycle (for advocates of the status quo). The evidence is sketchy at best. “Cost of capital” is typically modeled rather than measured directly. The models depend on a set of complex assumptions, some of which are highly questionable. (For example, the “weighted average cost of capital” that all MBA students learn to calculate assumes that “perfect capital markets exist.”) The issue can also seem to cut both ways. More frequent updates presumably reduce risk and lower the cost of capital for quarterly reporters. But if less frequent reporting is associated with higher quality financial information (as studies cited above show), that should also reduce uncertainty, reduce risk, and thereby reduce the cost of capital for semiannual reporters. One oft-cited study concludes simply that “the benefits of mandatory disclosures are likely to differ across firms.” It should also be remarked that if a company is topically concerned about its cost of capital – say, in connection with a forthcoming funding round – it can always release information on a more frequent basis voluntarily. (And of course, material events must always be disclosed by means of an 8-K filing.) Then there is the question of mindset, or bias. A survey of 400 Chief Financial Officers of U.S. public companies published in 2005 found that “a surprising 78% of the sample admits to sacrificing long-term value” in order to “smooth earnings.” Nearly 40% said they would give discounts to customers to accelerate future spending plans to increase the company’s reportable sales in the current quarter – forfeiting a percentage of revenue to buff up the 10-Q. The payoff is said to be predictability. At the very least, such measures muddy the quality of the information provided to investors, and may shade towards illegal manipulation. Earnings management and/or manipulation has been the subject of dozens of academic studies, with a variety of definitions and methodologies, so that estimates of the prevalence of these practices vary widely. But it seems clear that the pressure of quarterly reporting deadlines can warp managerial decisions in many cases. So, with regard to “short-termism” the evidence seems mixed. The UK accounting data say no, but survey results confirm a short-term bias among U.S. executives, which is significantly exacerbated by the earnings calendar. That said – after five decades, U.S. public company executives are by now fully habituated to the quarterly reporting cycle – and as opponents of change readily point out, American economic exceptionalism seems unimpaired. Compared to other countries, U.S. businesses are more profitable, the market values of U.S. public companies are higher, and U.S. strategic leadership in many sectors of the global economy (e.g., Tech, Finance, Pharma and Energy) is clear cut. It could be argued that somehow short-termism has served the U.S. economy very well. Perhaps it is an antidote for the complacency which otherwise tends to infect the management mindset in all large and successful organizations. So, short-term biases may exist, but do they matter? Does quarterly reporting help or harm the company and its investors? Would less frequent reporting impair market functioning? The hard evidence, such as it is, suggests that reporting frequency has very little effect, perhaps favoring semiannual reporting slightly. Ambiguity encourages both sides. The New York Times – which leans towards maintaining the status quo – summarized “numerous studies [that] found no discernible improvements in corporate planning or performance in countries where [less frequent reporting] has been tried” – implying no need for change. But a semantically equivalent rephrasing – “Numerous studies found no discernible difference in corporate planning or performance related to reporting frequency” – could equally well support the argument for joining the global consensus. And there may be very good reasons to do so. Quarterly capitalism has created what has come to be called the “Earnings Game”– where company managers, analysts, and investors maneuver for advantage in the turmoil before and after the official earnings release. It generates a characteristic distortion of the market, and a symbiotic distortion of management behavior. The quality of financial information is often compromised. Mispricings develop. Trading is abnormal and even chaotic. The participants are tempted to pursue quasi-adversarial and sometimes dysfunctional strategies, which open the door to market manipulation, inspire or reinforce short-termist biases in business decision-making, and increase the overall risk for investors. It is likely that retail investors in particular are disadvantaged, trading against professionals who have developed sophisticated techniques for exploiting the market anomalies created by the earnings game. Part 2 of this column will examine this game and its consequences, which make a stronger case for changing the current reporting cycle than the shallow theoretical arguments that have dominated the debate so far.

The US labor marketâs post-pandemic penchant for holding on to employees is coming to an end, analysts say. For years, many large businesses effectively hoarded workers, leading to a âno hire, no fireâ environment; thatâs now shifted to a âno hire, more fireâ job market, a Reuters columnist wrote. Amazon, UPS, Intel, Accenture, and Microsoft have announced layoffs recently, citing shrinking margins and the adoption of AI. Investors have welcomed the job cuts this year; one economist likened the mood to the 1990s, when âwe used to reward companies for letting people go.â The trend carries risks for the broader economy â though experts donât have the full picture without official data, which isnât being released during the US government shutdown.

Title: It’s getting harder to separate the stock market from the economy. That means the Fed and Congress have more incentive to help Wall Street

Jason Ma is the weekend editor at Fortune, where he covers markets, the economy, finance, and housing. After huge rallies or selloffs, it’s often pointed out that the stock market is not the economy, or that Wall Street is not Main Street. But that divide is getting blurrier. That’s because higher asset prices are spurring consumers to spend more freely than before, and consumption represents about 70% of GDP. In fact, this so-called wealth effect has become more potent in just the past 15 years. Today, every 1% increase in stock wealth translates to a 0.05% uptick in consumer spending, according to a note last week from Oxford Economics lead U.S. economist Bernard Yaros. In other words, a $1 increase in stock wealth leads to a $0.05 marginal propensity to consume, up from less than $0.02 in 2010. Meanwhile, every $1 increase in housing wealth leads to a $0.04 bump in consumption, up from $0.03. “As households see their wealth rise, they turn more sanguine about their personal financial situation and are more inclined to loosen their purse strings,” Yaros wrote. “Increases in wealth will also propel spending by allowing homeowners to extract more equity from their houses or to liquidate appreciated stocks to fund their current consumption.” He sees the wealth effect sending the marginal propensity to consume even higher in the coming years because retirees will comprise a bigger share of the population. Given that they already enjoy a bigger net worth than younger generations do, retirees will rely more on their wealth to support consumption after they stop working and earning an income, Yaros explained. On top of that, the ubiquity of digital media means consumer sentiment reacts even quicker to market news, reinforcing these wealth effects, he added. This more powerful wealth effect could help explain why consumer spending has stayed resilient. Even as President Donald Trump’s trade war has kept inflation sticky and made businesses more nervous about adding workers in an uncertain landscape, AI is still propelling the stock market to new record high after record high. At the same time, the stock market has grown more dependent on AI-related stocks, such as chip leader Nvidia along with so-called hyperscalers like Microsoft and Google. Based on his wealth-to-spending math, Yaros estimated that stock market gains in the past 12 months from the tech sector alone will boost annual consumption by nearly $250 billion, which would account for more than 20% of the cumulative spending increase. “While the stock market is not the economy, the latter risks greater whiplash from the ups and downs in the former,” he wrote. Analysts at JPMorgan also looked at the the link between the AI boom and consumers in a note last month. They estimated U.S. households gained more than $5 trillion in wealth in the past year from 30 AI-linked stocks, raising their annualized level of spending by about $180 billion. That represents just 0.9% of total consumption, but JPMorgan noted that it could go higher if AI spurs gains in a broader array of stocks or in other assets like real estate. And stocks are not limited to wealthier Americans either. A survey released last month from the BlackRock Foundation and Commonwealth showed that over 54% of Americans earning $30,000 to $79,999 a year are retail investors in the capital markets. And more than half of that cohort began investing in the past five years. To be sure, the wealthiest still spend the most dollars, and the emerging K-shaped economy has magnified their impact. Research from Moody’s found that the top 10% of earners accounted for half of spending in the second quarter, a record high. Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone, attributed that to the wealth effect from stock and real estate gains as well as from income disparities. “Tying all this together produces two things—an economy increasingly reliant on discretionary spending among higher earners, and higher earners whose discretionary spending is reliant on risk assets remaining buoyant,” he said in a note on Tuesday. This dynamic means central bankers at the Fed who control monetary policy and lawmakers in Congress who control fiscal policy have a greater incentive to support the stock market, Brown added. That’s because the wealth effect can work in the reverse direction, meaning falling asset prices will slow spending and the economy. “What we have, then, is an economy that’s tied increasingly closely to the fortunes of the equity market, and an equity market that’s increasingly tied to overall consumer spending, which coupled together result in stronger ‘put’ structure to backstop risk assets, with fiscal stimulus continuing, and monetary backdrops becoming looser,” he said. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Something Just Broke – It Appears That A Liquidity Crisis Is Upon Us, And That Is Really Bad News For The Financial Markets

The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? What is the Fed not telling us? The numbers clearly indicate that big trouble is brewing in the banking system. I wish that I could specifically tell you which banks are in the most trouble, but at this stage we simply aren’t being told anything. They probably figure that the best approach is to try to keep everyone as calm as possible. But they won’t be able to keep a lid on what is going on indefinitely, and when word finally gets out people could start to panic. In recent weeks, bank reserves have fallen to alarmingly low levels. In fact, last week they fell to the lowest level that we have seen in more than four years… US bank reserves have crashed to a four-year low, plunging to about $2.8 trillion, according to the latest Federal Reserve data, sending fresh warning signals across Wall Street and Washington. The steep decline marks the second straight week reserves have stayed below $3 trillion, a critical threshold analysts say could test the banking system’s liquidity strength. By itself, this doesn’t necessarily signal that we are facing a major crisis. But everyone agrees that what we are witnessing is certainly unusual. What is causing far more alarm is what occurred on Friday. All of a sudden, there was an insane amount of demand for overnight repo cash… Federal Reserve reportedly pumped about $29.4 billion into the markets via overnight repos. That’s a big number and it signals something I’m watching closely. According to the data for “Overnight Repurchase Agreements — Treasury Securities Purchased by the Fed” the figure for Oct 31, 2025 is $29.400 billion. In other words: The Fed is quietly stepping in and stepping up. To me, this is clear evidence that something just broke. Who suddenly needed that much cash? And why did they need it? The chart that I have posted below comes directly from the Federal Reserve, and it should chill you to the core… But that wasn’t the end of it. By the end of the day on Friday, it was quite obvious that something extremely strange had just happened… Federal Reserve liquidity facilities caught fire on Friday as month-end pressures pushed a key lending tool to a record level of usage. The Fed’s Standing Repo Facility lent a total of $50.35 billion on Friday to eligible financial firms in two separate availabilities, the highest-ever usage since the tool was put in place in 2021 to provide fast loans collateralized with Treasury or mortgage bonds. At the same time, financial firms also parked a considerable amount of cash on Fed books, with the reverse repo facility seeing inflows of $51.8 billion. So what is the bottom line? The bottom line is that it very much smells like a major crisis is brewing. But let’s wait and see what happens on Monday. If we see figures on Monday that are fairly normal, perhaps we have more time before things start breaking loose in the markets. However, if we see even larger numbers on Monday, hold on tight. In either case, the financial markets will not be able to stay disconnected from the real economy forever. Just like in 2008 and 2009, large employers all over the United States have been conducting mass layoffs. Sadly, this time around that includes some of our largest and most prosperous employers… The Trump administration offered buyouts to the entire federal workforce this year, aiming to reduce it by as much as 10%. Roughly 75,000 workers accepted. More recently, Amazon, UPS and Target all announced private-sector layoffs. Buyouts can sound tempting. A five-figure severance package might be the most money a worker has ever seen in one paycheck. But it’s also the last paycheck your employer will give you. We haven’t seen anything like this in many years. Bankruptcies are soaring, delinquency rates are spiking, thousands of stores and restaurants are permanently shutting their doors, and just about everything just keeps getting more expensive. What we are now facing is being described as “Depression 2.0”. Unfortunately, this is just the beginning and most of the population understands this. In fact, one recent survey discovered that 57 percent of Americans expect economic conditions to get even worse over the next year. Many of you are going to be facing some very hard decisions in the coming months. If you currently have a job that you highly value, I would recommend holding on to it as tightly as you can. But if you feel that it is absolutely necessary to go somewhere else, you will just have to do what you have to do. Just understand that if you leave your current position it will not be easy to find a new one at all. In 2008 and 2009, millions of Americans lost their jobs. Many of them didn’t have anything to fall back on, and so large numbers of them also lost their homes. This is one of the reasons why it is so critical to have a sizable emergency fund. At this point, even the mainstream media is stressing the importance of this… Most people live paycheck to paycheck, and when the economy crashes, that leaves no room to breathe. Having three to six months of essential expenses tucked away can make all the difference when cash flow dries up or jobs disappear overnight. Keep your emergency savings in an easily accessible account, not tied up in volatile investments. It’s not about hoarding—it’s about buying time and peace of mind. When others panic, you’ll have the stability to make smart, calm decisions. I expect things to start moving very quickly now. If the problems in our banking system bubble to the surface and start becoming highly visible, it will create a lot of fear. And it is just a matter of time before our absurdly overvalued stock market takes a dramatic tumble. Of course all of this is happening at a time when so many other elements of “the Perfect Storm” are coming together. We are right on the brink of multiple major wars, global food supplies are rapidly getting tighter, we are being told that the next worldwide pandemic could break out at any moment, and on average the U.S. has been getting hit by a “billion dollar disaster” about every two weeks. I expect so much chaos to be unleashed during the weeks ahead, and that means that we should expect the turmoil that we are currently witnessing on Wall Street to escalate quite a bit more.

Title: I Tried Aldi's Diet Coke Copycat And It's Not Even Close To Everyone's Favorite Fridge Cig

Time Published: 2025-11-02T18:20:00Z
Full Content:
As of 2025, Diet Coke reigns as the number one diet soda in the U.S., which doesn't surprise me at all. I will check and see if restaurants have Coke or Pepsi before I go. I'm that picky. And I'm not the only fan! Diet Coke ranks fifth among all top-selling sodas in general, coming in after regular Coca-Cola, Dr Pepper, Sprite, and Pepsi, in that order. And there are a lot of sodas out there! But recently, we heard a little rumor that there was a Diet Coke dupe that tasted even better and was cheaper, which had us more than intrigued. Personally, as a diehard Diet Coke fan, I have to say I was incredibly suspicious and needed to do my own investigating. (Those are some pretty big claims to be making.) The copycat — Aldi's Summit brand diet cola — is one of many dupes by this grocery store. Luckily, there is an Aldi very close to me, so I ran right out to grab a 12-pack. Already having Diet Coke on hand, because I use it in everything from mocktails and cocktails to baking sweet treats, it would be easy to do a head-to-head taste test. Giving each a 24-hour window to chill in my refrigerator, I sat down to taste them. I was ready for anything. I took a deep breath and opened my mind to the possibilities. Would it taste the same? Would it actually be better? Well, here's what I found. When working on this piece, Summit Diet Cola was available at my Aldi for $4.69 for a 12-pack of 12-ounce cans. There are over 2,500 Aldi locations scattered through 39 states in the U.S. So, the availability is somewhat accessible, although not as widely distributed as Diet Coke. As far as Diet Coke goes, at my local Kroger, there is always a BOGO sale going on, so I always stock up. The week I purchased these sodas, it was a buy two, get three free weekend sale. With a 12-pack of 12-ounce cans costing $10.99, that worked out to $4.39 per pack, which was an even better deal than Aldi. While Kroger only operates in 16 states and territories, I feel like there are other stores that probably offer similar discounts. When I checked out Walmart prices at the time of this writing, it had 24-packs of Diet Coke cans for $13.78, making a 12-pack $6.89. And Walmart does operate in all 50 states. Additionally, Costco (operating in 49 states and territories) had 35-packs of cans for $19.85, which would leave you paying around $6.60 per 12-pack. So, there are deals to be had if cost is an issue. I cracked open the chilled can of Summit Diet Cola and went in for my first taste. It had an immediate sweet cloud that covered my palate and filled my mouth. There was a nice carbonation about it that tingled my tongue and gave the soda an overall round, full profile. Oddly, there was an overly obvious citrus taste to it that reminded me of the lemon and lime flavor of Sprite, but with a touch of vanilla. It wasn't bad, just odd. But it couldn't garner too much attention, as the sweet flavor demanded center stage throughout. The sweetness tasted artificial and exceedingly apparent, like a small child vying for the spotlight. It carried the flavor in and stayed long after any citrus, spice, or carbonation was gone. And while it didn't go over the top or become offensive, it was still somehow larger than it needed to be. In the end, all the tastes stopped very abruptly, leaving the palate seemingly coated with a nothingness that wasn't entirely clean. This diet cola wasn't bad, but it was very obviously an off-brand, a generic interpretation of something familiar. I could taste what it was trying to achieve, but it tried too hard and missed the mark with its overzealous flavoring. Taking a sip of Diet Coke offered a layer of flavors and carbonation to cascade across my taste buds, dancing with tiny, prickling bubbles. There seemed to be a blanket of caramel that was soft, lush, and slightly sweet. Underneath the caramel was a hint of citrus that seemed to complement the spicy aesthetic without drawing too much attention to itself. The sweetness of it all seemed to be but a welcome guest of equal measure on the journey of flavors. Nothing tasted to stand out on its own; rather, every flavor worked together in harmony. The flavors of Diet Coke appeared to be deliberately refined, balanced on rich fizz that teased the taste buds into new heights of enjoyment. And when it left my mouth, the flavors and slight burn of carbonation lingered only for a moment before taking their final leave. Overall, refreshing and soft but strong, drinking Diet Coke was incredibly satisfying. I tasted both diet sodas over ice, one at a time. Then, I did the same straight from the can. To ensure I was comparing them as accurately as possible, I also went back and forth, taking sips side by side. The Summit Diet Cola had flavors that were audacious compared to Diet Coke. They went too far, became too artificial, and were too sweet. Instead of working together, the Summit Diet Cola came across as a battle for attention from one flavor to the next, while Diet Coke's flavor, carbonation, and sweetness all worked in tandem to complement and enhance each other's qualities. It would be one thing if rumors had said that this dupe was somewhat comparable. That I could see. Both sodas have a citrus component, an artificial sweetness, and a caramel aesthetic. However, Diet Coke remained subdued in all its flavors and maintained a refreshing quality that was enjoyable rather than complicated. Summit, on the other hand, was like a little kid dressing up in their parents' clothes, trying to be something it wasn't, and ending up as an obvious farce. Diet soda alternatives keep coming after Diet Coke. But I just don't believe that any of them will ever beat the OG. And why do we need them to? With the ability to get discounts or bulk amounts of Diet Coke, the savings are negligible. You just need to look around and see where you can find the best deal. To get the best taste, I feel it's more than worth it.

Title: Meta has an AI product problem  | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us In the midst of an unprecedented AI buildout, Meta is spending more than most. The company is building two massive data centers, and reporting indicates there will be as much as $600 billion in spending on U.S. infrastructure over the next three years. Those figures might not raise eyebrows in Silicon Valley, but they’re starting to make Wall Street nervous. The issue came to a head this week as Meta reported quarterly earnings, which showed the company’s operating expenses jumping $7 billion year-over-year and nearly $20 billion in capital expense. It was the result of intense spending on AI talent and infrastructure, which has yet to bring in meaningful revenue for the company. When analysts pressed for more specifics, Mark Zuckerberg made it clear the spending was just getting started. “The right thing to do is to try to accelerate this to make sure that we have the compute that we need, both for the AI research and new things that we’re doing, and to try to get to a different state on our compute stance on the core business,” Zuckerberg told analysts on the call. “Our view is that when we get the new models that we’re building in MSL in there and get like truly frontier models with novel capabilities that you don’t have in other places, then I think that this is just a massive latent opportunity.” If his goal was to reassure investors, it didn’t work. By the end of the call, Meta’s share price had plummeted in value. Two days later, the rout has only deepened. The Meta’s stock dropped 12% by the closing bell on Friday, representing more than $200 billion in lost market cap. It’s dangerous to read too much into stock prices, and in strict financial terms, Meta’s quarterly earnings weren’t that bad. ($20 billion in quarterly profit is nothing to complain about.) But this was the first quarter in which Meta’s aggressive AI spending on both talent and infrastructure had a visible impact on the company’s bottom line. Even more alarming was that, aside from a lot of enormous data centers and well-compensated AI researchers, it wasn’t clear what the money actually bought. Analysts pressed Zuckerberg on why he was spending so much on AI, and when they could expect to see revenue from the growing spending. But the call came at an odd spot in Meta’s planning, with no clear budget for projected spending and no available product that could anchor a revenue forecast. As a result, Zuckerberg was left with only general claims about the promise of AI. “There are going to be all kinds of new products around different content formats, and we’re starting to see that,” he asid during the call. “And then there are the business versions of all these too, like business A … the other part is how more intelligent models are just going to improve the core business and improve the recommendations that we make across the Family of Apps and improve the recommendations in advertising.” Meta isn’t the only company spending billions of dollars on AI infrastructure, so it’s worth teasing out why this same spending isn’t spooking investors at Google or Nvidia, both of which had a great quarter. OpenAI is the biggest offender, spending the same amount with far less financial cushion than Meta. There really are concerns that we’re creating a bubble, and if we are, Meta’s core business will let it ride things out better than most. But if you ask Sam Altman why he’s spending hundreds of billions of dollars on compute, he’ll tell you he’s operating one of the fastest growing consumer services in human history — and one bringing in $20 billion a year in revenue. We can argue about how sustainable the growth rate is (that’s a separate blog post), but there really is a fast-growing product at the bottom of all the OpenAI hype. A fast-growing ARR figure goes a long way to answer questions. Meta doesn’t have a product like that, and it’s not clear where it’s going to come from. The company’s most powerful AI product is the Meta AI assistant, which Zuckerberg noted on the call has more than a billion active users. But those numbers are surely juiced by the three billion active users on Facebook and Instagram, and it’s hard to see the current version of Meta AI as a competitor to ChatGPT. There’s also the Vibes video generator, which really did boost daily active users, but has limited business impact beyond that. The most ambitious project is the Vanguard smart glasses released earlier this month. However, the glasses feel more like an extension of Meta’s Reality Labs work than a real attempt to harness the power of LLMs. Put simply, these are promising experiments, not fully formed products. It’s telling then that when he was pressed on infrastructure spending, Zuckerberg’s response wasn’t to point to the recent launches, but to focus on the next generation. Zuckerberg stressed, while emphasizing the pending impact of the Superintelligence Lab’s new models, that he was very excited about new products. “It’s not just Meta AI as an assistant,” he said. “We expect to build novel models and novel products, and I’m excited to share more when we have it.” But this was an earnings call, not a product launch, so all he could say was that there would be more to share “in the coming months.” As the market response showed that answer is wearing thin. To be fair, it’s only been four months since Zuckerberg restructured his company’s AI team, and the new Superintelligence team hasn’t had time to launch an earthshaking AI product yet. But as the company spends billions of dollars to stay competitive in AI, there’s still no clear indication of what role Zuckerberg wants to play in the new industry. Will Meta AI use the company’s detailed store of personal data to grow into a ChatGPT competitor? Is Vibes the first step in a consumer entertainment play, building off Meta’s targeted ad system? Or maybe Zuckerberg’s references to “business AI” are hints at a more detailed enterprise play? So far, it’s anyone’s guess. Whatever the answer, the pressure is on Meta to find it — and soon.

Title: From Wild West to Wall Street: Crypto is boring now because ‘we won’

Once the Wild West of finance, crypto has matured into a Wall Street fixture with regulators and ETFs. We won. That’s why crypto is boring now. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Remember when Crypto Twitter was like taking a front-row seat to the movies? Markets were a runaway rollercoaster, narratives flipped like pancakes, and every week had the energy of a new heist movie. What happened? If you’re lamenting the days of God candles and 20% BTC pumps, Nic Carter wants you to smile through the tears: crypto is boring now because we won. From major exchange collapses to China bans, Elon Musk pumps to COVID black swans, it’s been quite a ride. Jamie Dimon lambasted Bitcoin as a “fraud” and threatened to fire anyone caught trading it at JPMorgan. Now the world’s biggest banks are stacking stablecoins, and even Dimon admits, “Crypto is real. Stablecoins are real,” as JPMorgan invites clients to post BTC and ETH as collateral for loans and launches its own blockchain rails. Are all the crazy days behind us now, and crypto is boring? Is it time to seek a new asset class for our thrills? Turns out, Gandhi’s saying, “first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win,” might fit crypto better than anyone expected.​ At the heart of the vibe shift is what Nic Carter nailed in a post on X. The reason the volatility has dampened is because we won. As he states: “Crypto is boring because so many of the open questions have been answered.” Gone is the existential guessing game about whether stablecoins will be banned or if writing smart contracts will get you thrown in jail. The old school volatility, the kind that made fortunes and wiped them out by lunchtime, came straight from regulatory Russian roulette and the sense that rules might change at any moment.​ Now? The GENIUS Act pins down rules for stablecoins, the Clarity Act sets out bright lines for what is a security and what isn’t. And even the question of crypto’s marriage with TradFi is a historical footnote, not a juicy risk premium. When you live in a world where holding T-bills on-chain is business casual and BlackRock’s ETF isn’t controversial, that means dampened volatility. Which means that crypto is boring. Even as price action grinds along, what used to be wild opportunity now feels, to many, like a playground being turned into a parking lot.​ As BTC analyst Will Clemente commented: “The vibes in the crypto groupchats that I’m in are just sad honestly, people completely giving up and pivoting to other asset classes if they haven’t already.” But Carter isn’t mourning. As he sees it, regulatory clarity, Wall Street adoption, and boring stability are proof that crypto won. The whole space has matured. What was once a technological risk-fest is now a “technological substrate” adopted by the world’s biggest firms. The new game isn’t about skirting the law; it’s about building products that actually generate value in clear daylight.​ Wall Street didn’t just join the party; it put on the DJ headphones. BlackRock. JPMorgan. Even Jamie Dimon’s about-face is now crypto lore. From denier to builder, the old guard’s pivot closes the loop on a playbook that once prioritized chaos and rewarded pirates. Now, crypto is boring. TradFi’s seriousness brings real capital, real custody, and real infrastructure. The legends of the wild west are being replaced by compliance teams, pension allocators, and crash-helmeted bankers. And that’s all great… except some of us miss the outlaws.

A Chinese embassy post highlighting Hsinchu Science Park underscores rising geopolitical risks to the world’s most advanced chip supply. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. On Friday night, China’s embassy in Washington posted a familiar message to X: “There is but one China in the world.” But this time, the predictable rhetoric from China came with a glossy photo carousel that included a sweeping aerial shot of Hsinchu Science Park, the epicenter of the world’s most advanced semiconductor manufacturing. As analyst Patrick Moorhead highlighted in a response to the embassy’s post, Hsinchu includes TSMC’s Fabs 12A, 12B, 20, 3, 5, 8, 2 and the Advanced Backend Fab 1, all crammed into the park’s core, along with the company’s Global R&D Center, “where all the world’s advanced foundry IP is created,” he wrote, pointing out that chips for Nvidia, AMD, Apple, Qualcomm, and even Intel depends on this small square of land. There is but one #China in the world; #Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. Every inch of Taiwan Province, China, is vibrant under the "Jilin-1" space satellite's perspective. 🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳💧Sun Moon Lake 日月潭⛰Alishan 阿里山🏙Taipei City 台北市⚓️Taipei Port 台北港… pic.twitter.com/bOIvAdrSuyOctober 31, 2025 While the post didn’t mention chips directly, it didn’t have to. Hsinchu is home to TSMC’s original fabs, the headquarters of MediaTek and UMC, and key government agencies that oversee Taiwan’s space and chip strategy. There is no other place on Earth with the same concentration of cutting-edge logic process nodes. This is where the GPUs that train AI models begin, where desktop and server CPUs are etched, and where bleeding-edge silicon IP is designed. Expand the embedded tweet below to see the images. Let me be clearer. Here are the TSMC fabs currently in Hsinchu Science Park in Taiwan: Fab 12A/12B/20/3/5/8/2 and Advanced Backend Fab 1.

In recent months, Chinese naval forces have staged simulated blockades in the Taiwan Strait, inspecting commercial cargo ships and raising fears of a chokepoint disruption. The Trans-Pacific Express Cable System, which directly connects Taiwan to the U.S. East Coast, Japan, South Korea, and China, was damaged by a Cameroon-flagged freighter, Shunxing39, earlier this year, prompting Taiwan to increase legal penalties for damaging undersea cables. According to a recent special report from Reuters, U.S. officials have begun modeling worst-case scenarios for the Bashi Channel, a key shipping lane essential to Taiwanese exports like advanced wafers and electronics, in response to recent incursions. In September, the US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called Taiwan’s chip sector the “single greatest point of failure for the world economy” because 99% of high-performance chips are manufactured there, and back in June 2021, a White House review warned that even a temporary hit to TSMC output could ripple through everything from datacenters to defense. China’s embassy didn’t need to mention any of that directly. A single photo of Hsinchu was enough at a moment while tensions remain high.

In recent months, Chinese naval forces have staged simulated blockades in the Taiwan Strait, inspecting commercial cargo ships and raising fears of a chokepoint disruption. The Trans-Pacific Express Cable System, which directly connects Taiwan to the U.S. East Coast, Japan, South Korea, and China, was damaged by a Cameroon-flagged freighter, Shunxing39, earlier this year, prompting Taiwan to increase legal penalties for damaging undersea cables. According to a recent special report from Reuters, U.S. officials have begun modeling worst-case scenarios for the Bashi Channel, a key shipping lane essential to Taiwanese exports like advanced wafers and electronics, in response to recent incursions. In September, the US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called Taiwan’s chip sector the “single greatest point of failure for the world economy” because 99% of high-performance chips are manufactured there, and back in June 2021, a White House review warned that even a temporary hit to TSMC output could ripple through everything from datacenters to defense. China’s embassy didn’t need to mention any of that directly. A single photo of Hsinchu was enough at a moment while tensions remain high.

Title: Why Millions Of Women Are Choosing Entrepreneurship In 2025

ByCaroline Castrillon, Senior Contributor. In 2024, women started nearly 1 of every 2 new businesses in America. That’s the highest rate on record, according to Gusto’s 2025 New Business Formation study. In addition, between 2019 and 2023, the number of women-owned businesses increased at nearly double the rate of their male counterparts, the 2024 Wells Fargo Impact of Women-Owned Business Report reveals. Women are leaving traditional corporate roles in unprecedented numbers to pursue entrepreneurship, writing their own rules for what success looks like. One example is April Springer, a former HR professional turned multi-unit business owner with Next Day Access, a provider of mobility and accessibility products. Based in Minneapolis, she owns three locations and also serves as vice president for the Minnesota and Pittsburgh territories. Her first location generated more than $1 million in revenue in its first year. She’s since expanded into multiple markets and now mentors other women in franchising. Her journey offers insights into the most powerful reasons millions of women are choosing entrepreneurship over corporate careers. The traditional corporate ladder no longer represents the pinnacle of achievement for many women. Success has become deeply personal, shaped by individual values rather than external expectations. As Springer explains, "I think women are redefining success on their own terms. There's no one-size-fits-all version of what a successful career or life looks like." This shift stems from: Expert Tip: Before making any major career move, write down your personal definition of success in specific, measurable terms. If you find yourself describing someone else's achievements or using vague terms, you haven't defined it yet. Your definition should be so clear you'd know instantly whether you're living it. Traditional employment models weren't built for modern life. More women are seeking careers that can adapt to their evolving priorities, whether that's family responsibilities, personal passions or the desire for autonomy over their schedules. As Springer explains, "The traditional corporate path doesn't always offer the flexibility, fulfillment or creativity many women are seeking. Entrepreneurship allows women to design a life and career that align with their values and priorities." What flexibility really means: Expert Tip: Track your energy and productivity patterns for two weeks. If your current job structure conflicts with your natural rhythms and priorities more than 60% of the time, that's a signal that entrepreneurship might serve you better. The rise of social media has transformed how women view entrepreneurship. Platforms like Instagram, LinkedIn and TikTok showcase real stories of women building successful businesses, making the path to entrepreneurship feel more accessible than ever before. Springer notes the impact of this visibility, "Social media has also played a big role in this shift. When women see others building successful businesses and balancing life in ways that inspire them, it creates momentum." The digital community effect includes: Expert Tip: Follow 10-15 women entrepreneurs in your industry on social media. Don't just scroll—actively engage. Comment on their posts, ask questions and join conversations. The connections you build digitally often translate into real mentorship and support when you launch your own venture. For women who want to be their own boss but feel intimidated by starting from scratch, franchising presents a compelling middle ground. Franchise models provide proven systems, established branding and built-in support networks that significantly reduce the risk associated with new business ventures. The franchise advantage includes: Expert Tip: Before investing in any franchise, speak with at least five current franchisees you choose yourself—not the ones referred by the franchisor. Ask specifically about hidden costs, actual time commitments and whether they'd make the same choice again. Many women entrepreneurs aren’t just chasing profits. They’re building small businesses with purpose. The desire to create meaningful impact drives many women to leave stable corporate positions for the uncertainty of entrepreneurship. Mission-driven businesses benefit from: Expert Tip: Define your business mission in one sentence: "We help [specific people] achieve [specific outcome] so they can [meaningful benefit]." If you struggle to complete this sentence clearly, spend more time refining your purpose. A vague mission won't sustain you through entrepreneurship's challenges. Amazon recently announced 14,000 corporate job cuts, while Target eliminated 1,000 roles. Entire departments can disappear overnight due to restructuring, automation or economic shifts. For many women, entrepreneurship offers more control over their financial future than any corporate job ever could. When you own your business, your income depends on your own efforts, not on someone else's decision to cut headcount. Why women are choosing entrepreneurship over corporate jobs: Expert Tip: If you're concerned about leaving your corporate job, start your business as a side hustle while still employed. Test your concept, build a client base and validate your income potential before making the leap. Many successful entrepreneurs launch this way, reducing risk while proving their business model works. The millions of women pursuing entrepreneurship today aren't abandoning ambition. They're redefining it on their own terms. It proves the best career path isn’t always the one laid out by someone else. Often, it’s the one you build yourself.

Title: 'Bitcoin's Silent IPO': Analyst Addresses BTC's Lame Price Action in Viral Weekend Essay

It's not exactly news to frustrated bitcoin BTC$104,850.17 bulls that risk assets across the planet for months have been recording what seem like daily record highs while the price action in BTC remains rather muted. "What if everyone is looking at this wrong," asks longtime traditional finance asset manager Jordi Visser in a heavily shared (1.5M views on X and counting) weekend essay titled "Bitcoin’s Silent IPO: Why This Consolidation Isn’t What You Think." While bitcoin never had a traditional IPO, the factors liming price gains are nearly exactly the same as those which cause poor price performance in stock IPOs, argues Visser. Tradfi IPOs and the months that follow, reminds Visser — particularly in tech — are major liquidity events for early investors. "Early-stage investors take enormous risks," wrote Visser. "If the investment succeeds, they deserve enormous rewards. But eventually, and this is crucial, they need to realize those gains. They need liquidity. They need an exit. They need to diversify." The examples, particularly in tech, are legion, but consider the Facebook (now Meta) IPO of 2012. The offering at $38 per share raised $16 billion at a valuation of $104 billion — quaint numbers today, but staggering amounts at the time. One year later, the stock was 30% lower, with pundits questioning Mark Zuckerberg's leadership. More likely than missteps by Zuck, it was early investors — be they his Harvard buddies, or Silicon Valley types, or the carpenters who framed out Facebook's first offices (who took pay in shares rather than cash) — using public markets to realize life-changing profits. Importantly, says Visser, the early investors don't hit the bid all at once. "They’re methodically distributing their positions. They’re being careful. They don’t want to crater the price. They’re patient. They’ve waited years for this moment. They can wait a few more months to do it right." The result, he says: "A sideways grind that drives everyone crazy." Sound familiar? "The on-chain data tells a clear story if you know how to read it," says Visser, turning to bitcoin. "Old coins, coins that haven’t moved in years, some dormant since the single-digit price days, are suddenly active." The ETFs, the institutional adoption, the friendly regulatory environment ... this created IPO-like conditions for bitcoin's early believers. "For years, the liquidity simply didn’t exist," he wrote. "Try selling $100 million of bitcoin in 2015. You’d crater the price. Try selling $1 billion in 2019. Same problem. The market couldn’t absorb it." "But now," he continued. "ETFs are providing institutional bid. Major companies hold bitcoin on their balance sheets. Sovereign wealth funds are getting involved. The market has finally matured to the point where early holders can exit significant positions without causing chaos." Again, reminds Visser, it's not being done all at once — no one is interested in crashing the price. But instead, steadily and methodically: hence the sideways grind and the rallies that reverse so quickly. What's occurring now is hardly anything that can be called a bear market, says Visser, but instead a distribution of ownership. Over the long run, this is a bullish event, but the process — at least in traditional markets — can take 6-18 months. Even though cycles often get sped up in crypto, Visser suspects there could be many more months of this frustrating price action in bitcoin. "Sentiment will only improve after the distribution is substantially complete," he wrote. "People are demoralized because they don’t understand what phase we’re in. They’re waiting for bitcoin to 'catch up' to stocks. They are worried about the four year cycle. Be patient. Once the heavy selling pressure lifts, once the patient accumulation by institutions has absorbed the OG supply, the path becomes clearer."

Title: Thawing Housing Market Not Yet Liquid Enough to Jump-Start Sales

Rejuvenating frozen US housing sales will require a strong job market and mortgage rates low enough to pique sellers’ interest in new homes. Emell Derra Adolphus Guest Contributor to The Daily Upside Since the 1989 cult classic Groundhog Day never specifies exactly how long it took Bill Murray’s character to escape his repetitive purgatory in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, fans devoted enough to run the numbers have come up with their own estimate: 33 years. Players in the US housing market hope to escape the numbers-driven winter of their discontent quite a bit sooner, but green shoots are sparse so far and last week didn’t do much to help. The nation’s largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton, saw its proverbial shadow, signaling on a Tuesday earnings call that it expects cooling housing sales to continue into next year, with angsty buyers chilled by relatively high mortgage rates and growing economic uncertainty. Earlier in the month, the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index measured builder confidence at 37 on a scale of 0 to 100, the highest since April, but still well below the level that would indicate most are optimistic about the short-term outlook. “The housing sector remains weak,” Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in a news conference on Wednesday after the central bank lowered its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point in response to growing concern about employment, a key factor in home purchases. The unemployment rate in the US ticked up to 4.3% in August, the last month for which the government collected data before a shutdown that has obscured the state of the job market despite anecdotal evidence of thousands of layoffs by corporate giants from e-commerce leader Amazon to shipping company UPS. “Job growth absolutely has an impact on new household formations and consumer confidence, and where you see that flatness in those markets, that is going to have an impact,” D.R. Horton Chief Executive Officer Paul Romanowski said on the company’s earnings call on Tuesday. Horton’s average sales price for single-family homes fell 3% from the previous year to $365,600 in the three months through September, D.R. Horton said. At the same time, leaning “pretty hard” into incentives such as buydowns that took mortgage rates as low as 3.99% for some purchasers trimmed 110 basis points from the company’s gross profit margin. As for how long it might take the market to heat up again, Romanowski offered a gauge, but not a timetable: “We need to see consistent, sustainable job growth to drive growth in the housing market.” From Romanowski’s mouth to the Federal Reserve’s ears. Still, the two rate cuts so far this year may not be sufficient to propel much of a rebound in the housing market, according to economists. “Single-family home sales may be climbing out of the basement, but they haven’t reached the ground floor yet, let alone any higher level,” said Associated General Contractors of America Chief Economist Ken Simonson. Despite data from the National Association of Home Builders showing that firms like D.R. Horton have succeeded in stimulating sales by building smaller houses, cutting prices and buying down interest rates for customers, “numerous policy initiatives are working against homebuilding and housing sales,” he said. Steep US government tariffs on “Canadian softwood lumber and on steel, aluminum, copper products, kitchen cabinets, vanities, upholstered furniture and more are pushing up construction costs,” Simonson said. The fluctuation in levy amounts, meanwhile, makes home planning and pricing even more difficult. Glimmers of hope are appearing in the market, however. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has fallen to a range of 6.2% to 6.3% from the level of 6.6% where it hovered most of the year. It’s encouraging, but “not enough of a cut to bring forth a surge of homebuyers,” Simonson said. Another interest-rate cut like October’s might help, but the improvement would be only incremental, and the reduction is far from a “foregone conclusion,” the Fed’s Powell said. Still, after several years of surging mortgage rates and shrinking of home inventory, “a weaker economy, increasingly impatient sellers, and slowly receding mortgage rates are helping tilt certain housing markets toward buyers,” said economist and Sage Policy Group CEO Anirban Basu. “The S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index has dipped for five consecutive months,” Basu said. “Bottom line: 2026 will be the best year to buy a home in a number of years.” Some parts of the US have shown firm demand, too, Basu said. Among them is the country’s south, where states such as Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama and Texas are attracting a steady stream of movers, said Nadia Evangelou, senior economist and director of real estate research for the National Association of Realtors. “People continue to move toward areas with better affordability and growing employment opportunities,” she explained. “Follow the people to see where housing demand will be stronger.” Demand is already spreading into Midwestern cities such as Des Moines, Omaha and Kansas City, she said, “with Kansas City experiencing a more than 50% increase in net domestic migration last year.” Thanks to comparatively high prices and labor market concerns, the supply of existing homes is approaching pre-pandemic levels, Oxford Economics Analyst Matthew Martin wrote in a report. At the state level, Tennessee, Texas, Colorado and Florida have experienced some of the largest increases in listings compared with pre-pandemic levels, Evangelou said. “Tennessee alone has about 35% more homes for sale than in 2019. Many of these same states have also seen the most new construction,” she said. “Exactly what the market has needed for years: more supply. Still, many of these homes are priced above what most buyers can afford.” Another complication is spillover from recent periods of low interest rates, including those during the pandemic and previously, during and after the Great Recession. Buyers who financed homes at rates of less than 3% then are reluctant to give them up in favor of new loans that cost twice as much. “But we have started to see some easing,” Evangelou added. “The inventory of existing homes available for sale is now at its best level in five years, suggesting more homeowners are finally listing.” She predicted a gradual improvement next year “as mortgage rates ease further and stabilize near 6%.” In September, in fact, the number of US homes sold popped 7.3% to about 442,400, according to real estate company Redfin. So if someone else gets stuck in a Groundhog Day time loop (in the unlikely event of a sequel), at least he or she will have a better chance of landing a new home after escaping Punxsutawney. The United States agreed to reduce broad tariffs on Chinese imports by 10 percentage points, bringing them to 47%. Execs said that inflation-addled consumers are under the impression that Chipotle costs more than it does. When layoffs rise, people spend less, which leads to tighter bottom lines and more layoffs. Wash, rinse, and repeat. In September, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that nine of the Fed’s 19 policymakers favored no more than one additional rate cut this year. Tariffs and the end of the de minimis exemption have been a one-two punch eroding UPS’ core business in 2025. The recent investment from private equity firms could help protect Keurig Dr Pepper from activist investors like Starboard. The S&P 500 has climbed 35% since its April low and roughly 90% since the beginning of its bull run in 2022. China’s GDP growth fell to 4.8% in the third-quarter, down from 5.2% in the second quarter and the slowest pace in a year. Counterpoint data found the iPhone 17 lineup outsold the iPhone 16 by 14% in the US and China for its first 10 days. The chip manufacturer, headquartered in the Dutch city of Nijmegen, was acquired in 2019 by state-backed Chinese semiconductor firm Wingtech. The announcement comes months after Apple said it’d invest $100 billion in US factories as part of its “American Manufacturing Program.” Shares of the crop trading and processing giant soared as POTUS threatened “retribution” over China’s de facto US soybean embargo © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: When the wrench comes for the wallet: Why Bitcoin’s biggest believers are handing over their keys

Self-custody is under fire as wrench attacks become a real threat for crypto holders, with physical coercion and organized crime targeting those with on-chain wealth. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Welcome to Slate Sunday, CryptoSlate’s weekly feature showcasing in-depth interviews, expert analysis, and thought-provoking op-eds that go beyond the headlines to explore the ideas and voices shaping the future of crypto. Self‑custody was once the ultimate badge of credibility in crypto. A declaration of faith in sovereignty over convenience, code over blind trust, and cryptography over legal fine print. But for many of the space’s earliest and wealthiest adopters, that belief is starting to bend under a different kind of pressure: wrench attacks. In a world now flush with organized crime, doxxing, and $5 wrench attacks, even the most battle‑hardened Bitcoiners are locking away more than their coins; their ideology is going in the vault as well. A decade ago, wrench attack jokes circulated mostly in privacy forums. The meme, coined from a 2015 XKCD comic, encapsulates a brutal truth. You can’t brute‑force a passphrase, but you can threaten someone with a $5 wrench until they tell you it. OG Bitcoiner Jameson Lopp, co‑founder of Casa and maintainer of the “Physical Bitcoin Attacks” directory, has spent years documenting cases of wrench attacks where everyday crypto holders are beaten, held hostage, or worse because of their on‑chain visibility. The directory now lists more than 200 verified incidents spanning at least 34 countries. From European traders kidnapped at gunpoint to influencers targeted after posting wealth flexes online. As of October 2025, the directory records 52 wrench attacks this year alone (more than one per week), with overall physical assaults increasing 169% since February. In late October 2025, Russian influencer Sergei Domogatskii was kidnapped in Bali by masked assailants who tased and beat him, forcing him to transfer approximately $4,600 in crypto from his mobile phone to their accounts. This is part of a rising trend of wrench attacks in this region, as Lopp previously told me: “I’ve seen a number of attacks, for example, where Russian citizens who are either vacationing or living in Southeast Asia are getting hit by Russian organized crime. They’re coming into the country, wrench attacking them, and then trying to get out as quickly as possible, and presumably trying to leverage jurisdictional arbitrage.” Even veteran cypherpunks are taking notice. In a recent interview on What Bitcoin Did, on‑chain analyst Willy Woo admitted: “I’m not self‑custodying anymore… I think you’ll see a lot more people who’ve been in this space a long time doing the same.” Woo reinforced that smaller holders should absolutely keep control of their own coins, but large balances and public profiles create an entirely different threat model. It’s not about losing a hardware wallet anymore; it’s about personal safety. Many others share his view. The Bitcoin Family, known for selling everything to live off Bitcoin, told CNBC in June that they’ve abandoned single‑device wallets for a scattered analog‑digital fortress. They’ve split seed phrases and encrypted data across four continents. Family patriarch Didi Taihuttu said: “Even if someone held me at gunpoint, I can’t give them more than what’s on my wallet or my phone. And that’s not a lot.” Both Woo and Taihuttu were once among the poster children for full sovereignty. Their quiet retreat marks a broader sentiment shift (one now confirmed by the numbers). Somehow, Wall Street has managed to do what few thought possible: lure long-time Bitcoin whales into its regulated fold. According to a recent Bloomberg article, a new breed of discreet, ultra-wealthy holders is quietly offloading their cold wallets and moving billions into spot ETFs (sometimes without so much as a murmur on the blockchain). Thanks to “in-kind transfers,” these whales can dodge a taxable sale, swapping their BTC directly for ETF shares. BlackRock alone has taken in over $3 billion since July through this channel. Suddenly, what used to be a wild-west game of keys and ledgers is starting to look a lot more like traditional finance. All packaged up with a shiny ticker symbol and plenty of paperwork to go around. “This terrified me a bit,” commented Bitcoin advocate and human rights activist Alex Gladstein. For someone who’s spent his career documenting the way repressive regimes freeze assets and lock citizens out of the global financial system, watching Bitcoin drift toward mainstream financial custody feels like watching the escape hatch slowly close. Why? Because safety, reporting, and inheritance are finally trumping ideology. Srbuhi Avetisyan, research and analytics lead at Owner.One and co‑author of Penguin Analytics recently helped analyze 13,500 high‑net‑worth families across 18 countries. She shares: “At high balances, the risk isn’t blockchain failure—it’s physical coercion and OPSEC drift (lost seeds, single-point wallets). 87% of families keep incomplete asset records, and 99.4% lack a verified digital twin of their holdings. Crypto often disappears at incapacity/death—not from volatility, but from missing credentials and unclear rights.” For these families, ETFs and qualified custodians aren’t about giving in to TradFi. They’re about ensuring heirs can locate and transfer what might otherwise vanish. Still, not everyone’s ready to hand the entire stack back to banks. There’s a rising class of “hybrid” custodians building bridges between full self‑sovereignty and institutional protection. Seth for Privacy, vice president of the self‑custodial app Cake Wallet, says the wrench attacks problem doesn’t have to end self‑custody; it just forces it to evolve. He explains: “Crypto has become mainstream, and self-custody solutions have to keep up.” Beyond leveraging privacy tools, like Silent Payments and Payjoin, where possible, to keep their transactions out of public view, he believes the best protection for high‑profile individuals is to stop talking about their wealth. That was a point hammered home by Lopp, as well, who told me: “If you are on any sort of public network and you are flaunting your wealth, that’s one of the more risky things that you could be doing.” Seth points to Lopp’s company, Casa, Unchained, or some newer entrants like Nunchuk and Liana as examples of “collaborative custody.” These setups enable users to maintain control while distributing risk through multi‑signature arrangements, such as a 2‑of‑3 or 3‑of‑5 scheme, with a fiduciary or geographically separate co‑signer to remove the single point of failure. Anthony Yeung, chief commercial officer at CoinCover, also sees hybrid models as the pragmatic path forward. “Complete independence also comes with risk. If a private key is lost or compromised, the assets are often gone forever. A hybrid model addresses this by combining the best of both worlds: individuals retain direct control and ownership of their assets, while a trusted institution provides a safety net through secure backup and recovery mechanisms.” He calls this “a digital Fort Knox”: still user‑controlled, but institutionalized enough to enable secure backups, key recovery, and even inheritance triggers. Yeung adds: “They may well be the bridge that brings the next generation of users from web2 to web3.” Thomas Chen, CEO of Function and managing director at BitGo for six years, agrees, although he emphasizes personalization and risk tolerance. “I think a future for hybrid models ultimately depends on the user’s risk profile and what they’re comfortable with.” Those who self‑custody gain sovereignty but lose convenience, he says, particularly when they want to pledge assets as collateral, trade at scale, or interact with smart contracts in general. That’s not the experience that institutional investors want, and it may not be right for HNW individuals either. ETFs and custodial structures allow Bitcoin to act like a financial asset, not just a collectible. For institutions, that’s non‑negotiable. As Andrew Gibb, CEO of Twinstake institutional-grade, non-custodial staking platform, put it: “The custody landscape is shifting from the crypto-native ideal of total self-control toward models that match the risk appetite and operational rigor of institutional investors.” Fiduciary duty, in his view, forbids relying on untested personal key setups. Yet not everyone’s convinced this convenience is worth the compromise. Tony Yazbeck, co‑founder of The Bitcoin Way, offers a sharper take: “People love to overcomplicate this, but it really comes down to common sense. Some wealthy holders and institutions convince themselves they are safer putting their Bitcoin into ETFs or custodial accounts. They say it protects them from mistakes, inheritance issues, or even physical threats. In reality, it just hands control of the world’s scarcest asset to someone else and replaces ownership with paperwork.” Having lived through Lebanon’s banking collapse, Yazbeck warns that history has proven that third parties fail, exchanges collapse, governments seize assets, and custodians freeze withdrawals. His advice is refreshingly non‑technical. “The risk of losing your Bitcoin because you trusted a middleman is far higher than the risk of losing access to your own keys if you handle them properly. Multisig setups, secure backups, and simple operational discipline solve almost every real self-custody problem.” But the best defense? Once again, stop attracting attention to yourself. “Stay quiet about what you hold and live a normal life.” His mantra: protect privacy, take responsibility, and never outsource what Bitcoin was invented to make trustless. EY blockchain specialist Yaniv Sofer believes we’re witnessing a financial re‑tiering rather than an ideological rupture. He explains: “Financial institutions are accelerating their entry into digital assets use cases, and custody is a critical core capability.” While some firms buy access through third‑party providers like Fireblocks and BitGo, others build internal systems to integrate tokenization and payments. Sofer cautions: “Hybrid custody models have not yet gained significant traction among financial institutions but remain a topic of interest. Regulatory requirements for qualified custodians continue to favor centralized solutions… but hybrid models could emerge as a differentiator as the market matures.” In Avetisyan’s view, the long‑term equilibrium is clear. Most founders will run dual rails: core exposure in ETFs or qualified custody for reporting and collateralization, with a smaller self‑custody satellite for censorship resistance. This dual-rail system, she says, is already shifting how liquidity flows through the crypto economy. As more Bitcoin migrates to custodial wrappers, traditional funding markets gain depth and stability. The flip side? Sovereignty becomes optional, not default. Maybe what’s happening now isn’t so much an ideological defeat as a maturation. Bitcoin’s promise of self‑sovereignty remains intact for those who choose to uphold it. As the Bitcoin lead at Sygnum Bank, Pascal Eberle, comments: “The future of “Freedom Money” lies in choice – investors can opt for full self-custody, institutional-grade protection, or hybrid models that balance both.” Hybrid custody, institutional wrappers, and ETF liquidity are all symptoms of the same evolution: crypto crossing into the realm of structured finance. For early believers, that can feel like a betrayal, with self-custody becoming sidelined to the margins. As Yazbeck framed it: “Thinking you are safer by giving your Bitcoin to someone else is like a rich person surrounding themselves with a military convoy out of paranoia. It looks strong but it is actually weak.” Yet perhaps this is decentralization in action; a dispersion of risk, trust, and control according to every individual’s appetite. Each generation of holder must redraw its own line between freedom and fear. In 2025, that line runs straight through the vault door.

Title: How Fintech Is Redefining Retirement Planning For The Private Markets Era
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/ilonalimonta-volkova/2025/11/02/how-fintech-is-redefining-retirement-planning-for-the-private-markets-era/
Time Published: 2025-11-02T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
ByIlona Limonta-Volkova, Contributor. Most Americans are preparing for retirement with yesterday’s tools. The rules of retirement planning are changing, but few have noticed. Financial innovation often promises greater access and equality, yet adoption rarely keeps pace with aspiration. A recent Harris Poll found that nearly 40% of Americans have never heard of private-credit funds, a class of alternative investments that Wall Street is racing to bring to 401(k)s. Only 10% say they want more nontraditional options in their retirement accounts. Yet once investors learn that most U.S. businesses generating over $100 million in annual revenue are privately held, nearly 60% say they would consider investing in them, and 90% would allocate part of their savings to private markets. It is not that Americans do not want these investments. They just do not know they exist. The disconnect between awareness and appetite points to a fundamental problem: the infrastructure to connect regular investors with private credit simply has not existed until recently. For decades, these investments remained locked behind institutional walls, accessible only to pension funds, endowments, and the ultra-wealthy. That is changing as technology platforms modernize an industry that has historically run on spreadsheets and handshakes. "Private credit shouldn’t be a black box," asserts Nelson Chu, co-founder and president of Percent, a fintech platform democratizing access to private credit markets. His company is one of several working to crack open what has long been an opaque, insider-only market. "By standardizing issuance and surfacing live order books and post-close surveillance, we've opened a historically institutional market to accredited investors with shorter durations, lower minimums, and clearer visibility into risk and cash flows." What Chu describes addresses one of the biggest obstacles to bringing these investments mainstream: transparency. Traditional private credit deals are typically opaque, illiquid, and require enormous capital commitments. Modern platforms are changing the equation by building digital infrastructure that brings efficiency and visibility to previously murky markets. This matters for a simple reason: 401(k) investors have watched their investment options narrow as the number of publicly traded companies has declined. Private markets now represent a vast universe of investment opportunities that most retirement savers cannot touch, even as their pension fund counterparts have loaded up on these assets for years. The irony is hard to miss. The investments deemed suitable for public pension funds are considered too risky or complex for the individuals those pensions serve. Earlier this year, federal agencies were mandated to ease regulations around alternative investments in retirement plans signals momentum toward broader access. Major asset managers, like Apollo and BlackRock, are already positioning themselves to capture a share of the $13 trillion 401(k) market. The race is on. Success will likely not come from regulatory approval alone. It will require building investor confidence through education and infrastructure. Companies like Percent in the U.S. and Germany's Exaloan are demonstrating that private credit can operate with the same transparency and efficiency that investors expect from their brokerage accounts. Exaloan provides data infrastructure and analytics that enable banks and asset managers to originate, assess, and monitor private debt portfolios with institutional-grade transparency. By digitizing loan-level data and standardizing reporting, platforms like these are proving that private credit can operate with the same clarity and efficiency investors expect from their brokerage accounts. "Retail investor appetite for alternative assets has accelerated dramatically," Chu explains. "We're seeing sophisticated investors, business owners, executives, professionals, actively seeking diversification beyond the 60/40 portfolio. They want assets that don't correlate with public markets, are designed to generate cash flow, and offer transparency into what they're investing in." The question is no longer whether these assets will enter 401(k) plans. It is how fast the system can catch up. The technology is in place, and investor appetite is undeniable. What remains is closing the knowledge gap and creating the transparency that builds lasting trust. This has the potential to redefine retirement planning. And for millions of Americans, that shift cannot happen fast enough.

Title: S&P 500 Q3 2025 Earnings Surge: Magnificent 7 Lead Market Rally
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/11/02/sp-500-q3-2025-earnings-surge-magnificent-7-lead-market-rally/

ByBill Stone, Contributor. The third-quarter earnings season begins its second busiest week, with 135 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Palantir (PLTR), Pfizer (PFE), Yum! Brands (YUM), Emerson Electric (EMR), McDonald’s (MCD), Humana (HUM), and Qualcomm (QCOM). Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) reported better-than-expected earnings on Saturday. A deeper dive and insights into Berkshire Hathaway’s third-quarter earnings are here. With 64% of companies reporting so far, 83% have beaten consensus earnings estimates. The earnings season preview from last week contains more details about the underlying drivers of earnings. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 10.7% year-over-year, above the expectations of 7.9% at the end of the quarter. The expected earnings growth rates for calendar years 2025 and 2026 increased to 11.2% and 14.0%, respectively. The continuation of the strong earnings season helped lift the S&P 500 last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week. Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remained the group to watch this earnings season. Despite the disappointments from Tesla (TSLA) and Meta Platforms (META), the rest of the group picked up the slack. Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon.com (AMZN) continued to support the thesis that demand for artificial intelligence (AI) is driving robust growth. Meta Platforms (META) posted disappointing headline earnings due to a non-cash tax charge. More importantly, investors were spooked by the announcement of more than $100 billion in planned investments in AI next year. As a positive, third-quarter revenues grew 26% year over year, and their ad business continues to post impressive results, so the underlying business remains robust. NVIDIA (NVDA), the last of the Magnificent 7 to report earnings, is scheduled to report on November 19. According to FactSet data, the positive earnings surprises from companies in the information technology, consumer discretionary, and health care sectors were the most significant contributors to the S&P 500’s earnings growth rate increase last week. As detailed above, the communication services sector was the largest detractor due to Meta’s earnings miss. Within technology, Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) were the most significant positive drivers. Amazon.com (AMZN) was the most crucial positive surprise in consumer discretionary, while Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK), and Gilead Sciences (GILD) were the most notable positive surprises in health care. Sales growth at 7.9% is running well above expectations. Three sectors are on pace for double-digit year-over-year sales growth this quarter: information technology, communication services, and health care. With the government shutdown continuing to drag on, US economic releases should remain relatively sparse. Importantly, the widely watched monthly jobs report is likely to be delayed by the government closure. Instead, the private ADP employment change release on Wednesday and the Challenger job-cut announcement report on Thursday will attract more attention than usual as investors and economists gauge the softness of the US labor market. Third-quarter earnings reports will fill the void during the second busiest reporting week of the season. While a better-than-expected earnings season is all but assured, the individual company reports and any commentary about future earnings expectations remain crucial. As widely anticipated, the Federal Reserve (Fed) delivered a 25 basis point (0.25%) rate cut at its meeting last Wednesday. Fed Chair Powell pushed back harder than expected against the market expectations of another cut at the December meeting, sending the odds to a little less than a 2-in-3 chance. The calendar is chock-full of Fed members speaking this week, so their comments will be closely monitored to gauge better the likelihood of a Fed easing in December.

Title: What To Expect in Markets This Week: AMD, Palantir, Pharmaceutical and Tech Earnings; Private-Sector Employment Report

Tech firms will likely command the spotlight during this week’s earnings calendar, though pharmaceuticals and gig economy providers are also likely to be in focus. Artificial intelligence demand will be top of mind for market watchers when chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices, Qualcomm, and Arm Holdings, as well as software provider Palantir, report earnings this week. Results from pharmaceutical firms come amid pressure from the Trump administration to lower prices. Market watchers are likely to pore over private-sector jobs data for October in the absence of the originally scheduled U.S. employment report, which is likely to be delayed again as the government shutdown enters its second month. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing. Advanced Micro Devices will report on Tuesday, and investors will likely want to hear more about recent deals like the one signed in October to supply AI chips to Oracle. Other chipmakers are on the corporate earnings calendar this week, including Qualcomm, which last week unveiled two new AI chips for data centers. Chip designer Arm Holdings is also scheduled to report this week. In other tech-related reports, Palantir’s earnings on Monday come as the software maker’s shares have more than doubled this year on strong demand for its AI platforms. Cloud network provider Arista Networks is also on the calendar on Tuesday. Novo Nordisk reports on Wednesday, and the maker of Ozempic faces pressure from President Donald Trump over the costs of the weight loss treatment, which he said should run about $150 a month instead of the more than $1,000 it costs now. Other noteworthy pharmaceutical firms to report this week include Amgen, Pfizer, and AstraZeneca, and they come as firms have made deals to lower drug prices in response to Trump's threat of hefty pharmaceutical tariffs. Several key firms in the so-called “gig economy” are also expected to report this week, including ride-sharing app Uber, food delivery service DoorDash, and property-rental app Airbnb. While the Federal Reserve has raised worries over the health of the labor market, the government shutdown is again expected to keep officials guessing over employment levels in the U.S. Originally scheduled for Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' monthly employment report for October is expected to be delayed due to the work stoppage. It would be the second straight monthly jobs report delayed due to the shutdown, which is entering its second month. Data on factor orders, the U.S. trade balance, and job openings are also likely to be delayed due to the shutdown. Market watchers won’t be totally in the dark when it comes to jobs in the U.S., as the private-sector ADP employment report remains scheduled for release on Wednesday. The closely followed ISM surveys on the manufacturing and services sectors are also scheduled this week, giving investors some indications on employment and pricing in those sectors. The Fed’s report on consumer credit and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey are also expected this week. Remarks from Philadelphia Fed President Anna Paulson, St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem, and New York Fed President John Williams will also be of note after the central bank last week cut interest rates for the second time this year. Quick Links: Recap Last Week’s Trading | Read Investopedia’s Latest News Monday, Nov. 3 Tuesday, Nov. 4 Wednesday, Nov. 5 Thursday, Nov. 6 Friday, Nov. 7 The Federal Reserve again cut interest rates last week, potentially leading to reductions in the rates that banks and credit unions pay on high-yield savings account deposits. Investopedia's Sabrina Karl has tips on how savvy savers can lock in better rates for months or years to come.

I don’t know why people become serial killers nor do I even care. I only know what should be done with them – and with extreme prejudice. “Why are we obsessed with serial killers?” Maybe because the killer in me is the killer in you…. Disarm, by Billy Corgan So I’ve watched a few of these series below on the central villain, and there is overlap of a kind, like deciphering whether the cult leader( ie, Jeffs ) or the serial killer is actually the worse and more effective evil. Exerting control seems to be a recurring theme. – Jeffrey Dahmer – Warren Jeffs and the FLDS cult ( polygamy ) – Ted Bundy – John Wayne Gacy – Zodiac These are all dark, and highly disturbing. I include the last entry since per the film, released in 2007 and possibly overlooked then, the alleged murderer was never actually caught or arrested for his crimes. My conclusion…some people are just not wired correctly from the get to. I actually have been a little curious about what the big deal is. Where I live, gang members have tens of bodies under their belts. There’re also a whole host of famous people who should be called serial killers but aren’t, like Obama. As far as I can tell, the only difference is that they lack individual notoriety for their crimes, for one reason or the other. The article doesn’t address this at all, unless I missed it and I would agree that the author’s reported curiousity may be less ubiquitous than they believe. It seems to me like the fascination with learning how other persons met with a miserable end is a phenomenom driven by news outlets (traditional and novel) hyping up particularly unique cases as a relatively easy sell for views/clicks etc.. The difference in the treatment is just stark. My news is always filled with the more prolific of the twenty or so deaths over the last week, sometimes barely afforded a paragraph because it’s the same old story over and over. Even when bodies do get found in pieces it’s not particularly earth-shattering. As far as I can tell, it seems to be that having a hundred known victims can never live up to the hype of leaving three of four bodies in sculpted positions. ‘Slasher’ enthusiasts, I’m sure, hardly care to learn how Joe went from selling his body for food to doing his part, keeping morticians securely employed. Mass murderers, spree killers, serial killers are categories, but I guess the category closest to covering officially protected perps would be something like “state sponsorsed terrorism”. US media is obsessed with serial killers (‘we’ means them), because shocking content attracts audience. It’s softcore atrocity porn. A polarizing film but one I think captured this well was Oliver Stone’s “Natural Born Killers”. It’s too graphic and psychedelic for some but the way it portrays the media hype and popular fandom around a duo of serial killers was phenomenal in my opinion. Takes the old adage of “If it bleeds, it leads” and turned the dial up to eleven to critique the 90’s era tabloid news like Hard Copy. Not sure if there are any modern equivalents but to me that film still holds up and remains relevant. In an awful comparison, serial killers are tantamount to aces in that you need 5 kills to establish yourself as such. Note to gun nuts intent on doing your worst: Any outcome in the single-digits is pretty much yeah whatever as far as Presstidigitation is concerned. It might not even make the front page of the internet-such is fate. By serial killers, do they mean social murders? Kills more people than any serial killer ever has. On the AI front, this below in today’s FT reporting the same thing that commenter Rasperry Jam has been saying, that much of AI’s immediate future is in specialized foundation models using proprietary data. . No archived link yet — https://www.ft.com/content/91002071-7874-4cb7-9245-08ca0571c408 The new hot job in AI: forward-deployed engineers OpenAI, Anthropic and Cohere have stepped up hiring for specialists to help businesses adopt their AI models ‘…Anthropic, OpenAI and Cohere are recruiting for so-called forward-deployed engineers, a new job for generative AI companies, as part of a push to generate more revenues by installing specialists within businesses to help them customise their AI models…. ‘…The move comes as businesses across industries from manufacturing to healthcare are increasingly keen to adopt AI tools, but are often unsure how to use the technology and generate a return on investment. “A Fortune 500 bank has completely different needs than a start-up building an AI-native product,” said Cat de Jong, head of applied AI at Anthropic …. ‘While FDEs (forward-deployed engineers) represent a relatively small number of AI groups’ workforce, OpenAI said demand for these roles has exceeded its expectations. ‘The group used this approach to customise its technology for John Deere, an agricultural machinery manufacturer, to help create more precise farming tools. This resulted in farmers reducing chemical spraying by 60 per cent to 70 per cent. ‘OpenAI’s Fournier said: “We learn what customers in different industries really need, we experiment and innovate together, and then those insights help advance OpenAI’s research and product offerings based on what works in the real world.” Me: This is AI coming for McKinsey, Bain, and the like. i.e. Customers used to contract with a management consultancy firm, which then outourced a majority of work to an IT consultancy firm (ITF) that in turn might do 90% of work for 10% of contract value and the MCF took the rest. Any true value lay in which ITF the management consultant firm had the nous to choose. With AI, the ITF — in this case, OpenAI, Anthropic, whichever– disintermediates McKinsey etc. and assigns their role to its own forward development engineers. So if those forward-deployed engineers are working with a Fortune 500 bank or a corporation like John Deere to tailor those AIs to them individually, would it also work out that they would also be funneling those corporation’s vital information back to Anthropic, OpenAI and Cohere for use as training set data? Yup. One thought, suppose there are better, more efficient AI models than Anthropic or Claude, buying into solution before problem…. Don’t rule out consulting yet. How about small language modules? Open labs* are raining small language models right now, some under 1B parameters, which is small enough to work (with patience) on any laptop. Most recently, LiquidAI published open-weight small models specialized for retrieval-augmented generation, summarization, information extraction, and mathematics. There has been a lot of recent work in vision and OCR surfacing recently as well. Small models are becoming more capable and efficient not only to encode or translate the text of a page or sign or describe a photo, but correctly read and reproduce sparse tables or describe the actions occurring between two video frames (with bounding boxes). * By open labs I mean those whose corporate future is not dependent on a world where all inference is centralized in a proprietary cloud, and who are not so motivated to hoard their IP or models. OpenAI and Anthropic, contrariwise, are worthless unless they can force the Western world to channel all its mechanical language processing through their machines and their meters. I think of OpenAI and Anthropic much like Uber, as regulatory plays intending to construct a regulatory environment in which the highly moderated service they offer is socially necessary, and alternatives are rendered illegal, unmerchantable, or impossible. Reminder that the “anti”-AI movement is only a shaping operation in the larger war against local computation, and, being mainly funded and operated by US AI services majors, national security goons, and washed-up pundits trying to uphold a lifestyle, should only ever be held with the same absolute suspicion and cynical hostility as any other corporate astroturf. The myth is not entirely wrong for some health conditions. My mother-in-law had polio as an infant. At some point in her seventies and eighties she (and the medical profession discovered that her muscles only had so many contractions in them and that the exercises she had been doing to maintain her strength were weakening her. would it also work out that they would also be funneling those corporation’s vital information back to Anthropic, OpenAI and Cohere for use as training set data? Typically legal agreements are signed between the model provider and the company purchasing the services that the purchaser’s proprietary data, code, trade-protected processes – anything that falls under IP – remains under the control of the purchaser and is not the property of the model provider. What this means in practice is more nuanced: these companies are hiring the FDE’s as part of a service to create fine-tuned models trained on the customer’s data and processes, for exclusive use by the purchasing company. I’ve worked on projects like this for my company; we didn’t have access to the customer’s IP directly. What we did was brought in the trainer application(s), taught the purchasing customer how to train their model, and provided guidance on how to configure, evaluate and deploy it after it was complete. We also taught them how to prompt/interact with the models based on what they were trying to do. We – and likely these other model providers – provide the purchasing company with the model trainer because taking the customer’s IP out of their network is a) probably too much data, I’m talking in excess of 50 terabytes b) no company’s security team is going to sign off on that no matter how lucrative/cool the end use case will be. So no, they probably aren’t taking the customer’s IP and sending it back to the primary frontier models for training in the way you are describing. They’re making a smaller version of the frontier model trained on the customer’s IP, for the customer’s exclusive use. The FDE are running the training and internal education projects. Sounds like Lean Six Sigma “black belts”. Maybe if Toyota did AI….. Do these OpenAI deployed engineers have the business sense, to replace the usual business process redesign “help” Do these OpenAI deployed engineers have the business sense, to replace the usual business process redesign “help” They don’t work solo, they are always paired with an “echo” team member (sometimes called a deployment strategist) who is the business/pm/person who interfaces directly with the customer technical and business leads. The FDE takes their orders from the DS; the customer yells at/makes demands of the DS. The DS is responsible for initial technical requirements gathering and “phoning home” to the company when business facets change (expansion, contraction, new opportunities, etc). They aren’t there to fully alter the purchasing customer’s business processes but to help the customer achieve their goals with their purchase of the AI services. So it is more of an on-site service partnership than an outside consultant. I lead the deployment strategist team at my company. The “forwards deployed” vocabulary is very militaristic. This strategy of embedding technical staff in the client on an open-ended consulting / brain-siphoning engagement is held up as the secret of Palantir’s “success”. I wonder if the buzzword comes from them too…. Anyway, we’re doing exactly this with our AI Fintech, building a very niche model and, yes, hiring forward deployed engineers for its deployment. Hell’s bells, those photos of the ultra-refined pizza(s) are ridiculous. As every Italian knows, pizza is its own food group, but there are rules. (Although in the Undisclosed Region the use of ingredients and doughs has some jazz-like variations, given that pizza is an exotic import from Naples and not original to the Chocolate City.) Lobster and caviar defeat the purpose of pizza, which is as a comfort food that doesn’t have too much meat or fish on top. It is the dough that matters. Second, I am seeing two other pizzas that aren’t pizzas. I’m not sure what the photos represent. They seem to be of a taco masquerading as a pizza — pieces of burnt sausage with raw lettuce, raw tomatoes, and sliced pickles? Or is this pizzaoidal object a discreet reference to Donald Trump’s eating habits? So these gold-foiled pizzas with pickles are a long way from a real pizza — which reaches the splendor of pizza when topped with cheese and squash blossoms. Or one of those jazzy Piedmontese variations (served at my Undisclosed Favorite Pizzeria): sauce of porcini, topped with porcini and a delicate Piedmontese cheese that is softer and a tad more savory than mozzarella. (Not that I’m complaining about mozzarella!) Heck, why waste a sturgeon’s time like this? PS: From Renato Viola’s home page, I discover that he has decamped to Miami, South Beach. Sic transit gloria pizzae. Thank you! I second that it’s the dough/crust first and foremost. I enjoy anchovies (with capers and red onion, please) from time to time, and have even once made a lobster pizza (it was tasty!), but these are not what I crave when I’m craving pizza. The State of Maine pizza, bacon and onion, is one of my favorites. mrsyk: anchovies (with capers and red onion, please) Anchovies are an object of veneration in the Undisclosed Region — especially the big anchovies from Spain or Sicily. So I understand your weaknesses. Once at my son’s urging we did a lobster fried rice as he said St Tony Bourdain had it. We did it without my wife present (the chef, the boss). It was good. Later my son said he made it up about Tony. There is a fancier Chinese restaurant nearby that makes a lobster fried rice and it’s delicious! They also do a nice dim sum lobster rangoon. I wouldn’t do lobster on a pizza [or mashed potatoes(!), looking at you Barstool-reviewed local Maine pizza place that is otherwise very good], but I find that substituting real lobster for the generally faux crabmeat in Asian cuisine is a nice touch. Horrible faux crabmeat is a nasty substitution for… real crab. Up here, on the BC Coast, the real thing is thankfully far more common — fake crab is extremely rare in Chinese restaurants, much more common in bad or mediocre Japanese restaurants, the latter often having both California Rolls and California Rolls with Real Crab on the menu. Saladizzas? Note ingredients seem to have been added after the pizza is done. Weird. I myself have done some weird dishes as I sometimes tried to be creative with mixed results. Paella madrás comes to mind. That one was edible and quite a thing though I have not tried twice. With time my “creativity” has mostly gone and now I stick most of the time with traditional recipes even if some are new to me. No garlic in the Spanish omelette then? (I’m torn on this one.) Onion, onion! And you can do it “campera” (country-side) with added pepper and chorizo. One bite, everybody knows the rules! In our town we used to have a pizza place called the Pizza Research Institute (PRI) that had the most unusual pizza toppings I’ve ever encountered. Many of my friends raved about it but as a half-Sicilian pizza traditionalist I had to be dragged kicking and screaming to try them. Unfortunately I really did like their pizza (except anything with Gorgonzola, a cheese apparently made from someone’s very dirty underwear). Example: the 3-P ….. pear, potato, and pesto. I know, I know…but it was brilliant. Laughingsong: Sicilian pizza (which is not sfinciune, which is wonderful) is what we in Chicago used to call the pizza of risen dough with much tomato sauce and very little cheese. You’d buy it buy the rectangle at certain bakeries. Oh, no, I feel Proust’s pizza calling… Note on sfinciune: I bought a slice of sfinciune at a nice grocery store in Palermo. It was ambrosial. Cheesy, plus a topping of gratinata, lots of breadcrumbs. Give it a try. Pear, potato, and pesto. The problem is that the pear’s elegant sweetness competes with the pesto’s wonderful perfume. The umami of the potato can’t rescue that threesome. That’s one of the dangers of threesomes. Now: Here in the Undisclosed Region you’d get potato, pesto, and hazelnuts (another object of veneration) or walnuts. Yumliziosa. Yeah, I dunno what any of that is. I did a Neapolitan style 10.5″ last night with a pizza oven, cooked up in about 2 minutes, starts to seriously burn at that point actually. Amazingly puffy but thin crust, overnight yeasted dough, just 00 flour, yeast, water, a bit of salt, and 1/8″ teaspoon of olive oil and a bit of amylase. Pesto, fresh basil, mozzarella cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, and scallions. Best thing ever. Call me a pizza pedestrian, but I prefer mine Montreal style (with the cheese on top) with salty meat toppings — never any vegetables. About “Entrepreneurship in Europe: Where are firms thriving and barely surviving? ” As far as I can tell what the data shows is mostly about how easy and cheap it is to set up and close down shell-companies. I.e. financial shenanigans that on balance is probably damaging both economy and lives. I did not see any reference to that being part of the explanation, either the author is blissfully unaware of that or the author is aware and decided not to include it anywhere in the article. Might be a combination of unaware and being slightly aware but digging into it and writing about it might not be good for career and social prospects. “Opinion: Why Trump’s talk about nuclear testing is dangerous” I’m thinking that it was defensive here. The Russians had just announced the successful testing of their nuclear-powered cruise missile, the Burevestnik. This was followed up by the successful testing of their nuclear-powered torpedo, the Poseidon. For the Neocons, this was bad news. It is one thing setting countries on fire in the Middle east or Africa or South America. They told themselves that they were safe as they had an ocean on each side, Arctic wastes to the north and a narrow peninsular to the south. With these new weapons that obsolete belief is dead. Trump had to throw up a distraction so that people would forget those new Russian weapons so came up with nuclear testing and it has worked. Only thing is whether Trump boxes himself in and is forced to conduct a nuclear test in a year or two from now because of all his belligerent boasting. It was another childish gesture. (Mine’s bigger than yours.) Quotidian Trumpian bravado. It’s not easy being a narcissist. My best guess is he doesn’t know the difference between nuclear powered and nuclear armed. I read someone point out trumps testing talk came just after his TACO with China. It’s round 10 million of SQUIRREL Nuclear testing is under the energy department, not the military. It would take probably years to put together the entire nuclear test program again before a single test could be completed. Historians will look back on 2025 as the US empire’s Suez year, with not just China’s successful pushback against US efforts to stop its rise but also Russia’s crushing of the Ukraine regime and the US-NATO proxy effort to regime change Russia. But, yes: 2030, if the Chinese perform a landing on Luna, is when this change will finally be absorbed by the mass of Americans. Those in DC will likely be the last to face the facts. Here’s The Duran weighing in on this, and I have the same concerns: Poseidon and Trump nuclear testing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugtS1clYjEI Plus, they also discuss the myth that Reagan “won” the Cold War with an arms race, and yes, it’s a myth. I don’t know the details of what brought the USSR down, but I dare say that having old, out of touch, corrupt leadership class that caused great internal disarray was a much greater reason for the USSR’s collapse. (And I see parallels in America’s leadership today, bummer that!) Nexperia allowed to resume exports from China following Trump-Xi talks — companies may seek exemptions from the Ministry of Commerce to restart international deliveries Tom’s Hardware It appears that the USA’s famously brilliant negotiator of a president may not have understood what he agreed to with regard to Nexperia in his recent discussions with Xi. Per Arnaud Bertrand, the main value added by Nexperia NL to the supply chain of chips used in the auto industry is the production of the silicon wafers. Nexperia CN has now re-sourced those wafers domestically, which will leave Nexperia NL to wither away and the American and European auto producers even more dependent on China. Good job, wheeler-dealer Don. There are still propaganda pieces in the Netherlands that Karremans did a great and heroic thing in stealing Nexperia. I always knew that the Dutch press was mostly propaganda, but sometimes it is still a surprise for me when they lie about something. There is a bus-sized hole in that agreement in that China made no commitment to actually approve shipments to Nexperia. In the case of rare earth exports, despite a commitment to resume shipments back in April, very few were approved over the next months. so I scrolled through news sites….no mention of the World Series, lmao. (the secular, structural decline of baseball is another topic). Society/mass culture has become, essentially, circles of “fandoms”—politics, sports, celebrity news, baking, widget-collecting, etc. There is no more universal (national) cultural glue holding society together (except, a John Carpenter-esque: consume!) pretty wild that we live in an age where almost every First Worlder has a supercomputer in their pocket, and people have siloed themself into their own world with their own IV drip of info. it’s like a scene from “Wall-E” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xToQ4cIHkk The only hint of violence on the diamond sputtered out during an ad hoc 7th inning stretch yesterday, but it was more of an Elks Club get together with no rabbit punches or fisticuffs to report and both teams dutifully went back to their respective dugouts… In comparison, I cringe about 6.3x a game during an NFL get together-when violence on the gridiron seems almost like a gut punch to watch. A lot of the skills are similar, throwing, running, catching and hitting-with a different variant on the latter. That was a World Series for the ages-one astounding play on the field after another, and I had mentally consigned myself to being on the losing side of an epic battle fought over 90 feet at a time in the 9th inning, satisfied in that i’d witnessed something special-and then redeemed by home run heroics by the least likely guy on the rosters to clear the fence. p,s, money, money, money dept: Disney owned the Angels around the turn of the century, and in their wisdom decided to trash all of the older players contracts, which were dutifully retrieved by a dumpster diver, and then sold to a coin dealer in Orange County. The ‘money’ one was Nolan Ryan’s yearly contracts, of which there were about 10 or so, and Nolan didn’t make jack, $27k. I must’ve read through hundreds of player contracts, got a little dull after awhile ah ha The internet has everything! Here’s the 1972 Nolan Ryan contract, and oh so plain Jane~ It fetched $6k in 2012 @ auction https://collectrea.com/archives/2012/Spring/767/1972-nolan-ryan-signed-california-angels-contract-first-american-league-contract On Nolan Ryan, when I worked at corporate HQ office of a local retail bank in Plano, Texas, circa 2011 to early 2012 my immediate manager was a Texas Rangers. Centered on the front wall of his office and opposite his desk was the timeless portrait of Ryan giving the business to an unfortunate Robin Ventura. Apparently there was disagreement on the high heat coming out of his right arm…. Always a shame that Ryan wasn’t gifted better team ownership or good franchise circumstances once he left the NY Mets; ok I guess the Astros had some years in the early to mid 80s after all. But for Ryan….No Cy Young award, but all them no hitters! It’s a new age, and it’s filled with football (of the international variety). Go check out an MLS game … Portland vs San Diego was absolutely electric last night. Fans singing, smoke flying, drums drumming, banners waving, stands bouncing. It is it’s OWN culture, and it’s international. Black, white, brown … every nation in the world represented. It’s called “the beautiful game” for a reason, and the beauty extends beyond the pitch. Maybe nobody’s talking about it because they can’t bear to admit that capitalism’s favorite team came out on top. I do like the individual Dodger players, and Ohtani especially is a pleasure to watch. And I do thank LA for taking a bunch of bunch of past their prime players with bloated contracts off the Red Sox’ hands several years ago. But LA is second only to the hated Yankees for teams I actively root against. It’s a team only PE C-suiters could love. Must be nice to bring in a billion dollars worth of pitchers for the last few weeks of the regular season and the p(l)ayoffs. Not every team has that luxury. Any mention of the Dodgers at NC should go under the guillotine watch. I dunno, fell under the spell of Dodger Stadium-the only 1960’s NL baseball stadium still left standing-and unlike most of the other 60’s efforts in that regard, didn’t have the awful dual MLB/NFL thing going on. Haven’t been to a game there this century, so i’m a little rusty-but oh the memories they linger pleasantly enough. From what i’ve seen on tv, the aged edifice looks to have more advertising than I remember seeing, but I’m from the era when trying to make money on such things was considered crass-so it was scant. The only indication @ Dodger Stadium was a big Union 76 orange ball on top of a pillar, so clean. Watched a NHL game from the 70’s awhile back and the boards are bereft of branding, naked as it were-they almost looked whitewashed in fact. Other than the link above? Do mega-sporting events like the World Series pay off? Here’s the economic reality behind them Or was this post a comment in reaction to it?

I can only imagine the panic in the Trump regime as the Chinese get closer and closer to their objective but it is not like they are doing anything about this goal themselves. There is no permanent head of NASA and the guy at SecTransport is acting head – while muttering about how NASA should be folded into the Department of Transport. And he has thrown contracts open again meaning that there is no clear set path to launch a Moon flight but competing corporations who probably have their own ideas how things should be done. But no doubt that Trump will stick to his demand that there be an American on the Moon before the end of his term. It’s a good thing that JFK never said that but only that it be before the end of the decade. “‘The money machine is misfiring’: City blames Brexit for UK’s £20bn productivity headache” What does “productivity” even mean when applied to a parasitic rent-seeking sector? The article actually addresses this but then turns away. One cannot stare into the sun! Of talks about how the historic UK productivity figures were driven by the productivity of the City and it has now cratered and brought the productivity figures down with it. I would like to see an analysis but I wonder if the current low measured productivity is actually any lower than before in many sectors (services), when finance is stripped out. The real new productivity crisis in the UK is in manufacturing as a result of higher energy and commodity costs because of war on Russia. And possibly the explosion of low wage jobs using the boom in legal economic migration (and the no wage jobs using illegal migrants). time change sucks if yer already insomniac and yer vertebrae wake you at 230am. anyhoo..this made the dog and catpile jump up off of me and flee: https://x.com/KimDotcom/status/1984812876398485824 ‘This one is more accurate…😂’ https://xcancel.com/FPSPredatorsHA/status/1984849553355628689#m In a nutshell…, lol. I’m pretty thankful for the dog and catpile these nights. The fur-ball foursome got btus to spare. yeah…before it was just Osa the dog, and Bob the Cat(who has always been kind of a dick)…but the 3 juvenile cats that were friendly to me at the bar…i brought them into the house while i went on my catmurder spree. and they have become fixtures…much more cuddly than Bob ever was(he hates them,lol)so i have Bob behind my head in the pillownest, Osa along my right thigh, and 3 little cats piled up on my legs. makes it hard to get up for coffee in the am. or to tend the woodstoves, etc. but they are a welcome source of heat…and pretty good company, so far…galloping alongside me back and forth as i go about my doins. theyve also apparently inspired Osa to follow me around more. she likes them, wants to play, etc…but they’re wary,lol. and this sorta cold am(for me,lol-, was the first time she didnt growl when one of them slipped off my legs and nuzzled against her. still…a warm woman would be preferable… Scientists just shattered a major exercise myth ScienceDaily Scientists just discovered something that runners and cyclists knew all along. Even amateurs know that measuring pulse after waking up is how one can gauge change over time, and that it gets lower as you get in shape. These results challenge a long-held belief, once repeated by US President Donald Trump, that the human body is like a battery with a limited energy supply and that exercise only depletes it. LOL, Trump science. Believe it or not, that was the first guy on the Moon’s thoughts, too. I believe that every human has a finite number of heartbeats… and I don’t intend to waste any of mine. Neil Armstrong That’s why he took one small step in stead of one giant leap. Another example of why someone being an expert in one thing does not translate to them knowing jack about anything else. Yet, for some reason there’s no end to the various celebrities opining on important topics, tech oligarchs getting the grubby mits on everything, and me here in the comments sharing my opinion on stuff I clearly know nothing about. …got the extended warranty on heartbeats 100 billion, or 100 years-whatever comes first. And here I’ve been thinking I only had a set number of heart beats allowed per day and exceeding that number would be instant death. Guess I no longer have that excuse to not exercise! Why Do Spiders Decorate Their Webs? A New Piece of the Puzzle Nautilus ~~~~~~~~~~~ I find black widow webs to be the most fascinating, almost looks as if the 8 legged one was on an acid trip during construction of. So intricate and chaotic-but with a purpose. Then there was the time NASA fed various psychotropics to spiders and photographed the results. See: https://rarehistoricalphotos.com/nasa-spiders-drugs-experiment/ Here’s a video that introduced me to that research https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZoZhM0E8Ow I work in this area and this is my experience. Large companies (and some not so large) are extremely paranoid about allowing the AI companies to use their vital information for training. The major AI players all sell private instances where users are assured that no one outside of their company can use their data for training or analyze the custom models. They put language in contracts and audits are conducted by 3rd parties to verify these claims. Its above my pay grade to determine what they are really doing behind the scenes, but given the way the contracts are written it would be a major scandal if they ever got caught cheating. A big worry to many is the user sending private information to the models running in public instances which do not have these guarantees. My employer blocks these sites, and we’re all told to use the private version. A second worry that is coming on strong is the use of Chinese models like DeepSeek and Qwen (even privately maintained versions using open source) . More companies are adopting policies where these are forbidden because, I assume, the Chinese cannot be trusted. One company described it as “geopolitical models are forbidden”. Re: Scientists just shattered a major exercise myth This is not new. back in the 70’s a friend gave me the “using up extra heartbeats” thing and I pointed out that: 3 mile run at 160 beats per min 160*20 = 3200 beats warm up cool down and other activity 120 beats per min 120*40 = 4800 beats resting pulse 50 for the rest of the day 23*60*50 = 69000 beats total 3200 + 4800 +69000 = 77000 beats per day him resting pulse 72*24*60 = 103689 beats per day (this assumes that during every day activity, his pulse is the same amount above resting pulse as mine) he started taking the stairs yeah this is some seriously auld news. It’s good to get it out there anyway as lots of the kids these days are all weights and no cardio. All weights and no cardio is also auld news, and no legs day too. ‘Massimo @Rainmaker1973 Students in China are encouraged to rest and nap during school.’ If those kids are doing a 12 hour day, then this is a vital necessity. I really like the way those desks converted into beds and they could teach the airlines a few tricks. You can see that there are multiple models here in use. And after those kids have their nap, they are ready to absorb more lessons. Of course if you read the replies to this tweet, you will find many sour grapes- https://xcancel.com/Rainmaker1973/status/1983685284827918711 I particularly liked the cabinets that had a whole bed hidden inside!! I could see a big market and lot of people making use of them. Homeless facilities, detention centers, airbnbs, Americans just trying to survive they’re inequality… Also, how is the United States education system going to compete with China? 12 hours of instruction a day! (Minus naps) I think car makers might be wise to incorporate some of the design implemented in the Chinese school desks to enable cars to become mobile homes … of a sort. Even dead cars could provide a home for the growing hordes of homeless. I have mixed feelings about 12 hours per day of instruction for school children. I learned the most from my own studies after I came home from school and from the time I spent at the public library and in my room attempting to write the most convincing essay I could for a homework assignment. Once I reached an age of double digits, I estimate that many, though not all days, I may have spent more than 12 hours per day studying when I add my study at home with the time spent in the classroom. I also greatly value the time I spent learning to play a musical instrument, or wandering in nature and in museums or attending the Summer Shakespeare plays and orchestral concerts my parents brought me and my siblings to. I believe schools and parents should foster a love for learning, endless curiosity, imagination, and questioning the ‘right answer’ in a way I did not see or sense in the schooling of my own children. As u.s. school are constituted, a 12 hour school day would bring the death of learning and those attributes I value. Son #1 is currently at a school where a 12h day is possible, if he went in for breakfast (07:30) and stayed for dinner (18:00) and left when the boarders do their prep (19:30ish). As it is, an 8.5h day is standard (08:45-17:15). He often goes in early for breakfast because it is a full English (sausages and bacon, hash browns, black pudding, eggs etc) but only stays late to play DnD! He also has Saturday school…. “Son #1” sounds like a name Musk would give to one of his kids. :) FYI that the Sonar 21 link seems to have some information it shouldn’t in the link URL. It came from a subscriber and needs to be cleaned up after the “?”. AI Blamed for Tens of Thousands of White Collar Layoffs – Futurism There should be a case study about that headline as being indicative of a larger problem. The real headline, more descriptive of the contents of the article and the reality (and also very catchy) is buried at the last paragraph: “AI is a flashy scapegoat for mounting white collar layoffs.” I drove by a ‘natural’ park in an arroyo yesterday, with pretty steep terrain, and a driverless mower on a two-track hydrostatic system was being driven by a parks worker with a R/C joystick gizmo, a dozen or so parks workers in sweatshirt uniforms watching. I circled back, got some pics, talked with El Jefe for a couple minutes. Asked him how soon he would plot waypoints via GPS, and have a computer driving it from an office with the lights off, the mower automatically re-docking to recharge batteries, and how many fewer staff he would have? He opined there was always weed-whacking to be done, doubted any man-power cuts. I was not in accord, but hey. Also asked him why they were mowing native bunch-grasses— wasn’t the point to be maintenance free and natural? I also suggested he get some bumper stickers printed up: “Support Universal Basic Income”. He was skeptical that Elroy, Jeff, Bill, Sergei would be delighted to start paying taxes to keep humans fed, clothed, warm, dry, and educated, with access to health care and clean potable water. Oh well. Who’s going to the park that the time and money will still be spent maintaining? a parks worker, or a forward deployed engineer? And if “natural”or “wildlife” was ever really the goal for the area, all machines would need to be removed as well. “Desperate Special Forces Bid to Save Pokrovsk Fails as AFU Faces Unprecedented Collapse on Every Front” I have no idea what good the Ukrainians thought that 11 special forces soldiers would do dropped near Pokrovsk. They were quickly wiped out so the whole thing was just a suicide mission. Seems that DC is going to have to get ready for several Ukrainian fortified cities to fall, one after another. I’m sure that Trump will demand an immediate ceasefire and to freeze this war on the contact line and if Russia does not agree, he will do something. But I bet that there will be an element of panic in the air when this happens, not only in DC but also in Brussels. A F U Hmmmm. Irony or paradox? A F U. Irony or Paradox? The fog of war keeps getting thicker. Who knows what their goal was? Extraction? Protecting key assets? A coked out plan to have commandos raid behind enemy lines and save the day? A drowning person will grab on to anything they can in their desperation. I have no idea how the peace will eventually be shaped but the dimensions of the coming AFU collapse are becoming increasingly clear despite the fog. The AFU will be completely destroyed and any patriotic fighters left standing will join terror groups to make strikes throughout the world. The best guess I’ve read so far is that they were supposed to reach the “sculpted” Pokrovsk city sign at the western entrance to the city, as the helicopter landed less than half a mile away and five of them were killed within a few hundred yards of it. Had they reached it, they could have raised an Ukrainian flag there, take some photos and skedaddle to Dnipro with “solid proof” that Pokrovsk is like totally back under Ukrainian control. It would fit in with the previous high-risk, showy gimmicks Ukrainians tend to do to win the war in social media, but which have little if any effect on the war itself. Perhaps their intent was to surrender with the rest of the guys. That would sure be my goal. commandos raid behind enemy lines and save the day This, my ol’ chap. Yet another one, straight from the UK. Shaken, not stirred.

Why, just yesterday the chairman of Nato’s military committee, one Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, said that >> from an operational point of view he considered the Russia-Ukraine war was >> bogged down, and “it was almost time to sit and talk because it’s a waste of lives”. https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxng7kxnp9o /sarc That is Monty Python level article, image included.

Nope. It´s mainly political. The real danger of course being how would the Russians react. Although, and I tend to agree, they would act only against targets on Ukrainian territory. Why risk more if the military fallout of Tomahawks would be really limited. Of course if the US wants to start WWIII. They can do that. But the fact that someone at Pentagon – allegedly – greenl-lit it now – doesn´t mean more than just that. Factions vs. factions. Provocation for sake of it due to lack of means and strategy. Russians are well aware of this. Fortunately for us.

I have a crazy notion and, if needed, talk me down. If they can get back to ridicuously easy money policy, they are going to credit “AI” with “productivity gains”. The U.S. joint staff aka pentagon said there are enough tomahawks to send some to Zelenski. Russian staff gets CNN feeds too! What was not said: Japan wants 400 for their missile destroyers, there not being much carrier in missile defense. Also, how to hit anything if U.S. does not provide top secret special access targeting and navigation aids. Those spunky Kievan contracts can get all the engineering specs to do what U.S. wants with tomahawks. Maybe shoot them off MiG 27’s. Are they karting in a ship to launch them from? A 50-foot sailing yacht named Andromeda. Of course! So efficient! From what I’ve seen, there are two batteries in the Army inventory. I assume one of these would be sent in theater. The launcher is housed in a 40-ft container, so an inviting target. I suppose you could park these in the far west by the Poland border to make it a more difficult counter-battery target. Targeting depends on the actual target and desired effect. If it’s a V-1-style terror effect, I suppose it’s possible that inertial nav all the way might be feasible. I would assume GPS denial is something Russia would pursue, at least near high-value targets. Tomahawk can have some onboard nav sensors that would be difficult to block, but depend on prior intel data, which I assume probably exists for any interesting targets. Enroute planning is based the missile RCS (detectability) and low-level flight to take advantage of terrain masking. Again you need intel of the anti-air defense capability. I don’t know, but assume these days actual terrain elevation data is sufficiently available and easily disseminated to shooters that that is no longer a limiting factor. While I suppose “black” programs could be postulated to exist, I continue to doubt the idea that a nuclear warhead option is available for any current missile or launcher. Stock market bubble predictions are becoming, or it’s just my view, seemingly prevalent.

Why Africa has become a hotspot for war -Al Jazeera Which reminds me of the latest “keep people scrambling foreign policy” effort: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-says-christians-face-existential-threat-in-nigeria/ “Trump threatens to cut off aid to Nigeria, orders Pentagon to “prepare for possible action” over persecution of Christians” And before people jump in with “the military won’t have the ability to do this or that”, it should be obvious by now that winning some conventional miltary conflict is not the goal. How odd the timing of that news when just a few days ago it was made public that Nigeria is looking to revive state-owned refineries. One refinery of note: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangote_refinery/ And I don’t doubt other global players have lobbied the US to intervene. There has also been a lot of talk about Nigeria (among others) transitioning from SWIFT to CIPS. A shout out to the 12 step groups (Because it is Sunday) who are, to me, the most interesting spiritual phenomenon of the 20th Century. I doubt that there is an adult American who has not lost someone they cared about to addiction, I certainly have. I have also been fortunate enough to have several people I had written off become clean and sober, people who now contribute significantly to their communities. I have read the “Big Book” and although it is better written than the book of mormon or the scientology texts, it is worthy of the Bulwer Lytton award… Happily the program is summarized in two pages, one longer than the summary of “The lazy man’s guide to Enlightenment’. Trump’s Retribution Campaign Leaves D.C. Prosecutor’s Office in Crisis (NY Times via archive.ph) America is a banana republic Under the vaulted arches of the National Union Building, a group of federal prosecutors gathered recently for what has become an all-too-common ritual: saying goodbye to colleagues. The speeches that night reflected the despondent mood inside the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, as the lawyers who were quitting urged those staying behind to forge ahead in uncertain times. Do what’s right, they said. Speak truth to power. Uphold the rule of law. But as the hour grew later — and the bar tab bigger — the politics that have buffeted the office for months suddenly intruded on the evening, people who were there recounted later. In a quiet corner, away from the charcuterie and veggie dip, Jonathan Hornok, a top aide to Jeanine Pirro, the Trump appointee picked to run the office, was firing Jon Hooks, a senior prosecutor who had worked there for nearly 20 years. That a respected supervisor with a long career could be stripped of his job in the middle of a farewell party for his colleagues captured something of the Darwinian tumult that has wracked the prosecutors’ office since President Trump returned to the White House and set about remaking the Justice Department in his image. Bad Jonathan! RE DHS Wants States to Hand Over Driver’s License Data for Citizenship Checks It’s amusing that a kind of national database of Americans, once anathema to conservatives, is being implemented by the Trump administration under the dubious pretense of stopping “voter fraud”. Literally there it is The Department of Homeland Security says it intends to add state driver’s license information to a swiftly expanding federal system envisioned as a one-stop shop for checking citizenship. I imagine Republicans in Congress will pass a bill to outlaw this or conduct investigations any time now… That’s what the state ‘Real ID drivers license’ program is all about. It’s also the prelude to the rollout of official digital IDs. Note: you do not have to have a Real ID drivers license to drive, or even to fly.

Here’s Why The REAL ID Must Be Stopped & How To Do It! ! w/ Twila Brase https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwhe0gNgxcI if only the people didnt have goldfish memory,lol my immediate recollection upon reading that was a few years ago in Texas….the texgop has long insisted thay they are all about Homerule…as in no intruding big gubmit from above, meddling in local communities. until a few texas cities voted to ban fracking…or to not support the border patrol…or whatever. then, Austin had to Step in and force them to toe the line. at the time, i wrote a furious email to all the texgop creatures, including the lite guv, Radio Preacher, calling them out for utter hypocrisy. that was also the last time i wrote a letter to the editor to the local paper/brochure. (it was well received) of course, the dems are no better. all is contingent and transactional…except that it all must serve the already rich and powerful. Researchers Apply AI To Defend Against Stuxnet-Like Cyber Attacks This is very late to the party. We did exactly this with a French start-up (reverse engineer Siemens PLC’s and do deep packet inspection and AI analysis of packets and traffic to detect anomalies) which we sold to Cisco as the core of their OT (operating technology) division. In 2015-2018. Students in China are encouraged to rest and nap during school. If these various desk designs don’t work out in Chinese schools, maybe blowing and Airbus can pick them up on the cheap and use them in planes. I guarantee they would be a gigantic hit. It’s going to get messy when the Turkeys come home to roost. turkeys…at least the wild-derived ones…are rather fastidious, for barnyard fowl,lol. its the dern ducks that shit everywhere. one morning, unbeknownst to me, there was one roosting on the palapa thing above my barstump…and i’m sitting here drinkin coffee, listening to coyotes, and imagining Evangeline Lilly sitting across from me…and that damned duck just lets one drop, right on my shoulder. and duckshit is pretty nasty,lol. i look up ere i sit down, now. but to your point…it was always gonna come home. down at the bottom where ive lived for most of my life, that was frelling obvious…and has been ongoing…at first, under the aegis of the War on Drugs. the difference between the late 80’s and now, is that the repression, oppression, and all around fascistic jackbootery has been creeping up the class ladder, of late…so more formerly important people are noticing. Gaza is a Method…just like Jakarta. the only question is where lies the bridge too far? we’re obviously not there, yet…too many are still relatively too comfortable to upset the applecart and really resist. but that will come. likely when the Sith are even more well entrenched than they are, now. and i remain a male Cassandra, being dragged out of walmart, crying “Doom!” “Beware Chinese bearing gift cards!” Oftentimes the commentariat is good for a chuckle. Sometimes a bellylaugh. Robotaxis… I’m prosecuted if I mount the sidewalk and mow down a pedestrian. Who faces *any penalty* if a robo-vehicle does that? Here is a very interesting video by Black American content creator Tabitha expanding on her theory that J D Vance will divorce his wife Usha in order to raise his chances of getting elected President. The New Kirx Klan Maga base will not tolerate a Brown Hindu Indian first lady. So Vance needs to get a new wife more to the New Kirx Klan’s MAGA-base’s liking. ” AMERICA FIRST… J.D. Vance Gets A Political Warning From A Leader of Young Republican Men!! ” https://www.youtube.com/live/M3E3t00nXQ4 thats sad as hell,lol. i know nothing about her, but i am an agnostic mystic druidy person, and my wife was catholic…and i supported our boys doing the catholic thing(imagine me in church…after her funeral mass, at the reception/dinner thing in the parish hall(overflow crowds), the Father pointedly sat by me, and we talked about Pseudodionysius,lol…because i am “not contained between my hat and my boots”…i told him that every priest needs a druid friend, and he agreed(!), but hasnt taken me up on it) so i understand multifaith marriage, and how much tolerance and forbearance it takes. thats the sort of example this country needs…and it would be doubly sad to see him cast that away…along with her and their kids…for some short term political calculation. The problem with that theory: Anyone that rabid about interracial marriage would likely not be excited about baby daddy to mixed kids. He can’t divorce the kids. I don’t know if the video talks about that. Don’t really want to watch it. Tabitha is pointing out that J D ” Despicable Little Tatoo” Vance is entirely soul-less, pragmatic and beneath ethics and morality. She therefor predicts that he will divorce his current wife and even try marrying the Widow Kirk if he can. It may not convince GroyperMAGA because of the mixed kids. But Vance will give it a good hard try. The test of a theory is in the coming-true or not of its predictions. If Vance divorces Suha then Tabitha’s theory is pretty good. If he then goes on to marry the Widow Kirk, then her theory is VERY good. Assuming Vance and his wife had a Catholic wedding, Vance would need to have the marriage annulled. Which can be done, but it is complicated. he is not married to his current wife “through the Catholic Church”. i state that categorically, because Tam and I tried, hard…but i would not lie.lol the part of the Catholic Church apparatus that deals with that, to my surprise, is what used to be called the Office of the Inquisition(yeah, that one,lol)…called something else more anodyne, now, that i dont remember. and they are hard core with their check boxes. i was babtise Lutheran, against my will, that wasnt even formed yet,lol…but that part was ok(i was an Xtian, in their eyes)…but i wouldnt submit to professions of Faith…which meant a hard NO!. theres no way in hell that Vance and his Hindu wife were married “through the church”. the Catholic government(what it is) takes their rules seriously. that Priest…Father Melvin…was a nice guy, and he meant well..a kind man, altogether. but he was a clerk…checking off boxes…not a spiritual leader. i found him kind and nice, but boring,lol. his successor out here, Father Red…young guy, inquisitive, well read…is much more inspiring…but also more strict when it comes to the Forms…ie: when he heard her last confession, and administered the Last rights, i had to leave the room…because i wasnt a Catholic. and she wanted me there. bt all that was between her and god, and i was damned to hell, and all. so i wasnt allowed in the temporarily Holy Space. lest i pollute it with my heathenism. Who knows. Maybe he will get ICE Barbie to put bounties on the children. I know a reasonable number of Evangelical Christians and the ones I know are not racists; in fact some of them are themselves Indian (from India) and some are married to Indian people. Vance would have a great advantage among Evangelicals to remain married to Usha, not just because he is supposed to remain married, but also because the question of her possible conversion would be endlessly fascinating to them. Regarding the Tesla robotaxi numbers Elon is spouting this line in the article stood out: “Considering that there are only two months left in the fourth quarter of 2025, Tesla’s Robotaxi team will likely be extremely busy during the next eight weeks.” Curious, I looked up how many are currently in the road: There are ZERO on the road in the Bay Area. https://electrek.co/2025/10/22/tesla-is-trying-to-deceive-investors-into-thinking-it-has-san-francisco-robotaxis/ From 0 to 1,000 in eight weeks? Sounds like another one of Elon’s fanciful predictions. Also, according to that article they don’t have a California license for autonomous vehicles but the law isn’t a concern for Elon so doubt that is a concern. A.I. Is Making Death Threats Way More Realistic (NY Times via archive.ph) Even though she was toughened by years spent working in internet activism, Caitlin Roper found herself traumatized by the online threats she received this year. There was the picture of herself hanging from a noose, dead. And another of herself ablaze, screaming. The posts were part of a surge of vitriol directed at Ms. Roper and her colleagues at Collective Shout, an Australian activist group, on X and other social media platforms. Some of it, including images of the women flayed, decapitated or fed into a wood chipper, was seemingly enabled — and given a visceral realism — by generative artificial intelligence. In some of the images, Ms. Roper was wearing a blue floral dress that she does, in fact, own. This year is lit. Trump really is the perfect embodiment of our elite; petty, corrupt, self serving, careless, and entirely focused on immediate gratification. He’s the perfect symbol of a failing state, an empire in terminal decline, entirely unaware even of the limits of power or concerned with the outcomes of its exercise. Well put. I might hazard to add that the corruption is consuming everything and everyone around him. We’re down to M T-G and Massie on the GOP side as the only pols left with anything resembling a soul. Even Rand Paul has become a petty, corrupt little tyrant. He was blathering on about raising the Social Security retirement age to 70 the other day – as if there aren’t a gazillion other real issues out there. I guess kicking old people when they’re down is easier than taking on the MIC, endless wars, genocide, and economic insanity … remember when Rand Paul actually stood up against someone more powerful than him? Remember when his Dad fought to audit the Fed? It’s all a memory now. Other than the immediate gratification bit, that description might serve just as well for Biden, which is appropriate given the Uniparty nature of the late stage empire’s elite Israel’s Zombie Economy Part 3: Israel’s Breakdown Into Tribes – Bassam Haddad Interviews Shir Hever Part 3 of 5 part series by Jadaliyya https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJTTm1Ep1mA We are not obsessed with serial killers. The PRESS is obsessed with sensationalism. And only about doing sensationalism with POOR & POWERLESS serial killers. Why? To distract us all from the actual MASS MURDERERS, GENOCIDAL even, that present themselves as “democratic” or “moderate” or “good” people: – Bush, Obama, Trump, Biden, Netahyanu, etc. There is not a single POOR & POWERLESS serial killer that reaches even near the kill count of the 5 Hitlers mentioned above. The Press exists to distract and manipulate. The capital/property exists to own the Press. The labour rights DON’T exist in order to facilitate taming actual journalists. The ones that refuse being tamed end up like Assange or the Gaza journalists… This is what “freedom and democracy” really means in the collective West nowadays, and perhaps since always. We all rember that POOR & POWERLESS guy named Jack, the reaper, from London. But the biggest serial killer of them all, in London, are Queen Elizabeth and Winston Churchill, responsible for the provoked famine in colonized Bangladesh, resulting in the GENOCIDE of around 3 million humans. The same press that tells us we “are absessed” with serial killers, doesn’t write a single line about the biggest serial killers of all, who exterminate millions of humans. Because when a serial killer is RICH & POWERFUL, the western “free and democratic” Press calls them “heroes” and “exemplar leaders”… Sorry, there is plenty of evidence to counter your assertion. Mystery novels and movies, which are not press organs, are also fixated with serial killers. See the Academy Award winner Silence of the Lambs as one of many examples. The Hollywood and the Press (aka MSM) are two cheeks of the same behind. Different organs working in concert. Yup. They are obsessed, and we are getting the mushroom treatment. I’m not obsessed with serial killers. Couldn’t care less. My buddy says he’s a cereal killer and a celery stalker. Ukrainian computer game-style drone attack system goes ‘viral’ I’ve been pondering some related things for a while and have some thoughts/predictions: 1. Video games will be used (maybe are already being used) to both train AI and find the best fpv pilots 2. Pro gaming is dominated by teenage boys. Not just because they are the most interested, but because they are the best at them. Once you hit 20 you’re too slow and on the way out. 3. It’s only a matter of time until we see an Ender’s Game scenario, in which teenage boys are recruited and utilised in real-world drone warfare and kill lots of “enemies”. 4. I hate this You are late with predictions. ;) FPV Kamikaze Drone, Release Date: 15 Dec, 2023 https://store.steampowered.com/app/2707940/FPV_Kamikaze_Drone/ Russian ad for feared RUBIKON drone unit https://www.bitchute.com/video/qZ5EPTxaKXpi Your email address will not be published.

I don’t know why people become serial killers nor do I even care. I only know what should be done with them – and with extreme prejudice. “Why are we obsessed with serial killers?” Maybe because the killer in me is the killer in you…. Disarm, by Billy Corgan So I’ve watched a few of these series below on the central villain, and there is overlap of a kind, like deciphering whether the cult leader( ie, Jeffs ) or the serial killer is actually the worse and more effective evil. Exerting control seems to be a recurring theme. – Jeffrey Dahmer – Warren Jeffs and the FLDS cult ( polygamy ) – Ted Bundy – John Wayne Gacy – Zodiac These are all dark, and highly disturbing. I include the last entry since per the film, released in 2007 and possibly overlooked then, the alleged murderer was never actually caught or arrested for his crimes. My conclusion…some people are just not wired correctly from the get to. I actually have been a little curious about what the big deal is. Where I live, gang members have tens of bodies under their belts. There’re also a whole host of famous people who should be called serial killers but aren’t, like Obama. As far as I can tell, the only difference is that they lack individual notoriety for their crimes, for one reason or the other. The article doesn’t address this at all, unless I missed it and I would agree that the author’s reported curiousity may be less ubiquitous than they believe. It seems to me like the fascination with learning how other persons met with a miserable end is a phenomenom driven by news outlets (traditional and novel) hyping up particularly unique cases as a relatively easy sell for views/clicks etc.. The difference in the treatment is just stark. My news is always filled with the more prolific of the twenty or so deaths over the last week, sometimes barely afforded a paragraph because it’s the same old story over and over. Even when bodies do get found in pieces it’s not particularly earth-shattering. As far as I can tell, it seems to be that having a hundred known victims can never live up to the hype of leaving three of four bodies in sculpted positions. ‘Slasher’ enthusiasts, I’m sure, hardly care to learn how Joe went from selling his body for food to doing his part, keeping morticians securely employed. Mass murderers, spree killers, serial killers are categories, but I guess the category closest to covering officially protected perps would be something like “state sponsorsed terrorism”. US media is obsessed with serial killers (‘we’ means them), because shocking content attracts audience. It’s softcore atrocity porn. A polarizing film but one I think captured this well was Oliver Stone’s “Natural Born Killers”. It’s too graphic and psychedelic for some but the way it portrays the media hype and popular fandom around a duo of serial killers was phenomenal in my opinion. Takes the old adage of “If it bleeds, it leads” and turned the dial up to eleven to critique the 90’s era tabloid news like Hard Copy. Not sure if there are any modern equivalents but to me that film still holds up and remains relevant. In an awful comparison, serial killers are tantamount to aces in that you need 5 kills to establish yourself as such. Note to gun nuts intent on doing your worst: Any outcome in the single-digits is pretty much yeah whatever as far as Presstidigitation is concerned. It might not even make the front page of the internet-such is fate. By serial killers, do they mean social murders? Kills more people than any serial killer ever has. On the AI front, this below in today’s FT reporting the same thing that commenter Rasperry Jam has been saying, that much of AI’s immediate future is in specialized foundation models using proprietary data. . No archived link yet — https://www.ft.com/content/91002071-7874-4cb7-9245-08ca0571c408 The new hot job in AI: forward-deployed engineers OpenAI, Anthropic and Cohere have stepped up hiring for specialists to help businesses adopt their AI models ‘…Anthropic, OpenAI and Cohere are recruiting for so-called forward-deployed engineers, a new job for generative AI companies, as part of a push to generate more revenues by installing specialists within businesses to help them customise their AI models…. ‘…The move comes as businesses across industries from manufacturing to healthcare are increasingly keen to adopt AI tools, but are often unsure how to use the technology and generate a return on investment. “A Fortune 500 bank has completely different needs than a start-up building an AI-native product,” said Cat de Jong, head of applied AI at Anthropic …. ‘While FDEs (forward-deployed engineers) represent a relatively small number of AI groups’ workforce, OpenAI said demand for these roles has exceeded its expectations. ‘The group used this approach to customise its technology for John Deere, an agricultural machinery manufacturer, to help create more precise farming tools. This resulted in farmers reducing chemical spraying by 60 per cent to 70 per cent. ‘OpenAI’s Fournier said: “We learn what customers in different industries really need, we experiment and innovate together, and then those insights help advance OpenAI’s research and product offerings based on what works in the real world.” Me: This is AI coming for McKinsey, Bain, and the like. i.e. Customers used to contract with a management consultancy firm, which then outourced a majority of work to an IT consultancy firm (ITF) that in turn might do 90% of work for 10% of contract value and the MCF took the rest. Any true value lay in which ITF the management consultant firm had the nous to choose. With AI, the ITF — in this case, OpenAI, Anthropic, whichever– disintermediates McKinsey etc. and assigns their role to its own forward development engineers. So if those forward-deployed engineers are working with a Fortune 500 bank or a corporation like John Deere to tailor those AIs to them individually, would it also work out that they would also be funneling those corporation’s vital information back to Anthropic, OpenAI and Cohere for use as training set data? Yup. One thought, suppose there are better, more efficient AI models than Anthropic or Claude, buying into solution before problem…. Don’t rule out consulting yet. How about small language modules? Open labs* are raining small language models right now, some under 1B parameters, which is small enough to work (with patience) on any laptop. Most recently, LiquidAI published open-weight small models specialized for retrieval-augmented generation, summarization, information extraction, and mathematics. There has been a lot of recent work in vision and OCR surfacing recently as well. Small models are becoming more capable and efficient not only to encode or translate the text of a page or sign or describe a photo, but correctly read and reproduce sparse tables or describe the actions occurring between two video frames (with bounding boxes). * By open labs I mean those whose corporate future is not dependent on a world where all inference is centralized in a proprietary cloud, and who are not so motivated to hoard their IP or models. OpenAI and Anthropic, contrariwise, are worthless unless they can force the Western world to channel all its mechanical language processing through their machines and their meters. I think of OpenAI and Anthropic much like Uber, as regulatory plays intending to construct a regulatory environment in which the highly moderated service they offer is socially necessary, and alternatives are rendered illegal, unmerchantable, or impossible. Reminder that the “anti”-AI movement is only a shaping operation in the larger war against local computation, and, being mainly funded and operated by US AI services majors, national security goons, and washed-up pundits trying to uphold a lifestyle, should only ever be held with the same absolute suspicion and cynical hostility as any other corporate astroturf. The myth is not entirely wrong for some health conditions. My mother-in-law had polio as an infant. At some point in her seventies and eighties she (and the medical profession discovered that her muscles only had so many contractions in them and that the exercises she had been doing to maintain her strength were weakening her. would it also work out that they would also be funneling those corporation’s vital information back to Anthropic, OpenAI and Cohere for use as training set data? Typically legal agreements are signed between the model provider and the company purchasing the services that the purchaser’s proprietary data, code, trade-protected processes – anything that falls under IP – remains under the control of the purchaser and is not the property of the model provider. What this means in practice is more nuanced: these companies are hiring the FDE’s as part of a service to create fine-tuned models trained on the customer’s data and processes, for exclusive use by the purchasing company. I’ve worked on projects like this for my company; we didn’t have access to the customer’s IP directly. What we did was brought in the trainer application(s), taught the purchasing customer how to train their model, and provided guidance on how to configure, evaluate and deploy it after it was complete. We also taught them how to prompt/interact with the models based on what they were trying to do. We – and likely these other model providers – provide the purchasing company with the model trainer because taking the customer’s IP out of their network is a) probably too much data, I’m talking in excess of 50 terabytes b) no company’s security team is going to sign off on that no matter how lucrative/cool the end use case will be. So no, they probably aren’t taking the customer’s IP and sending it back to the primary frontier models for training in the way you are describing. They’re making a smaller version of the frontier model trained on the customer’s IP, for the customer’s exclusive use. The FDE are running the training and internal education projects. Sounds like Lean Six Sigma “black belts”. Maybe if Toyota did AI….. Do these OpenAI deployed engineers have the business sense, to replace the usual business process redesign “help” Do these OpenAI deployed engineers have the business sense, to replace the usual business process redesign “help” They don’t work solo, they are always paired with an “echo” team member (sometimes called a deployment strategist) who is the business/pm/person who interfaces directly with the customer technical and business leads. The FDE takes their orders from the DS; the customer yells at/makes demands of the DS. The DS is responsible for initial technical requirements gathering and “phoning home” to the company when business facets change (expansion, contraction, new opportunities, etc). They aren’t there to fully alter the purchasing customer’s business processes but to help the customer achieve their goals with their purchase of the AI services. So it is more of an on-site service partnership than an outside consultant. I lead the deployment strategist team at my company. The “forwards deployed” vocabulary is very militaristic. This strategy of embedding technical staff in the client on an open-ended consulting / brain-siphoning engagement is held up as the secret of Palantir’s “success”. I wonder if the buzzword comes from them too…. Anyway, we’re doing exactly this with our AI Fintech, building a very niche model and, yes, hiring forward deployed engineers for its deployment. Hell’s bells, those photos of the ultra-refined pizza(s) are ridiculous. As every Italian knows, pizza is its own food group, but there are rules. (Although in the Undisclosed Region the use of ingredients and doughs has some jazz-like variations, given that pizza is an exotic import from Naples and not original to the Chocolate City.) Lobster and caviar defeat the purpose of pizza, which is as a comfort food that doesn’t have too much meat or fish on top. It is the dough that matters. Second, I am seeing two other pizzas that aren’t pizzas. I’m not sure what the photos represent. They seem to be of a taco masquerading as a pizza — pieces of burnt sausage with raw lettuce, raw tomatoes, and sliced pickles? Or is this pizzaoidal object a discreet reference to Donald Trump’s eating habits? So these gold-foiled pizzas with pickles are a long way from a real pizza — which reaches the splendor of pizza when topped with cheese and squash blossoms. Or one of those jazzy Piedmontese variations (served at my Undisclosed Favorite Pizzeria): sauce of porcini, topped with porcini and a delicate Piedmontese cheese that is softer and a tad more savory than mozzarella. (Not that I’m complaining about mozzarella!) Heck, why waste a sturgeon’s time like this? PS: From Renato Viola’s home page, I discover that he has decamped to Miami, South Beach. Sic transit gloria pizzae. Thank you! I second that it’s the dough/crust first and foremost. I enjoy anchovies (with capers and red onion, please) from time to time, and have even once made a lobster pizza (it was tasty!), but these are not what I crave when I’m craving pizza. The State of Maine pizza, bacon and onion, is one of my favorites. mrsyk: anchovies (with capers and red onion, please) Anchovies are an object of veneration in the Undisclosed Region — especially the big anchovies from Spain or Sicily. So I understand your weaknesses. Once at my son’s urging we did a lobster fried rice as he said St Tony Bourdain had it. We did it without my wife present (the chef, the boss). It was good. Later my son said he made it up about Tony. There is a fancier Chinese restaurant nearby that makes a lobster fried rice and it’s delicious! They also do a nice dim sum lobster rangoon. I wouldn’t do lobster on a pizza [or mashed potatoes(!), looking at you Barstool-reviewed local Maine pizza place that is otherwise very good], but I find that substituting real lobster for the generally faux crabmeat in Asian cuisine is a nice touch. Horrible faux crabmeat is a nasty substitution for… real crab. Up here, on the BC Coast, the real thing is thankfully far more common — fake crab is extremely rare in Chinese restaurants, much more common in bad or mediocre Japanese restaurants, the latter often having both California Rolls and California Rolls with Real Crab on the menu. Saladizzas? Note ingredients seem to have been added after the pizza is done. Weird. I myself have done some weird dishes as I sometimes tried to be creative with mixed results. Paella madrás comes to mind. That one was edible and quite a thing though I have not tried twice. With time my “creativity” has mostly gone and now I stick most of the time with traditional recipes even if some are new to me. No garlic in the Spanish omelette then? (I’m torn on this one.) Onion, onion! And you can do it “campera” (country-side) with added pepper and chorizo. One bite, everybody knows the rules! In our town we used to have a pizza place called the Pizza Research Institute (PRI) that had the most unusual pizza toppings I’ve ever encountered. Many of my friends raved about it but as a half-Sicilian pizza traditionalist I had to be dragged kicking and screaming to try them. Unfortunately I really did like their pizza (except anything with Gorgonzola, a cheese apparently made from someone’s very dirty underwear). Example: the 3-P ….. pear, potato, and pesto. I know, I know…but it was brilliant. Laughingsong: Sicilian pizza (which is not sfinciune, which is wonderful) is what we in Chicago used to call the pizza of risen dough with much tomato sauce and very little cheese. You’d buy it buy the rectangle at certain bakeries. Oh, no, I feel Proust’s pizza calling… Note on sfinciune: I bought a slice of sfinciune at a nice grocery store in Palermo. It was ambrosial. Cheesy, plus a topping of gratinata, lots of breadcrumbs. Give it a try. Pear, potato, and pesto. The problem is that the pear’s elegant sweetness competes with the pesto’s wonderful perfume. The umami of the potato can’t rescue that threesome. That’s one of the dangers of threesomes. Now: Here in the Undisclosed Region you’d get potato, pesto, and hazelnuts (another object of veneration) or walnuts. Yumliziosa. Yeah, I dunno what any of that is. I did a Neapolitan style 10.5″ last night with a pizza oven, cooked up in about 2 minutes, starts to seriously burn at that point actually. Amazingly puffy but thin crust, overnight yeasted dough, just 00 flour, yeast, water, a bit of salt, and 1/8″ teaspoon of olive oil and a bit of amylase. Pesto, fresh basil, mozzarella cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, and scallions. Best thing ever. Call me a pizza pedestrian, but I prefer mine Montreal style (with the cheese on top) with salty meat toppings — never any vegetables. About “Entrepreneurship in Europe: Where are firms thriving and barely surviving? ” As far as I can tell what the data shows is mostly about how easy and cheap it is to set up and close down shell-companies. I.e. financial shenanigans that on balance is probably damaging both economy and lives. I did not see any reference to that being part of the explanation, either the author is blissfully unaware of that or the author is aware and decided not to include it anywhere in the article. Might be a combination of unaware and being slightly aware but digging into it and writing about it might not be good for career and social prospects. “Opinion: Why Trump’s talk about nuclear testing is dangerous” I’m thinking that it was defensive here. The Russians had just announced the successful testing of their nuclear-powered cruise missile, the Burevestnik. This was followed up by the successful testing of their nuclear-powered torpedo, the Poseidon. For the Neocons, this was bad news. It is one thing setting countries on fire in the Middle east or Africa or South America. They told themselves that they were safe as they had an ocean on each side, Arctic wastes to the north and a narrow peninsular to the south. With these new weapons that obsolete belief is dead. Trump had to throw up a distraction so that people would forget those new Russian weapons so came up with nuclear testing and it has worked. Only thing is whether Trump boxes himself in and is forced to conduct a nuclear test in a year or two from now because of all his belligerent boasting. It was another childish gesture. (Mine’s bigger than yours.) Quotidian Trumpian bravado. It’s not easy being a narcissist. My best guess is he doesn’t know the difference between nuclear powered and nuclear armed. I read someone point out trumps testing talk came just after his TACO with China. It’s round 10 million of SQUIRREL Nuclear testing is under the energy department, not the military. It would take probably years to put together the entire nuclear test program again before a single test could be completed. Historians will look back on 2025 as the US empire’s Suez year, with not just China’s successful pushback against US efforts to stop its rise but also Russia’s crushing of the Ukraine regime and the US-NATO proxy effort to regime change Russia. But, yes: 2030, if the Chinese perform a landing on Luna, is when this change will finally be absorbed by the mass of Americans. Those in DC will likely be the last to face the facts. Here’s The Duran weighing in on this, and I have the same concerns: Poseidon and Trump nuclear testing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugtS1clYjEI Plus, they also discuss the myth that Reagan “won” the Cold War with an arms race, and yes, it’s a myth. I don’t know the details of what brought the USSR down, but I dare say that having old, out of touch, corrupt leadership class that caused great internal disarray was a much greater reason for the USSR’s collapse. (And I see parallels in America’s leadership today, bummer that!) Nexperia allowed to resume exports from China following Trump-Xi talks — companies may seek exemptions from the Ministry of Commerce to restart international deliveries Tom’s Hardware It appears that the USA’s famously brilliant negotiator of a president may not have understood what he agreed to with regard to Nexperia in his recent discussions with Xi. Per Arnaud Bertrand, the main value added by Nexperia NL to the supply chain of chips used in the auto industry is the production of the silicon wafers. Nexperia CN has now re-sourced those wafers domestically, which will leave Nexperia NL to wither away and the American and European auto producers even more dependent on China. Good job, wheeler-dealer Don. There are still propaganda pieces in the Netherlands that Karremans did a great and heroic thing in stealing Nexperia. I always knew that the Dutch press was mostly propaganda, but sometimes it is still a surprise for me when they lie about something. There is a bus-sized hole in that agreement in that China made no commitment to actually approve shipments to Nexperia. In the case of rare earth exports, despite a commitment to resume shipments back in April, very few were approved over the next months. so I scrolled through news sites….no mention of the World Series, lmao. (the secular, structural decline of baseball is another topic). Society/mass culture has become, essentially, circles of “fandoms”—politics, sports, celebrity news, baking, widget-collecting, etc. There is no more universal (national) cultural glue holding society together (except, a John Carpenter-esque: consume!) pretty wild that we live in an age where almost every First Worlder has a supercomputer in their pocket, and people have siloed themself into their own world with their own IV drip of info. it’s like a scene from “Wall-E” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xToQ4cIHkk The only hint of violence on the diamond sputtered out during an ad hoc 7th inning stretch yesterday, but it was more of an Elks Club get together with no rabbit punches or fisticuffs to report and both teams dutifully went back to their respective dugouts… In comparison, I cringe about 6.3x a game during an NFL get together-when violence on the gridiron seems almost like a gut punch to watch. A lot of the skills are similar, throwing, running, catching and hitting-with a different variant on the latter. That was a World Series for the ages-one astounding play on the field after another, and I had mentally consigned myself to being on the losing side of an epic battle fought over 90 feet at a time in the 9th inning, satisfied in that i’d witnessed something special-and then redeemed by home run heroics by the least likely guy on the rosters to clear the fence. p,s, money, money, money dept: Disney owned the Angels around the turn of the century, and in their wisdom decided to trash all of the older players contracts, which were dutifully retrieved by a dumpster diver, and then sold to a coin dealer in Orange County. The ‘money’ one was Nolan Ryan’s yearly contracts, of which there were about 10 or so, and Nolan didn’t make jack, $27k. I must’ve read through hundreds of player contracts, got a little dull after awhile ah ha The internet has everything! Here’s the 1972 Nolan Ryan contract, and oh so plain Jane~ It fetched $6k in 2012 @ auction https://collectrea.com/archives/2012/Spring/767/1972-nolan-ryan-signed-california-angels-contract-first-american-league-contract On Nolan Ryan, when I worked at corporate HQ office of a local retail bank in Plano, Texas, circa 2011 to early 2012 my immediate manager was a Texas Rangers. Centered on the front wall of his office and opposite his desk was the timeless portrait of Ryan giving the business to an unfortunate Robin Ventura. Apparently there was disagreement on the high heat coming out of his right arm…. Always a shame that Ryan wasn’t gifted better team ownership or good franchise circumstances once he left the NY Mets; ok I guess the Astros had some years in the early to mid 80s after all. But for Ryan….No Cy Young award, but all them no hitters! It’s a new age, and it’s filled with football (of the international variety). Go check out an MLS game … Portland vs San Diego was absolutely electric last night. Fans singing, smoke flying, drums drumming, banners waving, stands bouncing. It is it’s OWN culture, and it’s international. Black, white, brown … every nation in the world represented. It’s called “the beautiful game” for a reason, and the beauty extends beyond the pitch. Maybe nobody’s talking about it because they can’t bear to admit that capitalism’s favorite team came out on top. I do like the individual Dodger players, and Ohtani especially is a pleasure to watch. And I do thank LA for taking a bunch of bunch of past their prime players with bloated contracts off the Red Sox’ hands several years ago. But LA is second only to the hated Yankees for teams I actively root against. It’s a team only PE C-suiters could love. Must be nice to bring in a billion dollars worth of pitchers for the last few weeks of the regular season and the p(l)ayoffs. Not every team has that luxury. Any mention of the Dodgers at NC should go under the guillotine watch. I dunno, fell under the spell of Dodger Stadium-the only 1960’s NL baseball stadium still left standing-and unlike most of the other 60’s efforts in that regard, didn’t have the awful dual MLB/NFL thing going on. Haven’t been to a game there this century, so i’m a little rusty-but oh the memories they linger pleasantly enough. From what i’ve seen on tv, the aged edifice looks to have more advertising than I remember seeing, but I’m from the era when trying to make money on such things was considered crass-so it was scant. The only indication @ Dodger Stadium was a big Union 76 orange ball on top of a pillar, so clean. Watched a NHL game from the 70’s awhile back and the boards are bereft of branding, naked as it were-they almost looked whitewashed in fact. Other than the link above? Do mega-sporting events like the World Series pay off? Here’s the economic reality behind them Or was this post a comment in reaction to it?

I can only imagine the panic in the Trump regime as the Chinese get closer and closer to their objective but it is not like they are doing anything about this goal themselves. There is no permanent head of NASA and the guy at SecTransport is acting head – while muttering about how NASA should be folded into the Department of Transport. And he has thrown contracts open again meaning that there is no clear set path to launch a Moon flight but competing corporations who probably have their own ideas how things should be done. But no doubt that Trump will stick to his demand that there be an American on the Moon before the end of his term. It’s a good thing that JFK never said that but only that it be before the end of the decade. “‘The money machine is misfiring’: City blames Brexit for UK’s £20bn productivity headache” What does “productivity” even mean when applied to a parasitic rent-seeking sector? The article actually addresses this but then turns away. One cannot stare into the sun! Of talks about how the historic UK productivity figures were driven by the productivity of the City and it has now cratered and brought the productivity figures down with it. I would like to see an analysis but I wonder if the current low measured productivity is actually any lower than before in many sectors (services), when finance is stripped out. The real new productivity crisis in the UK is in manufacturing as a result of higher energy and commodity costs because of war on Russia. And possibly the explosion of low wage jobs using the boom in legal economic migration (and the no wage jobs using illegal migrants). time change sucks if yer already insomniac and yer vertebrae wake you at 230am. anyhoo..this made the dog and catpile jump up off of me and flee: https://x.com/KimDotcom/status/1984812876398485824 ‘This one is more accurate…😂’ https://xcancel.com/FPSPredatorsHA/status/1984849553355628689#m In a nutshell…, lol.

Even amateurs know that measuring pulse after waking up is how one can gauge change over time, and that it gets lower as you get in shape. These results challenge a long-held belief, once repeated by US President Donald Trump, that the human body is like a battery with a limited energy supply and that exercise only depletes it. LOL, Trump science. Believe it or not, that was the first guy on the Moon’s thoughts, too. I believe that every human has a finite number of heartbeats… and I don’t intend to waste any of mine. Neil Armstrong That’s why he took one small step in stead of one giant leap. Another example of why someone being an expert in one thing does not translate to them knowing jack about anything else. Yet, for some reason there’s no end to the various celebrities opining on important topics, tech oligarchs getting the grubby mits on everything, and me here in the comments sharing my opinion on stuff I clearly know nothing about. …got the extended warranty on heartbeats 100 billion, or 100 years-whatever comes first. And here I’ve been thinking I only had a set number of heart beats allowed per day and exceeding that number would be instant death. Guess I no longer have that excuse to not exercise! Why Do Spiders Decorate Their Webs? A New Piece of the Puzzle Nautilus ~~~~~~~~~~~ I find black widow webs to be the most fascinating, almost looks as if the 8 legged one was on an acid trip during construction of. So intricate and chaotic-but with a purpose. Then there was the time NASA fed various psychotropics to spiders and photographed the results. See: https://rarehistoricalphotos.com/nasa-spiders-drugs-experiment/ Here’s a video that introduced me to that research https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZoZhM0E8Ow I work in this area and this is my experience. Large companies (and some not so large) are extremely paranoid about allowing the AI companies to use their vital information for training. The major AI players all sell private instances where users are assured that no one outside of their company can use their data for training or analyze the custom models. They put language in contracts and audits are conducted by 3rd parties to verify these claims. Its above my pay grade to determine what they are really doing behind the scenes, but given the way the contracts are written it would be a major scandal if they ever got caught cheating. A big worry to many is the user sending private information to the models running in public instances which do not have these guarantees. My employer blocks these sites, and we’re all told to use the private version. A second worry that is coming on strong is the use of Chinese models like DeepSeek and Qwen (even privately maintained versions using open source) . More companies are adopting policies where these are forbidden because, I assume, the Chinese cannot be trusted. One company described it as “geopolitical models are forbidden”. Re: Scientists just shattered a major exercise myth This is not new. back in the 70’s a friend gave me the “using up extra heartbeats” thing and I pointed out that: 3 mile run at 160 beats per min 160*20 = 3200 beats warm up cool down and other activity 120 beats per min 120*40 = 4800 beats resting pulse 50 for the rest of the day 23*60*50 = 69000 beats total 3200 + 4800 +69000 = 77000 beats per day him resting pulse 72*24*60 = 103689 beats per day (this assumes that during every day activity, his pulse is the same amount above resting pulse as mine) he started taking the stairs yeah this is some seriously auld news. It’s good to get it out there anyway as lots of the kids these days are all weights and no cardio. All weights and no cardio is also auld news, and no legs day too. ‘Massimo @Rainmaker1973 Students in China are encouraged to rest and nap during school.’ If those kids are doing a 12 hour day, then this is a vital necessity. I really like the way those desks converted into beds and they could teach the airlines a few tricks. You can see that there are multiple models here in use. And after those kids have their nap, they are ready to absorb more lessons. Of course if you read the replies to this tweet, you will find many sour grapes- https://xcancel.com/Rainmaker1973/status/1983685284827918711 I particularly liked the cabinets that had a whole bed hidden inside!! I could see a big market and lot of people making use of them. Homeless facilities, detention centers, airbnbs, Americans just trying to survive they’re inequality… Also, how is the United States education system going to compete with China? 12 hours of instruction a day! (Minus naps) I think car makers might be wise to incorporate some of the design implemented in the Chinese school desks to enable cars to become mobile homes … of a sort. Even dead cars could provide a home for the growing hordes of homeless. I have mixed feelings about 12 hours per day of instruction for school children. I learned the most from my own studies after I came home from school and from the time I spent at the public library and in my room attempting to write the most convincing essay I could for a homework assignment. Once I reached an age of double digits, I estimate that many, though not all days, I may have spent more than 12 hours per day studying when I add my study at home with the time spent in the classroom. I also greatly value the time I spent learning to play a musical instrument, or wandering in nature and in museums or attending the Summer Shakespeare plays and orchestral concerts my parents brought me and my siblings to. I believe schools and parents should foster a love for learning, endless curiosity, imagination, and questioning the ‘right answer’ in a way I did not see or sense in the schooling of my own children. As u.s. school are constituted, a 12 hour school day would bring the death of learning and those attributes I value. Son #1 is currently at a school where a 12h day is possible, if he went in for breakfast (07:30) and stayed for dinner (18:00) and left when the boarders do their prep (19:30ish). As it is, an 8.5h day is standard (08:45-17:15). He often goes in early for breakfast because it is a full English (sausages and bacon, hash browns, black pudding, eggs etc) but only stays late to play DnD! He also has Saturday school…. “Son #1” sounds like a name Musk would give to one of his kids. :) FYI that the Sonar 21 link seems to have some information it shouldn’t in the link URL. It came from a subscriber and needs to be cleaned up after the “?”. AI Blamed for Tens of Thousands of White Collar Layoffs – Futurism There should be a case study about that headline as being indicative of a larger problem. The real headline, more descriptive of the contents of the article and the reality (and also very catchy) is buried at the last paragraph: “AI is a flashy scapegoat for mounting white collar layoffs.” I drove by a ‘natural’ park in an arroyo yesterday, with pretty steep terrain, and a driverless mower on a two-track hydrostatic system was being driven by a parks worker with a R/C joystick gizmo, a dozen or so parks workers in sweatshirt uniforms watching. I circled back, got some pics, talked with El Jefe for a couple minutes. Asked him how soon he would plot waypoints via GPS, and have a computer driving it from an office with the lights off, the mower automatically re-docking to recharge batteries, and how many fewer staff he would have? He opined there was always weed-whacking to be done, doubted any man-power cuts. I was not in accord, but hey. Also asked him why they were mowing native bunch-grasses— wasn’t the point to be maintenance free and natural? I also suggested he get some bumper stickers printed up: “Support Universal Basic Income”. He was skeptical that Elroy, Jeff, Bill, Sergei would be delighted to start paying taxes to keep humans fed, clothed, warm, dry, and educated, with access to health care and clean potable water. Oh well. Who’s going to the park that the time and money will still be spent maintaining? a parks worker, or a forward deployed engineer? And if “natural”or “wildlife” was ever really the goal for the area, all machines would need to be removed as well. “Desperate Special Forces Bid to Save Pokrovsk Fails as AFU Faces Unprecedented Collapse on Every Front” I have no idea what good the Ukrainians thought that 11 special forces soldiers would do dropped near Pokrovsk. They were quickly wiped out so the whole thing was just a suicide mission. Seems that DC is going to have to get ready for several Ukrainian fortified cities to fall, one after another. I’m sure that Trump will demand an immediate ceasefire and to freeze this war on the contact line and if Russia does not agree, he will do something. But I bet that there will be an element of panic in the air when this happens, not only in DC but also in Brussels. A F U Hmmmm. Irony or paradox? A F U. Irony or Paradox? The fog of war keeps getting thicker. Who knows what their goal was? Extraction? Protecting key assets? A coked out plan to have commandos raid behind enemy lines and save the day? A drowning person will grab on to anything they can in their desperation. I have no idea how the peace will eventually be shaped but the dimensions of the coming AFU collapse are becoming increasingly clear despite the fog. The AFU will be completely destroyed and any patriotic fighters left standing will join terror groups to make strikes throughout the world. The best guess I’ve read so far is that they were supposed to reach the “sculpted” Pokrovsk city sign at the western entrance to the city, as the helicopter landed less than half a mile away and five of them were killed within a few hundred yards of it. Had they reached it, they could have raised an Ukrainian flag there, take some photos and skedaddle to Dnipro with “solid proof” that Pokrovsk is like totally back under Ukrainian control. It would fit in with the previous high-risk, showy gimmicks Ukrainians tend to do to win the war in social media, but which have little if any effect on the war itself. Perhaps their intent was to surrender with the rest of the guys. That would sure be my goal. commandos raid behind enemy lines and save the day This, my ol’ chap. Yet another one, straight from the UK. Shaken, not stirred.

Nope. It´s mainly political. The real danger of course being how would the Russians react. Although, and I tend to agree, they would act only against targets on Ukrainian territory. Why risk more if the military fallout of Tomahawks would be really limited. Of course if the US wants to start WWIII. They can do that. But the fact that someone at Pentagon – allegedly – greenl-lit it now – doesn´t mean more than just that. Factions vs. factions. Provocation for sake of it due to lack of means and strategy.

I have a crazy notion and, if needed, talk me down. If they can get back to ridicuously easy money policy, they are going to credit “AI” with “productivity gains”. The U.S. joint staff aka pentagon said there are enough tomahawks to send some to Zelenski. Russian staff gets CNN feeds too! What was not said: Japan wants 400 for their missile destroyers, there not being much carrier in missile defense. Also, how to hit anything if U.S. does not provide top secret special access targeting and navigation aids. Those spunky Kievan contracts can get all the engineering specs to do what U.S. wants with tomahawks. Maybe shoot them off MiG 27’s. Are they karting in a ship to launch them from? A 50-foot sailing yacht named Andromeda. Of course! So efficient! From what I’ve seen, there are two batteries in the Army inventory. I assume one of these would be sent in theater. The launcher is housed in a 40-ft container, so an inviting target. I suppose you could park these in the far west by the Poland border to make it a more difficult counter-battery target. Targeting depends on the actual target and desired effect. If it’s a V-1-style terror effect, I suppose it’s possible that inertial nav all the way might be feasible. I would assume GPS denial is something Russia would pursue, at least near high-value targets. Tomahawk can have some onboard nav sensors that would be difficult to block, but depend on prior intel data, which I assume probably exists for any interesting targets. Enroute planning is based the missile RCS (detectability) and low-level flight to take advantage of terrain masking. Again you need intel of the anti-air defense capability. I don’t know, but assume these days actual terrain elevation data is sufficiently available and easily disseminated to shooters that that is no longer a limiting factor. While I suppose “black” programs could be postulated to exist, I continue to doubt the idea that a nuclear warhead option is available for any current missile or launcher.

How odd the timing of that news when just a few days ago it was made public that Nigeria is looking to revive state-owned refineries. One refinery of note: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangote_refinery/ And I don’t doubt other global players have lobbied the US to intervene.

Trump’s Retribution Campaign Leaves D.C. Prosecutor’s Office in Crisis (NY Times via archive.ph) America is a banana republic Under the vaulted arches of the National Union Building, a group of federal prosecutors gathered recently for what has become an all-too-common ritual: saying goodbye to colleagues. The speeches that night reflected the despondent mood inside the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, as the lawyers who were quitting urged those staying behind to forge ahead in uncertain times. Do what’s right, they said. Speak truth to power. Uphold the rule of law. But as the hour grew later — and the bar tab bigger — the politics that have buffeted the office for months suddenly intruded on the evening, people who were there recounted later. In a quiet corner, away from the charcuterie and veggie dip, Jonathan Hornok, a top aide to Jeanine Pirro, the Trump appointee picked to run the office, was firing Jon Hooks, a senior prosecutor who had worked there for nearly 20 years. That a respected supervisor with a long career could be stripped of his job in the middle of a farewell party for his colleagues captured something of the Darwinian tumult that has wracked the prosecutors’ office since President Trump returned to the White House and set about remaking the Justice Department in his image. Bad Jonathan! RE DHS Wants States to Hand Over Driver’s License Data for Citizenship Checks It’s amusing that a kind of national database of Americans, once anathema to conservatives, is being implemented by the Trump administration under the dubious pretense of stopping “voter fraud”. Literally there it is The Department of Homeland Security says it intends to add state driver’s license information to a swiftly expanding federal system envisioned as a one-stop shop for checking citizenship. I imagine Republicans in Congress will pass a bill to outlaw this or conduct investigations any time now… That’s what the state ‘Real ID drivers license’ program is all about. It’s also the prelude to the rollout of official digital IDs. Note: you do not have to have a Real ID drivers license to drive, or even to fly.

(it was well received) of course, the dems are no better. all is contingent and transactional…except that it all must serve the already rich and powerful. Researchers Apply AI To Defend Against Stuxnet-Like Cyber Attacks This is very late to the party. We did exactly this with a French start-up (reverse engineer Siemens PLC’s and do deep packet inspection and AI analysis of packets and traffic to detect anomalies) which we sold to Cisco as the core of their OT (operating technology) division. In 2015-2018. Students in China are encouraged to rest and nap during school. If these various desk designs don’t work out in Chinese schools, maybe blowing and Airbus can pick them up on the cheap and use them in planes. I guarantee they would be a gigantic hit. It’s going to get messy when the Turkeys come home to roost. turkeys…at least the wild-derived ones…are rather fastidious, for barnyard fowl,lol. its the dern ducks that shit everywhere. one morning, unbeknownst to me, there was one roosting on the palapa thing above my barstump…and i’m sitting here drinkin coffee, listening to coyotes, and imagining Evangeline Lilly sitting across from me…and that damned duck just lets one drop, right on my shoulder. and duckshit is pretty nasty,lol. i look up ere i sit down, now. but to your point…it was always gonna come home. down at the bottom where ive lived for most of my life, that was frelling obvious…and has been ongoing…at first, under the aegis of the War on Drugs. the difference between the late 80’s and now, is that the repression, oppression, and all around fascistic jackbootery has been creeping up the class ladder, of late…so more formerly important people are noticing. Gaza is a Method…just like Jakarta. the only question is where lies the bridge too far? we’re obviously not there, yet…too many are still relatively too comfortable to upset the applecart and really resist. but that will come. likely when the Sith are even more well entrenched than they are, now. and i remain a male Cassandra, being dragged out of walmart, crying “Doom!” “Beware Chinese bearing gift cards!” Oftentimes the commentariat is good for a chuckle. Sometimes a bellylaugh. Robotaxis… I’m prosecuted if I mount the sidewalk and mow down a pedestrian. Who faces *any penalty* if a robo-vehicle does that? Here is a very interesting video by Black American content creator Tabitha expanding on her theory that J D Vance will divorce his wife Usha in order to raise his chances of getting elected President. The New Kirx Klan Maga base will not tolerate a Brown Hindu Indian first lady. So Vance needs to get a new wife more to the New Kirx Klan’s MAGA-base’s liking. ” AMERICA FIRST… J.D. Vance Gets A Political Warning From A Leader of Young Republican Men!! ” https://www.youtube.com/live/M3E3t00nXQ4 thats sad as hell,lol. i know nothing about her, but i am an agnostic mystic druidy person, and my wife was catholic…and i supported our boys doing the catholic thing(imagine me in church…after her funeral mass, at the reception/dinner thing in the parish hall(overflow crowds), the Father pointedly sat by me, and we talked about Pseudodionysius,lol…because i am “not contained between my hat and my boots”…i told him that every priest needs a druid friend, and he agreed(!), but hasnt taken me up on it) so i understand multifaith marriage, and how much tolerance and forbearance it takes. thats the sort of example this country needs…and it would be doubly sad to see him cast that away…along with her and their kids…for some short term political calculation. The problem with that theory: Anyone that rabid about interracial marriage would likely not be excited about baby daddy to mixed kids. He can’t divorce the kids. I don’t know if the video talks about that. Don’t really want to watch it. Tabitha is pointing out that J D ” Despicable Little Tatoo” Vance is entirely soul-less, pragmatic and beneath ethics and morality. She therefor predicts that he will divorce his current wife and even try marrying the Widow Kirk if he can. It may not convince GroyperMAGA because of the mixed kids. But Vance will give it a good hard try. The test of a theory is in the coming-true or not of its predictions. If Vance divorces Suha then Tabitha’s theory is pretty good. If he then goes on to marry the Widow Kirk, then her theory is VERY good. Assuming Vance and his wife had a Catholic wedding, Vance would need to have the marriage annulled. Which can be done, but it is complicated. he is not married to his current wife “through the Catholic Church”. i state that categorically, because Tam and I tried, hard…but i would not lie.lol the part of the Catholic Church apparatus that deals with that, to my surprise, is what used to be called the Office of the Inquisition(yeah, that one,lol)…called something else more anodyne, now, that i dont remember. and they are hard core with their check boxes. i was babtise Lutheran, against my will, that wasnt even formed yet,lol…but that part was ok(i was an Xtian, in their eyes)…but i wouldnt submit to professions of Faith…which meant a hard NO!. theres no way in hell that Vance and his Hindu wife were married “through the church”. the Catholic government(what it is) takes their rules seriously. that Priest…Father Melvin…was a nice guy, and he meant well..a kind man, altogether. but he was a clerk…checking off boxes…not a spiritual leader. i found him kind and nice, but boring,lol. his successor out here, Father Red…young guy, inquisitive, well read…is much more inspiring…but also more strict when it comes to the Forms…ie: when he heard her last confession, and administered the Last rights, i had to leave the room…because i wasnt a Catholic. and she wanted me there. bt all that was between her and god, and i was damned to hell, and all. so i wasnt allowed in the temporarily Holy Space. lest i pollute it with my heathenism. Who knows. Maybe he will get ICE Barbie to put bounties on the children. I know a reasonable number of Evangelical Christians and the ones I know are not racists; in fact some of them are themselves Indian (from India) and some are married to Indian people. Vance would have a great advantage among Evangelicals to remain married to Usha, not just because he is supposed to remain married, but also because the question of her possible conversion would be endlessly fascinating to them. Regarding the Tesla robotaxi numbers Elon is spouting this line in the article stood out: “Considering that there are only two months left in the fourth quarter of 2025, Tesla’s Robotaxi team will likely be extremely busy during the next eight weeks.” Curious, I looked up how many are currently in the road: There are ZERO on the road in the Bay Area. https://electrek.co/2025/10/22/tesla-is-trying-to-deceive-investors-into-thinking-it-has-san-francisco-robotaxis/ From 0 to 1,000 in eight weeks? Sounds like another one of Elon’s fanciful predictions. Also, according to that article they don’t have a California license for autonomous vehicles but the law isn’t a concern for Elon so doubt that is a concern. A.I. Is Making Death Threats Way More Realistic (NY Times via archive.ph) Even though she was toughened by years spent working in internet activism, Caitlin Roper found herself traumatized by the online threats she received this year. There was the picture of herself hanging from a noose, dead. And another of herself ablaze, screaming. The posts were part of a surge of vitriol directed at Ms. Roper and her colleagues at Collective Shout, an Australian activist group, on X and other social media platforms. Some of it, including images of the women flayed, decapitated or fed into a wood chipper, was seemingly enabled — and given a visceral realism — by generative artificial intelligence. In some of the images, Ms. Roper was wearing a blue floral dress that she does, in fact, own. This year is lit. Trump really is the perfect embodiment of our elite; petty, corrupt, self serving, careless, and entirely focused on immediate gratification. He’s the perfect symbol of a failing state, an empire in terminal decline, entirely unaware even of the limits of power or concerned with the outcomes of its exercise. Well put. I might hazard to add that the corruption is consuming everything and everyone around him. We’re down to M T-G and Massie on the GOP side as the only pols left with anything resembling a soul. Even Rand Paul has become a petty, corrupt little tyrant. He was blathering on about raising the Social Security retirement age to 70 the other day – as if there aren’t a gazillion other real issues out there. I guess kicking old people when they’re down is easier than taking on the MIC, endless wars, genocide, and economic insanity … remember when Rand Paul actually stood up against someone more powerful than him? Remember when his Dad fought to audit the Fed? It’s all a memory now. Other than the immediate gratification bit, that description might serve just as well for Biden, which is appropriate given the Uniparty nature of the late stage empire’s elite Israel’s Zombie Economy Part 3: Israel’s Breakdown Into Tribes – Bassam Haddad Interviews Shir Hever Part 3 of 5 part series by Jadaliyya https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJTTm1Ep1mA We are not obsessed with serial killers. The PRESS is obsessed with sensationalism. And only about doing sensationalism with POOR & POWERLESS serial killers. Why? To distract us all from the actual MASS MURDERERS, GENOCIDAL even, that present themselves as “democratic” or “moderate” or “good” people: – Bush, Obama, Trump, Biden, Netahyanu, etc. There is not a single POOR & POWERLESS serial killer that reaches even near the kill count of the 5 Hitlers mentioned above. The Press exists to distract and manipulate. The capital/property exists to own the Press. The labour rights DON’T exist in order to facilitate taming actual journalists. The ones that refuse being tamed end up like Assange or the Gaza journalists… This is what “freedom and democracy” really means in the collective West nowadays, and perhaps since always. We all rember that POOR & POWERLESS guy named Jack, the reaper, from London. But the biggest serial killer of them all, in London, are Queen Elizabeth and Winston Churchill, responsible for the provoked famine in colonized Bangladesh, resulting in the GENOCIDE of around 3 million humans. The same press that tells us we “are absessed” with serial killers, doesn’t write a single line about the biggest serial killers of all, who exterminate millions of humans. Because when a serial killer is RICH & POWERFUL, the western “free and democratic” Press calls them “heroes” and “exemplar leaders”… Sorry, there is plenty of evidence to counter your assertion. Mystery novels and movies, which are not press organs, are also fixated with serial killers. See the Academy Award winner Silence of the Lambs as one of many examples. The Hollywood and the Press (aka MSM) are two cheeks of the same behind. Different organs working in concert. Yup. They are obsessed, and we are getting the mushroom treatment. I’m not obsessed with serial killers. Couldn’t care less. My buddy says he’s a cereal killer and a celery stalker. Ukrainian computer game-style drone attack system goes ‘viral’ I’ve been pondering some related things for a while and have some thoughts/predictions: 1. Video games will be used (maybe are already being used) to both train AI and find the best fpv pilots 2. Pro gaming is dominated by teenage boys. Not just because they are the most interested, but because they are the best at them. Once you hit 20 you’re too slow and on the way out. 3. It’s only a matter of time until we see an Ender’s Game scenario, in which teenage boys are recruited and utilised in real-world drone warfare and kill lots of “enemies”. 4.

As a five-time NYC marathon runner myself, I can attest that this race is truly one of the best days of the year. "The energy of marathon day never gets old," Rob Simmelkjaer — the CEO of New York Road Runners, the company behind the marathon — told BI. "It's just a giant block party." The sheer scale of the event — to the tune of $700 million in economic impact for the city — is a reminder of how running is experiencing a golden age. Brooks Running CEO Dan Sheridan came to the BI office on Thursday and said we're currently in "a running boom," one that's part of the wider health and wellness fixation infiltrating nearly all aspects of society — including the workplace. Running and other forms of exercise are no longer just workouts; they can also serve as social gatherings or even networking events. Companies, for one, are increasingly implementing group runs or fitness classes as a way to promote team building. This is creating a different kind of bonding experience for work colleagues, as opposed to the connections typically made at more traditional happy hours or dinners. My colleague Ana Altchek spoke to several fitness studios that said they've seen a sharp uptick in corporate demand. HIIT studio chain Barry's has experienced a surge in companies booking private classes for employees. Firms are also reserving spots for workers in public classes, or paying to bring instructors to conferences or other events. As for today's marathon, Sheridan of Brooks Running offered some advice. "Keep your head up even when it's hard," he said. Running the marathon is an achievement of one's personal journey: "Just soak that up," he says. In a phone-first world, getting offline is the new social currency. So it's no surprise that social connection apps are having a moment. From concerts to book clubs to dinners with strangers, the apps are about finding friendship as well as love. For many, they're a way to find the ever-shrinking third space, not to replace their online presence altogether. Touching grass hands. When venture capitalist Leslie Feinzaig surveyed female startup founders, she didn't ask about sexual harassment on the job. Respondents told her anyway. Of the survey's 180 female founders, eight detailed what they described as harassment, being hit on, or being demeaned by investors while seeking funding. A dark reality. Amazon's massive job cuts this week has the white-collar workforce on edge that they could be next. You can't always control the challenges life throws at you, but you can control how you respond. If you get laid off, you'll likely be in shock, so it's important to take a breath and process. Experts told BI the steps you should take if it happens to you. Three things to keep in mind.

Title: Reddit’s CEO Debuts As A Billionaire 20 Years After Cofounding The Company
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/monicahunter-hart/2025/11/01/reddits-ceo-debuts-as-a-steve-huffman-billionaire-20-years-after-cofounding-the-company/
Time Published: 2025-11-02T11:30:00Z

ByMonica Hunter-Hart, Forbes Staff. Reddit has hit its stride. After trudging through 19 years of almost entirely losing money, the platform recorded its first quarterly profit as a public company a year ago—and just posted its most lucrative financials yet. The company announced a net income of $163 million on Thursday, marking five consecutive quarters of profitability, about a year and a half after going public. The market rewarded the company. Reddit’s stock closed at $208.95 on Friday, up 7.5% from the previous day and up 75% year over year. It was enough to bump the fortune of cofounder and CEO Steve Huffman up to $1.2 billion. “Q3 was a strong quarter,” Huffman said on Thursday’s earnings call, in which he lauded Reddit as being “for humans by humans” and seemed to take a subtle dig at AI slop (the low-quality AI content clogging corners of the internet): “Reddit is in a unique position; we’re not trying to be the next anything. We’re focused on being the best version of ourselves and what the internet needs most: a place where people can connect on almost any topic and find genuinely useful information.” Authentic human recommendations are a hot commodity these days. As bots and sponsored content crowd the internet, Reddit is often seen as a more reliable source of information, and its popularity has exploded in the past couple of years. Daily active users have approximately doubled since the summer of 2023. Google searches increasingly surface links to Reddit: Organic search to the platform is up over 560% from two years ago, per data from digital marketing firm Semrush. Given that Facebook, Twitter (now X) and LinkedIn long ago minted a class of early-2000s social media billionaires, it may seem surprising that Huffman is so late to join that club. After all, Reddit was the world’s seventh-most visited website in September, according to Similarweb, ahead of LinkedIn, TikTok and Netflix. But that’s because Huffman, now 41, unloaded his founder’s stake in the then startup in 2006. About a year after launching the company in June 2005, he and his partner Alexis Ohanian—now a venture capitalist married to tennis icon Serena Williams—sold out to Condé Nast for just $10 million. It seemed an enormous sum for them at the time, the pair has said. Without any plans for monetization, and overwhelmed with running the exploding platform with just a few employees, they viewed the acquisition as a rescue. Perhaps in the short term, but long term, they left massive sums on the table. By 2014, the company was valued at $500 million. Ohanian, who joined Reddit’s board in 2014 but left in 2020, has said he did reacquire some shares while on the board, but likely gets most of his fortune from his many startup investments. Huffman, on the other hand, appears to be Reddit’s biggest individual shareholder these days. That’s because Reddit poached him back in 2015 to help navigate a streak of operational crises. His pay-for-performance compensation package has since allowed him to amass 3.1 million shares, or a 2.3% stake in the company. The rest of his fortune lies in Reddit stock options and $190 million in cash and other investments, Forbes estimates. Huffman declined to comment for this story. While generous stock awards are common among the billionaire CEO set—Tesla investors are even weighing whether to approve a $1 trillion compensation package for Elon Musk this week—it’s rare for an executive to build up such a significant stake essentially from scratch. In its 2024 IPO document, the company explained that it had massively increased the compensation of Huffman and COO Jen Wong the previous year because their packages had not been “providing the incentive initially intended”; Huffman’s ballooned to $193.2 million in 2023. It’s easy to argue that he’s earned his payday. When he became CEO in 2015, Reddit was in a state of emergency. The company was moderating content with an ultra-light touch, but it was becoming clear that some “subreddit” communities were overwhelmed with toxicity and harassment. When Reddit fired a popular employee who had been the company’s main contact with its volunteer moderators, moderators protested by shutting down their subreddits in what became known as the “Great Reddit Blackout.” A week later, Huffman took over. “It was 10 years into Reddit of ‘we don’t ban things,’” he recently told “The Best One Yet” podcast. “I think that was one of the things that only a founder can do, because the existing team at Reddit was so scared. This is what they told me: They were scared of changing anything, because they thought they’d ruin Reddit.” Huffman began by implementing the platform’s first content policy, which included prohibitions on spam, bullying, inciting violence and illegal activity. His team quickly banned a collection of subreddits, including some devoted to animated child pornography and a network of racist subs promoting “a proper society that lacks the negro plague.” Reddit began “quarantining” subs it deemed licit but especially offensive, requiring users to opt in before viewing their content. One example: r/PicsOfDeadKids, which was fully banned a few years later, as sometimes happens to quarantined subs. The goal was to make the space not only more pleasant for users, but also more attractive for advertisers. (Reddit does not run promotions on quarantined content.) Huffman and his team fixated early on advertising as the best initial monetization strategy for Reddit, in part because it could help them keep the platform free. “He built the company’s advertising business from the ground up,” says Morningstar analyst Malik Ahmed Khan. One of the challenges has been helping brands target their ads without compromising Reddit’s pivotal user anonymity. Unlike platforms like Meta and Google—which allow promoters to personalize ads based on demographic data and broader tracking across the internet—Reddit requires brands to use context clues. If a user joins a parenting subreddit or upvotes posts about pregnancy, for example, they may be more likely to see promotions for baby products. So far, it’s working. Advertising brought in $549 million last quarter, 94% of Reddit’s revenue. The company was generating only around $12 to $15 million in total sales when Huffman joined. New challenges lie ahead. Reddit is at the nexus of many of today’s hot-button debates, from the ethics around training AI models on user data to compromises between free speech and content moderation to the viability of text-based content in an online culture that’s increasingly focused on video. Huffman appears unfazed: “No matter what you’re going through, someone on Reddit has already been there, done that, and shared the story,” he said Thursday. “The best pitch for Reddit is Reddit’s content.” The son of divorced parents, Huffman grew up in a small town in Virginia near Washington, D.C. Starting and running his own business “always seemed like a possibility,” he once said, thanks in part to his father’s wild imagination for ventures (he was an engineer at GM) and his stepdad’s financial savviness (he was chief marketing officer at Unisys). He learned how to program computers when he was young and leveraged the hobby into a computer science degree at the University of Virginia, where he met Ohanian. By the end of their senior year, the pair knew they wanted to start some sort of company together. It was just the concept that needed tweaking. Huffman’s first idea was software for ordering food on a phone. The task sounds quaint and obvious now, but this was before the app era—and the newly formed startup accelerator Y Combinator rejected their pitch, termed “My Mobile Menu.” Y Combinator cofounder Paul Graham was nevertheless impressed enough with the duo that he asked them to submit another idea. Their second pitch was accepted. With a $12,000 grant in hand, they spent a few weeks designing Reddit before launching it shortly after their graduation, when Huffman was 21. Then came snowballing user growth, 16-hour workdays and the eventual sale to Condé Nast. Huffman stayed on as acting CEO until 2009, when he left to cofound another company: the travel search engine Hipmunk. Concur acquired Hipmunk in 2016 for an undisclosed sum and shut it down in 2020. Meanwhile, Condé Nast had spun out Reddit again and raised funds from outside investors like future OpenAI cofounder Sam Altman, but was having trouble monetizing the business. That’s when Huffman stepped back in. In addition to building ad revenue, Huffman’s early projects included a site redesign and the creation of a mobile app. The platform, which had 12 million daily users when he rejoined, now has 116 million. Reddit has historically been a U.S.-centric site, but it recently implemented translation capabilities for 30 languages so that users can easily read and contribute in their non-native tongues. That’s led to a 31% bump in international daily users over the past year. These days, Reddit’s second biggest source of revenue is licensing its content to train AI models. The platform used to allow free and open access to its application programming interface (API), where developers interact with all of the site’s data. But Reddit started charging for its API in 2023. It now works to block unknown bots from crawling the site, and is suing a handful of AI companies—including the search engine Perplexity—for allegedly scraping its data without permission. A select few have paid for permission. Huffman signed licensing deals with Google and OpenAI last year for a reported $60 million and $70 million, respectively. The site’s enormous collection of real-time, human-generated content has proven to be extremely valuable: Reddit was the most-cited source for Google’s AI Overview citations, and the second-most for ChatGPT’s, between August 2024 and June 2025, per the AI analytics platform Profound. Given Reddit’s centrality to their models, those fees could be seen as quite low. The $60 million Google reportedly paid is just 0.07% of the more than $90 billion that its parent company Alphabet (market cap: $3.4 trillion) expects to spend on AI infrastructure this year. “Those price tags set a low watermark,” says Colin Sebastian, senior research analyst at Baird. “As Reddit has more negotiating leverage, as the power of their content becomes more clear to the models, then I think the next deals should likely be priced higher than that.” And there’s always the risk that Reddit, in propping up AI chatbots, could diminish its own relevance. As something of a hedge, Huffman launched “Reddit Answers” in December, later telling investors that he wants the platform to become a “go-to search engine.” A search query into “Reddit Answers” returns a list of quoted recommendations from real users (with links to the original comments), collated by AI. Huffman has acknowledged that Google search traffic to Reddit has at times been challenged by the rise of AI but again is confident in its future. “Part of what helps them balance on the tightrope is that I think the language models want Reddit to survive,” says Sebastian. “Realistically, these models need a constant flow of authentic, human-generated content, and that’s hard to find. It can’t just be synthetic data. So there’s almost a perverse incentive for Google and Open AI to keep Reddit as a robust app for users.” To personally test that Reddit user experience, Huffman spends a fair amount of time on the platform himself. He’s published over 1,000 posts and comments; he hosts AMAs (“Ask Me Anything” sessions). Prior to the earnings announcement, his last activity was an Oct. 3 comment in response to a user celebrating that the 117 Reddit shares they’d bought at the IPO had since gone up more than 500% in value. Huffman replied with a smiley face. This story was updated at 12 p.m. on Sunday after Reddit replied with some additional context including the fact that Q3 2024 was the company’s third profitable quarter. The other two profitable quarters were when the company was private.

Title: Here's What We Learned From Big Tech Earnings Last Week

Earnings season kicked into high gear last week when five of the Magnificent Seven members with a combined market value of over $15 trillion reported results. The tech titans—Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META)—reported better-than-expected results across the board, and forecast their massive investments in artificial intelligence will grow in the coming year. Below, we take a closer look at some of the key takeaways from this round of big tech earnings. These tech giants account for a sizable share of the U.S. stock market, making their quarterly earnings some of the most highly anticipated and consequential events on Wall Street. Their investments in artificial intelligence have also been a boon to the U.S. economy over the last year. One thing made clear in last week's earnings calls, was that the hyperscalers’ AI investments are showing no signs of a pullback. Amazon on Thursday raised its full-year capital expenditures forecast and said that investments will increase next year. Alphabet also bumped up its capex guidance for the third time this year and forecast another “significant” increase next year. Microsoft didn’t share a quarterly or full-year capex estimate, but CFO Amy Hood said investments will grow even faster in fiscal year 2026 than in 2025. Executives stressed that, despite their massive investments up to this point, they expect demand will continue to outstrip supply into next year. Microsoft’s cloud computing platform, Azure, likely bore the brunt of its capacity constraints, according to Hood, who said the company has been forced to prioritize other core business offerings. She, like Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, also said that their internal AI teams need more computing capacity. Citi analysts in a note on Thursday said they expect cloud data center capex to grow 24% in 2026, which should be a boon to semiconductor makers like Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Spending on data centers is all well and good with Wall Street, as long as investors perceive rising profits will make it worthwhile. Meta shares tanked on Thursday after the company posted earnings that missed estimates due to a one-time tax charge, and raised the low end of its full-year capex guidance. Meta also said it expects its capex growth will accelerate next year. "The real focus coming out of earnings is Meta's updated view on 2026 capex and expenses as the company looks to build out an industry-leading amount of compute," JPMorgan analysts told clients in a note Thursday. "The costs for Meta are outsized relative to Google and Amazon, as those companies are larger and both have cloud businesses that provide an immediate path to Gen AI monetization, unlike for Meta,” they said. Higher operating costs added to Wall Street’s concerns about Meta’s AI spending. Total expenses rose 32% year-over-year in the third quarter, compared to 12% in the previous quarter, and are expected to grow even faster next year. Employee compensation was one of the largest contributors to rising expenses. Meta went on an AI hiring spree this year, making headlines for poaching top talent with eye-watering pay packages. That's added more pressure on Meta to find ways to cut costs. Recent reports of layoffs, including in its AI division, could point to some signs of strain in Meta's efforts to keep its spending in check. In the first inning of the AI craze on Wall Street, Alphabet was often looked at as a laggard in the space. Its Bard chatbot flubbed its first public demonstration, and analysts worried that the rising popularity of chatbots from startups like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity, could spell major disruption for Google’s core search business. However, Alphabet's strong quarterly results—thanks in part to AI search features—would counter that narrative. According to executives, Google’s AI search features, AI Overviews and AI Mode, are helping to increase search query volume, the opposite of what Wall Street expected. Google’s search revenue growth has accelerated throughout the year, rising from 10% to 12% in the second quarter, and then to 15% in the third. Executives added that Google is monetizing AI search queries at about the same rate as traditional search. “Search acceleration (paid clicks up 7% vs 4% in 2Q) despite OpenAI's strong usage growth suggests AI is expanding the overall ‘information’ opportunity, driving higher query volume and improving monetization,” wrote Bank of America analysts in a note on Thursday. Some investors have become concerned in recent months that the AI boom is being fueled by a handful of companies striking very large deals. For example, OpenAI accounted for nearly all of Oracle’s (ORCL) massive cloud computing backlog in the most recent quarter, and Nvidia said in its most recent earnings report that two direct customers accounted for almost 40% of its quarterly sales. But Microsoft executives sought to soothe worries about concentration risks during Wednesday’s earnings call. When asked about the breadth of contracts contributing to Microsoft’s record backlog, which grew 51% to $392 billion, CFO Amy Hood said, “it covers numerous products. It covers customers of all sizes." CEO Satya Nadella also suggested he sees broadening demand related to AI over time, telling analysts, “concentration risk gets mitigated by being thoughtful about how you really ensure the build is for the broad customer base.” The wider enterprise adoption cycle, he said, "is just starting."

Title: Satya Nadella says Microsoft will increase headcount following major layoffs, but there is a rider

Following massive job cuts, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that the tech giant plans to expand its workforce; however, the focus will now be on a more strategic and leveraged approach post-AI revolution. Nadella told investor Brad Gerstner at the B2G podcast that the company’s employee numbers will grow again, but in a “smarter, more leveraged” way. “We will grow our headcount,” Nadella said. “But the way I look at it is, that headcount will grow with a lot more leverage than what we had pre-AI.” Nadella's comments follow the tech company's reported layoffs of nearly 4,000 software engineering roles amid the growing adoption of AI, according to a Bloomberg report. Microsoft plans to cut nearly 6,000 jobs across its divisions, with over 30% of the layoffs based in Washington. In May this year, Satya Nadella addressed the company for the first time after announcing layoffs of roughly 6,000 employees, which account for about three per cent of the global workforce. He highlighted that this decision was part of a wider internal restructuring and did not indicate any issues with employee performance, Mint earlier reported. During a company-wide town hall, Nadella addressed the staff, explaining that the layoffs were essential to realign teams with Microsoft’s shifting priorities, particularly its growing emphasis on artificial intelligence. He recognised the emotional impact of the decision but emphasised that it was motivated by strategic changes rather than issues with productivity or talent. Notably, Microsoft is not the only company that has recently cut jobs. E-commerce giant Amazon earlier confirmed plans to cut nearly 14,000 corporate jobs, just months after Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy warned that AI would reduce the company’s workforce. The company plans to cut 30,000 jobs in total, Reuters reported. TCS, Accenture, Microsoft, Salesforce and Google are among the IT and tech companies that have conducted restructuring. IT and technology companies around the world are experiencing significant changes due to ongoing pressure from their US operations and recent worries about US President Donald Trump's proposed increase in H-1B visa fees, which could affect new applicants aiming to work in the United States. Besides concerns over the US visa fee hike, jobs in the sector are reportedly at risk of being replaced by artificial intelligence, which some companies might prefer to use to increase productivity and efficiency rather than relying on the human workforce.

Permana's job security concerns began in February 2023, when he was placed on a performance improvement plan — a move he saw as a clear sign his job was in serious jeopardy. "I was desperate because from what I'd heard, once you are in a performance improvement plan, you are on your way out at Amazon," said the 47-year-old, who lives in California. He began looking for work immediately but knew it might take a while to land a new role, and he was worried about not being able to earn a paycheck when he had a mortgage to pay. Then he had an idea. His daughter had been born the previous May, and he still had a few remaining months of paternity leave before it expired when she turned one year old. By temporarily stepping away from work, he thought he might be able to prolong his employment at Amazon while he searched for a new role. "I took the opportunity while I could to delay time," he said. It paid off. Less than a month after returning to work, Permana received a job offer for a software engineering position at MobilityWare, a mobile game developer.

Each piece delivers insights to help you make smarter career, money, and life decisions. While layoffs across the economy remain low by historical standards, white-collar workers have been disproportionately affected — and a hiring slowdown has made it harder for them to secure new roles. Business Insider has spoken with dozens of people laid off by major corporations as companies implement strategic shifts — including shedding management roles, reallocating resources toward AI initiatives, pushing out underperformers, and cutting costs across the board. Some of these workers saw their layoffs coming, but many others were caught off guard — citing factors like long tenure, a lack of performance issues, and the seemingly strong financial position of their employers. Rather than simply working hard and hoping for the best, some workers have prepared for the worst — deploying strategies like getting a head start on their job search, launching a side business, or secretly working a second job. Laura Ulrich, director of economic research at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said some workers may be feeling anxious about job security because lower hiring levels have raised concerns about their ability to find a new role if a layoff were to occur. And because hiring was so much stronger in many industries just a few years ago, the shift may feel especially stark. "If you become unemployed, it's become much harder to find a job," she said. Ulrich added that the hype surrounding the potential of AI technologies has also given some workers reason to worry about their job security — even as the full impact of these technologies remains to be seen. Business Insider has heard from dozens of workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.

Read more on the topic: Eduardo Noriega first began worrying about his job security at Microsoft in 2009, when the company laid off about 5,000 workers. He was spared, but it was a wake-up call. "When I saw the layoff, I realized that job security isn't real," said Noriega, who's in his 50s and lives in Seattle. After weighing his options, Noriega concluded that his best chance at financial stability was to build a business he could rely on if he ever lost his job. He said it was one of the best career decisions he's ever made. By the time he was laid off by Microsoft this past May, he'd spent nearly a decade building a staffing firm outside work hours — and was earning more from it than from his software engineering job. He said he had been hesitant to quit and give up the steady paycheck, but the layoff gave him the push he needed to go all in. "I never dared to quit," he said. "And then Microsoft presented the layoff, and for me, that was like an exit." Many of the workers Business Insider spoke with who had the greatest concerns about job security — and who took steps to guard against it — had either been laid off in the past or witnessed significant cuts at their employers. After getting laid off from four tech jobs between 2020 and 2023, Reed, who is in his 30s and lives in New York, was desperate for some level of job security. Business Insider verified his identity, but he requested to use a pseudonym due to concerns about professional repercussions. After his fourth layoff, Reed had a eureka moment. "I was like, the only way for me to combat not continuously being unemployed is to have two jobs," he said. As of earlier this year, Reed was on track to earn about $280,000 working two full-time remote jobs. He said his typical workweek is about 60 hours, and neither employer knows about the other gig — but he thinks it's worth it for the additional job security. "I need these two jobs to sustain my life with my partner," he said, adding, "I don't really have a choice." Not all job jugglers are as ambitious as Reed. Some, like John, a millennial software engineer based in California, are boosting their job security by taking on a part-time role on the side. He expects to earn about $225,000 this year, including around $60,000 from his part-time gig. John said his main employer knows he has a side gig of some sort, but doesn't know the specifics of the role — or how many hours he devotes to it. In addition to his part-time gig, John has become less concerned about his job security as he has developed his network over the years. If he were to be laid off from his primary job, he said he knows several startup founders and hiring managers in his industry who he believes would help him find employment. "I'm pretty confident that I'd be able to secure another full-time job in pretty short order," he said. Earlier this year, a strategic shift at Intel led Kent Ha, then a digital marketing strategist, to believe that his team's jobs were in jeopardy. He'd already been laid off twice over the past decade — in 2015 and 2020 — and wanted to avoid a lengthy spell of unemployment. So in June, he contacted his financial advisor to help him prepare financially — and started applying for jobs. "I figured worst case, I'd land another offer and have a backup plan," he said. "Best case, I'd keep my job and wouldn't have to make any changes." When the feared layoff came in July, Ha was already in the middle of a job search. While he's still looking for work, he's glad he got a head start. For some workers, the best way to ease their job security concerns is by accumulating savings that can help them stay afloat during unemployment — or give them the freedom to leave a job that doesn't feel stable. Phil Coachman, formerly a senior cloud solution architect at Microsoft, said that the company's layoffs conducted in 2023 raised significant concerns about his job security. Other frustrations with his role followed, and in July 2024, he began looking for a new opportunity. "I just didn't feel happy there anymore," said Coachman, who's in his 40s and lives in Pennsylvania. "I wanted to just continue making cool stuff and not have this constant fear of losing my job every week." However, Coachman's search proved challenging, and by January of this year, he decided to resign in order to focus on his job search. He said the "rainy day fund" he'd built over the years helped him feel comfortable doing so. "I had enough savings that even if it would take me a year to find a job, I would be fine," he said. "So it was just getting the courage to take that jump." While his savings helped him stay afloat during his job search, Coachman said deciding to rely more on his network after he resigned is what landed him a new job. A former Microsoft colleague referred him for a role at the AI startup Databricks, which led to an interview — and, in April, a job offer. His network couldn't protect him from being laid off, but it helped him end his spell of unemployment — and made him feel a bit less concerned about his job security going forward. "Finding my next gig was 100% through my network," he said, adding, "It's real connections with people that I think make all the difference." Jump to

Title: Hotels catering for families with autistic children: ‘Nobody looks or stares at you’
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/travel/2025/11/02/hotels-catering-for-families-with-autistic-children-nobody-looks-or-stares-at-you/

When Melanie* travelled abroad in July for a family holiday to Mallorca, Spain, with her six-year-old son Luke*, she found Dublin Airport stressful. Originally from Slovakia, Melanie, who works in finance, and her Irish-born husband have younger children – two-year-old twins – but Luke has profound autism and finds airports challenging. “You’re always worried there will be delays. You’re worried the plane could be sitting on the tarmacadam for three hours. If I have to keep him on a plane for five hours, he will probably walk off the plane. It’s too much,” she says. Luke has limited verbal skills and, in common with many autistic children, a tendency to abscond. “He runs away if he feels like it. One year when we were abroad we had to move chairs and luggage to block the door. The same goes for balconies.” Dining on holidays is difficult. “He’s very limited with his diet. He will eat chips or bologna sauce but the one I make because that’s the one he knows,” Melanie says. “So there’s anxiety around food because the food needs to be always the same. If it’s too much for him, he will lie down on the floor. It doesn’t matter where you are, he will just lie down. For us, it’s much easier to stay in Ireland.” For some families with autistic children, going on a break can feel harder than being at home. Lack of predictability, absence of routine and the anxieties and stress that may come with meltdowns in public settings can result in families avoiding holidays altogether. [ Why neurodivergent people are now coveted as highly skilled workers ] But as awareness has improved – it’s estimated one in 20 children in school today has an autism diagnosis – more hotels are retraining staff and improving facilities to cater to families with diverse needs. Adam Harris, of the autism charity AsIAm, which is working with hotels on training and awareness, says: “There’s an important momentum gathering. Contributing to that is our autism-friendly town initiative. Clonakilty, Maynooth, Drumcondra, Killarney and Waterford city have achieved the standard. Dublin city is working towards it. “There’s huge momentum and hotels are at the table in that regard. We’re in the process of doing accreditation with the whole iNua group,” which is Ireland’s largest regional hotel group, “so that’s exciting.” In Dublin, the Ashling Hotel on Parkgate Street, situated near the Zoo in the Phoenix Park and close to hospitals including St James’s, has 11 family rooms. Since 2023, one of these has been transformed into a sensory room, which is kitted out with mood cubes, weighted blankets, vibrating pillows and low levels of lighting. Ciara Barry of the Ashling says: “Some autistic people are sensitive to light, others to noise, others to touch. They’re able to sit down and just hug the pillow and it calms their nervous system.” Ashling staff have also received autism awareness training and the hotel endeavours to keep the same managers on rotation to welcome returning autistic children so they see a face they know. “They’re not just upgrades that we’ve done, they’re meaningful experiences for people under sometimes tough circumstances,” Barry says. The room rate (from around €260 for a family room per night) is the same as for other family rooms in the hotel, an important factor given it is estimated that it costs an additional €28,000 a year to raise an autistic child. “This isn’t something we wanted to financially benefit from. We just wanted to put something out into the community that’s needed,” she says. In developing their facilities, the Ashling took inspiration from other hotels around the country. “We were the first hotel in Dublin, but I linked up with the Pillo hotel in Meath – they were one of the first to implement a sensory bedroom – and the Radisson in Sligo have also done it,” Barry says. [ We need a more nuanced conversation about autism ] The hotel also worked with Keith O’Grady from Sensory House Ireland, which specialises in designing playrooms featuring everything from memory-foam bean bags to weighted teddy bears, lighted bubble tubes and projectors. These help to capture and regulate attention spans O’Grady says: “Ultimately you’re creating a space for calming within spaces like hotels, which can be over-stimulating, or anywhere with high footfall. We’ve done shopping centres, hospitals, the Curragh Racecourse, secondary schools like Blackrock College. “The most important things are to block out natural light and sound. People can be dysregulated by sunbeams hitting their eyes and fluorescent lighting can have the same effect. “The easiest way to explain to people is you’re trying to emulate the feeling of going into a spa. A relaxing environment with nice ambient lighting – that’s the effect you’re trying to create. You’re hopefully giving a space that they can go into, block out stimuli, and it gives them time to re-regulate themselves.” When it works, he says, families build trust with the hotels and come back time and again. “In the Ashling, people are coming back specifically to go to that hotel because they have that sensory bedroom.” It benefits all the family too, not just the autistic child, he says. “If families have a get-together, there might be only one autistic kid within the family, and it’s so they can go to that hotel, everyone can have a good time and it’s inclusive for everyone, the autistic person and not.” In Clonakilty, Co Cork, the Park Hotel and Fernhill House have evolved their offerings for neurodiverse guests. Irene O’Callaghan, of the Park, says: “We have sensory packs: the idea being that they have something to touch, something to smell and something to squeeze.” As soon as you mention that your child is autistic, it’s like ‘no problem’. Nobody looks at you or stares at you Because routine and predictability can be important, the hotel offers a picture guide of what to expect when guests are visiting for the first time. With staff trained in autism awareness, the hotel tries to anticipate issues before any arise. “During the week we had a lady whose child liked a specific kind of pancake. She told us that in advance so we were able to get them in. That really helps,” she says. In addition to family rooms, the Park has 20 apartments and six units that are fully self-catering. “We would have kids who would be flight risks,” O’Callaghan says. “In our apartments we have put additional locks on the inside, so we’ve those extra little mechanisms.” While not overtly geared towards those families, Center Parcs is a popular destination for parents with neurodiverse children – their self-catering lodges set across 400 acres in Longford Forest offer a soothing, low-stimulation environment. “I know many people say Center Parcs is very expensive, but my boy loves it,” Melanie says. “In the kitchen, I can make his meals. He learned to swim in Center Parcs because they have a slide where, to let you on, you have to be able to swim without a swimming aid. So he actually learned to swim from one side of the pool to the other so he could go down the slide. It was amazing. I never thought he would be able to swim. “There’s huge supervision there. As soon as you mention that your child is autistic, it’s like ‘no problem’. Nobody looks at you or stares at you.” For Etain*, an IT professional based in Dublin, who has four-year-old twin sons who are autistic, “the challenges come sideways at you”. Her twins were diagnosed in May, after they had started at preschool. “We just thought, ‘Oh my God, twins are complete chaos’. It took us a while to come around to the idea that our perfect little men might have been a bit different. “What we realised through that process was that we’d set up our life around the boys. Everything inside our bubble suited the boys. We had a nice routine. It was only when you went into the outside world that things got tricky.” The boys have differing needs and challenges. Noise can be a trigger: the white noise of hand-driers in public toilets or crying babies; big crowds another. When the family gets an invitation to go somewhere, Etain thinks long and hard about what’s best. “If it’s not something the boys are going to enjoy, we’re not just going to go so we have an Instagrammable photo.” She gravitates towards holiday homes in autism-friendly towns, where a minimum of 25 per cent of businesses in the town have undergone autism awareness training. “It’s definitely a plus,” she says. “It means you’re more likely to get a warm welcome from local businesses. If a child is finding a situation stressful, it means they don’t look at that child as a ‘bold child’.” When we speak, Etain is packing the car for Clonakilty for a family trip. “Clonakilty has a model railway village, which is a huge hit with our boys who love trains.” In their Airbnb, “the boys can see the sea from the garden. The garden is enclosed. I just love the freedom of them running around.” Having last visited at Easter, the twins have been excited about the upcoming trip for months. “The boys have had a 60-day countdown on the calendar on the fridge,” she says. Etain is willing to stay in a hotel with her sons, but it’s rarely her first choice. What would make a difference? “What hotels need to realise is parents don’t want to bring chaos. You’re not expecting people to roll out the red carpet, but small gestures like having quiet spaces or being accommodating if someone asks for a larger room, or getting your same table in the breakfast room – all those things make a difference. “In the La Mon outside Belfast, we get the same room every time we go. The hotel is spacious with a lovely quiet pool area and very warm, welcoming staff who remember the boys every time we visit, which is why we always go back.” Friendly staff, quiet spaces, a dedication to people’s needs: what’s not to like? Harris hopes more businesses will incorporate inclusive design and autism awareness training once they realise it’s an approach that makes sense for all. “Who doesn’t like clear communication? Who doesn’t like having predictability about what the experience is going to be like? Who doesn’t want to feel welcomed and not judged?” he says. “What is essential for an autistic family coming on holiday can actually be good for everybody.” *Some names have been changed. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: The reality of losing a job: Silent redundancies, AI and reentering the jobs market

THIS WEEK SAW the announcement of jobs at risk on different sides of the market, with hundreds likely to be lost at Amazon and courier firm Fastway. If it feels like this is becoming more common, it’s because it is more common. The figures confirm your thoughts. Recent data from the Central Statistics Office showed a spike of 9.4% in ‘job destructions’ compared to the same period last year. Following the latest announcement of jobs under threat, The Journal asked its readers on whether they had suffered through this over the past year. And in response we heard of the range of emotions experienced after they lost the jobs they had held for years. Some of these roles that were lost were in high-profile multinationals, with difficulties also found upon returning to the jobs market. A certain type of redundancy that has reared its head in recent months is the so-called silent layoff – where a smaller number of jobs are trimmed by a company without fanfare or media attention. The Journal has reported on claims of similar happening at TikTok’s Dublin office for instance. Some of these silent layoffs have been taking place well before this year, but may be getting noticed more due to a perceived tightening of the jobs market. Aidan from Co Offaly worked for a gas supplier for almost 20 years, but suddenly found himself out of a job in a round of cuts. Five people lost their work, this reader recalled: Another person told The Journal that they were recently made redundant from PayPal after over a decade of employment. But the sacking didn’t come as a shock as the reader said the company has been “doing redundancies every 6 months or so for the last 2-3 years. They tend to be in small numbers so it’s not reported a lot”. “Friends of mine from my department were made redundant earlier this year so it wasn’t a huge shock to me but I was still surprised when it happened,” said the reader, who asked to remain anonymous. The blow was cushioned by a redundancy payment: “I won’t mention the amount but it was generous.” Another reader, Cork-based and working in the tech sector, said ‘restructuring’ was the reason for his layoff – and for his lack of shock when it happened. He agreed that the short-to-medium term outlook for other companies means they are either cutting jobs or not looking to hire right now. “In my experience, it’s a challenging market for job seekers. I was a jobseeker in 2018 and 2022 – tougher market in 2025. There are lots of candidates right now for non-specialist tech roles like Project Managers/Program Managers/Product Managers/Recruiters.” A Morgan McKinley report into the Irish labour market detected this same trend. These adjustments are “not immediately visible” in headline figures as they don’t require a formal notification to the Department of Enterprise – and may well help avoid negative headlines. The notifications are supposed to happen if the layoffs meet a certain threshold of a workforce, which is 30 jobs or more at larger employers. What’s driving these silent layoffs? According to Morgan McKinley, it’s most often due to a combination of global economic uncertainty, AI-led transformation and nervousness around US tariffs. AI-led transformation was mentioned by a couple of our readers who had recently lost jobs. One, a translator, said half of his department was made redundant “because they believe in AI translations, although it is not nearly as good, or nearly as precise”. “There was a redundancy package,” he said, but added: “More than the bare minimum, but less than you would expect from an IT company with good revenues and a global brand.” There’s also the not so silent layoffs. Advertisement As with Amazon and Fastway this week, major employers like Oracle have also said they’re reducing their Irish workforce. Another example of this happened to one man working at Intel’s plant in Leixlip, Co Kildare. This reader “drew the short straw” and found himself the only one in his team cut as part of the trimming to the company’s Irish operations. Recent days have marked his last day at the company he joined six years ago via a project management subcontractor. “I was told 4 weeks ago that our department had to be cut by one and I drew the short straw. It absolutely came as a shock because there is a lot of work lined up for next year,” the man said. Earlier this year, Intel announced it was cutting 195 jobs, as it battles to catch up with competitors globally. Soon after a catering company contracted for the plant reduced its headcount by 37 jobs. This man who worked for Intel has to wait to find new work through the project management firm that subcontracts him to sites. However, there has been little success just yet in finding new work. “I’ve been finding it tough the past month since I was told, very few calls or email replies regarding new positions. Leaving Ireland isn’t out of the question but I’ll certainly be leaving Dublin in the near future,” he said. Our reader who lost their job in Paypal said they are yet to begin hunting for a new job, having heard of difficulties from previously laid off friends in their old office. “They haven’t had great luck searching for jobs so far. There doesn’t seem to be many jobs going in our skillset,” this person said. “I don’t feel hopeful that I’ll get a similar job or near to the same salary.” Brian had been working in Dublin as a lecturer in English for international students but lost the job in recent months amid a fall in enrollments. Brian, who received a redundancy package of €4,020, described the search for fresh work as “awful”. “The last time I was out of work (just after Covid) I got lots of replies and interviews,” he said. “While these didn’t always work out, at least there was a responsiveness. That seems to be gone.” Instead, he feels the job search these days is “like AI is talking to itself”. He explained: “I have to use ChatGPT to try to edit my CV so that my skills appear transferable, but I’m 100% certain they are using ChatGPT to filter applications.” It’s almost as if there is a “kind of contempt from prospective employers” that wasn’t there before, the lecturer added. “I don’t just mean not having any response to an application. I’ve had several semi-formal and formal phone calls and online interviews that have had no follow up at all.” John worked for a cryptocurrency firm and has also struggled after being laid off, which couldn’t have been at a worse time given he had just got engaged and bought a house. “As I live several hours from Dublin, I would need something remote or hybrid,” John said. “Finding work has been difficult as the market is very bad right now.” Is leaving Ireland an option for some of our readers? In the main, no. Several of those we spoke to who have found themselves unemployed have been landed in this position after years with the one employer, but at a period of time where they have children or have laid other roots by buying a home. A more hopeful experience was described by Jason from Co Dublin, who found out via a Microsoft Teams meeting that he and dozens more colleagues were being made redundant by their insurance firm. The company was moving the jobs back to the US. “It was not expected so abruptly,” Jason recalled. “We were half way through our house renovation and expecting our fourth child. Losing my job was not in our plans.” After three months spent drawing the dole, he found himself “fortunate enough to be offered a good position within another company within the same industry”.

Title: 3 Signs That Institutions Continue To Drive Crypto Adoption

BySean Stein Smith, Contributor. Despite the price of bitcoin still making headlines, states issuing dollar-backed stablecoins, and payments use cases dominating the conversation, there are substantial other headlines that investors might have missed in this flurry of activity. Particularly with the end of 2025 approaching, and with that the increased importance and focus of tax-related conversations, investors and advocates need to be especially vigilant to analyze institutional developments as well as what these deployments might mean for the wider marketplace. Another reason why certain investors and advocates might have overlooked the headlines below is the renewed focus that crypto hacks and breaches have brought to bear on the weaknesses that still exist within the marketplace. Be it the Bybit hack that exposed the dangers of institutionally backed hacking efforts, the debut of the film Code Is Law that examined the elements of the crypto landscape that believe regulatory safeguards are optional, or the billions lost through less spectacular hacking attempts the focus has rightly returned to cybersecurity, risks around client data, and the lack of insurance solutions for crypto products. In short, the tail end of 2025 has had a bevy of headlines (good and bad), policy updates and developments that have the potential to obscure just how widespread institutional adoption has become. Let’s take a look at some of those, as well as what the implications might be for investors and advocates alike. According to several sources, Mastercard is in late-stage talks to acquire stablecoin infrastructure platform Zerohash for nearly $2 billion, and while this specific acquisition is not finalized as of this writing, it is indicative of how payment processing giants are prioritizing stablecoins and on-chain payments. Stablecoins have been in the spotlight recently, with a number of recent wins on the policy front as well as the deployment of stablecoin/stabletoken solutions by several major TradFi institutions. With adjusted annual volume of approximately $9 trillion, taking into account bot-based trading and other potentially artificially inflated trading activity, the sheer size of the stablecoin payment space is appealing to the payment processing space. Even as margins continue to face headwinds from a competitive and legislative point of view, stablecoins have the potential to open up an almost entirely new market for payment processors to expand. Bringing together the familiarity and security that customers have come to expect from household names such as Mastercard with the crypto-native improvements delivered via stablecoins is looking like the “killer-app” that crypto has been looking for. Another payment processing giant, Visa, is also expanding its product and service offerings focusing on stablecoin utilization and payments running on four unique blockchains. Visa CEO Ryan McInerney reiterated the firms commitment. As these new services come online, Visa will have added support for four stablecoins running on four blockchains that will be able to converted into 25 fiat currencies. This announcement expands the support that Visa already provides to other stablecoins including USDC, Euro Coin (EURC), PayPal USD (PYUSD) on multiple blockchains. According to Visa the firm has facilitated $140 billion worth of stablecoin flows since 2020, further cementing the reality that stablecoins have 1) grown rapidly in terms of institutional usage, 2) taken center stage as the “every day” crypto use case, and 3) delivers quantifiable benefits to organizations involved in the transactions. This announcement is the foundational layer for other forthcoming efforts that will allow more banks and TradFi institutions to provide stablecoin related services, including the eventual ability of banks to mint and burn native stablecoins on the Visa tokenized asset platform. Visa continues to move to integrate TradFi banking products and services with the crypto-native space, and is another example of stablecoins are leading the effort to bring crypto to the mainstream via stablecoins. The global asset management giant Blackrock has certainly made its presence known in the crypto marketplace, with its leading spot bitcoin ETF having attracted over $100 billion in assets. Additionally, a recent announcement that Securitize (a Blackrock-backed tokenization firm) will be going public via a SPAC deal valued at $1.25 billion cements. The fact that the merger will occur with an affiliate of Cantor Fitzgerald, itself a longtime service provider to Tether and the USDT token, cements the pivot of Wall Street to the tokenized ecosystem. Since Securitize operated in the real-world-asset tokenization space, a sector that Blackrock CEO Larry Fink has forecasted could hit a size of $10 trillion, the implications of this merger are significant. Tokenization or RWA is a pivotal part of the forecasted growth of DeFi systems, DAOs, and other blockchain-based applications built for enterprise use. Given the scope and scale of support provided by both Blackrock and Cantor Fitzgerald the effect of this listing are sure to be felt across the space. Crypto makes headlines on a daily basis, but sometimes the most significant ones can fly under the radar; those are the ones investors should be sure to watch.

In unfortunate news for J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth series and MMO fans, Amazon Games’ Lord of the Rings MMO has been quietly canceled after layoffs hit the company’s gaming sector. The cancellation has been confirmed via a now-deleted LinkedIn post (spotted by Rock Paper Shotgun) by former Amazon Games senior gameplay engineer Ashleigh Amrine. Ashleigh, who had been with the studio for over nine years, detailed in the LinkedIn post: This morning I was part of the layoffs at Amazon Games, alongside my incredibly talented peers on New World and our fledgling Lord of the Rings game (y’all would have loved it). It’s always tough to see such a strong team go through something like this. I’ve been lucky to work with some of the most skilled, creative, and kind developers I’ve met there. Amazon announced massive corporate layoffs, which hit 14,000 staff members across the company. It’s reported that more employees will be laid off from its 350,000 workforce. Amid the layoffs, Amazon Games’ crew was hit the hardest, with an “undisclosed” number of cuts across its studios in San Diego and Irvine, as well as the central publishing team. The Vice President of Amazon Games confirmed the layoffs in an announcement, stating, “We have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development.” The company is stepping away from the MMO space to focus on casual titles, AI projects, and its cloud gaming platform, Luna. This is the second time Amazon’s Middle-earth MMO project has been canceled. Earlier in 2019, Amazon announced a partnership with Leyou Technologies and Athlon Games Studio. However, the deal was scrapped amid contract discrepancies when Tencent acquired Leyou. Later in 2023, Amazon joined hands with Embracer Group’s Middle-earth Enterprises for publishing rights for the Lord of the Rings MMO. Fans are disappointed upon hearing the loss of what could have been a new take on Tolkien’s universe. Layoffs have also hit Amazon’s New World as active development for the MMO has ended. New World’s Season 10: Nighthaven was the final major content update. Amazon announced that it would keep New World servers online through 2026 and give players 6 months' notice before the servers are sunset. Rock Paper Shotgun

Title: ‘Godfather of AI’ says tech giants can’t profit from their astronomical investments unless human labor is replaced

Jason Ma is the weekend editor at Fortune, where he covers markets, the economy, finance, and housing. Computer scientist and Nobel laureate Geoffrey Hinton doubled down on his warnings about how artificial intelligence will affect the labor market and the role of companies leading the charge. In an interview with Bloomberg TV’s Wall Street Week on Friday, he said the obvious way to make money off AI investments, aside from charging fees to use chatbots, is to replace workers with something cheaper. Hinton, whose work has earned him a Nobel Prize and the moniker “godfather of AI,” added that while some economists point out previous disruptive technologies created as well as destroyed jobs, it’s not clear to him that AI will do the same. “I think the big companies are betting on it causing massive job replacement by AI, because that’s where the big money is going to be,” he warned. Just four so-called AI hyperscalers—Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon—are expected to boost capital expenditures to $420 billion next fiscal year from $360 billion this year, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, OpenAI alone has announced a total of $1 trillion in infrastructure deals in recent weeks with AI-ecosystem companies like Nvidia, Broadcom, and Oracle. When asked if such investments can pay off without destroying jobs, Hinton replied, “I believe that it can’t. I believe that to make money you’re going to have to replace human labor.” The remarks echo what he said in September, when he told the Financial Times that AI will “create massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits,” attributing it to the capitalist system. In fact, evidence is mounting that AI is shrinking opportunities, especially at the entry level, and an analysis of job openings since OpenAI launched ChatGPT shows they plummeted roughly 30%. And this past week, Amazon announced 14,000 layoffs, largely in middle management. While CEO Andy Jassy said the decision was the result of “culture” and not AI, a memo he sent in June predicted a smaller corporate workforce “as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Despite the potential downside for workers, Hinton also sees benefits from AI. When asked if he would go back in time and stop AI from developing, he paused and said he doesn’t know. “It’s not like nuclear weapons, which are only good for bad things,” he explained. “It’s a difficult decision, because it can do tremendous good in health care and education. It’ll do tremendous good, and in fact if you think about it increasing productivity in many, many industries, that should be good.” The problem ultimately is not owing to AI itself, but “on how we organize society,” Hinton added. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Mamdani’s God Squad: The clerics, activists and political operatives who have his back

Fox News' Bill Hemmer breaks down the latest on key races to watch nationwide, including the New York City mayoral election and the gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey. When New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani stepped to the microphone outside the Islamic Cultural Center of the Bronx last week near Yankee Stadium, his voice broke as he spoke about "the memory of my aunt who stopped taking the subway after Sept. 11 because she did not feel safe." Behind him, a Yemeni-American educator in sunglasses named Debbie Almontaser nodded. Almost two decades ago, in 2007, she was forced to resign as principal of a city school after defending a T-shirt with the slogan "Intifada NYC." City officials viewed it as a call to violence. She said it was benign. Her case became a rallying cry for Muslim American activists who cast her as a victim of "Islamophobia." FBI AGENTS FROM '93 WTC ATTACK BLAST MAMDANI FOR EMBRACING RADICAL IMAM Now, Almontaser was back, this time as a senior advisor to Emgage Action and a board member of Yemeni American Merchants Association Action, two of 110 political nonprofits, community groups and political action committees backing Mamdani as he alleges "Islamophobia" against him. Recently, when critics questioned Mamdani’s ties to hardline Brooklyn Imam Siraj Wahhaj, she sprang to action, helping to organize a protest to defend Wahhaj. That rapid, coordinated response captured the modus operandi of a network of political operatives and clerics intertwined with the shared mission of catapulting Mamdani into the mayor’s office. Mamdani’s background diverges from many of his co-religionists. In an interview, he said he is a Khoja Shia Muslim, part of a small, relatively liberal sect with roots in India. Many of his New York-area allies are religiously strict Sunni Muslims who practice more conservative interpretations of the faith. But they find common ground in politics. "It’s a sophisticated fusion of religion, politics and identity," said Mansour Al-Hadj, a Washington-based researcher on Muslim political movements and extremism. "The same networks that once focused on community services are now mobilizing voters and producing candidates. This is how political Islam adapts inside democracy." Mansour Al-Hadj, a Washington, D.C.,-based researcher on Muslim political movements and extremism, warns of radical forces backing Zohran Mamdani's bid to be mayor of New York City. (Mansour Al-Hadj) Mamdani’s God Squad includes about a few dozen key players who specialize in painting any critique as an attack on their faith, accusing critics of Islamophobia even as many of them have engaged in strident rhetoric against the U.S., Israel and capitalism. The Original Imam: America is "filthy and sick" Mamdani set off a firestorm Oct. 7 when he walked into Masjid At-Taqwa in Brooklyn and later posted a photo of himself beaming beside the mosque’s imam, or prayer leader, Wahhaj. Zohran Mamdani meets Imam Siraj Wahhaj and Yusef Abdus Salaam Oct. 17, 2025. (@ZohranKMamdani/X) The imam’s checkered past goes back decades. In a 1992 talk, he said American Muslims should elect an "emir" rather than choose between George Bush and Bill Clinton. Soon after, he served as a character witness in the trial of Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, the so-called "Blind Sheikh" convicted for plotting the 1993 World Trade Center bombing that killed six people. "You know what this country is?" Wahhaj said in 1995. "It’s a garbage can. Filthy. Filthy and sick." In 2018, three of Wahhaj's children were arrested after authorities found 11 malnourished children in a New Mexico compound tied to his family; a grandchild had died in what authorities described as an attempted exorcism. He told local news reporters, "Whatever they did wrong … it's not acceptable to us." The Youth Imam: Resist "by any means necessary" In New York, the Muslim American Society recently signed on to a letter to challenge "unmistakably Islamophobic, anti-Black, and xenophobic" attacks on Mamdani. Signatories included CAIR National, the Council on American-Islamic Relations’ New York chapter, Islamic Circle of North America’s New York chapter, the Islamic Center of Five Towns, Muslim American Society of New York, Muslim Community Network, Rockaway Islamic Center and a "Syosset Muslim Community." Members of the Muslim American Society have long been quick to accuse others of Islamophobia even as they unabashedly call for violence against their perceived enemies. At an Eid celebration earlier this year, a cleric at the Muslim American Society cast Muslims as victims worldwide. Mohammad Badawi, youth director at the Muslim American Society, declared the local community’s joy would only be complete when Muslims are "victorious worldwide," adding they would celebrate "after the destruction of the illegitimate Zionist occupiers," Israel. He regularly organizes anti-Israel protests in a campaign against "injustice and oppression." At one protest, Badawi urged youth to "fight back" against injustices "by any means necessary." Abdullah Akl, a charismatic organizer with the Muslim American Society Youth Center, leads many protests under the banner of "Within Our Lifetime," with founder Nerdeen Kiswani. Mamdani joined them before his run for mayor. Akl calls the street protests "sacred activism," a mix of faith and resistance that will "free Palestine." Since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, the Muslim American Society Youth Center has organized prayer protests on Wall Street outside the New York Stock Exchange and street protests for "Nakba Day," calling the day Israel was created a "catastrophe," and youth-led demonstrations outside BlackRock. Akl turned a subway car into a protest zone with chants of "Globalize the intifada… There is only one solution: intifada revolution." When the New York Police Department arrested Akl and other activists, the Council on American-Islamic Relation’s New York chapter sent out a press release demanding their release. During the Oct. 7 protests this year against Israel, Akl shouted, "We did not act enough! We will show up, stronger than we did the first Oct. 7." In response to criticism, he posted a message on social media, doubling down and saying, "Saying we didn’t act enough to stop a full blown genocide against palestinians [sic] is incitement?? Saying we need to be louder and protest more and continue to speak up for gaza [sic] is a crime? Zionist tears once again for the most documented genocide in modern history." For decades, Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) has served as an aggressive and litigious watchdog for a host of Muslim figures and causes, often at the forefront of fighting legitimate bigotry. But CAIR has also courted controversy. Federal prosecutors named CAIR an unindicted co-conspirator in a federal terrorism-financing case against the Holy Land Foundation, a nonprofit based in Texas. In 2008, five Holy Land leaders were convicted of funneling $12.4 million to Hamas. Ultimately, no CAIR officials were charged in the case. Years ago, Mamdani recorded rap lyrics celebrating the "Holy Land Five," urging listeners, "My love to the Holy Land Five. You better look ‘em up." Basim Elkarra, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations California chapter and one of the founders of a new 501(c)(4) nonprofit, CAIR Action Inc., now seems to be pursuing a new and entirely legal means of financing causes, taking a page from the powerful pro-Israel political action committee AIPAC. He told a meeting of the Islamic Circle of North America, "AIPAC has had the run for 60 years, but it is over now. "We will teach these folks a lesson … we are coming." In another speech, he said, "The game has changed. AIPAC has been around since 1961…and now they have a formidable foe!" This summer, Mehdi Hasan, a former host at Qatar’s Al Jazeera TV network, sat down with Mamdani for a sympathetic interview. As the campaign heated up, Hasan became a full-time defender on social media, swatting at critics and framing Mamdani as the right kind of provocateur, a "once in a generation political talent." Mehdi Hasan speaks onstage during the Crooked Media — Lovett or Leave It: Live on Tour, April 25, 2024, in Washington, D.C. (Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Crooked Media) Hasan’s own record includes sermons likening non-Muslims to "animals" and comparing gay people to "sexual deviants." He has said his views have become more progressive since then. After a series of plane crashes earlier this year, Hasan wrote on social media, "Make American Planes Crash Again." He deleted the message amid criticism and said, "I deleted this sarcastic quote-tweet because MAGA and Islamophobic folks are clipping it out of context and trying to ridiculously suggest I’m inciting violence. I was obviously mocking the MAGA slogan ‘Make America… Again’ slogan and highlighting the shocking number of plane crashes under Trump and the FAA cuts. But this tweet was in poor taste, poorly worded, and has allowed people in bad faith to call me a terrorist…" Yasir Qadhi, a high-profile American imam and founder of the AlMaghrib Institute and MuslimMatters.com, selling the puritanical Salafi interpretation of Islam, literally wrote the book on "Understanding Salafism." Recently, he posted a two-part thread on X endorsing the idea of Mamdani’s win as a "civilizational victory." Yasir Qadhi, a high-profile American imam and founder of the AlMaghrib Institute and MuslimMatters.com, has encouraged support for Mamdani for his "courageous stand against Zionism," among other things. (Getty Images) He urged Muslim Americans to move beyond "naive" religious critiques of politicians who are more socially progressive than they are comfortable. Meanwhile, Qadhi once mocked European Jews as "white, crooked nose, blonde hairs" and "not a Semitic people." In the same lecture, he recommended a book, "The Hoax of the Holocaust." Most recently, he has backed the controversial Muslim housing development outside Dallas, "EPIC City." He noted in his Instagram post, "open to non-Americans as well." He touted some of its features, writing, "Islamic schools, college, masjid." Imam Khalid Latif is a popular chaplain at the Islamic Center of New York City, a $22 million project to build a hub and "our own space" on Sixth Avenue for young Muslim professionals. He endorsed Mamdani earlier this year and has been an ardent supporter. He has called him "a bearer of compassion in a time where it is far too rare." Imam Khalid Latif, shown here speaking at Lincoln Center in 2022, is the chaplain at the Islamic Center of New York City. He endorsed Mamdani earlier this year. (Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty Images) In 2012, Latif led a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia that included Omar Mateen, who would later murder 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, the deadliest anti-LGBTQ attack in U.S. history. He has denied radicalizing Mateen, and he hasn’t faced the same type of allegations that surround other imams. After the backlash to Mamdani’s meeting with Wahhaj, he posted, "Happy birthday to my brother Zohran… Keep showing them who we are by showing them who you are." He invoked the divine to bless Mamdani’s mission, revealing the fusion of religion and politics for the Mamdani God Squad: "May your 34th year be one of clarity, courage, and closeness — to your purpose, your people, and your Creator," ending with the Arabic word for amen, "Ameen." On Monday, Latif posted a sassy video from the Muslim Democratic Club of New York, saying, "The name is Mamdani, M-a-m-d-a-n-i," with Latif mouthing the part where the narration turns to, "You should learn how to say it." That day, Latif delivered a speech to support Mamdani, pivoting to allege Mamdani was now a victim of "anti-Black racism," saying, "Anti-Muslim sentiment is always" a symbol of "anti-Black racism." In a glowing portrait, The New York Times called Palestinian American political organizer Linda Sarsour a "Brooklyn home girl in a hijab." Over almost a decade, she has been a political mentor to Mamdani, inviting him into the Muslim Democratic Club of New York, which she co-founded. She later endorsed his race for the New York General Assembly, which he won. Activist Linda Sarsour speaks earlier this year at the Lights for Liberty vigil held in protest of the Trump administration's ICE actions. (Erik McGregor/LightRocket via Getty Images) All the while, she has been a polarizing figure, once saying about two critics, author and ex-Muslim Ayaan Hirsi Ali and activist Brigitte Gabriel, "I wish I could take their vagina away - they don’t deserve to be women." Ali is a survivor of female genital mutilation, a practice that involves cutting the clitoris of a young girl with the idea that it will inhibit sexual promiscuity. As a co-founder of the Women’s March, Sarsour stepped down amid criticism of alleged antisemitism and not welcoming Jewish feminists who support the state of Israel, or "Zionists." At a rally on Sunday night with Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Imam Latif told 13,000 people, "This is our city. This is our moment." Some Muslims beg to differ. "It’s not our moment," said Al-Hadj. "Across the boroughs, the Mamdani God Squad is banging a drumbeat of grievance after grievance, from Staten Island to Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and Long Island," he said. "Across the city’s Muslim institutions, you hear the same drumbeat: They smeared us. They silenced us. They fear us. "In that rising volume, something is lost: Muslim pluralism. The God Squad does not speak for every Muslim in New York — nor for every Shia, every Sunni, every immigrant family, or every second-generation kid trying to thread faith and freedom. It speaks for a coalition committed to illiberal ends, with socialist capture of city politics on the one hand and puritanical religious rhetoric on the other. They insist that to oppose them is to betray the community, so they actually push their own tyranny." Win or lose next week, Al-Hadj said, the Mamdani God Squad had actualized the words that had gotten Almontaser into so much trouble years ago: "Intifada NYC." Asra Q.

Title: These are the 3 signs your company is about to make layoffs: career experts

With Amazon, UPS, Target, and Skydance Paramount all announcing layoffs this week, many workers are worried their companies will be next to make cuts. But experts say there are three signs that a round of redundancies is on the horizon — so take note to avoid being blindsided. “Companies are seeing their ability to be more efficient and use less staff with AI, and so they’re taking the opportunity right now to reduce staff,” Jason Walker, co-founder of Thrive HR Consulting, told CNBC. The first sign is “a slowdown in hiring,” recruiter Jalonni Weaver revealed to the website. If new roles don’t get posted, or vacant roles aren’t filled quickly, “it’s never a good sign that you’re doing well financially.” Meanwhile, a change in corporate messaging is the second sign that the company could be looking to let some staffers go. “There’s a lot of language that starts to [plant] the seeds and set the foundation for what is coming,” consultant Rosie Nestingen told CNBC. Rey Ramirez of Thrive HR Consulting agrees. He advises employees to look out for phrases such as “we need to be more efficient” as a potential sign that the business could boot people in the near future. Thirdly, a reduction in some workers’ hours is another indication that layoffs are looming. “Employees can’t afford to live on 30 or 40 or 50% less pay, so that almost by design starts to push people out of the organization,” Ramirez explained, labelling a reduction in hours as effectively “quiet firing.” Other tactics, such as “return to office” mandates, are also deliberately designed to reduce headcount without the company needing to announce official layoffs. Still, it paints a picture of a company that could be mulling cuts in the near future. Amid a sluggish economy and anxiety about AI, Weaver advises all workers to keep their resumes up to date, just in case. Even if you aren’t planning on jumping jobs, the recruiter recommends applying to other roles on occasion in order to make sure your CV and skills at interviews remain “competitive.”

Title: Satoshi's Bitcoin Whitepaper Turns 17: From Cypherpunk Rebellion to Wall Street Staple
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/11/01/satoshi-s-bitcoin-whitepaper-turns-17-from-cypherpunk-rebellion-to-wall-street-staple
Time Published: 2025-11-01T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
The Bitcoin whitepaper, A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, published by the mysterious and pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, turned seventeen years old yesterday. Released on Oct. 31, 2008, amid the global financial crisis, the nine-page document laid the foundation for what would become the world’s first cryptocurrency. The whitepaper outlined a vision for a decentralized, peer-to-peer financial system built on cryptographic proof rather than trust in third-party intermediaries. Its goal was to eliminate the problem of double-spending and enable online transactions without relying on banks or other trusted third parties. “We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust,” Satoshi wrote. Seventeen years later, Bitcoin’s influence has reached far beyond the cypherpunk forums where it began. The anniversary comes as U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs in less than two years of existence have experienced unprecedented success, seeing total net inflow of over $62 billion and total net assets exceeding $150 billion, according to SoSoValue data. But Bitcoin’s mainstream acceptance extends beyond Wall Street. It has now entered the highest levels of government, including the White House under the current U.S. administration. Some of Bitcoin’s most outspoken critics have become its biggest advocates. In 2021, former President Donald Trump dismissed Bitcoin as a “scam against the dollar.” Yet by the 2024 presidential election, he was urging supporters to “never sell your bitcoin” and went on to sign an executive order establishing a bitcoin strategic reserve. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock the world’s largest asset manager once called Bitcoin an “index of money laundering.” Today, he champions it as one of his firm’s most successful ETF products and views it as a hedge against sovereign debt instability.Likewise, Michael Saylor, the outspoken CEO of Strategy, has become one of Bitcoin’s most persistent evangelists, continuing to accumulate BTC through stock and debt offerings. Saylor himself began as a skeptic, once declaring, “Bitcoin’s days are numbered. It seems like just a matter of time before it suffers the same fate as online gambling.” The last major holdout among prominent financial figures remains JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who continues to voice doubts about Bitcoin’s value and sustainability. His bank though, has heartily moved into the sector, including recently allowing clients to pledge bitcoin as collateral. The financialization of bitcoin through ETFs and corporate treasury adoption has drawn comparisons to the mortgage securitization boom of the 1970s an era that saw asset prices soar to new heights. Yet this evolution has not pleased everyone. Many early Bitcoin believers argue that that its very ethos, a form of money outside the control of the state, has been diluted by institutional adoption. For the cypherpunk movement that birthed Bitcoin, the system’s embrace by Wall Street and Washington feels like a paradox: a rebellion absorbed by the establishment it once sought to disrupt. On an annual basis, the average transaction fee per bitcoin block has fallen to its lowest level since 2010, raising concerns about the network’s long-term sustainability. Low fees, while attractive for users, reduce incentives for miners who secure the network, especially as block rewards continue to halve every four years. Originally envisioned as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, Bitcoin has increasingly been overshadowed by the “store of value” narrative. "Never sell your bitcoin," is a common refrain from Michael Saylor to the Trump family and many voices in between. At the same time, controversy continues within the developer community particularly between Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Knots over whether the network should allow non-monetary data like Ordinals or enforce stricter rules to block it. Some see such restrictions as necessary to preserve the network’s integrity, while others view them as a form of censorship that alters bitcoin’s open and permissionless nature. Beyond internal debates, the looming question of quantum computing also poses an unresolved risk. The potential for future quantum machines to break existing cryptographic standards could threaten Bitcoin’s security, with no definitive solution in place yet. “It’s no doubt that Bitcoin has arrived, accepted by Wall Street, and its sustained period above $100,000 confirms that," said Bitcoin OG Nicholas Gregory recently. "Its transition from peer-to-peer cash to a store of value is evident," he continued. "It remains to be seen where it goes long-term. I, for one, think the narrative of it as a medium of exchange is key to its enduring place, along with solutions to the quantum threat."

Title: AI Blamed for Tens of Thousands of White Collar Layoffs
URL: http://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-white-collar-layoffs
Time Published: 2025-11-01T13:45:00Z
Full Content:
By Rae Witte Published Nov 1, 2025 9:45 AM EDT There’s no question that the job market is a mess. According to Labor Department data, nearly two million Americans have been without a job for 27 weeks or more, the highest figure since 2022. And it’s hitting white collar jobs hard: this week alone, Amazon cut its corporate workforce by 14,000 jobs, UPS cut 34,000 operational workforce positions, and Target and Paramount axed 1,800 and 1,000 jobs, respectively. Many are blaming those cuts on AI. Everyone from Senator Bernie Sanders to Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell is wringing their hands about the tech’s effect on employment. Mike Hoffman, CEO of growth advisory firm SBI, told the Wall Street Journal that productivity surged when he cut his software development team by 80 percent. And Meta just culled 600 employees from the AI Superintelligence lab — after dropping billions to beef up the team — and blamed advancements in automation. Others aren’t so sure. New research found that even the world’s strongest AI agents struggled to perform the vast majority of tasks that companies currently lean on independent contractors for. According to a recent study from MIT, 95 percent of companies that adopt AI see zero meaningful revenue growth. Some companies are finding they’re forced to hire contractors to fix AI’s mistakes, or even to re-hire staff they terminated in favor of the tech. It all raises an interesting counter-possibility: maybe instead of AI actually replacing human-level intellectual labor, bosses are running with the narrative that it’s ready to replace human workers to justify layoffs — when what’s really happening is they’re offloading work onto a smaller human workforce, or forcing their overburdened remaining employees to produce lower quality results. The reality is that there are other major headwinds dragging down the economy. The US is now in a perpetual state of political uncertainty that has directly impacted many employers. President Donald Trump’s tariffs were announced, postponed, instated, rolled back, rinsed and repeated; his restrictive immigration policies and deportations are shrinking the workforce and increasing labor costs; cutting the $7,500 consumer incentive for electric vehicles is forcing layoffs in that sector. AI is a flashy scapegoat for mounting white collar layoffs, in other words, and if it keeps improving, it may eventually pose a real threat to jobs. But for now, it feels more like a bogeyman to rationalize short-term cost cutting — and any companies that indulge in it may find that they’re undermining their reputation and institutional knowledge for years to come.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you're one of the millions of unemployed Americans looking for work right now, it's clear the job market is tough. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that in August, the number of job seekers outpaced available openings in the US for the first time since April 2021. The shift comes amid a wave of layoffs this year across major employers, including Amazon, Meta, and GM. For many out-of-work Americans, it's easy to feel discouraged — but there's still hope. WalletHub has ranked the best and worst cities in the US for job hunters, showing where your odds might be strongest and weakest. To find out where you'll have the best chance at landing, keeping, and actually enjoying a job, WalletHub compared all 50 states using 34 metrics that reflect job-market strength and economic health. These include factors such as employment growth, median annual income, average commute time, job security, and even the likelihood that artificial intelligence could take your job in the future. WalletHub found that many of the best states for jobs are clustered in New England, the Upper Midwest, and the Great Plains, with Texas being the lone Southern state. Despite their regional and industry differences, from tech in Massachusetts to agriculture in the Dakotas, these states share common strengths: low unemployment, solid job growth, and business-friendly environments. "The best states for jobs make it easier for residents to find and retain jobs, and employers in these states also offer very competitive compensation and benefits," said WalletHub analyst Chip Lupo. These are the 10 best and 10 worst states for job prospects, according to WalletHub. Business Insider added September median home sale prices from Redfin and 2024 median household income data from the Missouri Census Data Center's ACS Profiles. Jump to

US stock market November 2025 forecast looks bullish as Wall Street enters its best month of the year. The S&P 500 gained 2.3% in October, the Nasdaq 4.7%, and the Dow 2.5%, extending its six-month winning streak. The Fed cut rates by 25 bps, fueling optimism after Amazon’s $180.2 billion Q3 revenue beat and AMD’s 58% monthly jump. With AI stocks surging, inflation easing, and rents falling, investors eye November for fresh highs — unless rising CRE delinquencies or job losses trigger a pullback.

Title: YouTube CEO emphasizes AI as the next technological frontier

YouTube is embarking on a transformative journey into artificial intelligence (AI), as CEO Neal Mohan outlined plans to position the platform at the forefront of this technological shift. In a memo to employees earlier in October, Mohan declared, "the next frontier for YouTube is AI", unveiling a significant reorganization of the company’s product and engineering divisions, which will take effect on November 5, 2025. To better align YouTube with its AI-driven ambitions, the company will restructure its operations into three primary product organizations, all reporting directly to Mohan. Johanna Voolich will oversee Viewer Products, managing areas such as Search and Discovery, the Living Room app, infrastructure, and Trust and Safety. Meanwhile, the Creator and Community Products group, temporarily under Voolich’s leadership, will focus on YouTube Shorts, Live, and expanding generative AI tools to assist creators. Christian Oestlien will lead the Subscription Products division, handling YouTube Premium, Music, TV, and other over-the-top initiatives. The company is also making internal changes to improve efficiency and collaboration. The UX organization, led by JT, will integrate with Scott’s engineering team to streamline processes. Similarly, the Shopping group, under Travis’s leadership, will continue to report to Scott. Mohan emphasized that these adjustments aim to strengthen decision-making, enhance accountability, and ensure high-growth areas receive the necessary focus and investment. As part of the restructuring, YouTube introduced a voluntary exit program for U.S.-based employees within Mohan’s direct reporting organization. The program offers eligible employees the option to leave the company with a severance package, although the precise number of eligible employees remains undisclosed. A YouTube spokesperson clarified that the program is voluntary and does not involve layoffs or role eliminations. Details of the program are being communicated individually to those eligible. Mohan has been vocal about AI’s potential to transform YouTube’s platform and services. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, he stated, "AI in service of human creativity" is a central focus for the company. He explained how AI can enable creators to generate ideas, develop visuals, and enhance video production more efficiently. "I do think creation is an area where AI will help enormously by making the process easier, faster, and more powerful", Mohan added. The new Creator and Community Products organization will lead the development of these AI-powered tools. This commitment to AI mirrors broader trends in the tech industry. Major companies like Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Google’s DeepMind also recently announced significant organizational changes to integrate AI into their operations. However, unlike many of these companies, YouTube’s approach does not involve layoffs, instead opting for voluntary departures to adjust its structure. The reorganization comes at a time of robust financial performance for YouTube’s parent company, Alphabet. The company recently reported its first-ever quarter with revenue exceeding $100 billion, with net income rising 33 percent year-over-year. YouTube contributed significantly to this growth, generating $10.26 billion in ad revenue during the third quarter of 2025, a 15 percent increase from the previous year and ahead of Wall Street expectations. Acknowledging the platform’s success, Mohan highlighted YouTube’s evolution. The platform has paid more than $100 billion to its creators, maintained its position as the leading streaming service in the United States for over two years, and grown its user base to 125 million YouTube Premium and Music subscribers, along with 8 million YouTube TV subscribers. Despite this growth, Mohan noted that the core leadership structure "has not evolved in a decade", necessitating the reorganization to better align with the platform’s current scale and complexity. In his memo to employees, Mohan expressed optimism about YouTube’s trajectory. "It’s an incredibly exciting time at YouTube, and many opportunities and challenges lie ahead", he wrote. "Looking to the future, the next frontier for YouTube is AI, which has the potential to transform every part of the platform." The changes, he noted, are designed to enable the company to "make the most of this opportunity" and ensure leadership teams are well-equipped to prioritize high-growth areas. As YouTube moves forward with its restructuring, its focus remains clear: leveraging AI to enhance both content creation and user experiences, signaling a new chapter of innovation for the world’s largest video platform. The changes will officially take effect on November 5, 2025, marking the beginning of what Mohan described as "an incredibly exciting time at YouTube."

Goooooooood Mooooooorning Fiatnam! It was painfully obvious what the extraterrestrials on board 3I/Atlas were thinking, they’d heard from across the universe about Bitcoin and were eager to invest, the blue light emanating from the spacecraft an attempt to fill a buy order, alas out of range yet. Could be. I heard they were arriving just in time for the Chiefs/Bills game. The plan was to land on the 50 yard line just before game time and auction off Gort to the highest bidder. Maybe to raise funds to buy that Crypto? …what sort of forty time does Gort got? When your reach extends from one sideline to another, and no one can block or tackle you, speed doesn’t matter much. And he can play both sides of the ball and never break a stretch. Try him at RB, TE, LT or DT. The Wunderwaffe of all time. Gamechanger! Wukchumni and Henry Moon Pie: klaatu barada nikto The interesting thing about the interpretations of 3I / Atlas is that the asteroid is beyond the Sun. So it is cutting through the solar system at a time when no one on Earth can see it — blocked by the Sun and too far away. And, yes, it has many weird qualities. “There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Milton Friedman, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.” Nevertheless, it has also arrived at an astrologically volatile time. All of the majors — Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, and Jupiter have gone into (and sometimes out of) retrograde in the second half of 2025. Mercury is due to go into retrograde again on 10 November in Sagittarius, the sign that 3I / Atlas emerged from. This fashion mag gives a highly detailed horoscope: https://www.russh.com/every-retrograde-in-2025/ When the biggies — Jupiter, his brother Neptune, their dads Saturn and Uranus, gods of time — all move together, even the skeptics among us (and I’m fairly skeptical) should take notice. Some “deep astrologers” think that we are receiving a signal of moving collectively into a new epoch. So there is life after Trump Derangement Syndrome. Maybe Jupiter can detach the claws of Bill and Hillary from the Democratic Party. Is Zohran Mamdani a sign of a new age of Saturn, peace, prosperity, and low-cost groceries? The golden toilet in the White House remains unexplained. [I will consult my patron, Mercury, who is more or less in charge of grocery stores.] After 3I/Atlas touched down on the White House lawn and Atalasians emerged, an excited President Trump almost immediately slapped tariffs on them, claiming ‘they’ve been cheating earthlings for far too long…’ Well, there are serious matters afoot. My page shows the Galactic Council (a bunch of commies, for sure) as arriving and sorting this earthly human cesspool out. They will instruct us as to having empathy for all life. Obviously they haven’t heard of the “Dark forest” theory… “‘Sobbing daughter captures ICE ‘detain her mom for not having social security number memorized” I got an idea. All those emigrants could easily have their Social Security number tattooed on their lower arms and as it is only 9 digits, would not have to be big. That way if ICE pulls them up, they can proudly pull up their sleeves and show those agents their Social Security number as that seems to be the only number they are interested in. Any resemblance to this idea and a practise that was undertaken in Eastern Europe in WW2 is just a coincidence. Don’t give anyone in DC ideas. What! no bar code tattoo to expedite ICE processing? That will go on your neck and be your Permanent Record Identifier. According to the Department of Public Information, there is no truth to the rumour that the first three numbers of everyone’s PRI number will be 666. Stay safe, and grey. You people need to get along with the zeigeist. Nowdays, everyone gets a chip under the skin. I’ve Got You Under My Skin https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1AHec7sfZ8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9MYizva-7o Really interesting article on lead exposure in early humans. Loved the points made regarding Neanderthal extinction and the potential linkages to Speech Sound Disorder and Autism. Radiation hormesis now comes to lead, just in time for the Trump Administration to loosen pollution restrictions. Convenient! I was very much surprised to read how many of those caves were contaminated by lead. How did that work out? It seems to have been widespread but I would have assumed that having places with lead deposits as well as developed caves would have only been a very small percentage and not over 70% like is suggested here. Did the Ancients use Lead Oxide as a pigment to produce white in their cave paintings? Did the Ancients use Lead Oxide as the pigment for face and body decoration goop? The Left Wins the Irish Presidential Election in a Landslide Counterpunch To give some background – Catherine Connolly is an ex Labour activist who left due (apparently) to internal fights within her local party. She was little known outside her constituency, although she seems to have been very well liked by other politicians including centrists – her two political jobs – Galway Mayor and Deputy Speaker for the parliament are both decided on open votes, which means a lot of the centre and right will have supported her. She was considered an outsider for the post, but as none of the left parties could agree on their own candidate, she became the de facto left candidate. She was also aided by the two centre right parties making an appalling mess of their campaign. She is a barrister and very good with both the public and on TV and won very easily. She has a long, consistent history of being on the general left of politics and in particular anti-war and anti-imperialism and pro-palestine (before it was fashionable, as they say). More recently, she seems to have become more nationalist on Irish unity (she keeps quiet on this as it’s the primary ideological issue dividing the left). The Presidential post is largely ceremonial and she will have little real power. It does have two significant political outcomes: 1. It will make it almost impossible for the current government to weaken Irish neutrality. She cannot block any attempt to join Nato or take part in military action, but she has the capacity to create a constitutional crisis over it, so no government would consider it worth the effort to try. It was never likely, but its pretty much an impossibility now for the next 7 years. 2. It greatly strengthens Sinn Fein (centre left/nationalist/republican). They initially couldn’t find a candidate that had any chance, so reluctantly backed her. But as they have by far the best electoral ground game, they became the de facto main partner in a loose alliance of left parties and the Greens. While that alliance lasts, it shows its possibilities in another election. But more crucially it has seriously weakened the current Prime Minister who despises Sinn Fein – it seems very likely he will not make it to the election. His likely successor belongs to the republican radical wing of his party, one much more likely to join forces with Sinn Fein. So this could give SF two potential coalition partners after the next election – a left wing/green alliance, or a centrist and left Republican one. They probably prefer the second option. She sounds very much like an Irish traditionalist in having Ireland be neutral and also pro-Palestinian out of principle. If she is there for the next seven years, then it may stabilize Irish politics and stop the idea I have heard of Ireland going into NATO so it can give all its military equipment to the Ukrainians and give Zelensky a coupla billion Euros. Forgive me as I have not been following Irish politics as closely as I used to, but is there really a movement among the Irish center-right to abandon neutrality and join NATO? The very idea seems so shockingly bad to me I could scarcely believe my eyes when I read your comment! No politician in Ireland who wants to get elected openly calls for it, but there is a lobby within the establishment who does want it (as this widely mocked article indicates). Michael Martin, the current PM, would try to move Ireland towards Nato if he could, but his party would never allow it. It would be a massive vote loser. The complication for Ireland is that even though it is not part of Nato, because of the lack of investment in defence over the years, the country has had little choice but to rely on UK/US and other European military help with various issues, from intercepting aircraft in Irelands aerospace to maritime rescue and heavy lift capacity for pulling citizens out of trouble around the world or in shoring up Irelands UN contingent (there has been an Irish Battalion in the Lebanon for nearly 3 decades now). For pragmatic reasons, Irelands small military accepts Nato standards for its equipment. So while neutrality is extremely popular with the electorate and the foreign establishment is split over this, no government aren’t actually willing to put in place a meaningful defence force. Interestingly, Sinn Fein has started calling for much more military spending. It is quite possible to envisage a situation where Ireland accepts membership of Nato as part of a deal for unification. I would prefer Sinn Féin to find a UK political party that would agree to leave NATO to enable unification, I.e. a common Ireland-Britain defence area as well as a common travel area. Although NATO may leave us first! :-) “US begins troop drawdown in Romania” Not just Romania but apparently Hungary, Bulgaria and Slovakia as well in December. I would imagine some panic in NATO over this as there might be the suspicion that Trump will eventually reduce US troop numbers until there is only a tripwire force left in Europe- https://www.kyivpost.com/post/63332 Not much profit to be had from only a tripwire force. They only need a skeleton force required for ISR the rest will be done with proxies. that is the European and West Asian plan. That is the impression that I got. That Trump & Co want Europe to field a strong military so that it can be its proxy force for that continent. The US would provide military equipment – at marked up prices – Europe would receive satellite data from the US but more to the point would have the US calling the shots for that European military like it does in places like South Korea. Maybe too like in South Korea, that there would be a US general put in charge of these European forces. maybe too the US would order deployment of that European force to places like Asia, maybe even Taiwan. A US general is, and has always been, the military head of NATO. This is no different, in practice, from US SK command structure. Would that include in combat as well? I know that is so for South Korea. Of course. SACEUR (who also has the US “hat” of COMEUCOM) has operational command from SHAPE in Mons, BE. Dubai: the dark truth — what lies beneath the wealth and glamour? – The Standard Read to me like an indictment of many parts of the world including Dubai. It takes global partners of privilege to create that kind of system. Some multipolar exploitation going on there. Read to me like a model for this: ‘Startup City’ Groups Say They’re Meeting Trump Officials to Push for Deregulated ‘Freedom Cities’ Wired (Paul R) The author of the Dubai piece seems to agree. Her concluding paragraph: “My fear is that we, in our rotting democracies, will become like Dubai, because to value this is to value tyranny, whatever name you give it, and there’s a word for that. Decadence: always the final age of empire.” I think our would-be techno-feudal overlords have a vision. It’s Dubai, but ruled by billionaire genius philosopher-kings rather than Sultans. Guys like Trey Goff will build it for them, and useful political lackeys like those in Congress and the Trump administration will make it possible. It takes a globe full of accomplices to create such a system. The world doesn’t have a “Trump” problem. Way beyond that. That’s the overarching point. Multipolar exploitation. I can only imagine the “Freedom City’s Mengele Institute For Anti-Aging” Re: “Read to me like a model for this: ‘Startup City’ Groups Say They’re Meeting Trump Officials to Push for Deregulated ‘Freedom Cities’ Wired (Paul R)” Yeah, me too. But ‘Startup Cities’ then led me to this gem: Inside the ‘Whites Only’ Community in Arkansas https://archive.ph/PvvVD But nothing new about building on the backs of indentured servants or slaves. That’s what “freedom cities” ultimately mean by “regulations”. Don’t even get me started on what they think is “science”. I just remembered…what happened to all those private islands? Why couldn’t they start this shit on those? Oh…that’s right…a parasite needs a host An ode to the soon to be “rare” 2025 penny, see lower. Good riddance to the meddlesome $0.01, which I grant still find useful in smaller exchanges of hard cash and currency…Maybe the retailers should be permitted to either round up or either round down, or just round it off period (!) Compliments of an 1980s song from Madonna… “Only boys who save their pennies, make my rainy day” The Chain Cent was the first effort by the US Mint in 1793, and they were about the size of a half Dollar. Fitting that we’re seeing off Mr. Lincoln~ A nice example is worth the big bickies, $126k https://www.pcgs.com/coinfacts/coin/1793-1c-chain-america-bn/1341 As a young teenager I would often gather coins in “vast numbers” twice per week on a small town paper route. For a measly $0.25 one could read all the news fit to print, and at the end of the afternoon I could saunter into the Wachovia branch to exchange those coins for “dollar dollar bills y’all….” So if I sold say 100 on a good day I was doing well even if it’s small time consumer paper media so to speak… Might have found a few wheat pennies on my route too! All this in a pre-internet world. What a seemingly more simple time. Those rainy fall and winter afternoons were awful though on a two wheel delivery machine. When I was a kid “Indian Head” pennies were a thing for collecting. Same for war cents and nickles. In some local auction decades ago, I bought this big lot of soup to nuts coins that had a couple of rolls of 1943 steel Cents which had been copper-plated to look like the real thing worth around $250k each instead of a Dime, and I spent them all over LA, one at a time over about a decade. I feel certain more than a few people got really excited about their ‘find’. https://www.pcgs.com/coinfacts/coin/1944-1c-steel/82722 “Good riddance to the meddlesome $0.01…” As you probably know, Canada ditched the penny already. It’s predictable! “Oh, it costs more to make it than it’s actually worth…” Two comments: 1. I remember as a kid in the US that I really liked the Eisenhower Dollar. Kind of like what my elders said, you knew you were holding something when you had one of those in your hand. All in for universal sufferage and thought the Susan B. Anthony was a good coin, but it just wasn’t a “real” dollar to me. Paper? Pfui. 2. Experience here in Canada seems to be mostly people don’t miss the penny. The bulk of people pay with a debit or credit card, and the rounding doesn’t apply to those. Cash transactions can be amusing to sort out. Always a gamble: am I going to pay more than the actual bill, or less? Fortunately Canadians don’t seem to be disposed to yank a handgun out and start blazing away because they got “cheated” by the system. We’re told it balances out in the long run. I wonder how much longer we have to run. I also remember when I first came to Canada there was some debate over the idea of minting a $5 coin to go with our $1 (“Loonie”) and $2 (“Toonie”) coins. The biggest debate was over what to call it. “Foonie” just rang like a lead bell. Ultimately the mint deployed the cost argument, though now I guess they’d just say everybody uses a card so it’s not a thing. I talked to a presenter at the British Museum after she gave a talk in their coin gallery. Their pound coins were relatively new at the time. Having seen some pretty wretched examples in commerce during our visit, as well as the simple design, I asked her what percentage of circulating pound coins she estimated to be “homemade”. She lowered her voice and said in a “don’t tell” voice it was around 60% (!!!) I never understood why they didn’t just get rid of the nickel also. Then instead of $1.23, for the price tag would be $1.2. Just like in Hong Kong. I have a vague memory of reading someplace that having prices like (say) $2.99 instead of $3.00 makes it more difficult to pilfer (this would apply to cash transactions, not credit or debit). Can’t remember the logic behind it though. China? I cannot find official Chinese confirmation that China will pause its rare earths export permits, per an X post by Arnaud B: https://x.com/RnaudBertrand/status/1983910248416211116 – I checked and was unable to find a notice on the official Chinese govt website regarding rare earths – but did find notices on tariff rates and soy beans. Although we have Trump The Fantabulists’ words (echoed by the media), however, he has form. If so, the economic implications to high tech (and the MICC) remain. I also recall that in the prior restriction, I read a report where after several months, China was only able to process a handful of permits. I also saw nothing about Nexperia. Side note, for a 90-minute meeting, 20-30 minutes are for opening statements, 10 minutes for closing statements, so 50-70 minutes of translation-slowed discussions means equivalent to ~20 minutes of normal discussion for issues with complex details. So did they run out of time before discussing rare earths, or was it just a case of: Trump: “About those rare earths?” Xi, “不是 (Bushi) – No.” Trump: “So No Lunch or press briefing.” Xi “Yes.” Trump: “Fine, I was going to order a round of fast food burgers.” Xi “Fine: We will buy some soybeans, if you drop tarriffs.” Trump: “Ok. Ummm. Hmmmm. How’s the weather in Beijing these days?” I wouldn’t put it past Trump to lie. He has made shit up before. “24 hours to end the Ukraine war.” Part of the issue is that nothing is in writing. Both parties are free to exaggerate, charitably. Trump has changed his mind so many times and flip-flopped that these may be Schrödinger’s tariffs. “24 hours to end the war in Ukraine” is not a lie. That was, and still is, quite possible. Can you end the war in a way that keeps the Russophobes and neocon crazies happy in 24 hours? No, you cannot. But you can’t do that in the next 24 years either. So I’d argue ending it in 24 hours where everyone is unhappy is actually a great idea. Fellow Chris: I think the lie was that he would actually do it, not that it was possible. A total cutoff of aid, along with making Zelensky persona non grata the minute he started whining about ceding territory, would have likely done the trick. Too bad he lied to his base. It really is a pity he lied. I wish he had followed through with the promise. It looked like he was going to. Witkoff put Bibi in his place for a minute before Trump was even sworn in. And now… we have even more war and chaos. Once I tried to talk a snake out of shedding its skin. Never again. Or the US has more nuclear weapons, I guess he doesn’t think his base understands how to use Google; or maybe that the sycophantic media will not question if the emperor’s new clothes leave him naked. ‘Heather Johnston @HeatherJ_Israel My name is Heather Johnston, and I am the Founder and President of @USIEducation I am deeply concerned about the hate that Tucker Carlson is spreading in our country. As a supporter of the Heritage Foundation, I am asking Dr. Kevin Roberts to clarify his statement regarding Carlson. Israel is central to God’s divine purpose, and we need to know where the Heritage Foundation stands. @KevinRobertsTX’ Oh god. It’s Zionist Karen. And she’s demanding to talk to the manager of the Heritage Foundation. The tucker Carlson interview was my first real exposure to Nick Fuentes. I’m almost done, but I’ve watched most of it. I actually thought that he came off as reasonable. He’s a very good and talented speaker, maintains a good flow and poise. He’s overcome a lot which is impressive, was kicked off YouTube, was on the no fly list, was being threatened, had hundreds of people come to his home, etc After he did a debate in college, a daily wire employee asked him if he’d like to visit Israel, he said no. But the main reason that he has a bright future is that the establishment is not providing an alternative. Nobody under 40 is ever going to be passionate about Lindsey Graham or Ted Cruz or Ben Shapiro. Hey, Afro, don’t blame old people for Graham, Cruz or Shapiro! Age has nothing to do with it. Take it from an ‘over 80!’ Tucker’s Christian theology is spot on, though I wish he’d named the heresy he was talking about. Darbyism is a 19th century invention by a British Calvinist. Spread through the Scofield Bible, it’s contrary to 1.900 years of amillennial eschatology shared by Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Reformed churches. Those Catholic church leaders that at best turned a blind eye to the kiddie fiddling surely can’t have believed in the dogma of heaven or hell as a soul’s permanent location in the afterlife. Because they would had had a firm idea about which location they’d end up in. My, what pretty evangs you’ve got… I love it when they go to the good book in order to defend Israel at all costs, where history majors in a narrow vein of events in an isolated area of the orb a few thousand years ago still resonate today. Reading the Gospels, quoting Jesus, Carlson is correct! There is no ‘love thy neighbor” in the militarism of the US and its zionist spawn! That said Augustine’s “just war doctrine” is excuse for heresy! Not one bullet fired by or for US/Israel in the last 80 years is “just” murder. So says me a repenting US airman! JD Vance and Augustine: https://martycenter.org/sightings/the-problem-with-jd-vances-augustine Thank you for the linked article! I was indoctrinated in the Just War by a USAF chaplain in the run up to Desert Storm! I took him as wrong at the time. I did not find out the rite of the chaplain. At that time I did serve in the states. Augustine excused Christians to get involved in Constantine’s state sanction murder. My best feel for Augustine is the quote: “Lord, give me chastity and continence, but not yet.” That aided my re-conversion and return to the Roman Church. Repentance is key That said in my seeking who is “thy neighbor” I go to the Good Samaritan and no further. Your neighbor is Jesus you see in every one you encounter. See especially the two mainstream men who passed by the sufferer. Samaritans were outcast to observant Jews in the setting of the parable. Augustine, doctor of the church, was not a pope and thus evidently fallible. He also gave us the curious concept of Original Sin. According to Hudson Augustine changed Debt to Sin or Economics to Sexual Mores I think. Popes are fallible too. At least, that’s what Dante said, and he encountered one. Papal infallibility is a 19th century construction (and only applies to church doctrine) so all of the popes have been more fallible than not. What’s going on with Bill Krystal? Somebody may need to check on him bc earlier in the week, I think he endorsed Mamdani for mayor! Rat departing a sinking ship. If you live in NYC, there is increasing desperation from the Cuomo campaign and wealth funded surrogates. Not to mention even more anger directed at Curtis Sliwa. God forbid the actual Republican candidate stay in the race, rather than prop up the sore loser who couldn’t accept that voters didn’t agree with his delusional belief that he got to be mayor just because he wanted to restart his political career so he ran again as an independent. Look this is NY, and we now have unaccountable electronic voting machines. Cuomo could still win. But all indications are that he is losing by a significant margin. Not enough of one in my opinion, but still significant. Banks and retailers run short on pennies as the US Mint stops making them Associated Press (Kevin W). More incompetence. Australia got rid of the penny before 2002, and required retailers to round up or down to the nearest five cents. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ As you say, every other country got rid of small change pretty effortlessly… I’d guess the last time you could buy something with a lowly Lincoln would’ve been around 1980 from a gumball machine near you. The last time we ditched a denomination was in 1889 when we 86’d the Three Cent Piece, been a spell. it’s called ‘Swedish Rounding’ by the way. Time to buy boxes of nickels at face value from your local bank – the copper and nickel contained therein is worth double or more face value – to sell to refiners when it’s discontinued? I read several years ago that Kevin Bass I think, did so to the annoyance of the local Federal Reserve bank. It’s a bit tricky separating copper from nickel, is what I’ve been told. Wanna buy my 75% copper & 25% nickel Nickel ingot?

If you know the status quo before this whole shitshow started it by large parts remains inexplicable. http://Www.swentr.site is your friend. I love the Russian trolling. It’s a true mirror URL… re: Germany – Israel – critical interview This is as much of a critical perspective on Israel that you will get by an established German reporter, Michael Lüders (German category of Chris Hedges, although he was no real war correspondent and much more benign in his views.) Which on the other hand by way of looking at those attacking him tells you the level of incompetence on the region by many German establishment morons. Lüders was Middle East correspondent for Germany´s biggest weekly DIE ZEIT. ((the) time) In case you can stand YT´s automatic dubbing in English, you can listen to it (it´s less obtrusive than German dubbings). Otherwise translate the transcript that comes with it. Interview with Michael Lüders: How the West supports Israel’s attacks on seven countries “Michael Lüders studied political science and Islamic studies in Berlin and Damascus, was a Middle East correspondent for Die Zeit for many years , and is currently a member of the extended board of the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW). In this interview, he discusses his new book, “Dirty Work: Israel, America, and Imperial Megalomania,” and Israel’s wars of aggression against Iran, Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen, and Qatar. Lüders explains how Israel and the USA secure their power in the region through wars, sanctions, and regime change, why Germany supports this policy, and what the consequences of a new war against Iran would be—for the entire region and far beyond.” The interview was conducted by Michael Holmes 60 min. https://www.nachdenkseiten.de/?p=141335 German Wiki on Lüders https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_L%C3%BCders re: Poland – Michael Jabara Carley – This piece was published originally on the Strategic Culture site which is banned from NC. However Michael Jabara Carley is one of the major authorities and he has not published there since 2020 (for whatever reason.) So I hope this is no violation of any sorts! If so, my apology. – This is pre-WWII but it fits the subject, I by coincidence just reread the piece a few days ago Michael Jabara Carley, downloadable pdf “What Poland Has to Hide About the Origins of World War II” Michael Jabara Carley Université de Montréal January 2020 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338543470_What_Poland_Has_to_Hide_About_the_Origins_of_World_War_II The outlook wasn’t brilliant for an unfortunate nine that day: The score stood three to three, with but one stanza more to play, And then when all hope died at first, and the other team did the same, A pall-like silence fell upon the patrons of the game. A straggling few got up to go in deep despair. The rest Clung to the hope which springs eternal in the human breast; They thought, “If only Shohei could but get a whack at that— We’d put up even money now, with Shohei at the bat.” ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ One of the best World Series i’ve seen in a world of Sundays, final game tonight, can’t wait. It’s had everything, almost. Great defensive plays, great pitching, weird plays, firsts of all kinds, including Freddie’s second walk-off homer in the 18 inning game (“Let’s play two!”) a record for any player in any combination of World Series games in history, and Shohei’s mind-blowing performance in one of the early games. But in my opinion, it’s not really baseball anymore, with all the rule changes they’ve made in the past 10-15 years to make the games go faster. No thinking between pitches, just throw another in a hurry, all DH now, bigger bases, etc. The last big rule change before this latest flurry was to lower the mound because of Bob Gibson’s unhittable pitching and it actually seemed to make the game better, but these latest ones are making it worse. Say what you will about his otherwise lackluster hitting in this Series, Freddie is “The glue in our clubhouse” according to the last two great manager’s he’s played for. Steady Freddie, indeed — Hall of Famer first ballot no doubt. Interesting that Atlanta fell apart after their World Series win when they let him go to the Dodgers, and the Dodger’s have now won one and may win two with him on the everyday roster. I never thought I’d be a Dodger’s fan, but Freddie’s the last link to Chipper, who was the last link to Maddux, Smoltz and Glavine who were the last links to Otis Nixon’s wall-climbing “The Catch” and Sid Bream’s slide into home. When Freddie’s career is done, my days of watching baseball will likewise be over. But this has been a historic Series, no matter, and I’m on the same page with you, waiting anxiously. pre-game starts in 10 minutes, game 7 of this incredible Series starts at 7 central time. Spoiler alert but don’t check the internet or on your phone. Waking up but my brain thought it was 7:45 AM Eastern but it really is 6:45AM….roll back the clock but repeat that October victory sensation for your Los Angeles Dodgers. So… happy for Freddie Freeman but that’s about all I can muster. I do think Roberts is a good manager, particularly when I consider the near misses from Bobby Cox whilst managing the Braves some 30 years ago in their heyday. “Report: Iran rebuilding its ballistic missile program” Israel would be very keen on attacking Iran once more – with America’s help of course. Trouble is that Iran is rebuilding their stock of missiles again as they have the industrial capacity to do it. And it seems that the Russians are helping them with their aerial defenses as Iran has finally realized that it needs help here. In addition, most of the groups that Israel set up in Iran are now gone and Iran will be carefully watching countries like Azerbaijan which aided the Israelis in their attacks. They will be a much tougher nut to crack next time. For their part, resupply of Israeli aerial defense missiles are probably proceeding slowly as those missiles take some time to build each. And now they know that Iran can hit any damn place that they want to and it does not matter if they have help from countries like the US, the UK, Jordan, etc. they do not know what to do next. So unless something tips the balance radically in favour of Israel, we may have a status quo developing where Iran won’t attack Israel and Israel can’t attack Iran. Sounds good to me. IDF does not have the wherewithal to do a Curtis E LeMay (bomber Harris with B-29’s and two A bombs) on Iran, too much geography, too much hardening, some level of air defenses. US help is limited by local infrastructure and depth of magazine which is already devoted to IDF. Do we really believe air shafts in Iran are straight and B-2’s can follow them …… Or that USAF flew 14 B-2’s in the same year. Your arguments are very logical and rational, and thus, sadly, irrelevant to the Israeli religious fanatics led by an indicted criminal who goes to prison if the war ends (and incidentally hell bent on genocide – making the IDF the true marvel comic book evil that used to be reserved for WW2 Germans with black uniforms). Israel is not being resupplied by building new missiles – that is too slow, and that was before the rare earth embargo of the US MICC. – They are being resupplied from the existing stocks underlying US-China war dreams. Let them be sent, and the US is rapidly losing its fevered war dreams (in a Thucydides trap). I trust European intel sources were totally honest with CNN, and not propagandizing regarding Iran Rebuilding its missile capabilities. Actually, an honest assessment would state that Iran is building out its capacity, particularly of the newest missiles, which were not used – they used such a minimal fraction of their stocks. Definitely not the same people who have been saying Russia is running out of missiles since day one are saying the same about Iran, despite its prepping for a US-Israeli war for decades.

Honestly seems very bizarre Interesting about Dubai. I am a fan of movie composer Hans Zimmer’s concerts including one in Dubai where he talks about how much he likes it there. Each week there is another fawning article about Dubai. Beyoncé sang there; Rio Ferdinand moved there. Westerners think it is “safe”, which is laughable. The talk is in English so doubtless his appreciative audience includes those wealthy British expats. But the article suggests his just folks vox populai patter may be cloaking an ugly reality. Still he is a very good musician Various right wing media ‘personalities’ or ‘influencers’ in England have very loudly moved to Dubai, because ‘there is too much immigration in England’ and ‘England is no longer safe because of immigrants [read Muslims]. But, of course, they will be ‘expats’ there rather than immigrants and only mix with their own kind in any case. My fascination with YouTube crochet and 90s rock channels has led to some interesting commercials. There were a whole series of commercials touting Dubai as a tourist destination for families, girls trip, honeymoon… It was yet another instance of cognitive dissonance for me. I could only wonder if tourists were limited to certain areas, almost like a Disneyland version of it. IA long time ago I read this article about Dubai; your comment caused me to dig it up again because it left an impression with me. It described a cruel, empty place that is all façade and inhabited by vapid rich people without empathy. A fake Disneyland for the wealthy and a hot hell for everybody else, run by a dictator. https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/johann-hari/the-dark-side-of-dubai-1664368.html >Banks and retailers run short on pennies as the US Mint stops making them Instead of abruptly discontinuing the production of one-cent coins, the U.S. government should have continued producing them using less expensive metals. After all, the government once profited greatly from producing steel pennies. A more honest idea would be to do what all countries eventually do when debasing their currency via inflation, just chop a zero or two off so the dime or the dollar would be the new penny. Would ditch those pricey nickels too. Even better, be proactive and make it three. What really is the point of units which are so worthless that one will not purchase anything? It’s because without it, you couldn’t skim off the top with a sales tax. Or more pertinently these days, a ‘merchant fee’. At least with a sales tax, we get fire trucks and clean water. – ‘Kathy Hochul admits socialist Zohran Mamdani’s ‘tax the rich’ plan would hurt NY’s middle class: ‘I cannot do that’ – New York Post This Post article is our political system in a nutshell. Our Establishment Democrat Governor, forced to support the nominally Democratic candidate for NY Mayor (in as unenthusiastic a manner as possible), regretfully explains why she just can’t tax the rich because it would hurt the “middle class.” The right-wing Post pretends to champion the “middle class” while accusing Hochul of pandering to the “radical left.” All those people chanting at Mamdani rallies or potentially voting for him in an election apparently don’t exist; at least they don’t count in the Post’s political world. I guess it is good, though, that at least everyone is so concerned about the welfare of the “middle class.” I’d better read that Daily Mail article next so I can really know what’s going on.

Only been to Chipotle twice and both times got a mild case of food poisoning. Plus it’s kind of expensive for what it is – a slightly fancier Taco Bell but still fast food. I don’t think more “digital experiences” and dollar sauce options are going to fix what’s wrong there. The kids don’t have money for garbage food. The third time I went to Chipotle I got food poisoning so severe I was hospitalized for 7 days followed by 7 days of recovery at home where I was incredibly weak. I will not step a foot into a Chipotle again. A good many stand alone ‘Meskin eateries here, especially so in the towns that are almost all Hispanic (read Mexican) in population, and I’m looking at you Farmersville, Ivanhoe and Woodlake. All the field workers are Mexican, so the food is authentic and tasty. The true test of a restaurant is their chile relleno… Why go to Chipotle? Absolutely the test is how good are their chile rellenos. I always order that. When it’s good it’s wonderful. My restaurant test for first time eating is red chili. If they ace that, we will return. Also, Yuma AZ has some great authentic Mexican restaurants. Why go? For the ugly, dystopian decor that looks like the set from a sequel to “Aliens”? For the seating so hard and uncomfortable that you are left with sciatic nerve pain for the rest of the day if you sit for more than five minutes? For the beef and chicken rendered so inedibly tough that it should have a warning label and come with a side of dental floss? Yes, I always try the relleno but for me the true test is fresh home made tortillas. They are really hard to find but nothing better. since only really fancy places like Mi Tierra in san antone make Mole, anymores, Tam’s Test Dish was always carne guisada. my test in all eateries is to first observe the back door and the dumpster area(if theres cats, thats good), then upon entering thru the front, take a deep whif of the air(sour smelling oil=bad), then immediately wander to the loo, and endeavor to get a peek into the kitchen(clean-ish(i understand the demands) but more importantly, happy people in there who are having a good time) save for chinese food, i prefer mom and pops. for chinese, i prefer corporate….esp panda express. due to a lack of cats and stray dogs in the neighborhood of this place we went to in san angelo. (amfortas winks) (there are exceptions to this moratorium on mom and pop chinese joints, of course…Mencius, there on medical drive, there in san antonio is excellent…they even let me into the kitchen, under the “this chef wants to see how the pros do a certain thing”. any place that shows such professional courtesy is a good place, generally, in my experience.) Before I quit the Twitter, I’d see occasionally retweets of people complaining about the prices at Chipotle, so their struggles isn’t really news. I was taken once as part of a corporate informal lunch 10 years ago. Not sure what the fuss is about. I never went back, and it was overpriced in 2014. Here are the owners of Chipolte: https://brandsownedby.com/who-owns-chipotle/ Never was a big fan. I would only do take out the times that I used to go. I needed to take it home and add some seasoning and to make it hot. Adding that extra heat could have been what saved me from these scary food poisoning incidents. Only been to Chipotle twice and both times got a mild case of food poisoning. …Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice… Well, you can’t fool me twice… W.

Kathy Hochul admits socialist Zohran Mamdani’s ‘tax the rich’ plan would hurt NY’s middle class: ‘I cannot do that’ – New York Post “I’m concerned about outmigration of people who are the ones who are supporting our budget,” Hochul said on the “Raging Moderates” podcast Tuesday about the top 1.5% of earners fleeing if she raised their taxes like Mamdani wants.” She claims NY has a middle class, but says the top 1.5% of New Yorker’s are supporting the budget. The Vampire State is incredibly agressive about income tax. Anybody without dependent kids, or unable to access one of the enormously long list of exemptions for special interests and cronies, has to pay on even the most limited income. They must also have a huge staff at the tax department since they recently audited my middle class income returns going back at least TEN years, and came up with demands for taxes, interest and penalties. I would have to see some real figures on that, both raw data amount and the percentage of income paid in taxes compared to those who aren’t in the top 1.5% .

Many many of those banks were consolidated with buyouts into larger banking entities at the direction of the FDIC. If one wanted to further consolidate the banking sector and reduce the number of community and small regional banks, this is one way to do that, imo. It’s never the smaller banks that get bailed out. The smaller banks get eaten. And an aside about the private credit crisis that’s looming: The big banks beginning after the GFC essentially stopped loaning to small businesses, that created the environment for the expansion of existing and creation of new private credit outfits. Small businesses still needed operating capital loans, and when their longtime big bank stopped lending even though the small business owner had never missed a payment or been a problem, they naturally turned to local private credit outfits. If there’s a problem now in the private credit market, it’s a crisis the big banks created, imo.

Market caps are more of an estimated lifetime value while GDPs are yearly stats … at least to this non-finance guy. Sure, it’s apples and oranges; but it’s a convenient way to put these absurd numbers into context. What else are you going to use? Count the sand on the beach? I would like to see a simple, easily understood metric used. Let us consider a mature P/E ratio as Nvidia ages to a mature company, free of hype. Assuming Nvidia achieves a P/E ratio of 10:1 as it (or the sum of pieces it may split into) ages, then Nvidia (or sum of pieces) would need to earn $512 billion per year. Someone buying Nvida would then see earnings of about 10% of original share purchase price. Alphabet (Google) reported earnings of $100.12 billion in the year ending Dec 31, 2024. Nvidia at 5x Google’s yearly earnings seems like a very tall order as this level of annual earnings would be bound to attract competition from other semiconductor firms. And Google’s earnings report might be more solid from an accounting standpoint. >Euro-homeless, time to hit the trash heaps?

Banning rare earth exports is also disadvantageous for China. Yes, there’s a crisis now, but they’ll resolve the situation the same way they did with gas. Back then, they also wrote that there was nothing to replace Russian gas and that Europe was doomed, industry would grind to a halt, and the population would freeze. Propaganda, that’s just propaganda. It has nothing to do with analysis. Monster_Fat +4 Today, 08: 52 Yes, yes, all the “Euro-homeless” will soon run for the dumps, just as they have been freezing for several years now, without Russian gas, undernourished without Russian wheat, sitting in the dark without Russian electricity, without paper due to the lack of Russian timber supplies, without metal products, having switched to stone tools since they no longer buy metals from Russia, and without plastic products, oils and other chemicals since they no longer have Russian oil…. The end of the EU is coming… true, this is not certain and only in the Russian media, but oh well… It’s surprising that Russians are skeptical rather than welcoming the decline of the EU. It’s not the end just a lot more money going to middle men. And of course trickling up to more ‘important people’. Chipotle stock craters as company says young people without jobs can’t afford their food anymore. I suggest the company hire Luigi Mangione as the company spokesperson, in the manner of Colonel Sanders or Ricardo Montalbán. The guy has tremendous star power in his own right, and could help position Chipotle as a defender of the poor and downtrodden instead of a ruthless up-charging corporate monster. There will be no charge for this idea. re: bird flu The zoo in Swiss Bern developed a vaccine against bird flu and presented it early this year. However the vaccine although working well was rejected in the EU for alleged safety concerns. I suspect lobbying – both by Pharma and food industry – have achieved here a twisted, genuinely Pyrrhic victory. European poultry industry is huge ($56B), followed by pork ($43B), then beef ($26B) annually. Imagine someone introduces a simple and easy to do solution for this bird flu problem that people could apply without a huge pharma company behind it. DIY-basis.

Then, Monday's announcement of a $38 billion deal between OpenAI and AWS eased concerns about Amazon's biggest vulnerability. Wall Street is impressed — Amazon shares hit record highs on Friday and popped another 5% on Monday's news. Still, questions remain about CEO Andy Jassy's big push to get Amazon back to startup mode while competing in the AI game. "Amazon isn't perfect, and we are seeing increasing urgency in defending their cloud leadership position and reclaiming some of the unique culture," Baird's senior analyst Colin Sebastian told Business Insider. "Jassy's strategy is proving successful, even if there are still some wrinkles to work out." Inside Business is today's must-read story on what the forces shaping business, tech, and innovation mean for you. Each piece delivers insights to help you make smarter career, money, and life decisions. Tuesday's layoffs fueled concerns about Amazon's AI prowess, sparking questions over whether the cuts reflected slowing growth or if efficiency gains were paying off. The company said it was a preemptive move that makes it "leaner." Even before the layoffs, Amazon was contending with a widening perception that it was trailing in AI, with a top Wall Street analyst calling it an "AI laggard." On top of that, Amazon's yearlong push to streamline its culture and cut bureaucracy had yet to deliver stronger shareholder returns. Jassy has cut the manager-to-employee ratio by 15% this year as part of a broader push to instill discipline and reshape Amazon's culture. Until earlier this week, it was the only one of the seven largest tech firms to underperform the broader market over the past five years. Investors were especially worried about Amazon Web Services' slow growth, the company's high-margin cloud unit. Though it maintains a far larger revenue base, AWS' growth has lagged behind competitors such as Microsoft and Google. "AWS revenue growth acceleration is a must," CFRA wrote in a research note last week. The company's third-quarter earnings and a deal with OpenAI put those concerns to rest. AWS's infrastructure will help "run and scale OpenAI's core artificial intelligence (AI) workloads starting immediately," the Monday announcement said, adding that the partnership "will have continued growth over the next seven years." In addition, Thursday's earnings report topped expectations, and it raised its capital spending forecast amid surging demand. AWS reported $33 billion in sales, a 20% increase, its fastest growth since 2022. The company also made a number of disclosures that showcased its progress in AI, including: Wall Street loved what it saw. "The AWS unlock is here," wrote Evercore's Mark Mahaney. Financial firm William Blair called it "a key step in reclaiming the narrative," while Barclays wrote in a note that "the past 48 hours have gone a long way to dispelling concerns." "AWS is gaining momentum," Jassy said during Thursday's earnings call. Still, skepticism remains. AWS may have pioneered the cloud, but the rise of AI is reshaping the landscape and giving rivals fresh ways to compete. Some of its flagship AI products have failed to gain much traction. And it didn't help that Jassy sidestepped an analyst's question on Thursday to specify how much of AWS' growth came from AI versus its core infrastructure business. DA Davidson's Gil Luria, who remains bullish on Amazon, told Business Insider that AWS still hasn't matched Microsoft or Google Cloud's lead in AI mindshare, and has plenty of catching up to do. "Amazon has been the slowest of the three hyperscalers in commercializing AI," Luria said. There's also uncertainty about whether the layoffs are over. Jassy said Thursday that the latest cuts weren't driven by cost pressures or AI, but by cultural alignment, implying the shake-up isn't done. "It's important to be lean, it's important to be flat, and it's important to move fast, and that's what we're going to do," Jassy said. Have a tip?

Title: CEO Andy Jassy says Amazon’s 14,000 layoffs weren’t about cutting costs or AI taking jobs: ‘It’s culture’

Role: ReporterMarco Quiroz-Gutierrez is a reporter for Fortune covering general business news. Amazon’s CEO has finally spoken up about the company’s 14,000 layoffs earlier this week, and he claims the motive was not at all financial. Speaking during the company’s quarterly earnings call Thursday, CEO Andy Jassy said laying off those employees was about a mismatched cultural fit—and nothing else. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it’s not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” he said about the job cuts. “It’s culture.” The job cuts this week, which mostly affected middle managers, follow a June memo in which Jassy said Amazon will need fewer employees thanks to the “efficiency gains” brought on by AI. In a separate memo announcing this week’s layoffs, Amazon’s senior vice president of people said the layoffs were about adapting to “transformative technology.” Jassy also mentioned Amazon’s business has grown over the past few years. The company has about 1.55 million total employees, with 350,000 corporate employees alone. As of December 2019, prior to the pandemic, the company had 798,000 total employees, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. “If you grow as fast as we did for several years, the size of businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you’re in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers,” he said. This type of growth can lead to consequences, Jassy added. “Sometimes without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work and who own most of the two-way-door decisions, the ones that should be made quickly and right at the front line,” he said. A spokesperson for Amazon declined to comment. Amazon joins other companies such as Salesforce, Target, and Paramount who have together laid off thousands of workers in the past few months. Several large companies have cited AI as a reason for hiring pauses or layoffs recently, said Fed Chair Jerome Powell this week, adding that the Fed is “watching that very carefully.” To be sure, a study of Goldman Sachs investment bankers this week found only 11% of their corporate clients were actively laying people off owing to AI. In contrast, about a third of companies in the technology, media, and telecommunications category are reducing headcount because of AI. During the quarterly earnings call, Jassy seemed to echo the sentiment, saying the “technological transformation” currently underway means companies need to be nimble and adaptable. “It’s important to be lean, it’s important to be flat, and it’s important to move fast,” he said. “That’s what we’re going to do.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: The job market may be sinking. Why you should beware of buyouts.
URL: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/11/01/layoffs-buyouts-job-market-employment/86984517007/
Time Published: 2025-11-01T09:01:35Z

You’ve been offered a buyout. Your employer wants to pay you to quit. It’s a big chunk of change. But leaving your job now would mean searching for a new one in a weakening job market. Should you accept the offer? Companies offer buyouts to thin the ranks, spending money in the short term to save money in the long run. Employers often leverage buyouts to avoid layoffs in a shaky economy. And that thought, alone, should give you pause. The Trump administration offered buyouts to the entire federal workforce this year, aiming to reduce it by as much as 10%. Roughly 75,000 workers accepted. More recently, Amazon, UPS and Target all announced private-sector layoffs. Buyouts can sound tempting. A five-figure severance package might be the most money a worker has ever seen in one paycheck. But it’s also the last paycheck your employer will give you. “It’s like lottery winners. Some people think the money lasts longer than it does,” said Donna Walton, wealth strategist at TD Wealth. If you are mulling a buyout, some considerations are universal: How large is the severance package? Am I close to retirement? Did I want to leave that job anyway? But the current economic climate presents its own challenges. Employers added only 22,000 jobs in August, according to the latest federal report. Unemployment ticked up to 4.3%, its highest level since October 2021. Nearly 2 million Americans have been out of work for six months or longer, the Labor Department reported in May, the largest number in more than two years. Companies are doing less hiring out of uncertainty about President Trump’s tariffs. Artificial intelligence is swiping jobs from new graduates. Recession fears loom. “It is a very soft job market,” said Michele Evermore, a senior fellow at the National Academy of Social Insurance, and a former Labor Department official in the Biden Administration, speaking to USA TODAY earlier this year. “It’s such a period of economic uncertainty, I think people are hanging onto their jobs.” Here are five tips for employees who are thinking about taking buyouts in 2025. Let’s start with a proactive step. Maybe your employer hasn’t offered a buyout. But you’re restless to make a change, and you’ve heard your company wants to cut costs. Consider approaching your managers and asking for a buyout. In many cases, there’s nothing to stop an employer from creating a voluntary severance package just for you. “You do see these things happen, particularly if there’s news that a company is planning on downsizing,” said Michael Scarpati, CEO of RetireUS, a financial wellness platform. “It’s kind of a win-win for both parties.” If you’re the first to ask for a buyout, you may get a better severance package than the one your employer eventually offers everyone else. But don’t ask for a buyout if you aren’t ready to take one. “You have to be willing to leave if they do offer it to you,” Walton said. “It’s not something you want to bluff about.” A typical buyout might offer four weeks of pay, plus another week for every year you’ve worked at the company. You might get extra health insurance coverage, even help in finding a new job. Roughly half of workers accept buyout offers without negotiating, AARP reports. But it can’t hurt to ask for better terms. “Think of it as if you’re going in for a job interview,” Scarpati said. You could ask for a full year of severance pay, rather than a few months. Perhaps your employer will cover the costs of health insurance while you look for a new job. Some workers hire attorneys to negotiate buyouts, said David John, a senior strategic policy adviser at the AARP Public Policy Institute. That might sound extreme, but remember: A buyout is a business proposition. The contracts can be complicated, sometimes including non-disclosure agreements or non-compete clauses. Even if you don’t bring a lawyer to a buyout negotiation, Walton said, “you should at least meet with one.” Unless you’re planning to retire, experts say, you should gauge your chances of finding another job before you leave your current job. If you work in a shrinking field, or in an economically afflicted region, you may already know it. “It’s a pretty different thing to take a buyout in D.C. if you work in a thinktank, or to take a buyout if you work on an oil rig in South Dakota,” Evermore said. Look at Labor Department jobs reports, Evermore said, to find out how many people are applying for unemployment insurance in your area, and how many are lingering on the benefit rolls. Better still: Apply for some jobs. See if you get bites. If not, that might be a good sign a buyout isn’t for you. In the best-case scenario, you can line up a new job before you take the buyout. Many employers offer buyouts to avoid layoffs, or at least to delay them. If you have a buyout offer, weigh the odds that the company will resort to layoffs once the buyouts are past. “A responsible company will address those worries right off the bat, and say yes or no,” said John of AARP. If layoffs are likely, think about whether you might land on a layoff list. Ask your manager if you are vulnerable. If your company has endured layoffs in the past, look at the severance packages those workers received. In some cases, Walton said, a buyout package might be “the same thing your company offers you if it lays you off six months from now.” Many federal workers who took buyouts from the Trump administration had only weeks to decide. That’s not nearly long enough, experts say. “Asking someone to make a major life decision that may involve relocating your whole family, you should get at least a few months for that,” Evermore said. Ideally, Scarpati said, six weeks is a “minimum” timeframe for a buyout offer. Ninety days is more reasonable. Use that time to “think about where you’re at in your career,” Evermore said. Talk to friends, colleagues and loved ones about your options. Test the job market. Ask yourself if you’re ready to uproot your household and move across the country. And run the numbers. If you are mid-career, do you have enough emergency savings to survive a period of joblessness? How would you cover health insurance? How generous are the unemployment benefits in your state? If you are near retirement: When were you planning to take Social Security? How would you cover health insurance until Medicare kicks in? Do you have enough retirement savings? Consider meeting with a financial planner. “Ideally,” Walton said, “have this financial plan done before any of this happens.”

Title: U.S. Health Insurers Face Headwinds as Q3 Earnings Reveal Mounting Cost Pressures

Time Published: 2025-11-01T09:01:14Z
Full Content:
U.S. health insurers experienced a challenging third quarter, reporting increased medical costs and significant policy-related pressures, which led to a notable decline in share prices across the sector. U.S. health insurance companies encountered substantial financial headwinds in the third quarter, reporting results marked by escalating medical costs and the looming impact of legislative changes. The sector's performance lagged the broader market, with several major players experiencing significant stock price depreciation. The third-quarter earnings season, which commenced on October 21, unveiled a consistent theme of increased cost pressures across the health insurance industry. A primary driver of these rising expenses has been the government-subsidized Medicaid and Medicare Advantage plans, where UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH), the nation's largest insurer, specifically highlighted heightened acuity levels among its Medicaid enrollees following the resumption of state-led procedural disenrollment in March 2023. Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC) reported a substantial $6.6 billion third-quarter loss, a stark contrast to its $713 million profit in the same period last year. This loss was largely attributed to escalating healthcare costs and a $6.7 billion non-cash goodwill impairment. The impairment was a consequence of a sustained decline in Centene's stock price throughout 2025 and the anticipated financial repercussions of the "One Big Beautiful Bill," which forecasts $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies over the next decade. Centene's health benefits ratio (HBR), the proportion of premiums spent on medical care, climbed to 92.7%, up from 89.2% a year prior, underscoring the rising cost burden. Market reactions to these results were swift and negative. Since October 20, Elevance Health Inc. (ELV) shares fell 9.1%, UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) declined 5.4%, and The Cigna Group (CI) dropped 19.5%. The most pronounced decrease among major managed care insurers was recorded by Molina Healthcare, Inc. (MOH), which saw its stock price decrease by 23.5%. These declines surpassed those of the broader market, with the S&P 500 falling 2.47% and the S&P Insurance Index decreasing 2.15% over the same period. The adverse market reaction reflects investor concerns over several interconnected factors. Primarily, the rising medical expense ratios indicate a squeeze on profitability, particularly as insurers grapple with sicker patient populations in government-funded programs. The "One Big Beautiful Bill" has introduced significant political uncertainty and financial risk, with projections suggesting it could eliminate health coverage for nearly 12 million Americans. This directly impacts insurers like Centene, which manage Medicaid plans for over 12 million low-income individuals. Furthermore, issues are not confined solely to Medicaid. UnitedHealth also noted the expected impact of changes within the ACA markets. The company anticipates that rate increases exceeding 25% and targeted service area reductions could lead to a decrease of approximately two-thirds in its Obamacare customer base, potentially forcing over one million enrollees to seek alternative coverage. These aggressive actions, while aimed at improving margins in the employer and individual segment by 2026, suggest ongoing struggles to achieve targeted profitability levels. The sector's performance in the third quarter highlights a challenging operating environment exacerbated by both fundamental cost pressures and a shifting regulatory landscape. The substantial goodwill impairment reported by Centene underscores the market's re-evaluation of long-term prospects in light of evolving healthcare policy. The company's valuation review specifically cited the expected financial impact of the "One Big Beautiful Bill" as a key factor. The broader market implications are significant. As insurers face increased costs and legislative changes that could reduce their customer base and subsidies, the sustainability of current business models, particularly within government-sponsored programs, comes into question. The aggressive rate hikes by UnitedHealthcare in the ACA marketplace indicate an industry-wide effort to adapt to these new realities, potentially at the expense of market share. While specific analyst quotes were not provided in the briefing, the collective sentiment from company executives and market movements suggests a cautious outlook. UnitedHealthcare chief executive Tim Noel indicated that the company's submitted rate filings reflect the 2025 morbidity and experience, including average rate increases of over 25%, as a necessary measure to improve margins. The acknowledgment that these margins are still projected to remain below the targeted 7–9% range for 2026 further underscores the persistent challenges. Investors will closely monitor several key factors in the coming quarters. The full implementation and impact of the "One Big Beautiful Bill" and its projected cuts to Medicaid and ACA subsidies will be a critical determinant for sector profitability. The ability of insurers to manage medical costs effectively, particularly within Medicaid and Medicare Advantage, will remain paramount. Furthermore, the strategies employed by major players like UnitedHealthcare to navigate the ACA landscape, including the potential for significant enrollee shifts, will provide insights into the sector's adaptability. The interplay of legislative policy, evolving patient demographics, and cost containment efforts will define the trajectory for U.S. health insurers in the near to medium term. ## Strive Outlines Preferred Stock Offering for Bitcoin Treasury Expansion U.S. equities saw a notable event on Monday, with **Strive Inc. (NASDAQ: ASST)** announcing plans for an initial public offering (IPO) of a new class of preferred shares. The proposed offering aims to raise capital primarily for the acquisition of additional **Bitcoin (BTC)**, marking a strategic move to expand the company's digital asset treasury. This development closely mirrors previous capital-raising efforts by firms like **Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR)**. ## Details of the Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock **Strive** intends to offer 1,250,000 shares of its **Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock**, designated as **SATA Stock**. Each **SATA** share will carry a stated amount of $100 and is designed to provide an initial annual dividend rate of 12.00%. These cumulative dividends are slated to be payable monthly in arrears, commencing on December 15, 2025. To underpin these dividend commitments, **Strive** plans to establish a dividend reserve amounting to $12.00 per share of **SATA Stock**, sufficient to cover the first 12 months of dividend payments at the initial rate. While **Strive** reserves the right to adjust the monthly regular dividend rate, its stated intention is to manage the rate to maintain the **SATA Stock** within a long-term trading range of $95 to $105 per share. The net proceeds from this offering are earmarked for general corporate purposes. The primary objective is the acquisition of **Bitcoin** and **Bitcoin**-related products. Funds may also be allocated for working capital, the purchase of income-generating assets, other capital expenditures, repurchases of the company's Class A common stock, and/or repayment of debt. As of October 27, 2025, **Strive** holds approximately 5,957.9 **Bitcoins**, valued at roughly $637 million. This figure could increase significantly, potentially to around 11,000 **Bitcoins**, should the company finalize its all-stock merger with **Semler Scientific (NASDAQ: SMLR)**. ## Market Context and Strategic Rationale The decision to issue preferred stock comes as **Strive's (ASST)** common stock has experienced considerable volatility. Following a recent SPAC deal and its pivot to a **Bitcoin**-focused asset manager, **ASST** shares have been trading at a discount to the underlying value of its **Bitcoin** holdings, reflected in a market value per share below the net asset value (mNAV below 1). In such a scenario, issuing additional common stock for **Bitcoin** purchases would be highly dilutive to existing shareholders. The preferred stock offering provides a non-dilutive capital-raising mechanism, allowing **Strive** to expand its **Bitcoin** treasury without further impacting common shareholder equity. On Monday, **ASST** shares declined by 2.3%, coinciding with a 4% slide in the price of **Bitcoin** to approximately $106,000. This reaction indicates that while the long-term strategy may be perceived positively, immediate market sentiment remains cautious, especially in a downward-trending **Bitcoin** environment. ## Precedent Set by Strategy's Diversified Capital Strategy **Strive's** approach draws a direct parallel to the capital-raising strategies employed by **Strategy Inc. (formerly MicroStrategy)**. **Strategy**, a pioneer in the corporate **Bitcoin** treasury model, has successfully utilized a mix of equity and various preferred stock offerings to finance its substantial **Bitcoin** acquisitions. For instance, **Strategy** has offered different classes of preferred shares, such as **STRK** (convertible with an 8% non-cumulative dividend), **STRF** (non-convertible with a 10% cumulative dividend), and **STRD** (non-convertible with a 10% non-cumulative dividend, featuring a higher risk-reward profile). These diverse instruments allow **Strategy** to appeal to different investor segments and broaden its access to capital for **Bitcoin** purchases. **Strategy's** expanded "42/42" capital raise plan, aiming for $84 billion through equity and convertible notes by 2027, underscores the scale and sophistication of such treasury strategies. The issuance of dividend-paying preferred stock linked to digital assets presents both opportunities and risks. For investors, it offers a potentially attractive income stream tied to the performance and accumulation strategy of a **Bitcoin** treasury company. However, the success of such an instrument is intrinsically linked to the stability and growth of **Bitcoin's** value, as well as the company's ability to sustain elevated dividend rates. Key risks include the potential for sustained cash dividends to underperform if trading or asset returns are weak, and the impact on liquidity from monthly cash obligations, particularly if dividends are compounded due to missed payments. ## Outlook and Key Considerations Looking ahead, the successful execution of **Strive's SATA** offering and its subsequent deployment of capital into **Bitcoin** will be closely monitored. The company's ability to maintain the **SATA Stock** price within its targeted range of $95-$105 per share through dividend rate adjustments will be a crucial indicator of investor confidence in the preferred shares. Investors will also be watching for developments in **Strive's** proposed merger with **Semler Scientific**, which could significantly augment its **Bitcoin** holdings. The broader market will continue to assess the viability and risks associated with "digital asset treasury" stocks. The performance of **Bitcoin** itself remains a fundamental driver for companies like **Strive** and **Strategy**. Upcoming economic reports, interest rate policy decisions, and overall sentiment in the cryptocurrency market will all play a role in shaping the trajectory of these specialized investment vehicles. ## PSEG Exceeds Q3 2025 Earnings Expectations, Narrows Guidance **Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG)** (**PEG**) announced strong financial results for the third quarter of 2025, reporting a net income of $1.24 per share, a significant increase from $1.04 per share in Q3 2024. This performance surpassed market expectations, which had forecasted an earnings per share (EPS) of $1.03. The company's non-GAAP operating earnings also saw a notable rise, reaching $1.13 per share for Q3 2025, compared to $0.90 per share in the prior year period. This growth was primarily attributed to the implementation of new electric and gas base distribution rates, effective October 2024, and enhanced returns on capital investments. Following these results, **PSEG** has narrowed its full-year 2025 non-GAAP operating earnings guidance to the upper half of its previously stated range, now projecting $4.00 to $4.06 per share, an adjustment from the earlier $3.94 to $4.06 per share. ## Detailed Financial Performance and Capital Investments For the third quarter of 2025, **PSEG**'s net income stood at $622 million, compared to $520 million in Q3 2024. The corresponding non-GAAP operating earnings were $565 million. The substantial improvement reflects the full impact of the October 2024 rate case settlement and higher power pricing. The utility segment, **PSE&G**, specifically reported a net income of $515 million for Q3 2025, up from $379 million in Q3 2024. In terms of capital deployment, **PSEG** invested approximately $1 billion in regulated projects during Q3 2025, contributing to a total of $2.7 billion for the first nine months of the year. This aligns with its ambitious $3.8 billion full-year regulated capital plan. The company also reaffirmed its robust Five-Year Capital Investment Outlook, projecting expenditures between $22.5 billion and $26 billion for the period of 2025 through 2029, a plan that is expected to be executed without the need for new equity issuance or asset sales. ## Strategic Growth Drivers: Data Centers and Nuclear Energy A significant driver of **PSEG**'s strategic outlook is the accelerating demand from data centers and edge computing. The company reported a substantial increase in data center load pipeline inquiries, which have risen to 11.5 gigawatts, with nearly all of this demand attributed to data center requirements. Mature data center applications within **PSEG**'s service territory also grew from 2,600 megawatts to 2,800 megawatts, indicating ongoing incremental activity. Management highlighted the ongoing legislative and regulatory processes in New Jersey, particularly concerning generation adequacy, with load growth from data center projects emerging as a central business driver. **PSEG** is actively collaborating with policymakers to address resource adequacy, including supporting proposed legislation aimed at promoting competition for new in-state generation. Furthermore, the company detailed initiatives targeting operational improvements and capacity growth within its nuclear fleet, including a recent transition in **Hope Creek**'s nuclear refueling cycle and ongoing upgrades at **Salem**. These strategic focuses underpin **PSEG**'s reaffirmed long-term non-GAAP EPS growth target of 5%-7% compound annual growth through 2029, supported by its significant capital spending program and the nuclear Production Tax Credit (PTC) environment. ## Market Reaction and Broader Implications The strong Q3 2025 earnings and positive outlook for **PSEG** have generated a bullish sentiment around the company's stock. The results underscore the positive impact of regulated rate adjustments and strategic investments in critical infrastructure. For investors, **PSEG**'s performance signals the potential for stable returns within the utility sector, particularly as demand for reliable and robust power infrastructure grows to support energy-intensive industries like data centers. **PSEG**'s proactive engagement with policymakers to balance affordability and reliability, coupled with its substantial capital expenditure plan, positions it favorably within a sector facing increasing demands and evolving regulatory landscapes. The emphasis on nuclear power also highlights a broader industry trend towards diverse and carbon-free energy sources. ## Outlook and Key Factors to Monitor Looking ahead, **PSEG**'s reaffirmed long-term EPS growth target of 5%-7% through 2029 remains a key indicator for future performance. Investors will closely monitor the company's ability to execute its ambitious $22.5 billion to $26 billion capital investment plan effectively and without the need for additional equity. The trajectory of data center load growth and **PSEG**'s capacity to meet this escalating demand will be crucial for sustaining its growth momentum. Continued legislative and regulatory developments in New Jersey regarding generation adequacy will also be critical, particularly as the region grapples with a supply-demand imbalance that could impact reliability and affordability. **PSEG**'s efforts to contract its nuclear output under multi-year agreements and pursue additional utility investments to address growing customer demand will be important factors to watch in the coming quarters. ## The $6.5 Billion Investment in Detail **Apollo**-managed funds have reached an agreement to commit $6.5 billion for a 50% ownership stake in **Ørsted**'s **Hornsea 3** offshore wind project, located in the UK. This substantial investment includes both the acquisition price for the joint venture interest and a commitment to fund 50% of the project's remaining construction costs. The agreement stipulates an initial investment of approximately $3.25 billion by **Apollo** upon closing, with the remaining $3.25 billion to be funded as the project achieves specific construction and development milestones in the coming years. **Hornsea 3** is positioned as the world's largest offshore wind project, boasting a generating capacity of 2.9 gigawatts (GW). Upon completion, this capacity will be sufficient to provide low-cost, renewable electricity to more than 3 million UK households. Under the terms of the agreement, **Ørsted** will maintain its role in constructing the wind farm through a full-scope Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contract. Furthermore, **Ørsted** will provide long-term operations and maintenance services, as well as managing the route-to-market for power generation. The senior financing for the project is being led by **Apollo**-managed entities, with banking facilities underwritten by a consortium of institutions including **BNP Paribas**, **ING Bank**, **Lloyds**, and **RBC Capital Markets**. Co-investors in the project include **La Caisse** (formerly **CDPQ**) and **PSP Investments**. The transaction remains subject to regulatory approvals and is projected to finalize before the close of 2025. ## Market Implications and Renewable Energy Expansion The commitment by **Apollo** to **Hornsea 3** signals strong investor confidence in large-scale **offshore wind** projects and the broader **renewable energy** sector. This investment provides crucial capital for a significant clean energy infrastructure project in the UK, a nation with ambitious decarbonization targets. For **Ørsted**, the partnership with **Apollo** enables it to de-risk its capital expenditure while retaining expertise in project development and operation. The influx of institutional capital into such substantial projects is indicative of the increasing financial viability and attractiveness of **renewable energy** assets for long-term investors seeking stable returns. The project's scale and its capacity to power millions of homes underscore its importance for UK **energy security** and its contribution to reducing carbon emissions. This move aligns with global trends of transitioning away from fossil fuels, where **offshore wind** is emerging as a critical component of national energy strategies. ## Broader Context: Apollo's Strategic Growth and Sector Trends This $6.5 billion investment is consistent with **Apollo Global Management, Inc.**'s (NYSE: **APO**) strategic focus on deploying capital into infrastructure and long-duration assets. The firm's second-quarter 2025 financial results reported on August 5, 2025, demonstrated robust growth, with total **Assets Under Management (AUM)** increasing by 21% year-over-year to $840 billion. **Fee-Generating AUM** also grew by 22% to $638 billion, driven by $61 billion in inflows during the quarter. This financial strength and capital-raising capability position **Apollo** to undertake significant investments like **Hornsea 3**. The firm's **Fee Related Earnings (FRE)** reached a record $627 million, a 21.5% increase year-over-year, complemented by **Spread Related Earnings (SRE)** of $821 million, totaling $1.4 billion for the quarter. These figures highlight **Apollo**'s capacity to execute complex, large-scale transactions and its diversified business model. From a broader market perspective, the **offshore wind** sector is attracting substantial investment due to its scalability, technological advancements, and supportive government policies. The UK, in particular, has been a leader in developing **offshore wind** capacity, making projects like **Hornsea 3** attractive to global investors seeking exposure to the energy transition. ## Industry Perspectives and Future Outlook Market analysts generally view **Apollo**'s investment in **Hornsea 3** as a positive development for both firms and the wider **renewable energy** infrastructure market. The partnership between a leading asset manager and a prominent **offshore wind** developer is expected to serve as a template for future large-scale **renewable energy** financing. The involvement of a diverse group of major banks and co-investors further validates the financial robustness and investment-grade nature of such projects. Looking ahead, the successful execution of **Hornsea 3** will likely encourage further institutional capital deployment into **offshore wind** and other **renewable energy** technologies. Investors will be closely watching the project's progress, regulatory approvals, and its eventual contribution to the UK's energy grid. This transaction reinforces the growing trend of private capital playing a pivotal role in accelerating the global **energy transition**, with a focus on delivering both environmental benefits and attractive long-term financial returns.

Title: The AI-Driven Stock Runup May Not Be As Good As Many Assume

ByErik Sherman, Senior Contributor. The witching hour. Is this about All Hallow’s Eve? No, it’s about tech companies — AI-focused in particular. Promise, hype, and intra-sector cross-investment has created an interesting dynamic of economic concentration and risk. By no means is this to say that tech companies and their stocks are bad. It also isn’t to say they will be good at all times and past performance is a guarantee of future returns. Technology stocks have shown strong returns, as they have in 2023 and 2024, according to U.S. Bank. The information technology sector gained 23% year-to-date on October 21, 2025. The tech-focused communication services sector gained 25%. In contrast, the S&P 500 increased by 15% and the return for the Nasdaq composite was 19%. More specifically, the so-called Magnificent Seven — Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla — comprise 36.6% of the S&P 500 as of October 2025, up from 12.3% in 2015, according to The Motley Fool. In year-to-date performance, the Magnificent Seven had returns of 18.6% compared to 14.5% of the S&P 500. A big reason is due to artificial intelligence growth. Stanford University’s Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence group calculated that corporate AI investment reached $252.3 billion in 2024. Year-over-year private investment was up 44.5% and mergers and acquisitions, up 12.1%. The current AI and tech success, though, creates some structural issues. “The S&P 500 is built on a ‘survivor bias’ basis, with companies having the most success making up the largest weightings,” Vince Stanzione, former currency trader and CEO of financial publisher First Information, says. The higher the market capitalization of the company, the higher its standing in the S&P 500. Stanzione compared two S&P 500-related exchange-traded funds: the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight EFT (RSP) and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY). “If you compare the equal-weighted RSP to SPY, you will see the equal-weighted is doing poorly, only up around 8% [year-to-date] compared to 17%.” The reason SPY did better is that it includes larger shares of top technology stocks. “It is somewhat worrying to have such high exposure in the S&P 500, and at some stage the sector will correct,” he adds. “For my own trading and clients, we have also had large exposure to mining stocks — which are hardly represented in the SPY — and, even after the recent pullback, this is up 113% YTD and on a far lower [price-earnings ratio] multiple than tech stocks, so there are still opportunities in other sectors. But for those just passively tracking the S&P 500, they remain tech-heavy and will keep dancing until the music stops.” The market excitement over AI is fueled by investor belief on its future. But the concentration of tech acts in a way like leverage in investing. The expectations can pile on atop the other. An example The Motley Fool gave was Nvidia. Since the end of 2015, the company has added trillions to its market cap, moving from the smallest contributor to the Magnificent Seven to the largest. That was a jump from 0.8% of the combined value to the largest at 21.2%. If you have ever seen a juggler balancing a spinning plate on a pole, then you know the plates must keep rotating to maintain their stability. “The current market continues to consolidate with outperformance limited to fewer and fewer stocks, mostly based on the promise of AI and, perhaps more compelling, spending on AI infrastructure,” says Geoff Strotman of investment consulting firm Segal Marco Advisors. “Many of these stocks happen to be the largest stocks in the US stock market (and the largest in history), which is quickly driving performance and valuations higher.” Strotman notes that while the S&P 500 is at “historically high valuation,” there are many other areas of the global stock market — US small caps and non-US stocks — that remain at average valuations. That can mean good returns with lower investment amounts. He adds that emerging markets are having a strong year, up almost 30% year-to-date. “The emerging markets outperformance is also a reminder for institutional investors to remain diversified and rebalance into underperforming asset classes in order to take advantage of return divergence and opportunities as Emerging Markets was just about left for dead at the beginning of the year,” Strotman says. However, concerns about risk from tech, or any other type of stock type, can create its own problems. “The debate over whether AI is a 'boom' or a 'bubble' is interesting, but in reality, it’s a distraction to everyday investors focused on long-term wealth,” says Alex Michalka, head of investments at Weatlthfront. “No one can know the answer for sure, and attempting to adjust your strategy based on a guess is a form of market timing, which historically is not a wise approach. Instead, you’re better off focusing on ensuring you have a well-diversified portfolio that includes the level of risk you’re comfortable with based on your situation and time horizon.” In other words, if technology is an area where you find heightened risk, you don’t need to run away from it. A diversified portfolio is an intelligent investment tool. Michalka mentioned direct indexing, in which you buy individual stocks to imitate an existing stock index like the S&P 500 or Nasdaq. You can look for areas of tech that gives some of the upside without being married to it.

Title: Texas And New York Set To Send Contrasting Signals To Investors
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickgleason/2025/10/31/texas-and-new-york-set-to-send-contrasting-signals-to-investors/

ByPatrick Gleason, Contributor. Next Tuesday, November 5, New York City voters are likely to elect a new mayor who has campaigned on income tax hikes for upper-income households and businesses. Meanwhile, that same day, Texas voters are expected to approve ballot measures banning state taxation of capital gains and the imposition of a financial transactions tax. The heightened contrast is sure to help the Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE), the new Dallas-based stock market set to launch in 2026. An October 31 Wall Street Journal report about a new $90 million commitment to the TXSE from J.P. Morgan, the investment bank of JPMorgan Chase, noted that the TXSE “has billed itself as more CEO-friendly” than the New York Stock Exchange, adding that “previous investors include Citadel Securities, BlackRock and Charles Schwab.” The new infusion from JP Morgan, the WSJ added, “brings TXSE’s total fundraising to date above $250 million.” Ballot propositions banning a state death tax, a financial transactions tax, and a capital gains tax aren’t the only 2025 ballot measures that are set to make Texas an even more attractive destination to live, work, and invest. Texas voters will have the opportunity to enact reforms that provide further tax cuts, particularly property tax relief. Polling shows Texas voters are likely to approve Proposition 13, which will provide property tax relief to Lone Star State residents through a 40% increase in the homestead exemption. The state’s $100,000 homestead exemption would rise to $140,000 if voters enact Proposition 13 next Tuesday. “While not a permanent fix to property taxes, the amendment should help slow the growth of property taxes for all homeowners,” says Texans for Fiscal Responsibility (TFR), who has endorsed Proposition 13. While Proposition 13 seeks to provide relief for all property taxpayers in Texas, Proposition 9 would provide relief from the business personal property tax, commonly referred to as the inventory tax, to small businesses across the state. If approved, Proposition 9 would significantly increase the existing $2,500 inventory tax exemption, raising it to $125,000. “Texas is one of just nine states where small business owners pay taxes on the value of their inventory for sale, their personal property, and everything else used to generate income,” noted the National Federation of Independent Business’s Texas chapter in its statement of support for Proposition 9. NFIB adds that passage of Proposition 9 “would save Texas small businesses over $500 million annually,” and “make Texas even more competitive amongst its neighboring states.” “This constitutional amendment simplifies compliance, reduces bureaucratic costs, and incentivizes productivity,” notes TFR’s analysis of Proposition 9. “It cuts down on burdensome taxation that can stifle economic growth, especially for small operations. This is a pro-growth, pro-business reform that respects taxpayers and limits government overreach.” The ballot measures that Texas voters will likely approve on November 5 underscore why governors and legislative leaders in so many states are pursuing a phaseout of their income tax that would have them join Texas in the club of no-income-tax states. The eight existing no-income-tax states have already demonstrated the economic benefits of avoiding an income tax, and many are now seeking to expand that advantage by making their tax codes even more competitive. Texas isn’t the only no-income-tax state where legislators are pursuing property tax relief. In fact, in no-income-tax Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis is now pushing for a full phaseout of property taxes in Florida. In particular, Governor DeSantis is championing a single measure for the 2026 ballot that would begin phasing out all property taxes in Florida. Republicans in the Florida House of Representatives introduced eight property tax relief proposals on October 17, with seven of them being constitutional amendments requiring voter approval in November of 2026. Constitutional amendments must receive approval from at least 60% of voters in order to be enacted. The James Madison Institute, a Florida-based think tank, recently conducted a poll that found 65% of those surveyed said they would support a ballot measure to provide property tax relief. Lawmakers in other states are also pursuing property tax relief or limitation in the coming year. In no-income-tax Tennessee, for example, legislators will seek to pass a bill in 2026 that limits the growth of property tax bills. Tennessee is currently one of only four states without some form of property tax limit on the books. “To provide relief for taxpayers, we must set firm limits on how fast local governments can grow their budgets,” Justin Owen, president of the Beacon Center of Tennessee, and John Hendrickson, policy director at Iowans for Tax Relief, wrote in an October 17 article in Governing Magazine. “This will ensure that taxes do not outpace the ability of families and businesses to pay. Taxpayers must be protected from unchecked growth in local government spending.” “Eliminating property taxes may be a noble solution, but tax policy should always be approached with prudence,” Owen and Hendrickson added. “Replacing property taxes with a new tax or raising an existing tax to a higher rate, or even shifting more responsibilities to the state budget, are not necessarily sound tax policies. The best approach to lower taxes is to limit local government spending.” There were already plenty of reasons for lawmakers in no-income-tax states to pursue property tax cuts, property tax limits, and other forms of tax relief. But the case for doing so is strengthened by the fact that, at present, governors and legislators in nearly a dozen states across the country are seeking to phase out their income taxes. As more states eliminate their income tax, the lack of a state income tax will become less of an advantage. Leaders of no-income-tax states — such as Governors Abbott in Texas, DeSantis in Florida, and Lee in Tennessee — have made clear they are not resting on their laurels and that they welcome the competition.

Title: Does Bitcoin Power Law model still work in 2025 after S2F failed?
URL: https://cryptoslate.com/does-the-bitcoin-power-law-model-still-hold-after-stock-to-flow-failed/
Time Published: 2025-10-31T23:00:37Z
Full Content:
The range that matters: $48k floor to $492k top, with the top increasing over time. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. With S2F in the rearview, the live power-law channel indicates that BTC is roughly 20% below fair value, but ETF flows could push it to either extreme. Bitbo’s implementation of Giovanni Santostasi’s model places the price near $109,700, the fair value near $136,100, the support near $48,300, and the resistance near $491,800, which frames the current cycle within a rising corridor derived from a power-law fit to price over time. The channel is constructed by running a linear regression of log(price) versus log(time since genesis), then duplicating that line in parallel to form upper and lower bounds that have historically contained cyclical extremes. The result is a time-based compounding curve with rails that move upward as time passes, making the model more of a location map than a point forecast. The core claim is simple to evaluate in live markets. Bitcoin trades about 20 percent below the fair-value regression and more than twice above the model’s floor, a mid-zone placement that contrasts with prior cycle tops and bottoms when the price tagged the channel’s resistance or support. Parameterization used by BGeometrics expresses the fair-value curve as P ≈ 1.0117×10^-17 × (days since genesis)^5.82, with a commonly referenced floor at about 0.42 times the curve, which is consistent with the present gap between spot price and Bitbo’s lower rail. The specification includes historical drawdowns while allowing for late-cycle overextensions toward the upper band. The logic behind this approach treats adoption as a power function of time and expects volatility to decay as the network matures, a property that appears as tightening oscillations around the regression line over successive cycles. Recent flows help explain why the price is in the channel’s middle rather than at an extreme. Crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) drew a record $5.95 billion in net inflows during the week ending October 4, 2025, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of approximately $126,000, alongside strong demand for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. The following two weeks showed that flows are not a one-way input. CoinShares recorded a swing to $3.17 billion of net inflows, followed by a reversal to $513 million of net outflows, including a single-week Bitcoin outflow of $946 million. Over the last two days alone, $958 million has exited US Bitcoin ETFs, with $290 million leaving BlackRock on October 30. That cadence is consistent with the power-law framing, where transitory demand surges or air pockets push price toward the upper or lower rails over weeks, while the long-run trajectory is anchored to the time-based power curve. October highs were tied to the breakout wave of ETF subscriptions, which are now a visible macro lever for crypto demand. The forward question, therefore, is not whether the power-law structure still applies, but where within the channel Bitcoin will trade over the next leg. A base-case path keeps the price oscillating around the regression, currently near $136,100, with a dampened amplitude if the volatility decay property holds. A bull-case path would see continued ETF inflows and benign macro conditions pull the price toward the upper resistance, near $491,800 today, which prior cycles reached during late-stage runs. A bear-case scenario would arise from macro tightening, a regulatory shock, or persistent ETF outflows that drive a retest of the lower rail near $48,300. This level has historically seen capitulation wicks before reentry into the channel. These levels rise with time as the exponent on days since genesis compounds. The rails are directional guardrails, not fixed targets. For readers tracking levels at a glance, the live model ranges are: PlanB’s S2F path called for $98,000 by November 2021 and $135,000 by December 2021, targets that were not met. The price then spent years below the S2F trajectory, an out-of-sample failure that weakened confidence in using a univariate stock-to-flow ratio to set deterministic targets. Vitalik Buterin has criticized S2F for providing false precision, and many analysts have identified methodological issues, including overfitting, the omission of demand and liquidity variables, and the treatment of halvings as step-wise valuation shifts that do not account for market microstructure. Institutional researchers continue to caution that S2F is not a reliable tool for long-term pricing. That leaves S2F as a scarcity narrative rather than a forecasting model. Power-law adherents, by contrast, argue that the cycle length and amplitude can be bounded without hard-dating outcomes. CryptoSlate has previously outlined broad windows in which Bitcoin would not sustain prices below roughly six figures after 2028 and could, at some point between 2028 and 2037, touch the seven-figure mark. Those are ranges, not calendar calls, and they inherit the same caveats as any model that ignores policy shocks or structural changes in market access. The new structural change is ETF flow, which functions as a demand valve that can overpower the marginal issuance cuts that halvings encode. Sustained weekly spot inflows above $2 billion to $3 billion would raise the odds of an upper-band test, while persistent outflows would increase the probability of a regression or floor retest. Macro liquidity, including the path of rates, the dollar, and central bank balance sheets, still takes center stage in determining whether the price holds above the regression or drifts toward the lower rail. That macro overlay is absent in S2F and is only indirectly present in the power-law fit, which is why practitioners track flows and policy alongside the channel. The power-law channel is constructed by taking daily BTCUSD closes, transforming them to log(price) versus log(time since genesis), fitting a simple linear regression as the fair-value curve, and then copying that line up and down in parallel to form resistance and support that historically enclose the price. The elegance lies in its production of a monotonically rising, time-based framework with a visible margin of error, which, so far, has captured cycle extremes without claiming to know the date or magnitude of future blow-offs. The cost is that it does not mechanistically incorporate known drivers, such as ETF demand or liquidity cycles, which must be monitored to understand where within the channel price is likely to reside in the near term. For now, the live read is straightforward. Price sits about one-fifth below the regression, well above the floor, with ETF flows and macroeconomic conditions determining whether Bitcoin tags the upper band or fades toward support before reverting to the mean. The channel continues to rise with time, and the rails define the tradable map. Also known as "Akiba," Liam Wright is a reporter, podcast producer, and Editor-in-Chief at CryptoSlate.

Amazon led the stock market on Friday, with shares jumping 9.6%, to the finish of another winning week and month. The Dow rose 40.75 points, or 0.1%, to 47,562.87, finishing the week up 0.8%. The S&P 500 rose 17.86 points, or 0.3%, to 6,840.20, ending the week with a 0.7% increase. The Nasdaq rose 143.81 points, or 0.6%, to 23,724.96, climbing 2.2% for the week. The online retailer was by far the strongest upward force on the market reporting profit for the latest quarter that blew past analysts' expectations, per the AP. CEO Andy Jassy said growth for Amazon's cloud-computing business has accelerated to a pace not seen since 2022. The company's size, roughly $2.4 trillion, means its stock movements carry more weight on the S&P 500 than almost any other company's. Without Amazon, the S&P 500 would have been down for the day. Apple had less effect on the market even though it's bigger than Amazon. The iPhone maker, which is worth more than $4 trillion, swung between modest gains and losses through the day before finishing with a dip of 0.4%. It likewise delivered a better profit report for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Tim Cook said Apple benefited from strong revenue for its iPhones and its services offerings, which include its app store.

Title: AI Didn’t Layoff 14,000 People. Amazon Did.

ByAnn Kowal Smith, Contributor. Amazon cut 14,000 jobs this week, citing, in part, efficiency gains from AI. But blaming AI for layoffs is like blaming the thermometer for the fever. AI didn’t eliminate these jobs. Amazon did. Its leaders did. And they’re not alone. Across the tech giants, AI isn’t making these decisions—it’s masking them. Efficiency has become the new moral alibi—Microsoft, Meta, Google, and many others have all cited AI as justification for thousands of cuts. Every time leaders make a human decision and hide behind a technical one, they erode something far more valuable than headcount. They erode trust. The language of “AI gains” has become a convenient disguise for an old reflex: cut now, justify later. Leaders once blamed “the market.” They blamed Wall Street. Then automation. Today they blame AI. We’ve found the perfect scapegoat—one that never talks back. And efficiency becomes the virtue that absolves the decision. The further leaders move from the people affected by their decisions, the easier it becomes to treat humans as inputs rather than individuals. Data becomes a shield against empathy. AI doesn’t make these choices, but it makes it easier to hide from them. That’s the new face of moral outsourcing—not machines taking over judgment, but humans abdicating it. Here’s the irony: the productivity miracle AI promised hasn’t yet arrived. A recent MIT study found that despite $30–40 billion in enterprise investment in generative AI, 95 percent of companies have seen no measurable return. Only five percent of pilots are delivering meaningful financial impact. If the payoff isn’t here, what exactly are we optimizing? The truth is, companies aren’t chasing performance, they’re shifting their bets. As GlobalData’s Neil Saunders observed, “In some ways, this is a tipping point away from human capital to technological infrastructure.” The story isn’t about productivity. It’s about where investment is flowing and what’s being left behind. Amazon’s own numbers tell the story clearly. The company isn’t shrinking because AI made it leaner. It’s shrinking to pay for AI. Net sales are up double digits year over year, and operating income topped $18 billion last quarter. Yet free cash flow has fallen from $53 billion to $18 billion in a year, driven largely by record spending on data centers, custom chips, and cloud infrastructure. Amazon is cutting costs today to fund the AI infrastructure that might, someday, deliver results tomorrow. Efficiency, pursued for its own sake, stops serving people and starts consuming them. From Microsoft to Meta, Google to Dell, the same logic echoes: cut people now to finance the systems to eventually replace them. The question isn’t whether AI will make us more productive. It’s what we’ll have sacrificed by the time it does. Each algorithmic layoff widens the distance between leaders and the people they lead. It doesn’t just trim headcount. It thins the thread of trust that holds organizations together. The stock market is booming. Yet, in the U.S. alone, nearly 700,000 job cuts were announced in the first half of 2025, up 80% over the same period last year. Every time an organization maximizes profits and machines over people, the social contract that binds workplaces together is collateral damage. It used to be that if you were smart, worked hard, and loyal to your company, they were loyal to you. Those days are disappearing. Now we ask laid off workers to pay the price for oversized payrolls, while the leaders move forward unaffected. It’s unrealistic to suggest that a company can never downsize, that it can’t restructure itself to meet the needs of a disruptive technology. But when people are involved, the “how” matters. When an automotive supplier found itself in a similar pickle, needing to reduce its workforce by 30% to stay afloat, its leaders charted a different path. Instead of mass layoffs, they offered voluntary retirement plans, each with generous severance, and met their reduction needs organically. Preserving everyone’s dignity, those who left and those who stayed remained deeply committed to the company and its success. You can’t innovate in a climate of fear. And more than half of workers now fear losing their jobs in the next year. People stop taking risks. They comply. They play it safe. Ironically, at the dawn of the AI era, we’re engineering the conditions least conducive to innovation. At its highest and best use, AI could help us cure cancer, rebuild infrastructure, even reverse climate damage. But we may throw that future away. Not because machines failed us, but because we did. It doesn’t have to be this way. AI isn’t inherently dehumanizing. It’s a mirror, reflecting the values of those who build and wield it. LinkedIn’s Aneesh Raman envisions a new “relationship economy,” one where social intelligence sits at the center of work. “Human ideas are the new code,” he says. “Human energy is the new data center. And a new world of work anchored on the human brain is about to emerge.” It’s an inspiring vision—one we could realize, or ruin—depending on how we use the power in our hands. Octavia Butler captured this paradox decades ago in her evocative short story, The Book of Martha, where God asks a woman to redesign humanity to save the world. Every solution she imagines creates a new harm. The story ends not with certainty, but humility. That’s the leadership lesson AI demands: every “efficiency” we celebrate carries consequences we can’t yet see. Every act of progress leaves a shadow, and real wisdom lies in seeing both. As AI moves closer to the center of decision-making, leadership’s job is to keep accountability in human hands. The future of work won’t be written by bots. It will be written in the daily decisions leaders make about people. Taking responsibility begins with owning those choices. Leaders should state plainly what was decided, why it was decided, and who is accountable. Transparency is the first antidote to moral outsourcing. It also requires re-humanizing the data. Every data point represents a person, a livelihood, a story. Before optimizing, leaders should ask who is affected, what relationships might be broken, and what trust might be lost. Data without dialogue degrades judgment. And finally, responsibility means measuring what truly matters. Not just productivity or profit, but belonging, learning, and creativity—the conditions that make innovation possible. In an age obsessed with speed, these are the slow variables that determine whether progress endures. If we want AI to serve humanity, we must first take responsibility for the humans we lead. Committed employees need a committed employer. It’s a social contract grounded in mutual trust.

Title: AI Didn’t Layoff 14,000 People. Amazon Did.

ByAnn Kowal Smith, Contributor. Amazon cut 14,000 jobs this week, citing, in part, efficiency gains from AI. But blaming AI for layoffs is like blaming the thermometer for the fever. AI didn’t eliminate these jobs. Amazon did. Its leaders did. And they’re not alone. Across the tech giants, AI isn’t making these decisions—it’s masking them. Efficiency has become the new moral alibi—Microsoft, Meta, Google, and many others have all cited AI as justification for thousands of cuts. Every time leaders make a human decision and hide behind a technical one, they erode something far more valuable than headcount. They erode trust. The language of “AI gains” has become a convenient disguise for an old reflex: cut now, justify later. Leaders once blamed “the market.” They blamed Wall Street. Then automation. Today they blame AI. We’ve found the perfect scapegoat—one that never talks back. And efficiency becomes the virtue that absolves the decision. The further leaders move from the people affected by their decisions, the easier it becomes to treat humans as inputs rather than individuals. Data becomes a shield against empathy. AI doesn’t make these choices, but it makes it easier to hide from them. That’s the new face of moral outsourcing—not machines taking over judgment, but humans abdicating it. Here’s the irony: the productivity miracle AI promised hasn’t yet arrived. A recent MIT study found that despite $30–40 billion in enterprise investment in generative AI, 95 percent of companies have seen no measurable return. Only five percent of pilots are delivering meaningful financial impact. If the payoff isn’t here, what exactly are we optimizing? The truth is, companies aren’t chasing performance, they’re shifting their bets. As GlobalData’s Neil Saunders observed, “In some ways, this is a tipping point away from human capital to technological infrastructure.” The story isn’t about productivity. It’s about where investment is flowing and what’s being left behind. Amazon’s own numbers tell the story clearly. The company isn’t shrinking because AI made it leaner. It’s shrinking to pay for AI. Net sales are up double digits year over year, and operating income topped $18 billion last quarter. Yet free cash flow has fallen from $53 billion to $18 billion in a year, driven largely by record spending on data centers, custom chips, and cloud infrastructure. Amazon is cutting costs today to fund the AI infrastructure that might, someday, deliver results tomorrow. Efficiency, pursued for its own sake, stops serving people and starts consuming them. From Microsoft to Meta, Google to Dell, the same logic echoes: cut people now to finance the systems to eventually replace them. The question isn’t whether AI will make us more productive. It’s what we’ll have sacrificed by the time it does. Each algorithmic layoff widens the distance between leaders and the people they lead. It doesn’t just trim headcount. It thins the thread of trust that holds organizations together. The stock market is booming. Yet, in the U.S. alone, nearly 700,000 job cuts were announced in the first half of 2025, up 80% over the same period last year. Every time an organization maximizes profits and machines over people, the social contract that binds workplaces together is collateral damage. It used to be that if you were smart, worked hard, and loyal to your company, they were loyal to you. Those days are disappearing. Now we ask laid off workers to pay the price for oversized payrolls, while the leaders move forward unaffected. It’s unrealistic to suggest that a company can never downsize, that it can’t restructure itself to meet the needs of a disruptive technology. But when people are involved, the “how” matters. When an automotive supplier found itself in a similar pickle, needing to reduce its workforce by 30% to stay afloat, its leaders charted a different path. Instead of mass layoffs, they offered voluntary retirement plans, each with generous severance, and met their reduction needs organically. Preserving everyone’s dignity, those who left and those who stayed remained deeply committed to the company and its success. You can’t innovate in a climate of fear. And more than half of workers now fear losing their jobs in the next year. People stop taking risks. They comply. They play it safe. Ironically, at the dawn of the AI era, we’re engineering the conditions least conducive to innovation. At its highest and best use, AI could help us cure cancer, rebuild infrastructure, even reverse climate damage. But we may throw that future away. Not because machines failed us, but because we did. It doesn’t have to be this way. AI isn’t inherently dehumanizing. It’s a mirror, reflecting the values of those who build and wield it. LinkedIn’s Aneesh Raman envisions a new “relationship economy,” one where social intelligence sits at the center of work. “Human ideas are the new code,” he says. “Human energy is the new data center. And a new world of work anchored on the human brain is about to emerge.” It’s an inspiring vision—one we could realize, or ruin—depending on how we use the power in our hands. Octavia Butler captured this paradox decades ago in her evocative short story, The Book of Martha, where God asks a woman to redesign humanity to save the world. Every solution she imagines creates a new harm. The story ends not with certainty, but humility. That’s the leadership lesson AI demands: every “efficiency” we celebrate carries consequences we can’t yet see. Every act of progress leaves a shadow, and real wisdom lies in seeing both. As AI moves closer to the center of decision-making, leadership’s job is to keep accountability in human hands. The future of work won’t be written by bots. It will be written in the daily decisions leaders make about people. Taking responsibility begins with owning those choices. Leaders should state plainly what was decided, why it was decided, and who is accountable. Transparency is the first antidote to moral outsourcing. It also requires re-humanizing the data. Every data point represents a person, a livelihood, a story. Before optimizing, leaders should ask who is affected, what relationships might be broken, and what trust might be lost. Data without dialogue degrades judgment. And finally, responsibility means measuring what truly matters. Not just productivity or profit, but belonging, learning, and creativity—the conditions that make innovation possible. In an age obsessed with speed, these are the slow variables that determine whether progress endures. If we want AI to serve humanity, we must first take responsibility for the humans we lead. Committed employees need a committed employer. It’s a social contract grounded in mutual trust. Amazon’s layoffs aren’t just another round of cost-cutting—they’re a warning to every company chasing the same playbook. When the world’s most powerful firms reduce people simply to expand their AI budgets, they send a clear signal about the future of work: speed over stewardship, profits over people, efficiency over empathy. The short-term gain is easy to count; the long-term cost isn’t. It won’t appear on a balance sheet. It will surface later, in the trust we squander, the talent we silence, and the future we forfeit. The danger isn’t artificial intelligence. It’s artificial leadership.

Amazon, which announced plans this week to reduce its global corporate workforce by about 14,000 jobs, says it is laying off 760 jobs in Southern California beginning in January as part of a shakeup driven by artificial intelligence. Overall, Amazon says it will cut 1,540 positions in California — including 783 in Northern California, according to Vani Appukkutty, a senior manager in the company’s human resources department. In Southern California, layoffs are coming to Irvine (333), Culver City (152), San Diego (145) and Santa Monica (130). Also see: Disneyland lays off about 100 salaried employees The layoffs begin Jan. 26 and finish by April 1, Appukkutty wrote in Oct. 28 letters filed with the state’s Employment Development Department. “Employee separations resulting from this action are expected to be permanent,” she wrote. The filings were made as part of the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act — commonly referred to as WARN — which are required when an employer lays off more than 50 employees. All affected employees are notified at least 60 days before their terminations are scheduled to occur, according to Appukkutty. The layoffs include positions for business intelligence, data, software and security engineers, contract managers, creative marketers, financial analysts, game artists and designers, lawyers, product managers, tax analysts and other administrative staff, according to the EDD letters. More job cuts: Santa Monica-based RAND cuts 11% of its workforce Appukkutty did not provide reasons for the layoffs or where in the tech giant the reductions would happen. However, news reports said that Amazon.com was gutting its video-game division in Irvine, San Diego and its central publishing division. The retailer also announced Oct. 3 that it would close four of its Amazon Fresh supermarkets in Southern California by mid-November as it reevaluates store performance. Beth Galetti, senior vice president in charge of Amazon’s human resources department, wrote in an Oct. 28 blog post that artificial intelligence is enabling companies to “innovate much faster than ever before.” In announcing the 14,000 corporate layoffs, Galetti wrote that Amazon is convinced of the “need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” She said that the reductions are a continuation of the work to get even “stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources” to invest in Amazon’s future. The corporate layoffs mean “reducing in some areas and hiring in others,” she added. For instance, Amazon announced in early October that it planned to fill 30,000 new seasonal roles across California, including up to 8,000 roles in Riverside, San Bernardino and Ontario — as well as up to 3,000 roles for the upcoming holidays across Los Angeles, Long Beach and Anaheim, and 1,300 roles in San Diego, Chula Vista and Carlsbad. Many of the seasonal roles have the potential to transition into year-round employment with benefits, said Amazon spokeswoman Carly Levy in an Oct. 14 statement.Related Articles 2 Amazon Fresh grocery stores are closing in Orange County

Title: BlackRock's Larry Fink says US still top destination for global investors to park money

Tortoise Capital’s Rob Thummel and Payne Capital Management’s Ryan Payne join Mornings with Maria to discuss record market highs, the AI infrastructure boom and how Big Tech earnings and U.S.–China trade talks could drive investor sentiment. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that the U.S. remains the primary destination for investors to put their assets and will continue to be for at least the next year and a half amid economic trends. Fink was part of a panel moderated by Bloomberg Television at the Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia and noted that earlier this year there was "modest transformation and movement out of the dollar" as investors moved assets to Europe and other regions. However, he noted that movement came from a "huge overweight in dollar-based assets" and that the trend appears to be reversing with investors moving back into U.S. assets. "I would say in the last two months we're seeing that money coming back into the U.S., so I don't see there's that much movement. There's still a deep belief in the opportunity in the U.S.," Fink said, noting the surge in investment related to AI and other capital projects. BLACKROCK'S BRAGGING RIGHTS TO FASTEST-GROWING ETFS BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that the U.S. will continue to be a destination for investors to be "overweight" for at least the next 18 months. (Kirk Sides/Houston Chronicle via Getty Images) "Over 40% of the economic growth in the second quarter was capex for technology, and you don't see that in other places in the world," the BlackRock chief said. "And it's that capex, whether it's data centers or finding more power, gas, building gas turbines – you're seeing all that happening more in the U.S. than in most places in the world today." "You're not seeing that as much in Europe, and this is one of the big reasons for the huge gap between U.S. GDP and European GDP," he added. BLACKROCK CEO LARRY FINK'S ANNUAL LETTER TO INVESTORS Fink said that while money will continue to move around to different countries and regions of the world, he thinks most global investors will continue to focus on being overweight on their U.S. investments for the next year and a half. "Money's going to move around all the time, but I would say most global investors have a very large overweight in the U.S. and I think that's going to be the best place to have your overweighting for at least the next 18 months," Fink added. U.S. markets tumbled earlier this year amid concerns over the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on the economy, as well as longstanding fiscal issues. TRUMP AND XI STRIKE TRADE TRUCE: 5 KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM THE SOUTH KOREA SUMMIT U.S. markets have rebounded on strong AI investment after sliding earlier this year in the wake of tariff announcements. (Michael Nagle/Bloomberg via Getty Images) President Donald Trump's announcement of his "reciprocal" tariff policy in early April prompted a significant sell-off in the stock market – though the administration later delayed and pared back some of those tariff policies, which reduced investors' concerns. Longstanding concerns over the long-term fiscal health of the U.S. have also continued to accumulate as the deficit has surpassed the $37 trillion and $38 trillion thresholds over the course of 2025. Concerns about the inability of lawmakers to curtail persistent and growing budget deficits prompted Moody's to become the third major ratings agency to downgrade the U.S. credit rating from its top tier.

Title: Crypto’s second wave of ETFs arrives, investors snap up new Solana offering
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/10/31/cryptos-second-wave-of-etfs-arrives-investors-snap-up-new-solana-offering/
Time Published: 2025-10-31T17:01:49Z

A flurry of new crypto spot ETFs launched on Tuesday and Wednesday, meaning that mom-and-pop investors can now invest more easily in lesser-known cryptocurrencies. Until this week, these investors could only buy Bitcoin and Ethereum in ETF form, and based on initial demand, at least one of the new offerings is off to a roaring start. The new ETF provides exposure to Solana, the sixth most popular cryptocurrency. According to Eric Balchunas, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, the Bitwise Solana Staking ETF (BSOL) had the best ETF launch of 2025 in any asset class. Demand for other new ETFs, providing exposure to Litecoin and Hedera, was more muted. Although crypto exchanges like Coinbase have long sold these cryptocurrencies, the ETF wrappers mean investors can get exposure to these assets in the form of shares purchased through any brokerage. “For investors, this is about as McDonald’s easy as you can get,” said Balchunas in an interview with Fortune. “It’s low-cost, easy, and safe.” The launch of this latest crop of ETFs comes nearly two years after the Securities and Exchange Commission first opened the door to crypto funds in January 2024. That’s when the agency finally approved a bid by BlackRock and others to sell Bitcoin ETFs, following a nearly decade-long legal battle with the crypto industry. The first Ethereum ETFs launched later that year. Now, with the launch of ETFs for more obscure cryptocurrencies, traders will have access to an even deeper array of digital assets. On Thursday, BSOL, the Solana ETF issued by crypto asset management firm Bitwise, saw $46 million of trading volume in its third day. By contrast, the Canary Hedera and Litecoin ETFs saw roughly $2.3 million and $500,000, respectively, in their third day. “BSOL did phenomenally well,” said Hunter Horsley, the CEO of Bitwise, in an interview with Fortune. “And I think it connected with a lot of investor demand.” Other issuers to launch Solana and Hedera ETFs are Grayscale and Canary, respectively. The race to launch new cryptocurrency ETFs is competitive, as first movers are better able to cultivate investor loyalty and gain a leg up on competitors who are slower to come to market. “It’s like the Ricky Bobby quote, ‘If you’re not first, you’re last,’” said Balchunas. “There’s a little of that in the ETF world. That’s why there’s such a rush to market.” The quest for a crypto ETF dates back to as early as 2013, when the Winklevoss twins —whose legal battle with Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg was popularized in the movie The Social Network—sought approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which track the current price of the popular cryptocurrency, became a white whale for those in the sector. But, under multiple administrations, the SEC rejected applications for them, citing the immaturity of the market and the potential for manipulation. In 2021, the agency approved a Bitcoin futures ETF, but not a spot fund. In 2022, Grayscale, a prominent crypto asset manager, sued the agency for allowing futures-based but not spot funds. Grayscale won the case in August 2023. In 2024, a select few spot ETFs launched to record success. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) attracted $70 billion in total assets more quickly than any other ETF. Its Ethereum fund (ETHA) also set record inflows. Under the Trump administration, the floodgates for spot crypto ETFs flew open after the SEC updated its guidance in July. But the recently launched ETFs for Solana, Hedera, and Litecoin appear to make use of new guidance that the SEC issued at the start of the ongoing federal government shutdown. While the exact technicalities of how these issuers were justifying the listing of their new funds were unclear to Balchunas, he said that they were being opportunistic. “These issuers are very crafty. They found phrasing in guidance put out by the SEC about what to do in the shutdown,” he added. Balchunas also predicted that XRP, the fifth biggest cryptocurrency, would be the next crypto ETF to launch. “If I had to bet $1,000, I would say it would launch a couple of weeks after the government comes back,” he said. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Meta Stock Had Its Worst Day In Three Years Due to AI Overspending Worries

The same week that Nvidia became the world’s first $5 trillion company, significantly propelled by its AI-related investments and products, Meta’s stock had its worst day in three years because traders fear that Meta has overspent on AI. As CNBC reports, Meta shares dropped more than 11% on Thursday and have thus far dropped another 1.3% so far today, as of writing. At its bottom yesterday, October 30, Meta’s share price reached its lowest point in three years. Meta, like many tech companies, is frantically racing to improve its AI technology and tools. The stock market fears that Meta’s aggressive capital expenditures on AI are perhaps too aggressive and are arguably unlikely to pay off. During an earnings call on Wednesday, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended the company’s AI spending, which is a huge chunk of overall annual capital expenditures nearing $72 billion. “It’s pretty early, but I think we’re seeing the returns in the core business. That’s giving us a lot of confidence that we should be investing a lot more, and we want to make sure that we’re not underinvesting,” Zuckerberg said during the call. Meta is far from alone in its massive AI spending. CNBC notes that Alphabet, Google’s parent company, increased its projected expenditures to $93 billion, while Microsoft indicated that it also expects to spend more this year than in 2024. Although Meta had a disastrous day yesterday, its stock value is still up over 9.5% so far in 2025. Nonetheless, as MarketWatch wrote yesterday, “There’s an AI bubble.” There are many failed AI startups, and spending is unsustainable. However, MarketWatch argues that the biggest players, including Meta, are “essentially unassailable.” The economics publication claims that these companies are so big, and their core businesses so successful, that even “extended periods of disappointing AI returns” won’t sink the ships. This aligns, at least in part, with what Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said this week. As reported by Fortune, Powell claims that most of the AI-related spending is being done by successful companies with actual earnings, rather than speculative spenders. Powell says the AI bubble, if there is one, is not like the dot-com bubble. But massive companies have failed before, sometimes in catastrophic fashion. Whether investors’ worst fears may be realized, there is clearly a general uneasiness about how at least some companies, including massive ones, are approaching AI.

Title: October 2025 in Review

The Site Happy Halloween and all that… and on a Friday no less. Stay safe out there. As for the site, both long time readers might recall me complaining endlessly about how changing the time setting of the blog from UTC to US Pacific time changed my posting streak, which began on March 29, 2020, which would be 2,042 days ago, to starting in May 2023 because the time zone change put one post or another into a different day. I used to post at all hours of the day and night. I mostly used to post at 17:15 UTC, or 10:15 local time, which somehow got converted oddly. Anyway, after bitching about it for well over a year, I finally did something about it. I went back and correct some times… because it turns out that WP.com did some odd things to times when I did that change… to see if, you know, that might actually work. And it did. Granted, it didn’t work in one fell swoop. I basically had to go to the next date that got screwed up and fix the times there, so my streak count went from 857 to 987 to 1252, to whatever, as I worked my way back, day by day, to each screw up. And it was strange, because there were, in fact, no day gaps so far as I could tell. It just freaked out about some times that were past 18:00 around the DST changes. So, basically, bad WP.com code. But I got there. The TAGN Streak – Battlefield 2042 Does this really matter? Am I a better person because WP.com now correctly displays my post streak? Or does this really say more about my own mental defects? Yeah, you probably know the answer better than I. Meanwhile, in comment comedy this month, I have had a repeat commenter from Portland, Oregon (judging from his IP address… remember kids, I can see that) who keeps complaining about my blog appearing on their Kindle and asking that I remove my content from their device. Please.remove this web sight from my kindle At first I thought this was a joke, but it has come up a few times. And I can’t really help them. I recall that there is some minimal browser available on the Kindle, but how things get bookmarked or whatever, no idea. I use the Kindle app on the iPad. One Year Ago LOTRO, EverQuest, and EverQuest II all announced their coming expansions so close together that I just put them all in a single post. Blizzard kicked off the World of Warcraft 20th Anniversary festivities. I was asking, not for the first time, when WoW Classic should end. Is there a point when it just isn’t “classic” anymore, or are we on the ride to catch up to retail? Actually in the game, the instance group was still working through Cataclysm Classic, taking on The Lost City of Tol’vir, with a bit of Coren Direbrew on the side. We were also out there with many others farming Wintergrasp for honor. Tol Barad was just bad. Wintergrasp was generally an Alliance walk over, unless we pulled the Horde pre-made group. Then we got worked. We also cheesed the Vault of Archavon in Wintergrasp, because why not? Then we started testing the waters for heroic Deadmines. That was getting us to the end of the expansion so far as we were concerned, so I was wondering how much longer the whole thing would drag on. (Until July 2025, which was too damn long for me.) In EVE Online, the Crimson Harvest event, one of only two regular annual events at this point, kicked off once more. The candidate list for the CSM19 elections was announced, so the campaigning could begin in earnest. Shortly thereafter Alcoholic Satan was removed from CSM18 and dropped from the CSM19 ballot. It isn’t a realm CSM if there isn’t some drama. Then the election started. (And the Alliance Tournament kicked off as well.) When the polls closed we got the results and saw who would be on CSM19. We also got a date for the upcoming Revenant expansion. There was also the MER, which seemed to indicate we were coming out of the “summer slump,” if you believe in that. I did a Friday bullet points post with more about the AT, more Revenant details, the announcement of the Empires of EVE: Vol III project, the current PLEX price crisis (not helped by Torvald Uruz destroying 38,400 PLEX as part of his dramatic rage quit), EVE Galaxy Conquest, and finally getting my 20th Anniversary Collectors Edition delivered (18 months after the 20th anniversary). Then, as the month closed out, CCP finally forced everybody into mandatory participation with the Equinox sov changes. Yay, rejuvenation or something. Actually in New Eden, there was a State of the Goonion meeting that announced our Migration from Delve to Tenerifis. Let the big move begin! This seemed to dismay and confuse PanFam leadership, who had barely fought back claiming that Goons would get tired and go home. The Reavers SIG also celebrated a decade of not existing. The actual move was being handled by stages, with everybody getting to the regional gate between Querious and Catch. (And when I write “everybody” I mean maybe 40% of the alliance. People were still panic moving months later.) Then there was a massive op for crossing the regional gate. And then more move ops. More ops all the time. I also went on my own side adventure, avoiding the regional gate as I moved a black ops battleship and a blockade runner through an alternate route. This all led to Brave finally taking 1DQ1-A and being declared the winner of World War Bee. The Stars Reach pre-alpha carried on with a test of some new tools, then there was a test for combat and new ranger skills, I tried out Galaxicus, the spiritual successor to Stellar Emperor / MegaWars 3. Also, our binge watching habits continued, with another post summarizing what we had been watching. Five Years Ago I started using that 34″ ultra-wide monitor. Coincidentally, I also started complaining about the UI in games being too small and hard to read if they lacked a reasonable scaling option. Somebody at Google Stadia was ranting about making streamers pay. Is there something in the water that makes people this dumb? Blizzard delayed the Shadowlands expansion. But they were building up for the AQ war supply event in WoW Classic. And we got a late November launch date before the month was out. WoW seemed to be hanging on according to the Q3 2020 results. I was also wondering if we were going to get a level squish with every WoW expansion going forward. And then the big level squish patch hit and all our level 120 characters were suddenly level 60. The only thing was to try it out, though it was a bit strange. The new Exile’s Reach starter area was… new. We put together a little group to try the level squished Northrend. Ula made us an instance group video about our time in Sunken Temple. Then there was the running of the Gnomes. And then we started some prep for a little instance called Blackrock Depths. Meanwhile, StarCraft II fell off of Blizzard’s active development list. The EverQuest team announced the Claws of Veeshan expansion, the EverQuest II team announced the Reign of Shadows expansion, and the Lord of the Rings Online launched their War of Three Peaks expansionette. And in EVE Online World War Bee was in full swing, with PAPI finally trying to gain a foothold in Mother Delve. That led to Guinness World Record setting battles, which CCP got us ready for by introducing a UI Only mode to the game. That was some timing. I’ll sum up the war as a list: And outside of the war I did a bit of quiet mining in the new ore distribution plan. The Reavers SIG turned six years old. We got a Crimson Harvest event for Halloween. The Howling Interdictors update gave us stasis bubbles. And then there were the Triglavians. They captured 27 empire systems and, with another update, they were yanked into a new Triglavian region named Pochven. Farewell Niarja. Sean Connery, the favorite James Bond of many, passed away. Finally, there was the tale of the Canadian visitor. Ten Years Ago I opened up the month with a post about the Mineserver Kickstarter campaign, a little box that promised to make hosting easy! A pity is never came to anything… and that I basically threw money into nothing. Then there was the now perennial complaint about customers being too cheap to by any and every 99 cent game. It is because your 99 cent game sucks. In EverQuest II, the Desert of Flames expansion unlock votes passed on Stormhold and Deathtoll, which made me ponder the pacing of nostalgia. Daybreak seemed to want to go faster. Daybreak also have expansion announcements for EverQuest and EverQuest II that included pricey special editions. Milk ’em while you got ’em I guess. But PlanetSide 2 was having problems attracting subscribers. EverQuest II was consolidating servers, so it was farewell to Crushbone. In Lord of the Rings Online, server consolidation was just getting under way as well. Crowfall was still in development, but had announced some costly RMT castles. Guild Wars 2 launched the Heart of Thorns expansion. I picked up the Reaper of Souls expansion for Diablo III and made it through Act V. My wife and I went to EVE Vegas where we partied and heard about the planned Citadel expansion. I brought some give-aways for the trip, which I covered, along with Pirate’s Little Helper, in a Friday bullet points post. Meanwhile, in New Eden I was very impressed with the multi-buy feature that came in with the previous month’s Vanguard release. I was also wondering if space priests were a problem. I also went pipe bombing for the first time. The month’s Blog Banter wanted to know about my PC. And Reavers celebrated their first anniversary. Over in one corner New Eden SpaceMonkeys Alliance (SMA) stole ISK from EVE Online casino I Want ISK who, in turn, hired low sec mercenaries to camp SMA space, starting the embers of what would become the Casino War. And the sad tale of CCP and White Wolf came to an end as CCP sold off the subsidiary and its neglected IP, World of Darkness. Finally, in Minecraft, Aaron began his draining of an ocean monument, and I was interested in bases, several of which sprang up as I worked on the Great Northern Road. Fifteen Years Ago I had some hopes and expectations for BlizzCon. They were pretty much unmet. But Blizzard had already announced the Cataclysm ship date, so what else did I expect? I asked if people ever look at the items in the blog side-bar. People mostly do not. EverQuest launched the House of Thule expansion. I finished building my new computer. Windows 7 64-bit was the wave of the future… unless you wanted to take that LOTRO survey. The EVE Online screen shot contest wrapped up, winners were declared and prizes were sent out. I was playing Lords of Ultima innocently enough and then somebody attacked me! Oh noes! I was suddenly determined to “catch them all” and finish the National Pokedex in Pokemon SoulSilver. The instance group was playing in LOTRO, which had been live as a Free to Play game for one month. In-game, we were subjected to the disturbing habits of some of the residents of the Lone Lands, while I indulged in one of my own habits, the mid-game character swap. And then I made one post completely unreadable by making anagrams out of all the proper nouns. I had to repost a corrected version. I bought Civilization V, which like every Civilization launch, had issues with my current computer. The unwritten rule of Civilization is that you need to upgrade your machine in order for the game to play well. LEGO Universe launched. My daughter and I were drinking new and interesting sodas and I was really hoping that the SF Giants could make it to a World Series victory. Twenty Years Ago Club Penguin, the browser based, kid friendly MMO, launched. Pity about Disney screwing the whole thing up. Civilization IV launched and, as with all Civ launches, the game really needed the next generation of hardware to run in its full glory. I recall submitting a bug and getting a response telling me to stop trying to play with so many civilizations in a single game. Age of Empires III also launched. While it was well reviewed, and we all bought a copy, it never really eclipsed Age of Empires II in my heart. The second game remains the pinnacle of the series for me. Twenty-Five Years Ago The PlayStation 2 launches in North America. Pokemon Gold & Silver arrive in North America. Regional launches were a thing back then. Forty-Five Years Ago Berzerk arrives in arcades. I remember this game showing up and dropping a lot of quarters to play it. It said things.

I managed to get through purple stakes with the checkered deck, the one I find the easiest to run with in that you can go all in on flushes pretty easily. Now I am working on orange stakes, the next to last level… and it is a thing. But it is a rogue-like, which means you just keep starting over until the RNG favors you. EVE Online What did I do in New Eden? Nothing very eventful I guess. I went on a couple of ops, did a bit of the Crimson Harvest event, tended my planets, ratted again a little bit, voted for CSM20, and started accumulating skill points for the Catalyst expansion coming in November. Nothing really exciting, just playing the game in kind of a low key way. No Man’s Sky We might have hit the end of Corvette Summer or whatever. I had already gone back to mostly exploring and the basic game play loop of discovery and moving on. We did try our hand at base building… and it was not very satisfying. I still have more to say about that. Then there was Expedition 20, which Potshot and I both got through, though there were some hurdles as noted. Palia The new game for some of us in the group. Despite it being mostly the housing and crafting portion of an MMO, with scant adventure available, it does press enough of the “progress quest” character advancement buttons without giving you too early on, so you always feel like you are working towards something. We’ll see how long it lasts, but for now it is a pretty chill game. Palworld We’ve been moving slowly here. This has become the Sunday afternoon game, but only if we have the full group. And, being adults with responsibilities and obligations and all that, it doesn’t always come together. But we persist. Pokemon Go The big October update still seems strange to me. Adding new levels to engage you level capped players… and then changing the level curve so that same players just skip past 20 of the 30 levels added… well, it is a bold strategy. So I have xp to get me to level 74 already, we’re just caught up in the tasks required for each of the last ten levels. Coming Up It is the start of the run up to the holidays. It will also be the prime season for high quality ads, so we’ll see if ad revenue for the site goes up. (Please use an ad blocker plugin with your browser. If you’re somebody who reads this far in, I don’t want to tax/annoy you. I want to tax comment spam bots.) In EVE Online we will have the Catalyst expansion coming mid month. That will shake things up a bit; new ships, new login rewards, new Twitch drops and all of that. Enshrouded is also supposed to get its next big update. It was supposed to be this month, but it got pushed out to “October 42nd” according to the community team. Best not to ship too early. It is quite possible we might get one of the three planned Daybreak expansions before the end of the month. I’d bet on LOTRO being the first, but we’ll see. Took your first Blaugust very seriously, did you? LikeLike Actually that lines up with Blapril, which was the sixth run, when during early Covid we decided to do Blaugust early because we were all stuck at home and had plenty of time to write. It just so happens I have worked from home since then, which has meant more time for writing since I no longer have a commute. LikeLiked by 1 person Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

Title: Mind Affirm’s GAAP… It Only Misleads

ByDavid Trainer, Contributor. Many companies rely on misleading “adjusted” metrics to trick investors into thinking their business is stronger than it is in reality. The law allows companies to invent entirely new metrics or manipulate others to support a narrative that paints a more positive picture of the firm’s fundamentals. These companies often include disclaimers that caution against using non-GAAP metrics. Yet, the Street often builds its narratives on these “adjusted” metrics. “Adjusted” metrics are not the only problem. GAAP earnings are often misleading. Unusual, one-time gains or losses frequently distort reported GAAP results and cloud investors’ ability to understand the true economic performance of companies. To uncover real, Core Earnings, investors must dig into the details buried in the footnotes. This week’s Danger Zone pick is a perfect example of just how misleading reported earnings can be. The company recently reported positive GAAP earnings for the first time since its IPO. Meanwhile, Core Earnings remain highly negative. Further analysis reveals the company is burning through cash at an alarming pace. Only by leveraging superior fundamental data can investors get the truth about this company’s profitability, or lack thereof. I first put Affirm Holdings (AFRM) in the Danger Zone in October 2021, reiterated my bearish opinion most recently in October 2024, and named it a Zombie Stock in September 2022. GAAP profits may have investors re-thinking this company, so I believe now is a great time to remind investors how GAAP net income is misleading and show how AFRM remains overvalued. Affirm continues to grow its top-line at impressive levels. In fiscal 4Q25, revenue and gross merchandise volume (GMV) grew 33% and 43% year-over-year (YoY), respectively. For the full year of fiscal 2025, Affirm grew revenue and GMV 39% and 38% YoY, respectively. The company also successfully onboarded new customers and merchants, with active consumers and active merchants rising 23% and 24% YoY respectively in fiscal 2025. Perhaps most noteworthy – at least to investors that don’t look beyond the surface numbers – Affirm generated positive GAAP net income in fiscal 2025, a first since fiscal 2019. While Affirm reports positive top-line growth and GAAP net income, a deeper analysis, one that accounts for the footnotes and MD&A of company filings, reveals a different picture. Beyond profitability, the company’s stock price remains overvalued, and after rising 83% last year and 25% YTD, it carries large downside risk. More on that later. Affirm has not reported positive operating profit in any fiscal year of my company model, which dates back to fiscal 2019. The company has not generated positive Core Earnings since fiscal 2019 either. This fact begs the question, how does Affirm report positive GAAP net income if reported operating profit and calculated Core Earnings are negative? The answer is non-operating income or income unrelated to its core business. In fiscal 2025, Affirm reported an operating loss of -$87 million. However, the company reported $149 million in “Other Income, net” on its income statement. This other income is interest earned on money market funds included in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and interest earned on securities available for sale, among other items. In other words, Affirm has a lot of cash and securities from all the stock it has sold, and that’s where it gets the income to generate positive GAAP net income, not from its core operation. I leverage my firm’s Robo-Analyst AI Agent to calculate Core Earnings, a proven superior earnings measure that excludes these unusual gains/losses. In doing so, I find that Affirm’s Core Earnings remain negative at -$78 million in Fiscal 2025. Figure 1 provides a reconciliation from GAAP Net Income to Core Earnings. Figure 1: Affirm’s GAAP Net Income to Core Earnings Reconciliation: Fiscal 2025 In Affirm’s quest to take market share, it has adopted a growth-at-all-costs approach, even going so far as stating “growth is always the answer” in the company’s fiscal 4Q24 shareholder letter. Total operating expenses, which include loss on loan purchase commitment, provision for credit losses, funding costs, processing and servicing, technology and data analytics, sales and marketing, general and administrative, and restructuring and other were 103% of revenue in fiscal 2025, which further explains why, as noted above, reported operating income is negative. When I first named Affirm a Zombie Stock in September 2022 it had enough cash on hand to sustain its cash burn for another 10 months. Affirm slowed its FCF burn from -$814 million in fiscal 2024 to -$425 million in fiscal 2025. The lower, yet still negative, FCF means Affirm no longer qualifies as a Zombie Stock because it has enough cash on hand to sustain its fiscal 2025 FCF burn for 61 months from the end of September 2025. Despite positive GAAP net income, Affirm continues to burn through cash each year. Affirm’s free cash flow (FCF) has been negative on an annual basis in every year since fiscal 2019. On a quarterly basis, FCF has been negative in 14 of the 15 quarters over the same time. In fiscal 2025, the company burned -$425 million in FCF excluding acquisitions. From fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2025, Affirm burned through a cumulative $5.1 billion (18% of enterprise value) in FCF excluding acquisitions. See Figure 2. Figure 2: Affirm’s Cumulative Free Cash Flow: Fiscal 2020 – Fiscal 2025 Per Figure 3, Affirm’s shares outstanding increased from 47 million in fiscal 2019 to 323 million in fiscal 2025. Whether through new share issuances or stock-based compensation, funding the business with new investors capital is not sustainable and not that different from a ponzi scheme. Figure 3: Affirm’s Shares Outstanding: Fiscal 2019 Through Fiscal 2025 In my recent report on Klarna (KLAR), one of Affirm’s key competitors, I pointed out how a growth-at-all-costs strategy can be successful in attracting users and growing GMV. In fact, Klarna used this approach to grow both users and GMV than traditional buy-now pay later peers Affirm and Afterpay (owned by Block, ticker XYZ). However, compared to PayPal (PYPL), the pure-play BNPL companies are miniscule. PayPal generated $1.7 trillion in total payment volume (TPV) in the TTM, with upwards of 434 million users/accounts. The scale and ubiquity of PayPal create strong competitive advantages, which ultimately manifest in higher margins and profitable operations. Figure 4: Comparing Users and GMV: BNPL Competitors: TTM * User data from end of 2023, when Afterpay last disclosed users**Annualized based on latest disclosed GMV of $8.24 billion in 3Q24 Payment plans or installment loans may look more attractive in an economic slowdown and as affordability of everyday items decreases. But such a slowdown doesn’t make one BNPL firm more attractive than another. Ultimately, each company is offering a largely undifferentiated product. Of buy now pay later (BNPL) users, PayPal (PYPL) is the clear top choice, with 56% of BNPL users having used PayPal, compared to 38% for Affirm. Additionally, merchants and retailers benefit from BNPL providers like Affirm and Klarna, which assume the credit risk of payment in return for a small fee paid by the merchant. Sure, Affirm gains users and GMV, but this structure leaves BNPL firms exposed to all the risk of payment. A recent study from LendingTree found that 41% of BNPL users say they paid late in the past year, which is up from 34% a year ago. Given these dynamics, it shouldn’t be surprising that the two pure-play BNPL companies are only competitors that don’t generate an ROIC and NOPAT margin above 0%. See Figure 5. Each of the other competitors, including PayPal (PYPL), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), American Express (AXP), Synchrony Financial (SYF), and others have more profitable business lines that can offset offering 0% interest loans and payment plans. Figure 5: Affirm Profitability Vs. Competitors: TTM Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to analyze the future cash flow expectations baked into Affirm’s stock price. I also present an additional DCF scenario to highlight the downside risk in the stock if Affirm fails to achieve the overly optimistic expectations in the current stock price. To justify its current price of $76/share, my model shows that Affirm would have to: In this scenario, Affirm’s revenue would reach $42.8 billion in fiscal 2035, or 13.3 times higher than the company’s fiscal 2025 revenue and 110% of Visa’s TTM revenue. In this scenario, Affirm’s NOPAT would reach $6.6 billion in fiscal 2035, or 1.3x PayPal’s TTM NOPAT and 2.8x Block’s TTM NOPAT. If I assume Affirm maintains a revenue to GMV rate of just under 9% (equal to fiscal 2025), then this scenario implies Affirm’s GMV in fiscal 2035 equals $487 billion compared to fiscal 2025 GMV of $37 billion. For context, Amazon’s (AMZN) 2024 (calendar year) U.S. GMV is estimated at $792 billion. In other words, Affirm would need to generate nearly two-thirds the GMV of Amazon to justify its current stock price. Also keep in mind, companies that grow revenue by 20%+ compounded annually for such a long period are also “unbelievably rare”, making the expectations in Affirm’s valuation even more unrealistic. If I instead assume: the stock would be worth just $45/share today – a 41% downside to the current price. In this scenario, Affirm’s revenue would reach $23.0 billion in fiscal 2035, or 7.1 times higher than the company’s fiscal 2025 revenue and 97% of Block’s TTM revenue. In this scenario, Affirm’s NOPAT would reach $3.6 billion in fiscal 2035, or nearly equal to Synchrony’s TTM NOPAT. If I again assume Affirm maintains a revenue to GMV rate of just under 9%, then this scenario implies Affirm’s GMV in fiscal 2035 equals just under $262 billion, up from $37 billion in fiscal 2025. Lastly, if I assume: the stock would be worth just $28/share today – a 63% downside to the current price. This scenario still implies that Affirm generates $2.3 billion in NOPAT in fiscal 2035. Figure 6 compares Affirm’s implied future NOPAT in these scenarios to its historical NOPAT. For reference, I include PayPal and Block’s TTM NOPAT. Figure 6: Affirm’s Historical and Implied NOPAT: DCF Valuation Scenarios Each of the above scenarios assume Affirm grows revenue, NOPAT, and FCF without increasing working capital or fixed assets. This assumption is highly unlikely but allows me to create best-case scenarios that demonstrate the high level of expectations embedded in the current valuation. For reference, Affirm’s invested capital has grown 32% compounded annually since fiscal 2019. If I assume Affirm’s invested capital increases at a similar rate in the DCF scenarios above, the downside risk is even larger. Given that the performance required to justify its current price is overly optimistic, I dig deeper to see if Affirm is worth buying at any price. The answer is no. The company owes $32 million in total debt, has $728 million in outstanding employee stock option liabilities, $695 in minority interests, and has no excess cash. Affirm has an economic book value, or no growth value, of -$2/share. In other words I do not think equity investors will ever see $1 of economic earnings under normal operations, which means the stock would be worth $0 today.

I first put Affirm Holdings (AFRM) in the Danger Zone in October 2021, reiterated my bearish opinion most recently in October 2024, and named it a Zombie Stock in September 2022. GAAP profits may have investors re-thinking this company, so I believe now is a great time to remind investors how GAAP net income is misleading and show how AFRM remains overvalued. Affirm continues to grow its top-line at impressive levels. In fiscal 4Q25, revenue and gross merchandise volume (GMV) grew 33% and 43% year-over-year (YoY), respectively. For the full year of fiscal 2025, Affirm grew revenue and GMV 39% and 38% YoY, respectively. The company also successfully onboarded new customers and merchants, with active consumers and active merchants rising 23% and 24% YoY respectively in fiscal 2025. Perhaps most noteworthy – at least to investors that don’t look beyond the surface numbers – Affirm generated positive GAAP net income in fiscal 2025, a first since fiscal 2019. While Affirm reports positive top-line growth and GAAP net income, a deeper analysis, one that accounts for the footnotes and MD&A of company filings, reveals a different picture. Beyond profitability, the company’s stock price remains overvalued, and after rising 83% last year and 25% YTD, it carries large downside risk. More on that later. Affirm has not reported positive operating profit in any fiscal year of my company model, which dates back to fiscal 2019. The company has not generated positive Core Earnings since fiscal 2019 either. This fact begs the question, how does Affirm report positive GAAP net income if reported operating profit and calculated Core Earnings are negative? The answer is non-operating income or income unrelated to its core business. In fiscal 2025, Affirm reported an operating loss of -$87 million. However, the company reported $149 million in “Other Income, net” on its income statement. This other income is interest earned on money market funds included in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and interest earned on securities available for sale, among other items. In other words, Affirm has a lot of cash and securities from all the stock it has sold, and that’s where it gets the income to generate positive GAAP net income, not from its core operation. I leverage my firm’s Robo-Analyst AI Agent to calculate Core Earnings, a proven superior earnings measure that excludes these unusual gains/losses. In doing so, I find that Affirm’s Core Earnings remain negative at -$78 million in Fiscal 2025. Figure 1 provides a reconciliation from GAAP Net Income to Core Earnings. Figure 1: Affirm’s GAAP Net Income to Core Earnings Reconciliation: Fiscal 2025 In Affirm’s quest to take market share, it has adopted a growth-at-all-costs approach, even going so far as stating “growth is always the answer” in the company’s fiscal 4Q24 shareholder letter. Total operating expenses, which include loss on loan purchase commitment, provision for credit losses, funding costs, processing and servicing, technology and data analytics, sales and marketing, general and administrative, and restructuring and other were 103% of revenue in fiscal 2025, which further explains why, as noted above, reported operating income is negative. When I first named Affirm a Zombie Stock in September 2022 it had enough cash on hand to sustain its cash burn for another 10 months. Affirm slowed its FCF burn from -$814 million in fiscal 2024 to -$425 million in fiscal 2025. The lower, yet still negative, FCF means Affirm no longer qualifies as a Zombie Stock because it has enough cash on hand to sustain its fiscal 2025 FCF burn for 61 months from the end of September 2025. Despite positive GAAP net income, Affirm continues to burn through cash each year. Affirm’s free cash flow (FCF) has been negative on an annual basis in every year since fiscal 2019. On a quarterly basis, FCF has been negative in 14 of the 15 quarters over the same time. In fiscal 2025, the company burned -$425 million in FCF excluding acquisitions. From fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2025, Affirm burned through a cumulative $5.1 billion (18% of enterprise value) in FCF excluding acquisitions. See Figure 2. Figure 2: Affirm’s Cumulative Free Cash Flow: Fiscal 2020 – Fiscal 2025 Per Figure 3, Affirm’s shares outstanding increased from 47 million in fiscal 2019 to 323 million in fiscal 2025. Whether through new share issuances or stock-based compensation, funding the business with new investors capital is not sustainable and not that different from a ponzi scheme. Figure 3: Affirm’s Shares Outstanding: Fiscal 2019 Through Fiscal 2025 In my recent report on Klarna (KLAR), one of Affirm’s key competitors, I pointed out how a growth-at-all-costs strategy can be successful in attracting users and growing GMV. In fact, Klarna used this approach to grow both users and GMV than traditional buy-now pay later peers Affirm and Afterpay (owned by Block, ticker XYZ). However, compared to PayPal (PYPL), the pure-play BNPL companies are miniscule. PayPal generated $1.7 trillion in total payment volume (TPV) in the TTM, with upwards of 434 million users/accounts. The scale and ubiquity of PayPal create strong competitive advantages, which ultimately manifest in higher margins and profitable operations. Figure 4: Comparing Users and GMV: BNPL Competitors: TTM * User data from end of 2023, when Afterpay last disclosed users**Annualized based on latest disclosed GMV of $8.24 billion in 3Q24 Payment plans or installment loans may look more attractive in an economic slowdown and as affordability of everyday items decreases. But such a slowdown doesn’t make one BNPL firm more attractive than another. Ultimately, each company is offering a largely undifferentiated product. Of buy now pay later (BNPL) users, PayPal (PYPL) is the clear top choice, with 56% of BNPL users having used PayPal, compared to 38% for Affirm. Additionally, merchants and retailers benefit from BNPL providers like Affirm and Klarna, which assume the credit risk of payment in return for a small fee paid by the merchant. Sure, Affirm gains users and GMV, but this structure leaves BNPL firms exposed to all the risk of payment. A recent study from LendingTree found that 41% of BNPL users say they paid late in the past year, which is up from 34% a year ago. Given these dynamics, it shouldn’t be surprising that the two pure-play BNPL companies are only competitors that don’t generate an ROIC and NOPAT margin above 0%. See Figure 5. Each of the other competitors, including PayPal (PYPL), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), American Express (AXP), Synchrony Financial (SYF), and others have more profitable business lines that can offset offering 0% interest loans and payment plans. Figure 5: Affirm Profitability Vs. Competitors: TTM Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to analyze the future cash flow expectations baked into Affirm’s stock price. I also present an additional DCF scenario to highlight the downside risk in the stock if Affirm fails to achieve the overly optimistic expectations in the current stock price. To justify its current price of $76/share, my model shows that Affirm would have to: In this scenario, Affirm’s revenue would reach $42.8 billion in fiscal 2035, or 13.3 times higher than the company’s fiscal 2025 revenue and 110% of Visa’s TTM revenue. In this scenario, Affirm’s NOPAT would reach $6.6 billion in fiscal 2035, or 1.3x PayPal’s TTM NOPAT and 2.8x Block’s TTM NOPAT. If I assume Affirm maintains a revenue to GMV rate of just under 9% (equal to fiscal 2025), then this scenario implies Affirm’s GMV in fiscal 2035 equals $487 billion compared to fiscal 2025 GMV of $37 billion. For context, Amazon’s (AMZN) 2024 (calendar year) U.S. GMV is estimated at $792 billion. In other words, Affirm would need to generate nearly two-thirds the GMV of Amazon to justify its current stock price. Also keep in mind, companies that grow revenue by 20%+ compounded annually for such a long period are also “unbelievably rare”, making the expectations in Affirm’s valuation even more unrealistic. If I instead assume: the stock would be worth just $45/share today – a 41% downside to the current price. In this scenario, Affirm’s revenue would reach $23.0 billion in fiscal 2035, or 7.1 times higher than the company’s fiscal 2025 revenue and 97% of Block’s TTM revenue. In this scenario, Affirm’s NOPAT would reach $3.6 billion in fiscal 2035, or nearly equal to Synchrony’s TTM NOPAT. If I again assume Affirm maintains a revenue to GMV rate of just under 9%, then this scenario implies Affirm’s GMV in fiscal 2035 equals just under $262 billion, up from $37 billion in fiscal 2025. Lastly, if I assume: the stock would be worth just $28/share today – a 63% downside to the current price. This scenario still implies that Affirm generates $2.3 billion in NOPAT in fiscal 2035. Figure 6 compares Affirm’s implied future NOPAT in these scenarios to its historical NOPAT. For reference, I include PayPal and Block’s TTM NOPAT. Figure 6: Affirm’s Historical and Implied NOPAT: DCF Valuation Scenarios Each of the above scenarios assume Affirm grows revenue, NOPAT, and FCF without increasing working capital or fixed assets. This assumption is highly unlikely but allows me to create best-case scenarios that demonstrate the high level of expectations embedded in the current valuation. For reference, Affirm’s invested capital has grown 32% compounded annually since fiscal 2019. If I assume Affirm’s invested capital increases at a similar rate in the DCF scenarios above, the downside risk is even larger. Given that the performance required to justify its current price is overly optimistic, I dig deeper to see if Affirm is worth buying at any price. The answer is no. The company owes $32 million in total debt, has $728 million in outstanding employee stock option liabilities, $695 in minority interests, and has no excess cash. Affirm has an economic book value, or no growth value, of -$2/share. In other words I do not think equity investors will ever see $1 of economic earnings under normal operations, which means the stock would be worth $0 today.

Title: Amazon laid off over 14,000 people this week—but Wall Street is loving it anyway

The mighty heft of Amazon is hoisting the U.S. stock market higher on Friday. The S&P 500 rose 0.6%, erasing much of its slump from the day before and nearing its all-time high set on Tuesday. The index is on track to close a third straight winning week and a sixth straight winning month, which would be its longest monthly winning streak since 2021. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 37 points, or 0.1%, as of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.3% higher. Amazon led the way after jumping 11.6%. The retail giant was by far the strongest force lifting the S&P 500 after reporting profit for the latest quarter that blew past analysts’ expectations. CEO Andy Jassy said growth for its booming huge cloud-computing business has reaccelerated back to a pace it hasn’t seen since 2022. Apple also helped lift the market after its stock added 0.3%. It likewise delivered a better profit report than analysts expected, though by not as big a margin as Amazon did. CEO Tim Cook said it benefited from strong revenue for both its iPhone lineup and its services offerings, which include its app store. The two Big Tech profit reports were the among most important on Wall Street Friday because Amazon, worth roughly $2.4 trillion, and Apple, at over $4 trillion, are two of the biggest companies in the market. They alone account for 10.6% of the S&P 500’s total value, even though they make up just 0.4% of its membership. That means their stock movements can carry more weight on the S&P 500 index, which sits at the heart of many 401(k) accounts, than hundreds of other stocks. Elsewhere on Wall Street, online message board Reddit jumped 14.7% to erase losses from earlier in the week after reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Coinbase Global rose 3.2% after the crypto exchange’s profit likewise topped expectations. Outside of earnings reports, Netflix added 1.9% after the video streamer announced a move that could make its stock price more affordable but still leave all its investors holding the same amount. Netflix will undergo a 10-for-1 stock split, where it will give nine additional shares to every investor with one. They helped offset a 3.7% drop for AbbVie, even though the medicine maker reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than expected. Analysts pointed to how it’s beating forecasts by less than before, and expectations may have been high after AbbVie came into the day with a strong 28.4% gain for the year so far. The pressure is on companies to deliver strong growth in profits to help justify the huge gains their stock prices have made since April. Criticism has been growing that the stock market has become too expensive. Friday’s overall gains helped Wall Street recover from Thursday’s slump, when the S&P 500 fell 1%. Investors appeared unnerved by big increases in spending that Meta Platforms and Microsoft are planning as the investment spree related to artificial-intelligence technology keeps gushing. Financial markets also appeared skeptical that President Donald Trump’s trade truce with China would put an end to tensions between the two countries. In stock markets abroad, indexes dipped in Europe following a mixed finish in Asia Friday. Stocks fell 1.4% in Hong Kong and 0.8% in Shanghai after data showed factory activity in China contracted in October for a seventh straight month and at the fastest pace in six months. Japan’s Nikkei 225, meanwhile, jumped 2.1% to another record index after a report showed industrial production rose 2.2% month-on-month in September, beating market expectations. In the bond market, Treasury yields eased a bit after their spurt higher in the middle of the week, when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned markets that another cut to interest rates in December “is not a foregone conclusion — far from it.” The yield on the 10-year Treasury dipped to 4.08% from 4.11% late Thursday, but it’s still above the 3.99% level it was at before Powell’s warning. ___ AP Business Writers Teresa Cerojano and Matt Ott contributed. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: WealthStack Roundup: Orion to Rollout Denali AI in 2026

AI announcements from Orion, SS&C and Boosted.ai and alts tech news from Envestnet and SignatureFD with CAIS. October 31, 2025 Wealthtech provider Orion announced Denali AI this week, the company’s new enterprise intelligence platform that will power what the company is referring to as its AI-first ecosystem, when it is fully available. For now, the technology remains in beta with select Orion advisory firm clients. Broad availability is expected sometime in 2026 at which time details on pricing and other aspects of Denali will be provided, according to the firm. The AI has been built to connect every system and workflow across the Orion technology ecosystem. On the Orion website, the company calls the technology “Your Firm’s AI Command Center,” stating it was designed to provide a firm’s administrators with full control and visibility into their AI environment, including usage data, activity logs and other connected sources and will be where firms define their AI-related configurations, set and align policies, and ensure that the AI matches a firm’s compliance and governance standards. “Orion Denali AI is the cornerstone of Orion’s future … by combining automation that expands capacity, insights that anticipate client needs, and intelligence that supports better decisions,” said Reed Colley, president of Orion Advisor Technology, in a statement. Orion demonstrated artificial intelligence assistants and other AI-driven features at the Future Proof conference in September. Related:Financial Monitoring Application Carefull Announces AI This week, Envestnet announced the launch of two managed model portfolios that include interval funds on its platform. The new funds are available through Envestnet’s Strategist UMA. The new models integrate semi-liquid and liquid strategies, enabling seamless allocation to alternatives with point-and-click simplicity, according to Dana D'Auria, co-CIO and Group President of Envestnet Solutions, in a statement. The first two models are from Franklin Templeton and BlackRock, with others slated for 2026 from Fidelity Investments and State Street. The Franklin Templeton fund has five risk-based options ranging from Conservative to Aggressive. The portfolio will incorporate a 10% allocation to alternatives. The BlackRock fund is a multi-asset income fund with private market models and incorporates public and private credit, covered call strategies and dividend-focused equities. Neither fund will require subscription documents, and both provide simplified tax reporting. Last week, Envestnet announced the appointment of Bhaskar Peddhapati as chief technology officer. He will be responsible for all aspects of technology, engineering and information security across the company. He most recently ran the mortgage technology team at Cotality (formerly CoreLogic). Related:WealthStack Roundup: bQuest Joins The Founders Arena SS&C this week announced the launch of its AI agent catalogue. The available agents, which were developed, tested and used within SS&C prior to their external availability, range in their use cases from trade reconciliation and validation to contract analysis. The agents are delivered as a managed service, designed to help organizations overcome talent shortages and operational bottlenecks. Annuity carrier American Life, an SS&C customer, for example, is currently evaluating SS&C’s Credit Agreement Document Agent for possible use in streamlining the processing of its private credit operations by having the AI agent review and update lengthy loan documents. The agents in its catalogue have been built using SS&C’s AI Gateway, which provides secure, auditable access to large language models and employs real-time guardrails for advanced security and data loss protection, real-time risk monitoring, and explainability of actions. And SS&C offers a range of deployment options, including hosting the AI Agents and AI Gateway on its own privately owned GPU infrastructure in ISO-compliant data centers, ensuring full custody of client data. Boosted.ai has launched voice-powered AI research agents, making it the first investment research platform that enables analysts and advisors to converse with a research agent in real-time. Boosted.ai has integrated the natural language voice technology from ElevenLabs, meaning that those employing Boosted.ai’s Alfa agent can speak to it naturally, in real time, when making queries. In a prepared statement, Boosted.ai provided the following hypothetical to illustrate how a verbal conversation might proceed: Portfolio Manager: “Hey Alfa, look at companies in the S&P 500 with a dividend yield over 2% and a price-to-earnings ratio greater than 15. Then read earnings transcripts, SEC filings, and news for those stocks over the last 3 months and summarize their exposure to China.” Boosted.ai Alfa response: “I’ve identified 27 names, concentrated in industrials, consumer staples, and energy. A significant number have meaningful exposure to China, both as a revenue source and a supply chain dependency. Would you like me to group them by sector or by level of exposure?” While not a household name for most financial advisors, Boosted.ai launched in 2017 and is perhaps better known to asset and investment managers; it raised $15 million in funding last November. SignatureFD Partners with CAIS, DFA, Axcelus on Tax-Advantaged PPLI Vehicle SignatureFD, an RIA with $10 billion in assets, launched AutographFD, an operating division that will allow investors to allocate money to both public and private investment strategies within the tax-advantaged private placement life insurance wrapper. The RIA is partnering with alternative investment platform CAIS on private strategies, Dimensional Fund Advisors on public strategies and Innovator on defined outcome strategies. Autograph has incorporated AI into its platform to educate investors on alternative strategies and streamline the process of getting PPLI for clients. Axcelus Financial, with which SignatureFD has a long-term relationship, will be providing the insurance. According to Doug Liptak, chief strategy officer at SigntureFD and founder of AutographFD, PPLI has traditionally been available on the very high end of the private investor market, to family offices with over $100 million in assets. AutographFD makes PPLI available to qualified purchasers with $3-million-plus in investable assets, although the average users will likely be investors with $10 million in assets. Liptak noted that both end-investors and outside financial advisors have responded to news of AutographFD development with enthusiasm since it allows for tax-free growth of PPLI investments and simplified administration, with no K-1 forms, capital calls or subscription documents that need to be signed. “It’s a better way to access alternatives from a tax-free standpoint,” he said. “Autograph allows you to do it all inside an institutionally priced policy and then get the tax benefits.” Davis Janowski Senior Technology Editor, WealthManagement.com Davis Janowski is a New York-based technology journalist whose work spans consumer, business and the FinTech sectors.

Title: Amazon hoists Wall Street toward another winning week and month

By STAN CHOE, AP Business Writer NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon led the U.S. stock market on Friday to the finish of another winning week and month. The S&P 500 rose 0.3% and pulled closer to its all-time high set on Tuesday. It closed out a third straight winning week and a sixth straight winning month, its longest monthly winning streak since 2021. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 40 points, or 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.6%. Amazon led the way and jumped 9.6%. The retail giant was by far the strongest force lifting the market after reporting profit for the latest quarter that blew past analysts’ expectations. CEO Andy Jassy said growth for its booming cloud-computing business has accelerated to a pace it hasn’t seen since 2022. Amazon’s massive size of roughly $2.4 trillion means its stock movements carry more weight on the S&P 500 than almost any other company’s. Without it, the S&P 500 would have been down for the day. Another highly influential stock, Apple, had less of an effect on the market even though it’s bigger than Amazon. The iPhone maker, which is worth more than $4 trillion, swung between modest gains and losses through the day before finishing with a dip of 0.4%. It likewise delivered a better profit report for the latest quarter than analysts expected, though by not as big a margin as Amazon did. CEO Tim Cook said it benefited from strong revenue for both its iPhone lineup and its services offerings, which include its app store. Elsewhere on Wall Street, online message board Reddit jumped 7.5% to erase losses from earlier in the week after reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Coinbase Global rose 4.6% after the crypto exchange’s profit likewise topped expectations. Outside of earnings reports, Netflix added 2.7% after the video streamer announced a move that could make its stock price more affordable but still leave all its investors holding the same amount. Netflix will undergo a 10-for-1 stock split, where it will give nine additional shares to investors for each they own. They helped offset a drop for AbbVie, which fell 4.5% even though the medicine maker reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than expected. Analysts pointed to how it’s beating forecasts by less than before, and expectations may have been high after AbbVie’s stock came into the day with a strong 28.4% gain for the year so far. The pressure is on companies broadly to deliver big growth in profits to justify the huge gains their stock prices have made since April. Criticism has been growing that the U.S. stock market has become too expensive. A day earlier, the S&P 500 slumped 1% as investors appeared unnerved by big increases in spending that Meta Platforms and Microsoft are planning as part of the investment spree underway in artificial-intelligence technology. Financial markets also appeared skeptical that President Donald Trump’s trade truce with China would put an end to tensions between the two countries. Additional drops on Friday of 1.5% for Microsoft and 2.7% for Meta were the two heaviest weights on the U.S. market. All told, the S&P 500 rose 17.86 points to 6,840.20. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 40.75 to 47,562.87, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 143.81 to 23,724.96. In stock markets abroad, indexes dipped in Europe following a mixed finish in Asia. Stocks fell 1.4% in Hong Kong and 0.8% in Shanghai after data showed factory activity in China contracted in October for a seventh straight month. Japan’s Nikkei 225, meanwhile, jumped 2.1% to another record after a report showed industrial production rose more in September than expected. In the bond market, Treasury yields eased following their spurt higher in the middle of the week, when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that another cut to interest rates in December “is not a foregone conclusion — far from it.” The yield on the 10-year Treasury dipped to 4.09% from 4.11% late Thursday, though it’s still above the 3.99% level it was at before Powell’s warning. Other central banks have halted cuts to rates or hinted at pauses recently, and “it seems this is it for the 2025 easing season in developed economies,” economists at Bank of America wrote in a BofA Global Research report.

Title: Netflix Stock Is Set for a 10-for-1 Split. What You Need To Know
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/netflix-stock-is-set-for-10-for-1-split-what-you-need-to-know-11840971
Time Published: 2025-10-31T14:52:09Z
Full Content:
Netflix said it plans to undergo a 10-for-1 stock split, in a move that could make its stock more accessible to a wider range of investors. The split, which is set to take place after the closing bell on Friday, Nov. 14, means shareholders will receive nine new Netflix (NFLX) shares for every one they owned heading into the split. Their overall stake in the company won’t change because of it, but each share will subsequently be worth about 10% of its price before the split took effect. Trading at the split-adjusted price is scheduled to begin when the market opens on Monday, Nov. 17. Netflix said the change is meant to “reset the market price of the Company's common stock to a range that will be more accessible to employees who participate in the Company's stock option program.” That could also make it more attractive to investors outside the company who may have shied away from the stock at its recent levels after a run-up this year. Shares of Netflix were up over 3% around $1,123 in recent trading, bringing their year-to-date gains to about 26%, outpacing the broader S&P 500's roughly 16% over the same period. Netflix’s 10-for-1 stock split follows similar moves by large-cap tech companies looking to make their shares more affordable to employees and retail investors. Stock splits can help boost liquidity and make trading easier for buyers and sellers. Though Netflix shares took a hit earlier this month after the company's third-quarter earnings missed analysts' estimates due to a one-time tax expense in Brazil, it's been a strong year for the streaming giant's stock, which has benefited from a well-received slate of content and expectations of continued growth, along with the perception that it's relatively insulated from shifting tariff policies. The decision to undergo a split, typically considered a positive signal by investors, could also point to confidence in further gains ahead for Netflix. By contrast, reverse stock splits—which consolidate shares to raise the price of each individual share—are often taken as a sign of concern about a marked decline in the price of a stock.

Title: This Stock Market Bubble Is Not Real (This 8% Dividend Proves It)

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Are we in a stock market bubble or not? Let’s tackle that question head-on, because it’s all we seem to be hearing about these days. I’ll put my cards on the table: We’re not in a bubble. I’m going to show you why I’m still bullish on stocks at these levels. Then we’re going to play overwrought bubble fears with a “cornerstone” fund that’s beaten stocks over just about every timeline but is still cheap (and yields a rich 8%, too). When it comes to stocks, the truth is, there’s a good reason why they keep rising: We’re in a booming economy. Of course, you might not feel that way—many communities across America are suffering. Income inequality, crime, corruption—it’s a mess out there. Those are all serious problems, to be sure. But just as the stock market is not the economy, the stock market is not society, either, and those problems can co-exist with a rising market. Stocks are rising because their moves are tied to one thing: earnings. And earnings are soaring. Bloomberg recently reported on something we’ve been talking about for a while here at Contrarian Outlook and in my CEF Insider service: Earnings are growing as companies improve their profits through efficiency gains, some of which are driven by AI. In fact, the earnings beats we’re seeing come from across the economy, from companies as diverse as General Motors (GM), Coca-Cola (KO), Morgan Stanley (MS) and, of course, tech names like Broadcom (AVGO) and Lam Research (LRCX). While tech continues to be the top-performing sector, there’s good reason to expect that more and more gains will come from outside of tech, as new innovations spread from that sector into other parts of the economy. This doesn’t mean we should simply avoid tech and buy the rest of the market. After all, tech’s earnings gains are the strongest out there and will likely remain so, although financials are a close second. At a time like this, we want broad-based market exposure. But of course, as my CEF Insider members know, we do not want an index fund. Their paltry 1% yields are just plain unacceptable to us income investors. Instead, we’re going with a closed-end fund (CEF) that invests in a broad range of S&P 500 stocks, but with a key difference: This one pays a rich 8% yield. That would be the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), which holds tech darlings like Broadcom, as well as top performers from other sectors, like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM). Thanks to its well-crafted portfolio, ADX hasn’t just matched the stock market’s returns over the last decade—it’s beaten it. This is why, at CEF Insider, we’ve been holding ADX for almost the entire time shown on this chart (and we would’ve held it for the entire time if CEF Insider had launched in 2015, rather than in 2017). This outperformance is great—but so is the dividend. ADX has yielded around 9.5% over the last decade, thanks to the huge special payouts management issued at year-end. But in 2024, the fund changed its distribution plans, going with a more evenly spread payout tied to the fund’s net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio). Now, ADX’s regular distributions are more consistent and reliable. The fund pays about 8% now, largely because the stock price is up over 13% in 2025 (as prices rise, yields fall). But its total return including dividends is 21.7% for the year, as of this writing, again far ahead of the S&P 500, at 16.6%. In other words, this fund has outperformed over the short and the long term. Yet it still trades at a discount to NAV. ADX’s discount is now 8.3%, but it was over 10% at the start of the year (and was around 12% most of the time before that). With the fund’s high yield, market outperformance and smartly built portfolio, this discount is likely to disappear, especially as more money comes into stocks as bubble fears fade. If you buy ADX today, you can still lock in this discount, boosting your upside potential while also securing that healthy yield. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

ByJJ Kinahan, Senior Contributor. Key Takeaways -Tech gets a confidence boost -Some sector rotation is happening -Market still digesting Fed meeting Amazon.com and Apple are going to kick us off in a big way today as the market continues to drive higher. It is very encouraging to see two of the stalwarts of the market be the further drivers of the rally. In fact, Amazon.com crushed earnings as the closely watch AWS end of the company beat and helped round out a very solid earnings report. In the case of Apple, they beat on iPhone sales and gives great confidence to the overall market, but to the tech sector in particular. We will talk about earnings more in a bit. Let’s take a look at what happened in yesterday’s session. We saw the market stumble a bit yesterday as the tech stocks gave a much cloudier picture. Yesterday was a tale of two cities as Alphabet had a 2.5% gain on the day with a strong quarterly report. Much of this was driven by advertising and cloud businesses. These were two very widely followed areas by analysts and they certainly were happy with what they saw. When you put up $100 Billion in Quarterly Earnings that sends a large message. META Platforms, however, were the other end of the spectrum. The stock was down over 11% on the day. This was primarily due to concern over expenses rising faster than expected and a one-time tax charge of $16 Billion. One other stock that stumbled of note yesterday was Chipotle Mexican Grill which was down 18,2%, making it the biggest loser in the S&P 500. The company reported a struggle with the 25–34-year-old cohort of customers (worth watching) and with that missed on the Quarter and lowered yearly outlook As we head to todays Halloween trading action, as mentioned Apple and Amazon have us off to a great start on the day. Some of the other earnings we wanted to mention are from the Energy Sector. Exxon Mobil Corporation reported earnings that slightly missed expectations and continued the lower year-over-year trend. Much of that is due to the lower price of Crude Oil and the stock is down slightly. Chevron Corporation is mostly unchanged as the earnings also fell year over year, but they did top estimates The other things to watch all revolve around the rotating of Investor expectations. That is one of the things that many have pointed out is a seeming rotation by some of the large firms from an incredibly strong weighted tech sector to the Financial and Pharmaceutical sectors. We also have a seeming “trade truce” between the US and China. We know that this is a fragile partnership and one that has the investing community nervous. The last one to keep in mind is the constantly changing probabilities of a December rate cut after the Fed comments on Wednesday. This will be a constant subject for us to visit over the next few weeks as Investors try to digest what this means. As always stay with your long-term Investment goals and stick with your trading plan Have a Happy and Safe Halloween!

The market responded tepidly, underscoring the weight of broader supply concerns and signaling that short-term inventory shifts are not enough to reset sentiment. OPEC+ Output Strategy Continues to Pressure Market Tone Bearish pressure intensified as it became increasingly likely that OPEC+ will move forward with an additional production increase of 137,000 barrels per day in December. This would follow a series of gradual output hikes already totaling over 2.7 million bpd since earlier this year. While not massive in isolation, the planned increase reinforces the perception that major producers are confident supply is sufficient — even in the face of subdued demand expectations. The group’s formal decision, expected at its upcoming meeting, is being closely watched. While the market is not anticipating a reversal, any indication of restraint could offer relief. For now, the bias remains toward looser policy and an expanding supply backdrop. Russia Sanctions Create Noise, But No Physical Tightness Yet Earlier optimism tied to fresh U.S. sanctions on Russian oil majors quickly faded. Although some key buyers in India and China paused new purchases, analysts noted that Russian flows remain uninterrupted. Lukoil’s decision to divest international assets was the most visible response, but materially, no disruption in seaborne supply has occurred. With Russia continuing to offer discounts and utilize shadow shipping fleets, traders are increasingly treating the sanctions as headline noise rather than a meaningful constraint. The International Energy Agency (IEA) reinforced this view, noting that ample global spare capacity continues to buffer the system against minor geopolitical disruptions. US-China Trade Truce Seen as Symbolic, Not Structural Markets briefly found support following a modest thaw in U.S.–China trade relations. In exchange for China resuming U.S. soybean purchases and committing to fentanyl enforcement and rare earth exports, Washington agreed to reduce tariffs for one year. While the deal was initially welcomed as a step in the right direction, it lacked depth. Analysts characterized it as a truce rather than a turning point, and crude traders largely agreed. The absence of structural reform or long-term trade clarity meant there was little basis to revise demand forecasts materially higher. In effect, the agreement softened downside risk without generating fresh upside momentum. Fed Rate Cut Adds Macro Support, But Momentum Is Lacking The Federal Reserve’s quarter-point rate cut on Wednesday offered a mild boost to risk sentiment. Lower borrowing costs are typically supportive for energy demand and broader commodity markets. However, the Fed hinted this may be its final cut of the year, citing government shutdown risks and a murky fiscal outlook. While the move aligns with a more accommodative global policy stance, especially as Europe and Japan keep rates on hold, the macro signal was not strong enough to overcome fundamental oil-specific concerns. With global GDP still struggling for traction, the impact on crude demand expectations remains limited. Weekly Light Crude Oil Futures Trend Indicator Analysis Light crude oil futures are in a position to close lower for the week after failing to follow through to the upside, following last week’s dramatic closing price reversal bottom. As of Thursday’s close, the market is trading $60.57, down $0.93 or -1.51%. On the upside, traders are facing its first major resistance level at the 52-week moving average at $62.29. Two minor resistance points come in at $62.50 and $62.59. Overcoming the latter will confirm the reversal bottom, but the market will still face headwinds at the long-term pivot at $63.74. We believe this price is the potential trigger point for an acceleration to the upside, with $65.95 the first target. Meanwhile, the inability to overcome the 52-week moving average will indicate that bearish traders are defending against an upside breakout. This could lead to a test of a 61.8% level at $59.44. Prices could collapse to $55.96 if the Fib level fails as support. As far as our trend indicator is concerned, we’re going to go with the 52-week moving average again. The market remains below the 52-week moving average, keeping the short-term trend bearish as we approach Friday’s open. Weekly Technical Forecast The direction of the Weekly Light Crude Oil Futures market the week ending November 7, 31 is likely to be determined by trader reaction to the 52-week moving average at $62.29. Bullish Scenario Recovering and sustaining a move over the 52-week moving average will signal the return of buyers. This move could lead to a confirmation of the previous week’s closing price reversal bottom and a bullish breakout over $63.74. Bearish Scenario A sustained move under the 52-week moving average will indicate the presence of sellers. This could fuel a sharp break into $59.44, while opening up the possibility of a retest of $55.96. Fundamental Outlook: Bearish Bias Holds with Market Awaiting Fresh Catalyst WTI crude is set to post a weekly loss heading into Friday’s session, with fundamentals offering little reason for buyers to step back in. Despite a strong U.S. inventory draw and easing trade rhetoric, the broader narrative remains centered on oversupply and policy uncertainty. OPEC+ signaling fresh output increases, and the limited impact of sanctions on Russian flows continue to weigh heavily. Unless the market receives a clear catalyst — whether from surprise OPEC+ restraint, a meaningful shift in geopolitical posture, or a sharp improvement in demand expectations — sentiment is unlikely to shift. Traders should continue to monitor key value areas for signs of demand re-engagement, but in the absence of conviction buying, the path of least resistance remains lower. Technically, trader reaction to the 52-week moving average at $62.29 sets the tone for the week. As of Thursday’s close, the market is on the weak side of this indicator, putting Light Crude Oil Futures in a weak or bearish position. To access this exclusive content...

Title: How AMZN Stock Rises To $500?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/31/how-amzn-stock-rises-to-500/
Time Published: 2025-10-31T12:31:58Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Following Amazon’s exceptional Q3 2025 earnings disclosed on October 30th, which saw the stock rise 12% in after-hours trading, the crucial question is: Is this the start of a significant surge that could elevate AMZN stock to $500 or more? It's certainly a possibility. Amazon announced earnings per share of $1.95, exceeding the expected $1.57—a 25% surprise that caught Wall Street completely off guard. Revenue reached $180.2 billion, a 13% increase year-over-year, surpassing the $177.8 billion consensus forecast. But here’s the real highlight: AWS revenue skyrocketed 20% to $33 billion, representing the strongest growth since 2022 and outpacing analyst predictions of $32.4 billion. This isn’t just about exceeding expectations—it’s about AWS demonstrating that it can compete with Microsoft Azure’s 40% growth and Google Cloud’s 34% growth in the AI era. Why is this significant for the stock price? Because it directly tackles the primary issue hindering Amazon’s valuation. Before the earnings release, AMZN had only increased by 2.2% year-to-date while the S&P 500 gained 16%. Investors were concerned that Amazon was falling behind in the AI competition. These results show a different story. In the following sections, we will explore how AMZN stock could potentially double from this point. However, if you’re looking for upside with less volatility than holding individual stocks like AMZN, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns over 105% since its inception. Why is this the case? In general, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; there’s less volatility, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. How is Amazon's AI strategy structured? Unlike competitors who rely on partnerships, Amazon is developing its own infrastructure empire. The company has just launched Project Rainier—an $11 billion AI data center in Indiana equipped with more than 500,000 Trainium 2 chips specifically intended for training Anthropic’s Claude models. What differentiates this from Microsoft or Google’s strategies? Amazon is not just hosting AI—it is also manufacturing the hardware. AWS CEO Matt Garman indicated that the company spent nearly $100 billion in capital expenditures in the past 12 months. This vertical integration grants Amazon pricing power and margin growth that competitors find difficult to match. Can AWS maintain growth of 20% or more? The evidence suggests it can. Demand for AI computing from enterprises is escalating more quickly than supply. Amazon has increased its data center capacity by 3.8 gigawatts in a year—more than any other cloud provider. With Anthropic set to utilize 1 million Amazon chips by the end of 2025, AWS has secured significant revenue predictability. What is fueling Amazon's advertising growth? The figures present a compelling narrative. Ad revenue reached $17.7 billion in Q3 2025, reflecting a 22% year-over-year increase, building on the $56.2 billion annual run rate established in 2024. Amazon's distinctive role as both a retailer and a media platform offers unrivaled targeting capabilities that command premium pricing. How does this stack up against other high-growth sectors? While AWS receives much of the attention, advertising serves as Amazon’s hidden growth driver. The introduction of ads on Prime Video broadened inventory while retaining the valuable e-commerce data that boosts the effectiveness of Amazon's ads. This dual revenue stream strategy resembles successful technology giants like Google. For more, see – Amazon’s segment financials. And what about the main retail segment? Don't underestimate the foundation. Amazon's online store generated $247 billion in 2024, and $67.4 billion in Q3 2025, accounting for 37% of total revenue. This segment isn't declining—its consistent cash flow is fueling the high-margin AWS and advertising growth that elevates valuation metrics. What needs to occur for Amazon to reach $500? Let’s analyze the scenarios. At the current price around $251 (post-earnings), Amazon is trading at approximately 35x trailing earnings. For the stock to double, we need either earnings growth, multiple expansion, or a combination of both. Can earnings double within 2-3 years? The trajectory indicates it is plausible. With AWS growing at over 20% alongside improving margins, advertising revenue potentially approaching $90-100 billion, and AI efficiencies enhancing operations, there is a pathway to over $11 per share in earnings—double the 2024 figures. Will the market accept premium multiples? This is where it becomes intriguing. If Amazon maintains its current 35x multiple on $11 earnings, that alone would elevate the stock to $385. However, companies driven by AI growth often command multiples of 40-50x. Applying a 45x multiple to $11 earnings would suggest a valuation of $495. What about the revenue growth narrative? Amazon’s guidance for Q4 2025 of $206-213 billion in revenue indicates that the company is on track for $900 billion in annual revenue within three years. This level of scale, combined with margin expansion due to AI investments, underpins premium valuations. Consider that investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be risky. Explore the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has exceeded its all-cap stock benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver robust returns for investors. Why is this? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks presented an adaptable approach to capitalize on favorable market conditions while minimizing losses when markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics. Amazon’s Q3 2025 earnings signify a potential turning point. The combination of accelerating AWS growth, booming advertising revenue, and substantial AI infrastructure investments creates multiple avenues for significant stock appreciation. The calculations supporting a rise to over $500 aren’t speculative—they're based on sound business fundamentals. With AWS sustaining over 20% growth, advertising potentially reaching $100 billion, and AI fostering margin expansion across all sectors, Amazon possesses the revenue growth and profitability trajectory to justify premium valuations. The primary catalyst is investor recognition that Amazon isn’t falling behind in the AI race—it’s constructing the infrastructure necessary to lead it. Project Rainier and the Trainium chip initiative provide distinctive advantages that competitors cannot easily replicate. For investors with a 2-3 year horizon, valuations in the range of $400-500 seem achievable.

Title: How Much Does It Matter How Much Your Robotaxi Costs To Build?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2025/10/31/how-much-does-it-matter-how-much-your-robotaxi-costs-to-build/
Time Published: 2025-10-31T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
ByBrad Templeton, Senior Contributor. Tesla hopes to have a robotaxi, and has made serious efforts to make it cheaper to manufacture. Their pilot deployments, which are not yet robotaxis as they require full time human supervision, are done in stock Tesla models Ys, costing around $55,000 to retail customers. Most other players have paid minimal attention to cost, loading up vehicles with high-cost sensors and computing, with cost estimates over $150,000 per vehicle. This difference may, it turns out, mean little, at least for the first several years. Tesla says their Cybercab design, with 2 seats, no controls, just cameras for sensing and a Tesla-designed computing chip, with a minimalist interior, will be made for about $30,000. Baidu Apollo says their design, which is now in use costs $28,000 to build. Amazon’s Zoox uses a specialized custom design currently made in small volumes that will have a very high price to start. Waymo’s new Zeekr design uses a $40,000 base vehicle--or it was before Biden’s tariffs and now Trump’s--and is estimated to add $30,000 of gear. Their Hyundai design will be somewhat more. Tesla has also recently suggested that when they offer the Cybercab to retail customers, it will have a wheel and pedals. Vehicle cost (ie. depreciation per mile) is indeed the largest of several components of the “cost of goods sold” for a robotaxi, but it’s only about 25% of that cost. Other elements like depots, cleaning, charging, maintenance, insurance/crashes, customer service and remote ops and more add up to the rest. The COGS determine your gross margin. If somebody uses a vehicle that costs 25% more, it’s only going to increase the total COGS/mile by 7-10%. In a mature, commodity market, this would either mean thinner margins, or slightly higher prices to customers. But we’re not in a mature, commodity market, and we won’t be for quite some time. Both because the technology is new and evolving, and because in many cities, there won’t be competition for years to come. (There won’t even be service for years to come in many towns. There are still mid-sized towns without Uber.) Where there is competition, price won’t be nothing, but it will be one of many factors. Companies that are using a more expensive vehicle will do so for a reason, usually a reason that seeks to attract more customers. Zoox’s custom vehicle is expensive, but it offers bidirectional driving, face to face seating and big side windows. Zoox hopes that customers will prefer their vehicle, even at a slightly higher price. Waymo’s Jaguars are luxury vehicles with leather seats, more like UberComfort or even UberBlack, which customers pay more for. Today, of course, the extra sensors and computing make an overwhelming difference. The companies with these sensors (notably LIDAR) have operating unsupervised robotaxis, and have for 6 years in the case of Waymo. Nobody without a LIDAR has a working robotaxi; they just hope to. You can’t get a bigger difference than that, and everybody hopes for what is a literal first mover advantage. If the cost is found in sensors and other digital electronics, we know what happens to the price of such things with time and scale--they plummet, and I mean really plummet, by orders of magnitude. With other car parts, it’s a miracle to make them 20% cheaper. With digital electronics it’s very strange if they don’t get 10 times cheaper, in some cases a billion times cheaper. Tesla is good at making cars, though the Chinese are better at making them cheaper. Only tariffs prevent the Chinese automakers from winning any price war, and that’s not a long term answer. There are a few other costs which can come down--Tesla hopes to reduce the cost of mapping, but that’s a very small component of the COGS. They are the leader in charging, though they have selected a totally new charging approach for the CyberCab, putting them on an even footing with the others who also must find automatic charging methods. Tesla hopes their all-camera approach will work. If it does, then the expensive sensors in all the working robotaxis no longer provide any advantage, they are cost with no benefit. The others bet that’s not the case. If their bet turns out to be wrong, the question will be how readily they can change their approach, and what it costs them. The attraction of the camera-only approach is that it is, in some ways, simpler, and mostly machine learning. Duplicating it will not be too hard for experienced companies, but testing and certifying will take time. They’ll have all the other components of a service in place, though, and of course their old technology will still be working, just costing more than it should, which investors must handle. At the price of current ride-hail services, which is around $2.50/mile, a dime in extra COGS isn’t a big isue. That changes in other markets. The biggest market for the technology is a subscription service which convinces customers to give up ownership of at least one car in favor of the subscription. Here price matters more, because the subscription must be priced competitively with private ownership, which cost around $12,000/year, plus parking, according to AAA. That’s pushing $1/mile, though it drops a lot as a car gets older. As long as the car and service are good, the lower the cost of building the car, the better. This is also true for privately owned self-driving cars, where drivers are cost sensitive, and base hardware costs are usually tripled in retail costs. Making a consumer self-driving car is much harder than making a robotaxi, and while a few have intentions, nothing is solidly on the horizon other than Tensor’s high-end vehicle (unless you believe Elon Musk’s normally wrong predictions.) Indeed, Tesla said for years their HW3 cars had all the necessary hardware but have walked that back. This market comes later, and gets big even later. Robotaxis come sooner, but at first, they are not competing on price, in fact they’re probably not competing that much at all, instead being the only vehicle in a given city until there are multiple strong players going after each other. Years from now, as competition heats up, vehicle cost will start to play a competitive role, but everybody’s vehicles, computers and sensors will all look fairly different by then, too.

Title: Meta’s $27 billion bet turns AI compute into Wall Street’s hottest new investment

Full Content:
Sharon Goldman is an AI reporter at Fortune and co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. She has written about digital and enterprise tech for over a decade. Are data centers the new REIT? Not quite — but Meta’s new mega–data center in northeast Louisiana marks what one expert calls a “decisive shift” in how hyperscalers finance the AI era: by turning data centers into a new investable asset class. “This is where capital markets meet compute,” said Sean McDevitt, a partner at management consulting firm Arthur D. Little, which provided commercial due diligence advice to Meta. Traditionally, tech giants like Meta, Google, and Microsoft have funded their data center buildouts directly. This time, Meta is partnering with Blue Owl Capital, a private-credit investment firm, on the $27 billion data center known as Hyperion. As reported by The Wall Street Journal, Blue Owl owns 80% of the project, while Meta holds 20%, operating and leasing the facility long-term. BlackRock bought more than $3 billion of bonds that the joint venture (dubbed Beignet) issued last week to finance the project, in a sale arranged by Morgan Stanley. The deal stands out for its scale—the largest private-debt offering ever—and for its A+ rating from S&P, which reflects Meta’s backing of the project (albeit with just a single agency rating). Yet the debt had a yield of 6.58% at issue, a level closer to high-yield, or “junk,” bond territory. That structure allows Meta to build its data center without putting the full $27 billion of debt on its own balance sheet. The approach—known as a special-purpose vehicle (SPV) or off–balance-sheet financing—is largely new territory for hyperscale infrastructure. “By being able to access outside capital, you’re not limited to your own free cash flow generation,” McDevitt said. “You’re bringing on investors with return profiles on an infrastructure-type investment that allows companies to build bigger, larger, quicker, and faster.” He compared it to taking out a mortgage: you can buy a bigger house—or, in this case, build more data centers—by borrowing instead of paying cash up front. McDevitt believes the Hyperion deal could become a template for the industry. He estimates that roughly $150 billion in AI-driven data center construction is coming in the next few years. If other hyperscalers—Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and OpenAI among them—adopt similar models, capital markets rather than tech companies themselves will effectively fund the infrastructure of the AI era. “This is replicable,” he said, though he cautioned that it remains to be seen how the project performs in practice. “Now what has to happen? Meta has to build this thing, then put workloads in it and operate under the presumption that they’ll monetize those computing loads driven by AI in the future,” McDevitt added. That is precisely where criticism of the deal lies: According to Global Data Center Hub analysis, “If AI workloads or margins stumble, these SPVs could echo the dark-fiber overbuild of the 1990s vast capacity sitting idle while debt remains outstanding.” Still, for now, there’s no reason to think other major banks won’t try the same thing, said McDevitt. “Why wouldn’t others look to mimic [this deal]?” Sharon GoldmanX: @sharongoldmanEmail: sharon.goldman@fortune.com Submit a deal for the Term Sheet newsletter here.

Title: Who is Bankim Brahmbhatt? Indian-origin CEO under BlackRock's radar for ‘breathtaking’ $500 million scam in US?

An Indian-origin CEO is at the heart of a $500 million scam that targeted the world’s biggest investment group BlackRock’s private-credit investing arm and other lenders, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. According to the WSJ report, BlackRock’s private credit investment arm, HPS Investment Partners, are now trying to recover the money after falling victim to what it calls a ‘breathtaking’ fraud. Bankim Brahmbhatt, the owner of US-based Broadband Telecom and Bridgevoice, has been accused of fabricating accounts receivable that were supposed to be used as loan collateral. The lawsuit, filed in August, alleges that HPS had provided loans to Brahmbhatt's companies on the condition that they pledged millions of dollars owed by customers as collateral for the money. The lenders have now accused that Brahmbhatt’s companies owe them more than $500 million. BlackRock has also claimed that when the verification process of the account receivables started, it was found that the funds from the loan was diverted offshore accounts in India and Mauritius. According to the WSJ report quoting people familiar with the matter, BNP Paribas helped BlackRock’s HPS Investment Partners finance the loans to Brahmbhatt's companies. HPS, which was bought earlier this year by BlackRock, started lending to at least one financing arm affiliated with Brahmbhatt’s telecom companies in September 2020. Since the case was filed in August, several companies linked to Brahmbhatt including New York-based invoice financing firm Carriox Capital, have since filed for Chapter 11 protection in the US. Meanwhile, the lenders in their lawsuit said that Brahmbhatt had used fake invoices, contracts and emails over the past two years to make it appear as if the money was owed to established telecom companies. “Brahmbhatt created an elaborate balance sheet of assets that existed only on paper,” lawyers for the lenders wrote. Following its initial 2020 credit, HPS hiked the amount of its debt investment to about $385 million in early 2021, and then to around $430 million in August 2024. Nearly half of the loan to Brahmbhatt’s Carriox and affiliated entities were financed by BNP Paribas, the people quoted by WSJ said. According to the report, an HPS employee in July had noticed the irregularities with certain email addresses that purportedly came from Carriox customers. That led to suspicions, with HPS officials enquiring Bankim Brahmbhatt about the alleged irregularities. At the time, the businessman had assured them nothing was wrong, but later stopped picking up their calls. When an HPS employee visited the offices of Brahmbhatt in New York's Garden City in July, they were found to be closed. On Wednesday, office suite was locked and appeared vacant, and nobody answered the bell at his listed residence in Garden City. Two BMWs, a Porsche, a Tesla and an Audi were seen parked in the driveway, and a package next to the front door lay unattended. HPS has told some clients they believed Brahmbhatt is in India, according to the report. Bankim Brahmbhatt is the founder of Bankai Group, and has been in the telecom industry for over three decades. His companies Broadband Telecom and Bridgevoice sell services and infrastructure to other telecom companies. The LinkedIn account of Bankim Brahmbhatt seemed to be deleted when Mint tried to access it. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

National Guard in each state is ordered to create ‘quick reaction forces’ trained in civil unrest AP Border Patrol takes lead role in Trump administration’s Chicago crackdown, carrying out more arrests than ICE CBS News ICE Is Now Wandering the Streets, Scanning People’s Faces to Check If They’re Citizens Futurism ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Everything is going down in lefty Big Smokes, feel pretty safe here in Tiny Town where we are politically right smack dab down the middle and surrounded by a sea of red down in Godzone. A local wag calls us ‘Caucasian Island’ as Haoles make up 91% of the population. That said, i’m reading reports in regards to ICE/NG being seen on the streets in nearby Woodlake, which has about 10k people and is 87% Hispanic. I drive by orchards all the time, and how can you tell in a drive-by how the workers are feeling, but it doesn’t seem any different-the way they go about doing things, there’s about 25 cars parked in front of the orchard, a few port-a-potties, a couple of 10×10 popup shade structures and a mess of ladders to be able to pick oranges on high. It’d be so easy to round them up~ Trump has got over three more years in office. Plenty of time for ICE to eventually get around to smaller places like those orchards near you unfortunately. Once you create a monster organization like ICE you cannot keep them idle but must be always be sending them off to new areas to harass. They had a veteran’s parade yesterday in Fayetteville NC. “All the forces were represented”. Well no. there were no face covering ICE agents waving from the floats. That little detail escaped the TV coverage…. So no future ‘Thank you for you service’ coming anytime soon? The 97 year old owner of a cabin near me passed on last year and his 30 something grandson inherited it from him, and over the summer he’s been up half a dozen times, and each sojourn he tells me that he’s a military combat veteran about 4 or 5 times. On one side 99% of the population has nothing to do in terms of being in the military, and on the other side the 1% never lets you forget it. “Thank me for my service” Thank him for letting himself be used. losing the use of his legs(t-7, i think) by being used for bullshit geopolitical shenanigans is what rumbled my stepdad Don’s stomach ever after. he was the biggest antiwar person i have ever known…and when my boys played whatever that combat vidgame was and started talking about joining the marines, because it would be awesome, i sat them down on his front porch with him for an afternoon…and all that nonsense just kinda went away. My army service began 1959. I never left the United States. Yes, I served but then the draft said I had no choice. I was not an enthusiastic soldier, but I did my duty. No pats on the back required. I considered myself fortunate to have been too young for Korea and too married and a father for Vietnam. Many many years later in circumstances that escape me, I was asked if I have served in the military. I said yes. This bright eyed young person said, “Thank you for your service.” Inwardly, I recoiled. It felt the same to me as hearing, “Have a nice day.” I did what I was asked to do and required to do. Leave it at that. Wondering if the airlines will include announcements for ICE & CBP in their preboarding of :Active Duty US military “ More likely that sooner or later that Trump will declare a national ICE Day so they know that they are appreciated. That one is worthy of starting a pool !! Vegas Book—What day/ year will the holiday be created? I’m thinking Labor Day will be repurposed too, and any expectant mother that delivers on that day, gets a $100 gift card from Amazon. ICE really needs dress uniforms! Something inspired by Hugo Boss from the 30’s, in black. With the Nike Swoosh on the collar instead of lightning bolts. And medals, too. Lotsa medals. methinks those red or black Sith robes would be more apropos… Oh no! Roundup Ready braceros! A new wonder tool for Big Ag. It is widely known that more people die from cold than heat. According to ScienceDirect, “In most epidemiological studies, excess cold deaths far outnumber heat deaths.” https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542519625000543 Thus, the report from BioScience which mentions rising temperatures will be harder to convince those who are more comfortable as temps rise, to do something now, only for it to be too late to do much when extreme temperatures arrive in the future. ” Historic U.S. Civil War Ship Decaying Due to Fungal Invasion ” I think that there is only one real long term solution here. Remove the old planking and arrest any fungi, perhaps by having those planks frozen for future research. Then replace those removed planks with hardy timber treated to resist any future fungi infestations. Of course eventually that may leave you with the Ship of Theseus quandary- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus Remember too that this ship was built during the US Civil War as a temporary class of ships and would normally have been scrapped after war’s end- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Cairo The scientists working on the restoration might want to look into using Chlorine Dioxide as a fumigant.

I think that is what is being done with the USS Constitution–thete’s a grove maintained by the Navy to supply timber for maintaining the ship, too. So the relevant skills and resources are not lacking. i hafta say, maintaining a grove for such things is rather cool. i support such uses of my tax dollars. Add to that the Navy Experimental Hemp Plantation to the north of Meridian, Mississippi. As the boys down at the supply house like to say: “Your tax dollars at rest.” This reminds me of a story from Gregory Bateson that I read several decades ago in either a Whole Earth Catalog or a CoEvolution Quarterly Magazine article. And I find an online article making a referrence to that story and then offering some background and context around it. It is titled: ” Oak Beams, New College Oxford The beams of the New College, Oxford dining hall come with an amazing story. ” Here is the link. https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/oak-beams-new-college-oxford As a person who lives very close to the border in Imperial County CA and has regular interactions with the Border Patrol agents, I can tell you that we are all happy to see these a–holes going somewhere else. I am sorry for the people inland who they harass, but at least they are not here in the constitution free zone causing traffic accidents (they drive like maniacs) and annoying the locals, many of whom have family on both sides of the wall. The BP here are overstaffed, no one is crossing in this area, so the agents mostly sit in their cars where there is a signal and watch porn. Occasionally they get restless and go forth to bother whoever they can. God protect us from bored cops.

Democrats’ rift with unions erupts as shutdown pain worsens https://www.axios.com/2025/10/30/democrats-unions-labor-trump-shutdown-airlines Teamsters, too, once true-blue. Um, the “Swing States” in today’s link featuring that title are members of the BRICs So these unions are happy to see a hundred million other Americans lose their health care due to sudden unafordability at every level so they can get back on the federal job sooner. Just as the teamsters and others are happy to double or triple the speed of global warming for everyone else so they can have “good jobs at good wages” in the meantime. The solidarity candle burns at both ends. Is the Democrat leadership continuing the shutdown because they fear that the huge premium hikes on voters’ health insurance will lead the voters to abandon Obamacare in favor of Medicare for all? The Democratic leadership is not leading the shutdown. The Total-Three-Branches ownership-and-control Republican leadership is leading the shutdown, to prevent swearing Grijalva in so as to keep putting off the discharge petition to get the Epstein Files released so as to keep protecting our Pedophile President Donald ” The Groomer” Trump. Democrats’ insisting on extending the Obamacare subsidies is just Grindr Mike’s pretext and excuse. South Korea’s 30-year quest for nuclear subs pays off. What comes next? Breaking Defense South Korea needs nuclear subs even less than Australia. Have you asked the South Koreans why they want these submarines? Do you think you can manage to convince them that you are right and they are wrong? the waters around the Korean peninsula are not deep. (electro-diesel subs can achieve the same goals for a lot less money) If looking through the prism of purely Korean defense, nuclear-powered attack subs are a ego-driven boondoggle—just like their Establishment’s drive a few years back to have a blue-water carrier strike group like France or the UK. Western Europe might have grown tired of being a US vassal—not the Korean establishment. Even their “left-wing” current president is as fervent pro-vassal as his right-wing predecessor. Not necessarily – the Chinese appear to be investing in relatively small shallow water nuclear attack submarines to replace their Kilo class subs. Its not clear what their purpose is, but it may be that they see value in having them hide in the canyons of the South China Sea for longer periods than is possible for AIP. The Koreans may have similar ideas. Their most recent subs are capable of launching medium range ballistic missiles such as the Hyumoo 4 – the thinking seems to be to ensure that they can sit off shore North Korea (or unnamed other local adversaries) to maintain the ability to carry out rapid decapitation strikes. A key element of RSK strategic thinking appears to be a focus on a very rapid and precise counter-strike on key underground bunkers in the event of an attack. And South Korea is nowhere near a vassal. They have proven very adept at using the US defence umbrella to follow their own strategic objectives in both politics and economics. This move is highly likely to be part of an overall policy of becoming a key defence supplier to the US (i.e. making the US dependent on them as a supplier). Nothing says “nowhere near a vassal” like jumping on the Ukrainian bandwagon, and pushing North Korea right into the arms of Mother Russia. Some might consider it the best gift Kim Jong Un could wish for (and one of acts of self harm that US vassals are ritually engaging in), though it must be a sly 4D chess move by totaly-not-a-vassal, and a part of some convoluted South Korean gambit. Launching rapid decapitation strike is where it’s at, expecially when you know for sure that nukes will be boomin’ back atcha. Who’s the enemy for the S Koreeans? An enemy that necessitates nuclear subs? The depth of the water is completely irrelevant to what power plant a sub uses…. No one asks South Koreans what they want. That’s the whole problem with being a vassal. As far as convincing goes, wise man say that it’s easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled. I do think that South Koreans are smarter than Ukrainians, and that they might figure things out by themselves before they run out of people. Who cares what yankee slaves want? They’re standing in opposition to the legitimate government of the Korean people. Long live the Democratic People’s Republic. I have. Then I realized I am not a Korean any more. The Rev Kev is needed here, so that we can make a final judgment on who needs nuclear subs more. South Korea’s nuclear subs are a commodity — Canada, which needs nuclear subs even less than just about anyone, wants to appease Trump by spending an absurd 5% of GDP on defence, but doesn’t want to be seen as rewarding the US for its blackmail, is looking to buy some. And it probably makes sense to buy something that likely will actually work. Well, Canada used to need to patrol it’s ice covered Northern coast. Now, by the time the new boats are built, there may not be any ice left…. re: Yes, Everything Crashed–Just Not For You Charles Hugh Smith An American physician with nearly 50 years of experience brought me up short when he reported that for many Americans, the healthcare they receive is equivalent to what third-world residents receive. The algorithm serves me up quite a lot of videos of Americans who have moved overseas to so-call third world countries (mostly in Central America) and the medical care they describe sounds dreamy compared to the US. It’s cheap, with lots of face time with actual doctors, and with a dearth of paperwork. Daniel Swain is a weatherman’s weatherman, there is really nobody like him, truly a climate savant (and I mean that in the nicest way) and so widely respected. Any kind of weather related event happens on the left coast, and he’s always quoted-as he’s the expert. Now aside from nabbing an operating system and calling it his own, what does Gates know about the climate in order to make such a declaration? Gates seems to know his own mortality.

Far from the worst-case scenario, this is pretty much the next best thing. I just re-read Immanuel Wallerstein’s World System Analysis. How do capitalists increase profit ? Externalize costs. Cut taxes. Reduce wages. The bottom 90%’s share has steadily declined since the 1970s. Tax cutting has been relentless. The EPA is under attack. That said, fire and rehire at lower wages is just part of the program. re: “Mass hunger approaching” and “National Guard in each state”…. Seems like I’m watching an orchestrated effort – by both parties – to run the Cloward-Piven strategy. The poor will be hurt…. again. The political question or calculation is: which party will be blamed for the pain and failure? Is this all about next year’s midterm elections? A game of political chicken? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloward%E2%80%93Piven_strategy At some point, after then Dem Speaker of the House Tip O’Neill worked with Reagan to raise the SS retirement age to ‘pay for’ Reagan’s tax breaks to wealthier citizens, after Bill C ended “welfare as we know it” which increased poverty, and after Obama traded away an extension of unemployment benefits during the GFC to get a win on another issue, I began to think the Dem party no longer gives a toss about the poor, the unfortunate, or the mistreated. Scary interpretation is to brace for more horrible revelations about Dem spying, scandals, Biden dementia denial, self-dealing and so many other festering sores will lead to pitchforks and torches. The do-nothings just talk and line their pockets, like head grifter Pelosi, while constituents worry about getting food. You don’t hate all politicians enough.

Re: With mass hunger approaching as food stamps expire Saturday, huge price increases revealed for Obamacare healthcare plans Looks like family member’s plan has 50% increase in premium and the deductible doubled!!! awful — how is this cluster(care) not befouling Saint Obama’s image? rhetorical ? smh The rhetoric is calling the ACA ‘Obama Care’ where it is used as a smear to the democratic party alone, despite the fact that he signed into law – as opposed to veto – after the ACA had passed through house and senate (dems and repubs) – as is the usual course of things in the USA – for his signature. In other words, it was not just some idiot president tossing around executive orders as has become custumary over many decades of illusionary leadership. My view is that it largely passed because both the house and senate were captured by their true constituency -finance capitalism devoted to puffery and asset bubbles- and it was cleary stated with ill-defined sloganeering, or, should I say con-artistry (makeing things up where the mark/victim/target/voter is left to make the conclusion as to the true meaning of the art – most often given to believe that they are the true beneficiaries of aforesaid con-artistic statement) such as: government should be shrunk down to baby sized in order to more easily kill the baby in a bathtub, government should be run more like a business (failing, as always, to mention what type of business – monopoly business, fraudulent business, banking, private equity, widget production?- or that most businesses fail in the first five yrs), Regulation is making business to difficult so we have to deregulate businesses because the government is just to darned hard on them Jawbs – cut the red tape (of course they fail to disclose that the deregulation was mainly in the Financial services industry whose cliches included ‘making money the old-fashioned way’ ((not dislosing the ‘old-fashioned way’ -was the ‘way’ before Glass-Steagle closed down on fraud and speculation))), ‘Hope and change’ (not disclosing that what it meant was ‘ I sure as hell hope that nobody notices that nothing will change). Mexicans do jobs that Americans won’t do —of course, not mentioning that Americans won’t do those Jawbs because of the abject poverty wages and slave like conditions that are now coming to roost for americans because of asset inflation (cost of living increasing faster than income for that outgo)– maybe it’s a great way to force americans who are tired, poor, huddled masses yearning to breathe free into cheap labor for industrial faming……..I’m sorry, I forgot that the idea is to get rid of paid labor through automation, AI and bond servitude), MAGA – “Make America Great Again” … a little late to ask – For who? because the answer is the same as it has been for a long time…..“I hope we shall crush in its birth the aristocracy of our moneyed corporations, which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength and bid defiance to the laws of our country.” Thomas Jefferson “To achieve victory, high finance needs to disable government, which is the single power able to regulate, tax and otherwise curtail its expansion. To disable political democracy, finance buys control of the electoral campaigns so as to promote politicians acting as its officers. It also buys control of the television, radio and published mass media, and uses endowments to buy control of the academic process. Together, these are the various organs that represent the “brain” of society.” Michael Hudson We had to struggle with the old enemies of peace–business and financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sectionalism, war profiteering. They had begun to consider the Government of the United States as a mere appendage to their own affairs.

The Ukrainians have downplayed how serious it is in Pokrovsk and Kupyansk so by inviting journalists in, they would be able to report the true situation. Only it is not going to happen. The Ukrainians have said ‘I also remind all media that any visits to Russian-occupied territory without Ukraine’s permission are a violation of our legislation and international law. They will have long-term reputational and legal consequences. We are watching closely’ so they are threatening any journalists that might think of taking up the offer- https://www.rt.com/russia/627171-ukraine-journalists-safe-passage/ So something on the order of about ten thousand Ukrainian soldiers are about to fall into the Russian bag. And the Zelensky regime will demand that they must fight to the last and to sell their lives dearly or else it will make Zelensky look bad in the media. I may have misunderstood the reporting, but I think Russia is willing to stop firing so that reporters can travel in Ukraine. I don’t think that the reporters have any contact with the Russian army at all. So, it’s obviously not going to happen. But as you say Rev Kev, very clever on Russia’s part IMF is ready to ‘help’ Jamaica indeed. The carrion feeders probably froth at the mouth everytime any kind of crisis threatens outside of the G20. Also, the gleaner is a terrible outlet with a history of emotive reporting. They have articles that sound more like the excerpts from a YA crime thriller than actual news. That said, it might be impossible to find impersonal, worse critical, reporting in any Jamaican paper. The same seems to go for impartiality as well. There are plenty of non-profits stepping up to help. There is no need for these ghouls. They will likely demand austerity and charge interest on loans to the Jamaican government. Just say no! They will absolutely demand austerity but whether or not the govt cares to avoid it is anybody’s guess, I can only hope. One optimistic note is that the Clinton faction probably won’t be anywhere near Jamaica. Maybe. The Clinton’s may be more “deep state” than that.

My first thought when I saw the headline… “US Envoys Put Lebanese Army Under Watch” Those US envoys can say what they want but the Lebanese are not going to start a civil war by going after Hezbollah just to keep these goofballs and the Israelis happy. For a start, Hezbollah is better equipped than the Lebanese army because the west has always kept the Lebanese army weak so as not to worry the IDF. Same as in Jordan. In addition, Hezbollah has combat experience which the army does not really have. Another factor is that you have may families that have members in Hezbollah and the army so they won’t want to see any fighting. Finally, the Lebanese know that once Hezbollah is disarmed, that will be the signal for Israel to invade the country and occupy at least the southern half so that they can set up their Settlements there and make it part of Greater Israel. Those US envoys can pound sand. AI layoffs to backfire: Half quietly rehired at lower pay The Register As predicted here on NC, one of the few LLM success stories. It’s working exactly as intended.

He used the opportunity to send a distress message confirming for the first time to the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence and Americans that American POWs were being tortured in North Vietnam.

With those dissenters gone, Trump was happy again as Ratcliffe once more spun him the latest fables. Idjut! Taibbi and Kirn. ATW. utube. public excerpt.

Bubble delicious How OpenAI Uses Complex and Circular Deals to Fuel Its Multibillion-Dollar Rise (NY Times via archive.ph) Many of the deals OpenAI has struck — with chipmakers, cloud computing companies and others — are strangely circular. OpenAI receives billions from tech companies before sending those billions back to the same companies to pay for computing power and other services. Industry experts and financial analysts have welcomed the start-up’s creativity. But these unorthodox arrangements have also fueled concerns that OpenAI is helping to inflate a potential financial bubble as it builds what is still a highly speculative technology. Here are unusual financial agreements helping to drive the ambitions of OpenAI, the poster child of the artificial intelligence revolution. Why was 6 afraid of 7?

All such figures remain unverified and should be treated as provisional: they derive from media reporting, visual scaling of released footage, and expert judgment rather than from independently released technical specifications.

Oh noes That Trump would call for this is not terribly surprising; he has spent years occasionally urging Republican leaders to scrap the filibuster. Nor is it particularly likely to provide an actual offramp in the shutdown; those same GOP leaders have steadfastly declined Trump’s entreaties before and rejected this idea repeatedly in recent weeks. It’s not even clear whether enough senators would vote for such a change if GOP leaders went along with it. So practically speaking, it’s a pointless interjection from the president. But it does matter in one way: It’s Trump yet again inserting himself into these kinds of talks in ways that are thoroughly unhelpful to his party. And this has become a trend. It is very unhelpful, because it demonstrates what people mostly don’t know — at any time, the Senate can just decide to pass legislation with a majority vote. Democrats very much don’t want Trump running his mouth about this, either, I bet. For one, it violates “norms” of the Senate, and Democrats worship norms above all else. And that’s one reason they find Trump so vulgar, I mean, tearing down parts of the Whitehouse, how dare he? Otherwise, they’re very much on board with Team Trump, not even having a reversal of the punitive cuts in the big beautiful pile of garbage as a minimum bid to vote to end the shutdown. Fun.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Big Tech's AI gold rush isn't slowing down— it's getting more expensive. Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft all opened their wallets wider than ever this quarter, logging record-breaking capital expenditures on AI chips, servers, and data centers. Microsoft was the top spender at nearly $35 billion, narrowly beating Amazon. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company could increase its long-term asset spending, or capital expenditure (capex), by as much as 24% next year. Each company said it planned to spend even more on capex going forward. A few recent deals exemplify this trend. Amazon this week opened an $11 billion data center in Indiana, part of its massive AI supercluster called Project Rainier, and said it would spend $5 billion on data centers in South Korea. Microsoft recently joined a consortium of investors to buy 50 data centers in the US and Latin America for $40 billion. Even Apple, a notoriously restrained spender compared to the other hyperscalers, told investors that it expects capex spending to increase in the next fiscal year. Inside Business is today's must-read story on what the forces shaping business, tech, and innovation mean for you. Each piece delivers insights to help you make smarter career, money, and life decisions. Investors are watching closely: companies showing early AI payoffs, like Google, are being rewarded, while others — like Meta — are running out of time to prove the spending spree is worth it. "After all the expensive hires and the capex ramp, Meta's grace period for showing investors something on the non-core AI side is nearly up," Bernstein senior analyst Mark Shmulik said Wednesday in a research note. The question for investors: which of these giants can turn that spending into actual AI returns — and which are just building costlier foundations for the future? Capital expenditures in the company's most recent fiscal quarter were driven by growing demand for cloud and AI offerings, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood said Wednesday. The nearly $35 billion in spending represents a 74% increase from the same time period last year. Roughly half of that spend went primarily to GPUs and CPUs, which Hood referred to as "short-lived assets." Microsoft spent $11.1 billion on data center leasing alone for the quarter. The company previously forecasted $30 billion in capex for the quarter. Amazon spent $34.2 billion in capex in the third quarter. The world's largest cloud provider said it expects to spend $125 billion this year in capex, up significantly from $83 billion in 2024. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said the company plans to spend even more on capex in 2026 as it looks to double its data center capacity in the next two years. Meta spent $19.4 billion on capex in the third quarter, and is projecting 'notably higher growth' next year. Meta also adjusted its capex guidance range for 2025 from $70 billion to $72 billion, up from its previous estimate of $66 billion to $72 billion last quarter. That's almost double the amount — $39.2 billion total — Meta spent on capex in 2024. "We're seeing very high demand for additional compute," CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors on the company's third-quarter earnings call Wednesday. The company expects to spend $116 billion to $118 billion on infrastructure costs next year, representing a 22% to 24% increase from 2025. Meta is building its own data centers and contracting space through third parties. It recently raised $29 billion for its massive data center project in Louisiana from firms including Pacific Investment Management Company and Blue Owl Capital. CFO Anat Ashkenazi told investors on the company's earnings call Wednesday that the "vast majority" of capex was spent on AI infrastructure. Approximately 60% of the spend went to chips and servers, while 40% went to networking equipment and data centers. Google raised its capex guidance for the year, projecting a range of $91 billion to $93 billion, up from its previous estimate of $85 billion. "We're continuing to invest aggressively due to the demand we're seeing from cloud customers, as well as the growth opportunities we see across the company," Ashkenazi said. Google parent Alphabet's stock jumped yesterday after it reported a boost in revenue growth from its cloud division in the third quarter. Wall Street seemed less concerned about its parent company's capex raise compared to those of its Big Tech peers. The third quarter was a "pretty solid flex" for Google, "around the AI bull case," Barclays analysts said in a research note on Wednesday. Jump to

Title: DeFi set for $2tn tokenisation boom: Standard Chartered picks the winners

About us Copy link DeFi is set for a $2 trillion boom. That’s according to Geoffrey Kendrick, head of digital assets research at UK bank Standard Chartered, who expects Wall Street’s surging adoption of blockchain technology will drive the tokenised real-world asset market to increase by over 5,600% by 2028. That number is excluding the stablecoin market, which has ballooned to be worth just under $308 billion in 2025, fuelled by a friendlier US government. “Stablecoins are creating a platform for DeFi to continue its expansion in the coming years,” Kendrick wrote. “Their success in 2025 has raised awareness in developed markets and created the necessary liquidity onchain to enable other DeFi solutions.” He predicted that tokenised money-market funds powered by stablecoins will make up $750 billion of the $2 trillion market. The rest of the market will be made up of $750 billion in tokenised equities, and $250 billion in tokenised funds, Kendrick said. “The less liquid segments of private equity, commodities, corporate debt and real estate for the other $250 billion,” he added. The comments highlight the bullishness around tokenised assets from traditional finance. BlackRock, State Street and Deutsche Bank are just some of the financial giants muscling into this space. Kendrick said the DeFi boom is driven by three factors: surging awareness in developed markets, onchain liquidity, and the expansion of onchain lending. Ethereum has and “key DeFi protocols like Aave are going to be the winners,” Kendrick said. Indeed, Aave, DeFi’s largest lending platform, recently relaunched its institutional platform to capitalise on Wall Street’s growing interest. Earlier this week, the Ethereum Foundation rolled out a new institutional platform titled Ethereum for Institutions, a site designed to guide traditional financial institutions in integrating Ethereum’s blockchain infrastructure. “Clear pathways are essential as institutions build on Ethereum,” the foundation said in its announcement. The US government’s drive to regulate the crypto market and to police the industry less strictly than during the Biden years has fuelled the rally. It has seen pro-crypto people be appointed to key government roles, seen a landmark stablecoin bill be signed into law, and Congress seems to be on the cusp of finalising a broad markets bill. To be sure, Kendrick warns that next year presents a massive danger that risks puncturing the growth. “The main risk to this would be if regulatory clarity in the US does not materialise — a possibility if the US administration is unable to push through regulatory changes before the November 2026 midterm elections, but not our base case,” he said.

Title: Meet the ex-McKinsey exec helping NYC's CEOs get comfortable with Zohran Mamdani

Every time Alex publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yasser Salem is not the sort of guy you'd expect to drop everything to get a socialist elected. When we met, he wore a white button-down, a tweed sport coat, and a baseball cap with a camouflage American flag on it that said "Husband, Daddy, Protector, Hero." There's no irony in his choice of hat. A McKinsey and Saudi Public Investment Fund alum who ran his own investment firm, the 43-year-old father of five is a fan of Ayn Rand and her brand of free-market individualism. Salem is now selling Zohran Mamdani's democratic socialist vision in New York City's boardrooms. In September, he launched OneNYC, a pro-Mamdani PAC that's raised nearly $400,000 from donors like Andrew Milgram, CEO of Marblegate Asset Management. While the PAC has spent money on ads — including $53,000 on a TV spot — Salem said its true goal is to act as a connective tissue between New York's business world and a populist candidate whose ascension is one of the year's top political stories. Salem's outreach follows months of condemnations of the candidate by Wall Street's elites like JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Pershing Square head Bill Ackman, and Third Point hedge fund boss Dan Loeb. Billionaire corporate leaders have been spending big in a last-ditch effort to elect Andrew Cuomo. Since Mamdai's surprise 12-point primary win, Salem said, the business community has been more willing to engage with the candidate. Salem has chatted with more than 70 CEOs, roughly 30 of whom head large corporations, he said. Most conversations have been with the finance, insurance, and real estate industries, but about a third have been with tech CEOs, he said. Ralph Schlosstein, the Democrat chairman emeritus of Evercore and a cofounder of BlackRock, described OneNYC to Business Insider as "a noble effort to bridge the gap" between Mamdani, who is not well known to business leaders, and "those in the business community who are passionate about the success of the city." For his part, it has been reported that Mamdani has been on a charm offensive, meeting with tech executives and New York power brokers, including Dimon and Brooklyn developer Jed Walentas. Mamdani is listening to his critics, Salem said. He announced last week that he would keep on NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch if elected, to the chagrin of his most progressive supporters. This came after a "resounding, resounding recommendation" from business leaders, Salem said. Under rules governing PACs, Salem and OneNYC are not allowed to directly coordinate with the candidate, but he believes that there are more opportunities for partnership ahead. OneNYC is organizing a New York business advisory council that would be willing to advise a potential Mamdani administration, including Milgram and Kevin Ryan, a prolific venture investor of AlleyCorp who helped found Business Insider. Kathy Wylde, CEO of the Partnership for New York City, told Business Insider in an email that Salem is "building the infrastructure" to give business leaders "seats at the table" if Mamdani wins. She said that her nonprofit group, which represents the interests of some of the city's biggest corporations, has connected Salem with "individual leaders to hear their ideas and concerns." If the polls are correct, Salem says CEOs they've invited have "indicated that they're ready to join immediately after the election." Salem, a son of Egyptian immigrants who was raised in Manhattan, said the idea for the PAC came the night of Mamdani's primary landslide, while he was celebrating at the campaign's official watch party. He thought that if an NYU Stern and Harvard Business School graduate could join a bunch of progressive activists, maybe he could find some common ground between New York's business leaders and a Mamdani mayoralty. It was an unlikely revelation for someone whose résumé is packed with corporate strategy experience, not political organization. After a few banking internships, Salem's career took off with consulting powerhouse McKinsey, where he said he helped build infrastructure for the Saudi kingdom's response to the MERS virus in 2014. He also spent a year with Saudi Arabia's nearly $1 trillion Public Investment Fund, one of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds. When Mamdani announced his run in late 2024, Salem was running Hira Ventures, his own small private advisory and investment firm, which built a Brooklyn-based urgent care clinic and a COVID-testing business during the pandemic. As he grew his businesses, he also expanded his network of New York's business and political power players. When Salem first got a call late last year to meet Mamdani through a politically connected friend, he turned it down, he said. He was "in the middle of a deal, very busy." He also saw Mamdani polling at 1% and thought Mamdani "either doesn't know what he's saying isn't achievable, which is a problem, or he knows what he's saying isn't achievable, and that's even a bigger problem." As Mamdani's poll numbers and Instagram followers continued to rise, Salem decided he was judging the campaign like a consultant — expecting a five-year plan with milestones and metrics. But Mamdani wasn't offering a step-by-step blueprint; he was setting a vision. By laying out big goals, such as "an affordable New York for all," Salem said, Mamdani could be creating the energy and momentum to make change possible. When Salem set up OneNYC, he saw a way to get business leaders to "disregard distracting noise," and set out to use his experience. "When you're a seven-year vet at McKinsey, your day-to-day is to talk to CEOs, right?" Salem said. Mamdani's platform — free city buses, a rent freeze, and higher taxes on millionaires — has rattled New York's business elite. Executives warn his tax plan could drive wealth and jobs out of the city, while real-estate leaders say a rent freeze would squeeze landlords and stall repairs. At an event on Wednesday, Home Depot cofounder Ken Langone said: "New York is on the verge of making a monumental mistake." Andrew Milgram, the Marblegate founder who donated $50,000 to a pro-Cuomo PAC before the primary and $50,000 to OneNYC when it launched, was convinced to support Mamdani because of the way his affordability message resonated with New Yorkers, calling him the "messenger of the moment." Milgram said it's obvious Salem "starts with a pretty tall order," but agreed that the idea "that we can generate real change in this city for the benefit of all" has some business leaders willing to think outside the box. Mamdani's loudest critics have threatened that if he wins, the city's tax base will flee. A poll from Victory Insights, a right-leaning polling firm, reported that more than a quarter of New York City residents would consider leaving if Mamdani won. Salem doesn't think that will be the case. "Early on, I heard almost zero about taxes, which I found fascinating," Salem said about his conversations with CEOs. Schlosstein said that many of his peers would be willing to pay more if they felt the difference in quality of life. "A good number of those who are higher income are prepared to pay somewhat higher taxes in order to have a more successful city," Schlosstein said. Salem said that CEOs have highlighted three major concerns: Mamdani's lack of experience, public safety plans, and fears that his housing affordability program would backfire. Salem explained that a potential Tisch appointment showcases that Mamdani will put "capability" over "ideology," helping allay concerns around his lack of experience or his plans for public safety. Some proposals, like free childcare, were easy for business leaders to understand. Others, like free buses, have required his background in advising to help people grasp the idea. Buses were selected because eliminating fares could also speed them up by cutting boarding time. Salem often cites a study by Charles Komanoff, the policy architect of New York's congestion pricing laws, which found that free buses would run 12% faster, cost just $600 million in lost fares, and bring nearly $1.5 billion in economic benefits. Salem says he hasn't embraced socialism but has shed a "purist approach" to capitalism over the last five years, partially driven by price-gouging among his competitors during the COVID-19 pandemic. He tries to get CEOs to see beyond labels and focus on practical differences. "It's like, guys, I am a big fan of Ayn Rand, I've read all of her work," he said. "We have a problem with labels. My position is that as business leaders, you have the added responsibility of distinguishing between labels and the actual meaning of the words." Correction: October 31, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated that Saudi Arabia's PIF was the world's largest sovereign wealth fund. Jump to

Building on their strategic collaboration, Hyundai Motor Group and NVIDIA are now entering a new phase of collaboration, shifting from strategic adoption of advanced software platforms and infrastructure to joint innovation of core physical AI technologies. Together, they will codevelop AI capabilities for mobility solutions, a next-generation smart factory and on-device semiconductor advancements to strengthen Hyundai Motor Group’s future capabilities. As part of this endeavor, Hyundai Motor Group and NVIDIA aim to enable integrated AI model training, validation and deployment using 50,000 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs. In addition, in support of the Korean government’s initiative to build a national physical AI cluster, Hyundai Motor Group and NVIDIA will work closely with government stakeholders to accelerate ecosystem development. This will result in an approximately $3 billion investment to advance the physical AI landscape in Korea. Key efforts include the establishment of an NVIDIA AI Technology Center, Hyundai Motor Group’s Physical AI Application Center and regional data centers. This will also foster dynamic exchanges with NVIDIA’s engineers and technicians, helping cultivate Korea’s next generation of physical AI talent. “AI is revolutionizing every facet of every industry, and in transportation alone — from vehicle design and manufacturing to robotics and autonomous driving — NVIDIA’s AI and computing platforms are transforming how the world moves,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Together with Hyundai Motor Group — Korea’s industrial powerhouse and one of the world’s top mobility solutions providers — we’re building intelligent cars and factories that will shape the future of the multitrillion-dollar mobility industry.” “As we enter a new era of AI-powered mobility and smart factories, deepening our collaboration with NVIDIA marks a pivotal step forward,” said Euisun Chung, executive chair of Hyundai Motor Group. “Together, we are not only building advanced technologies but also laying the foundation for a robust AI ecosystem in Korea — one that fosters innovation, nurtures talent and positions us at the forefront of global AI leadership.” "For Korea to leap forward as a leading nation in AI, the advancement of physical AI is essential — a key initiative championed by the Ministry of Science and ICT. This inaugural step in public-private collaboration to foster physical AI is therefore incredibly significant,” said Bae Kyung-hoon, Deputy Prime Minister, and Minister of Science and ICT of the Republic of Korea. “Korea has a strong foundation in manufacturing. By combining Korea’s rich manufacturing data with NVIDIA’s cutting-edge AI infrastructure, we expect to build a win-win model through collaboration with domestic companies, thereby accelerating innovative AI transformation in manufacturing across industries.” Hyundai Motor Group Advances Automotive With NVIDIA AI Factory With its NVIDIA Blackwell-based AI factory, Hyundai Motor Group will deploy essential infrastructure for powering every phase of innovation — bringing together in-vehicle AI, autonomous driving, factory automation and robotics into one intelligent, interconnected ecosystem.NVIDIA offers the three AI compute platforms that serve as the infrastructure for physical AI and robotics: Together, these computing platforms form the backbone of AI and car factories, enabling the transportation industry to develop, validate and deploy advanced physical AI at scale. Building Smart Factories and Safe Cars of the FutureAs part of the expanded collaboration, unveiled earlier this year, Hyundai Motor Group will use the NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise platform to create robust factory digital twins — virtual replicas of manufacturing environments that unify and manage factory data — as well as enable precision control, software- and hardware-in-the-loop validation, discrete event simulation and virtual commissioning. These physically accurate digital environments accelerate robot integration, optimize production, enable predictive maintenance and pave the way for fully autonomous, software-defined factories — reshaping how vehicles are designed and manufactured. NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise also extends to humanoid and robotic systems using NVIDIA Issac Sim™, an open robotics reference framework built on NVIDIA Omniverse. This enables virtual validation of task assignments, motion planning and ergonomic safety before robot deployment on physical production lines, significantly accelerating robot integration and maximizing productivity. Hyundai Motor Group is also testing the use of the NVIDIA Omniverse and Cosmos platforms on NVIDIA RTX PRO Servers, with NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs, to build digital twins of regional driving environments and conditions, incorporating extensive simulations to advance its development pipeline.

Title: S&P 500’s path to 7,000 boosted by derivative flows

Time Published: 2025-10-31T04:30:25Z

A wave of bullish options trading has turbocharged the U.S. stock market’s rally, propelling the S&P 500 close to the 7,000 mark after gaining 17% so far this year. Traders have shown strong appetite for call options, pushing the one-month rolling calls-to-puts ratio to its most optimistic level in nearly four years. This surge in demand highlights the growing confidence among investors betting on continued market strength. (Source: Reuters) The sharp rise in call-option buying has left options dealers in a “short gamma” position, where they tend to amplify market swings rather than absorb them. In this setup, dealers sell stock futures when markets decline and buy them when prices rise, inadvertently increasing volatility. This dynamic means price moves in either direction are likely to become more pronounced. If the S&P 500 breaks above the key 7,000 level, dealers’ hedging activity could actually accelerate the rally. Since they are short gamma, dealers would be forced to buy stock futures to rebalance their positions as prices rise, adding fresh upward pressure. As Chris Murphy of Susquehanna Financial Group noted, the influx of aggressive upside call buyers has created conditions that could temporarily keep the market’s momentum alive. However, the same mechanics that drive rallies can also deepen declines. If the market starts to weaken, dealers could sell stock futures to hedge, worsening any pullback. Analysts caution that investors may have already priced in too much optimism, leaving little “fuel” for another big leg higher. SpotGamma’s Brent Kochuba believes the market could easily pause or retrace some gains from current levels. Much of the recent enthusiasm has been centred around the “Magnificent Seven” tech giants — Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. But according to Nomura’s Charlie McElligott, this rush into upside calls may have peaked. He expects a short-term pullback of 3% to 5% in major U.S. indexes, citing investor fatigue, rising concerns over AI spending, and uncertainty about the Federal Reserve’s pace of rate cuts.(Disclaimer: This slideshow has been sourced from Reuters.)

Title: The Changing American -- and International -- Buying Culture

There is no question that we in the U.S, have turned a big corner when it comes to how and where we shop. Anyone with a computer or a smartphone can turn it on (that is, if it is ever turned off) and traverse the shelves of millions of companies' merchandise, shopping the world without moving an inch. Contrast that with pre-digital days when families had a Sears, Roebuck or a Montgomery Wards catalogue and thumbed through them, routinely, to see all the marvelous gimcrack that money could buy. To put things in perspective, Montgomery Ward, the company that actually invented the mail-order catalog in 1872, ended publication of its general catalogue in 1985 due to financial difficulties and competition from modern retail formats. Sears ceased publication of its full-line catalogue in 1993. I remember both, fondly. They were "dream books" where all manner of fascinating (and many ordinary) items called out from their silent placement on one of hundreds of pages to ordinary Americans to please consider them for purchase. These books were thought to be in direct competition with local merchants, but few or no local shop owners had the space or financial wherewithall to stock them. Both Sears and Wards opened their stores at roughly the same time (Sears in 1925 and Wards in 1926). Their popularity grew quickly, but both maintained strong original customer bases among rural Americans. For the next fifty years or so, Americans displayed pretty predictable buying habits. Then, in the late eighties, the spread of the computer began to alter those habits. Online merchandisers started appearing, the most prominent of course is the ubiquitous Amazon which made its debut in 1995 (in 1994 it was called "Cadabra"). The shopping paradigm took a massive jolt as the company went from strength to strength during the 1990s. From a startup selling books, music and videos, the company soon changed its business model to that of a multi-sided marketplace platform (MSMP) which now connects sellers (who list and sell products), buyers (who shop through Amazon’s site or app) and third-party service providers (delivery, advertising, developers, etc.). The company actually took the Sears/Wards concept and ratcheted it up and applied it to the modern marketplace thanks to digitalization. Today, Amazon earns money by facilitating transactions between these three sides of itself and taking a cut through commissions, fees, and services. In some ways, Amazon resembles Sears and Wards and all other previous merchants. It buys wholesale and sells retail. Unlike its bricks and mortar predecessors, though, it engages in third-party marketplace sales by using its digital platform to reach customers, and it takes a referral fee (usually 8%–15%) and sometimes fulfillment and storage fees (FBA) from the companies whose products are listed. The company has a Web Services Division (AWS) which is a cloud-based computing division launched in 2006. It provides servers, storage, databases, and AI tools to businesses, globally. (This division is Amazon's most profitable one.) Then there is Amazon's subscription services which include Amazon Prime (membership for free shipping, video streaming, music, etc.) which generates recurring revenue and strengthens customer loyalty. Another revenue stream for Amazon is its sale of ad space on its website and applications. (Sponsored product listings, banner ads, and video ads now make Amazon the third-largest digital ad company after Google and Meta). Amazon and its founder learned much from Sears and Wards. Both older companies offered ancillary services like: insurance, credit and financing, automotive and home services and mail-order repair and service. It is fair to say that both of them were trusted by American consumers. Their guarantees were honored and their service was sterling. Amazon's return policy is seamless and trusted by millions of customers who know that they will be treated fairly by the company if a product doesn't live up to its claims. In pre-Amazon days, local merchants lived and died by their reputations. If customers lost faith in or were treated poorly by local merchants they stopped patronizing them and their businesses failed. Amazon sits on the same slippery slope and knows that its reputation is built one sale and sometimes one return at a time which is why it has adopted policies similar to those of Sears and Wards. There is a reputational value for many companies to have their products listed with Amazon because they know that they will not have to stand at the front line and defend their own individual return policies. Amazon will do it for them, and if Amazon treats its customers well, it reflects positively on manufacturers who don't have to deal with dissatisfied customers if something goes wrong. That is a double-edged sword, however, as Amazon gets all the credit for the successful consummation of the sale and the after-sale experience. In essence, individual companies cede their reputations to Amazon's sales fulfillment policy. Granted that a bad product is still a bad product, and the original manufacturer will still have to defend it, but the whole return experience rests in Amazon's hands. This singular return policy issue is often a deal-breaker or deal-maker for American consumers. Trust is key and so is ease of return. Other online retailers know this and are keenly aware that it is not only the products that compete with each other but sales, return and service policies as well and they can often make the difference between a sale or a miss. Websites went mainstream in the mid-to-late 1990s, but it wasn't until around the new millenium at the beginning of the dot com era that the bulk of retailers discovered the benefits of a web presence. Our buying culture began to change as more and more Americans began to go "online" and dip their toes in the digital retailers' water. Twenty-five years ago there were $25 billion in retail online sales. Today, global retail sales are $6.3 trillion. By comparison, Sears' highest annual sales year was in 2003 with $53 billion. Amazon's net sales in the same year were $5.26 billion. How are American consumers shopping today? If we look at "traditional" non-digital bricks and mortar retail sales in the U.S. today, the figure is estimated to be about $7.26 trillion. U.S. online (digital) retail sales in 2024 are estimated at about $1.19 trillion. While the actual sales figure disparity is huge, there is one very worrisome trend that keeps physical retailers up at night. It is "showrooming." Showrooming is simply a situation where a potential customer will visit a physical store, view an actual product on display, note its price and then take up a salesperson's time with a number of questions, after which they will leave and do an Internet search (probably on Amazon) and make their purchase based on price. Obviously, this disadvantages the physical retailer that has to inventory the product, display the product, educate his workforce on the merits of the product, and then worry that the customer will change his mind after purchasing it and return it at which point the retailer must then incorporate it back into his stock as a "used product" and take a loss on its sale. Meanwhile, Amazon has dedicated online retail marketplaces with websites in about 23 countries. There are eleven in Europe and the U.K. but none in Denmark, for example, to take just one Scandinavian country. One might ask why that is. Apart from the obvious market size (Denmark has only 6 million people) there are other reasons, one of them being the labor issue. Denmark follows what’s called the Danish model, a system based on collective bargaining between unions and employer organizations, rather than strict labor laws set by the state. Around 65%–70% of Danish workers are union members, and unions are deeply involved in setting working conditions, wages, and benefits. Employers operating in Denmark are expected — almost socially and politically required — to recognize and negotiate with unions. Amazon’s stance on unions is one of resistance to unionization. The company prefers direct employee management rather than collective bargaining and has fought union access in many countries (including Germany, the U.S., and the UK). In countries where unions are especially strong — like Denmark, Norway, and Sweden — Amazon’s reluctance to engage with unions has created tension in what can only be described as the "Nordic labor conflict." In 2023 in Sweden, the Swedish Transport Workers’ Union (Transportarbetareförbundet) and Union launched strikes at Amazon’s Swedish logistics partners because Amazon refused to sign a collective agreement. Danish unions, including 3F (Fagligt Fælles Forbund), HK Handel, and others, supported the Swedish strike, refusing to handle Amazon goods from Sweden. This Nordic solidarity action effectively made it impossible for Amazon to operate freely in Denmark without recognizing a union agreement. As of today, Amazon still has no collective bargaining agreement in Scandinavia, though negotiations have been discussed. The practical effect on Denmark is that Amazon has avoided opening warehouses, logistics hubs, or data centers in Denmark as doing so would legally and socially require negotiating with unions. Instead, the company serves Danish customers through Germany, where it can maintain control of operations while still reaching the Danish market. This has given cover to Danish retailers who are still able to avoid in-country Amazon competition and continue to charge high prices for many of the same goods. However, if Danish consumers wish to purchase goods through Amazon's marketplaces in E.U. countries they can avoid paying customs duties or tariffs as the purchases are considered intra-E.U. sales and not international imports. Danish customers will still pay the onerous 25% Value Added Tax on products shipped to Denmark through the EU VAT One Stop Shop (OSS) System. The future for physical retailers is one of adapt or fail as the Internet and AI join forces to find the best deals across many digital platforms and place further pressure on traditional merchants that have avoided changing their business models. This goes for stores in Denmark that must shell out vast sums for store rentals and high wages for employees and for "showroomers" where steadily rising costs challenge their bottom lines.

Anyone with a computer or a smartphone can turn it on (that is, if it is ever turned off) and traverse the shelves of millions of companies' merchandise, shopping the world without moving an inch. Contrast that with pre-digital days when families had a Sears, Roebuck or a Montgomery Wards catalogue and thumbed through them, routinely, to see all the marvelous gimcrack that money could buy. To put things in perspective, Montgomery Ward, the company that actually invented the mail-order catalog in 1872, ended publication of its general catalogue in 1985 due to financial difficulties and competition from modern retail formats. Sears ceased publication of its full-line catalogue in 1993. I remember both, fondly. They were "dream books" where all manner of fascinating (and many ordinary) items called out from their silent placement on one of hundreds of pages to ordinary Americans to please consider them for purchase. These books were thought to be in direct competition with local merchants, but few or no local shop owners had the space or financial wherewithall to stock them. Both Sears and Wards opened their stores at roughly the same time (Sears in 1925 and Wards in 1926). Their popularity grew quickly, but both maintained strong original customer bases among rural Americans. For the next fifty years or so, Americans displayed pretty predictable buying habits. Then, in the late eighties, the spread of the computer began to alter those habits. Online merchandisers started appearing, the most prominent of course is the ubiquitous Amazon which made its debut in 1995 (in 1994 it was called "Cadabra"). The shopping paradigm took a massive jolt as the company went from strength to strength during the 1990s. From a startup selling books, music and videos, the company soon changed its business model to that of a multi-sided marketplace platform (MSMP) which now connects sellers (who list and sell products), buyers (who shop through Amazon’s site or app) and third-party service providers (delivery, advertising, developers, etc.). The company actually took the Sears/Wards concept and ratcheted it up and applied it to the modern marketplace thanks to digitalization. Today, Amazon earns money by facilitating transactions between these three sides of itself and taking a cut through commissions, fees, and services. In some ways, Amazon resembles Sears and Wards and all other previous merchants. It buys wholesale and sells retail. Unlike its bricks and mortar predecessors, though, it engages in third-party marketplace sales by using its digital platform to reach customers, and it takes a referral fee (usually 8%–15%) and sometimes fulfillment and storage fees (FBA) from the companies whose products are listed. The company has a Web Services Division (AWS) which is a cloud-based computing division launched in 2006. It provides servers, storage, databases, and AI tools to businesses, globally. (This division is Amazon's most profitable one.) Then there is Amazon's subscription services which include Amazon Prime (membership for free shipping, video streaming, music, etc.) which generates recurring revenue and strengthens customer loyalty. Another revenue stream for Amazon is its sale of ad space on its website and applications. (Sponsored product listings, banner ads, and video ads now make Amazon the third-largest digital ad company after Google and Meta). Amazon and its founder learned much from Sears and Wards. Both older companies offered ancillary services like: insurance, credit and financing, automotive and home services and mail-order repair and service. It is fair to say that both of them were trusted by American consumers. Their guarantees were honored and their service was sterling. Amazon's return policy is seamless and trusted by millions of customers who know that they will be treated fairly by the company if a product doesn't live up to its claims. In pre-Amazon days, local merchants lived and died by their reputations. If customers lost faith in or were treated poorly by local merchants they stopped patronizing them and their businesses failed. Amazon sits on the same slippery slope and knows that its reputation is built one sale and sometimes one return at a time which is why it has adopted policies similar to those of Sears and Wards. There is a reputational value for many companies to have their products listed with Amazon because they know that they will not have to stand at the front line and defend their own individual return policies. Amazon will do it for them, and if Amazon treats its customers well, it reflects positively on manufacturers who don't have to deal with dissatisfied customers if something goes wrong. That is a double-edged sword, however, as Amazon gets all the credit for the successful consummation of the sale and the after-sale experience. In essence, individual companies cede their reputations to Amazon's sales fulfillment policy. Granted that a bad product is still a bad product, and the original manufacturer will still have to defend it, but the whole return experience rests in Amazon's hands. This singular return policy issue is often a deal-breaker or deal-maker for American consumers. Trust is key and so is ease of return.

Title: Meta could get left behind in the AI arms race—and the stock is paying for it

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg doesn’t have his head in the clouds—and that might be the problem. Shares in the Facebook parent are getting crushed Thursday after it unveiled a mixed set of third-quarter earnings last night and doubled down on plans to billions more on artificial intelligence over the coming year. “Our compute needs have continued to expand meaningfully," finance chief Susan Li told investors late Wednesday. “We expect to invest aggressively to meet these needs both by building our own infrastructure and contracting with third-party cloud providers. As a result, our current expectation is that Capex dollar growth will be notably larger in 2026 than 2025." Those remarks overshadowed both a record quarterly revenue tally of $51.2 billion and a $16 billion tax hit that ate into the group’s bottom line. “Meta has always been a company willing to spend its way into the future," said Jacob Falkencrone, global head of investment strategy at Saxo Bank. “This quarter confirms that pattern, only now the bet is far larger and the payoff less immediate." Meta’s challenge, however, is that it can’t finance its AI ambitions through cash flows in the way that rivals such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft, which have massive commercial cloud computing divisions that generate billions in revenue, are able to do. And that leads to more debt. Bloomberg reported Thursday that Meta is planning to raise $25 billion through a six-part corporate bond offering that will include debt that doesn’t mature until the year 2065. A deal Meta finished last week, aimed at building a new data center in Louisiana, also moved $27 billion in debt from its balance sheet by structuring it through a special-purpose vehicle. Zuckerberg hinted at the idea of selling some of its excess computing power to outside customers if the group “overshoots" on its spending and infrastructure plans. “And then you know, the kind of the very worst case would be that we effectively have just prebuilt for a couple of years, in which case, of course, there would be some loss and depreciation," he said. “But we’d grow into that and use it over time." A lot can change in that waiting period, however, especially given that Meta remains caught in the inherent contradiction of AI itself: If the technology is successful in speeding up tasks and accelerating online efficiencies, users will likely then spend less time on the ad-based platforms such as Facebook and Instagram that drive nearly all of the group’s profits. It’s also worth noting that the Metaverse, Zuckerberg’s last great tech vision that was launched with great fanfare in late 2020, has been something of a dud. Reality Labs, the division created to power that alternative universe, lost $4.4 billion last quarter, taking its cumulative red ink past $70 billion in less than five years. Bank of America analyst Justin Post, however, remains a believer. “We expect Meta stock to be controversial given a limited EPS growth outlook and free cash flow pressure in 2026," he said in a note published Thursday. “However, we see Meta in a position of strength with massive user network and opportunity to integration compelling AI products (including content creation tools) over the next two years." Still, Post lowered his Meta stock price target by $90, taking it to $810 a share, although he kept his Buy rating in place. Meta stock was down 9.6% at 679.73, a move that would mark the biggest single-day since April 2024. Download the Mint app and read premium stories Log in to our website to save your bookmarks.

Title: Integrating event information and multi dimensional relationships for improved financial time series forecasting
URL: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-22926-y
Time Published: 2025-10-31T00:00:00Z

Financial time series prediction has consistently been one of the core research problems in the fields of econometrics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence1. Since the introduction of Brownian motion theory and the efficient market hypothesis in the mid-20th century2,3, scholars have been exploring how to accurately predict the price movements of financial assets. With the increasing complexity of global financial markets, accurate financial forecasting can not only provide scientific basis for investment decisions but also help financial institutions conduct effective risk management and asset allocation, and its importance is increasingly prominent. The complexity of today’s financial markets far exceeds the assumptions of traditional theoretical models. The exponential growth in information dissemination speed has changed the fundamental operating mechanisms of markets, and diversified information sources such as social media, news websites, and financial blogs enable market information to spread at unprecedented speeds, significantly shortening investors’ decision-making windows, making market reactions more rapid and prone to overreaction. The proliferation of algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading has fundamentally changed market microstructure4,5. According to statistics, algorithmic trading accounts for over 70% of trading volume in the U.S. stock market, and the interaction of these automated trading systems creates complex feedback mechanisms that traditional market models based on human behavior struggle to accurately describe. The deepening of globalization has further increased the complexity of financial markets6, with the correlation between different markets significantly increased, and volatility in a single market often rapidly transmitting to other global markets through various channels such as trade connections, capital flows, and investor sentiment. In recent years, deep learning technologies have achieved significant progress in the field of time series prediction, with models such as Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM)7, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)8, and Transformers9 demonstrating strong performance across multiple time series forecasting tasks10,11. However, existing methods primarily focus on the statistical properties of time series data itself, often overlooking two key factors that influence financial markets: first, external event information that drives market behavior (such as corporate announcements, macroeconomic events, and market sentiment)12,13, and second, the complex correlations between assets based on multi-dimensional relationships (such as industry relationships, supply chain relationships, competitive relationships, etc.)14,15. This single-perspective modeling approach limits the predictive accuracy and generalization capability of models in complex financial environments. Although existing research has attempted to address the aforementioned problems, there remain obvious research gaps and technical deficiencies. First, traditional time series models cannot distinguish similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes16. For example, the same price decline may stem from poor corporate earnings reports, overall market corrections, or sudden negative events, but existing models often treat them as identical patterns, leading to limited prediction accuracy17. Consider scenarios of sharp stock price declines where surface price behaviors might be completely identical (such as an 8% single-day drop), but the underlying driving factors are entirely different: earnings-driven declines usually accompanied by high trading volume and strong continuation after earnings announcements18,19; systematic risk declines affect entire sectors or even the entire market; technical adjustment declines usually have small trading volume and easily gain support at key technical levels20,21,22. Existing models often treat these essentially different decline patterns as the same “decline signal,” significantly reducing the accuracy of subsequent predictions. Second, existing multimodal fusion methods mostly adopt simple feature concatenation or early fusion strategies, lacking deep modeling of complex interactive relationships between event information and time series data23,24. These methods often directly concatenate different types of feature vectors, ignoring the intrinsic logical relationships between different modal information, and event information and price data differ in temporal granularity and impact duration, making simple alignment methods prone to information loss. Finally, in terms of asset relationship modeling, most methods only consider single-dimensional relationships (such as price correlations or industry classifications), failing to comprehensively capture the multi-dimensional, multi-level complex correlations among financial assets25. The correlations between financial assets are multi-dimensional, multi-level complex networks, but existing methods show obvious simplification tendencies in relationship modeling: most studies only consider price correlation as one dimension, ignoring other important dimensions such as fundamental similarity, business relevance, and supply chain relationships; many models assume that relationships between assets remain static, unable to adapt to relationship evolution caused by changing market environments26; in the few studies that consider multi-dimensional relationships, they often simply assign equal weights to various dimensions, lacking adaptive weight adjustment mechanisms. Beyond theoretical challenges, the development of actual financial business also places higher requirements on prediction models. Modern quantitative investment strategies require models not only to predict direction but also to predict magnitude and duration27, and investors want to understand the logic behind prediction results, especially when facing abnormal market conditions28. The 2008 financial crisis and 2020 pandemic shock demonstrated that traditional risk models based on historical data often fail when facing extreme events29, and financial institutions urgently need prediction tools that can integrate multi-source information and identify systemic risks in advance30. With the strengthening of fintech regulation, applications such as algorithmic trading and robo-advisors must possess certain interpretability31, and model decision-making processes need to be reasonably explained to regulatory agencies and customers. Based on these challenges, this study aims to address the following three key questions: How to effectively fuse event information with time series data, enabling models to understand the intrinsic meaning of price patterns under different event contexts; How to construct multi-dimensional asset relationship networks to more comprehensively capture complex correlations in financial markets; How to design effective fusion mechanisms to achieve deep integration of event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors.” To address the above problems, this paper proposes the Dual-stream Alpha Factor Fusion Network (DAFF-Net), which achieves deep understanding and accurate prediction of financial time series data through the organic combination of an event-driven temporal pattern extractor and a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module. The core innovations of DAFF-Net include: Event-aware routing mechanism: Designed an event-aware router that fuses time series data with contextual event information encoded from news, corporate announcements, and macroeconomic data, enabling the model to understand the underlying narratives behind market fluctuations and effectively distinguish market behavior patterns that appear similar on the surface but are essentially different. Multi-dimensional relationship adaptive fusion: Proposed a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module that constructs a comprehensive asset relationship network more effective than single-relationship methods through adaptive fusion of frequency domain, fundamental, and knowledge graph relationships, capable of dynamically adjusting the importance of different relationship dimensions according to market conditions. Soft clustering attention mechanism: Adopted soft clustering strategies to replace traditional hard clustering methods, preserving fine-grained weak relationship information and avoiding information loss that hard clustering might cause, which is particularly important in complex financial market environments. Dual-stream fusion architecture: Designed an innovative dual-stream fusion framework that achieves deep integration of event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors,” maximizing the synergistic effects of different modal information through carefully designed masked attention mechanisms. The structure of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a detailed introduction to the overall architectural design of DAFF-Net, including the event-driven temporal pattern extractor, multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, and contextual factor fusion with multi-horizon prediction mechanism; Section 3 presents comprehensive experimental validation on Amazon stock data, including dataset construction, baseline model comparisons, and result analysis; Section 4 provides in-depth discussion of the effectiveness of technical innovations, deep interpretation of model performance, and research limitations with future prospects; Section 5 summarizes the main contributions and practical application value of this research. DAFF-Net adopts a dual-stream fusion design philosophy, with its overall architecture shown in Fig. 1. The core idea of this architecture is to decompose the financial time series prediction task into two complementary learning processes: event-driven temporal pattern understanding and multi-dimensional relationship-aware cross-asset information fusion. As shown in the central part of Fig. 1, DAFF-Net receives three types of heterogeneous data inputs. Let the time series data be \(X \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times T \times D}\), where N represents the number of assets, T represents the time window length, and D represents the feature dimension. Event data is represented as \(E \in {\mathbb {R}}^{T \times D_e}\), where \(D_e\) is the event vector dimension. Relationship data includes fundamental information \(F \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_f}\) and knowledge graph structure \(G \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\). After instance normalization processing, the data streams are respectively fed into two parallel feature extraction branches: Left branch (as shown in the left panel of Fig. 1) is the event-driven temporal pattern extractor, which fuses temporal segments with event vectors through an event-aware router: where \({\textbf{h}}_{t} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{(D+D_e)}\) represents the fused representation at time t. Right branch (as shown in the right panel of Fig. 1) is the multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, which generates three types of relationship matrices in parallel. The frequency-domain relationship matrix is computed through fast Fourier transform: The fundamental relationship matrix computes similarity based on structured data: The knowledge graph relationship matrix is directly obtained from the graph structure: These three relationship matrices are integrated through an adaptive fusion module. As shown in the bottom right corner of Fig. 1, fusion weights are learned through a small neural network: The final fused relationship matrix is: where \(\odot\) denotes element-wise multiplication. As shown in the contextual factor fusion module in the center of Fig. 1, the outputs of the two branches are integrated through a masked attention mechanism. The event-aware temporal features \(Z_{\text {temporal}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_h}\) output from the left branch and the channel attention matrix \(A_{\text {channel}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\) output from the right branch are fused as: This fused representation is then passed to the multi-horizon prediction heads, as shown at the top of Fig. 1. The prediction heads consist of multiple feedforward networks that generate predictions for different time spans: where \(h \in \{1, 5, 20\}\) represents the prediction days, and \({\hat{Y}}_{h} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times 1}\) is the corresponding return prediction. Figure 1 clearly shows the information flow of the entire architecture: multimodal inputs at the bottom undergo feature extraction and relationship modeling through two specially designed branches, then achieve deep integration of “narrative factors” and “relationship factors” in the fusion module, and finally output prediction results for different time spans through multi-horizon prediction heads. This design enables DAFF-Net to simultaneously capture event-driven dynamics and complex inter-asset correlations in financial markets, achieving more accurate multi-horizon predictions. Overall architecture diagram of DAFF-Net. Traditional time series models in financial markets often face the “pattern confusion” problem, i.e., inability to distinguish similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes. For example, the same price decline may stem from poor corporate earnings reports, overall market corrections, or sudden negative events, but traditional models often treat them as identical patterns. To address this key problem, we designed an event-driven temporal pattern extractor, whose architecture is shown in the left panel of Fig. 1. The core of this module is the Event-Aware Router, which addresses the critical challenges of multi-source event integration and temporal alignment. Unlike simple concatenation approaches, our router employs a sophisticated event processing pipeline that handles heterogeneous event types with different temporal granularities and impact characteristics. Multi-Source Event Processing We employ BERT-base-uncased32 pre-trained transformer model for encoding textual event information into 768-dimensional dense representations. The BERT model processes concatenated news headlines and lead paragraphs, with maximum sequence length of 512 tokens. We first categorize events into three distinct types based on their market impact patterns and temporal characteristics: where: \(w_{news}, w_{corp}, w_{macro}\) are learnable event type weights \(\text {decay}(t - t_{news})\) models the temporal decay of news impact: \(\exp (-\lambda (t - t_{news}))\) \(\text {impact}(\text {type}_{corp})\) assigns different weights based on announcement types (earnings: 1.0, guidance: 0.8, strategic: 0.6, operational: 0.4) \(\text {persistence}(\text {policy}_{macro})\) captures the lasting effect of macroeconomic policies Temporal Alignment and Weighting To handle the temporal misalignment between high-frequency trading data and irregular event occurrences, we employ an attention-based temporal alignment mechanism: where \(Q_t\) represents the query vector from time series data at time t, \(K_e\) represents the key vector from event e, and \(\text {temporal}\_\text {mask}(t, t_e)\) applies exponential decay based on the time distance between the trading timestamp and event timestamp. Adaptive Event Fusion The final event representation integrates all event types through learned attention weights: where \(\alpha _i\) are dynamically computed attention weights based on current market volatility and \(\text {EventMemory}_{t-1}\) maintains a momentum term from previous significant events. Final Router Input The temporal segment and processed event vector are then fused: Traditional approaches often rely on generic knowledge bases without proper domain adaptation. Our method addresses this limitation through a systematic financial-domain knowledge graph construction process: Financial Entity Mapping We establish explicit mappings from generic knowledge entities to financial assets through: Relationship Strength Quantification Rather than using arbitrary fixed weights, we derive relationship strengths through empirical analysis of market co-movements and fundamental connections: where \(\rho _{*}\) are empirically derived scaling factors based on historical correlation analysis: Dynamic Relationship Updates The knowledge graph relationships are updated quarterly based on: Corporate action announcements (M&A, partnerships, spin-offs) Supply chain relationship changes (supplier/customer updates) Regulatory classification changes (GICS sector reclassifications) Cross-holdings and institutional ownership changes This enhanced event-aware routing mechanism ensures that: Different event types are processed according to their inherent characteristics Temporal misalignments are properly handled through attention mechanisms Event impacts are modeled with realistic decay patterns Knowledge graph relationships reflect actual financial market structures Relationship weights are empirically grounded rather than arbitrary The router matches current market conditions to a set of learnable temporal pattern prototypes \(\{P_1, P_2,\ldots , P_M\}\), where each prototype \(P_i \in {\mathbb {R}}^{D_p}\) represents a specific event-driven market behavior pattern. These prototypes are automatically learned through the training process, with typical patterns including (Table 1): Routing probabilities are computed through attention mechanism: where \(W_r \in {\mathbb {R}}^{(D+D_e) \times D_p}\) is a learnable projection matrix. Based on routing probabilities, the system selects Top-K most relevant Linear-based Pattern Extractors (LPEs). Each extractor \(\text {LPE}_i\) is an expert network specifically designed for particular patterns: The final output is obtained through weighted aggregation: Event-Driven Temporal Pattern Extraction The correlations between financial assets are multi-dimensional and dynamically changing, making it difficult for single relationship modeling methods to comprehensively capture this complexity. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 1, our proposed multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module addresses this problem by generating and fusing three types of relationship views in parallel. To ensure experimental validity and prevent any form of future information leakage, all relationship matrices and model components strictly adhere to temporal constraints. For any prediction at time t, we guarantee that: Frequency-domain relationships are computed using only historical price data from the sliding window \([t-L_{\text {freq}}, t-1]\), where \(L_{\text {freq}} = 60\) trading days: Fundamental relationships utilize only the most recent quarterly financial data available before time t, ensuring no forward-looking bias: Knowledge graph relationships reflect the corporate structure and business relationships as documented up to time \(t-1\), with quarterly updates based on publicly disclosed information: Adaptive fusion weights \(\varvec{\alpha }\) are learned exclusively on the training dataset (2010–2020) and remain frozen during validation (2021–2022) and testing (2023–2025) phases: This temporal discipline ensures that our experimental results reflect genuine predictive capability rather than information leakage artifacts. We verified compliance by re-computing all performance metrics with strict temporal validation protocols. Frequency-domain relationship matrix: Captures periodic similarities in price movements through real Fast Fourier Transform (rFFT): where \({\tilde{X}}_i^H\) denotes the complex conjugate transpose. Fundamental relationship matrix: Computes cosine similarity based on normalized fundamental data: where fundamental features include (Table 2): Knowledge graph relationship matrix: Quantifies structured relationships between entities by processing financial knowledge graphs. We conducted extensive parameter experiments to determine optimal relationship weights, as shown in Table 3. Based on comprehensive parameter experiments across multiple validation periods, the optimal knowledge graph relationship matrix is defined as: The parameter selection was validated through cross-validation on the training set (2010-2020) and confirmed on the validation set (2021-2022), ensuring robust performance across different market conditions (Table 4). The three relationship matrices are dynamically integrated through an adaptive fusion module. Fusion weights are learned through a multilayer perceptron that takes the current market state as input: The fused relationship matrix is: To achieve more robust “soft” clustering, we apply the Softmax function to each row of the fused matrix to generate a channel attention matrix: The advantage of this soft clustering method over hard clustering is that it preserves subtle weak relationship information, which is particularly important in financial markets. Multi-Dimensional Relation-Aware Soft Clustering The contextual factor fusion module is a key component of the DAFF-Net architecture, responsible for deep integration of heterogeneous information from the two branches. As shown in the fusion module at the center of Fig. 1, this module employs a masked attention mechanism: where \(Z_{\text {temporal}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_h}\) is the temporal features from the event-driven branch, and \(A_{\text {channel}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\) is the channel attention matrix from the relationship-aware branch. To enhance feature representation capability, we further introduce residual connections and layer normalization: The final fused representation is obtained through another feedforward network: The multi-horizon prediction heads adopt a design with shared bottom-layer features and independent prediction branches. For each prediction horizon \(h \in \{1, 5, 20\}\), we design independent prediction networks: where the parameters of each prediction head are independently optimized to adapt to the prediction characteristics of different time spans (Table 5). To simultaneously optimize prediction performance across multiple horizons, we adopt a weighted multi-task loss function: where the loss for each horizon is mean squared error: The weights \(\lambda _h\) are set according to prediction difficulty and practical application importance: \(\lambda _1 = 0.5\), \(\lambda _5 = 0.3\), \(\lambda _{20} = 0.2\). Contextual Factor Fusion and Multi-Horizon Prediction This design enables DAFF-Net to effectively integrate event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors,” while providing targeted optimization for prediction tasks across different time spans, thereby achieving excellent performance in multi-horizon financial prediction tasks. This study selects Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock as the primary research subject, based on several important considerations: First, as a global leading technology giant, Amazon’s stock price is subject to complex influences from multiple factors, including changes in company fundamentals, industry technological developments, macroeconomic policies, and market sentiment fluctuations, providing an ideal testing environment for validating our multimodal fusion method; Second, Amazon enjoys extremely high attention in capital markets, with abundant news reports, analyst research reports, and investor discussions, providing sufficient raw materials for constructing high-quality event datasets; Finally, as an important constituent stock of the NASDAQ market, Amazon has complex correlations with other technology stocks, consumer stocks, etc., helping to validate the effectiveness of our multi-dimensional relationship-aware module. We constructed a comprehensive multimodal dataset spanning from January 1, 2010, to May 31, 2025, totaling over 15 years of complete market data. This time span covers multiple important market cycles, including the technology stock recovery period of 2010-2015, the technology stock boom period of 2016-2020, the pandemic shock and recovery period of 2020-2022, and the interest rate hike cycle and artificial intelligence boom period of 2023-2025, ensuring the representativeness of the dataset and the generalization capability of the model. Data sources cover multiple authoritative financial data providers: quantitative trading data is mainly obtained from Yahoo Finance API and Refinitiv Eikon terminals, including daily open, high, low, close prices, volume, and adjusted prices; news and announcement data is collected in real-time through Bloomberg Terminal News Feed, supplemented by relevant reports from mainstream financial media such as Reuters and Wall Street Journal; fundamental data is extracted from Refinitiv and S&P Capital IQ databases, covering financial statements, valuation indicators, and industry classification information. While Amazon (AMZN) serves as our primary prediction target, the multi-dimensional relationship-aware module requires a comprehensive asset universe to construct meaningful N\(\times\)N relationship matrices. We carefully selected a universe of 50 large-cap technology and related stocks to ensure robust relationship modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. Asset Selection Criteria: Market capitalization > $50 billion as of December 2020 Primary listing on NASDAQ or NYSE Technology, consumer discretionary, or communication services sectors (GICS classification) Complete daily trading data availability from 2010–2025 Minimum average daily trading volume > 1 million shares Final Asset Universe (N=50): Core Technology: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, META, NFLX, NVDA, ORCL, CRM, ADBE, INTC, AMD, CSCO, AVGO, QCOM, TXN E-commerce & Consumer: AMZN, EBAY, SHOP, ETSY, WMT, TGT, COST, HD, NKE Cloud & Software: SNOW, PLTR, ZM, WORK, DDOG, NET, OKTA, MDB, CRWD Communication: VZ, T, TMUS, CHTR, CMCSA, DIS, NFLX Related Technology: TSLA, UBER, LYFT, SQ, PYPL, V, MA Temporal Data Handling: All 50 assets follow identical temporal splits: Training period: 2010–2020 (all assets) Validation period: 2021–2022 (all assets) Testing period: 2023–2025 (all assets) Missing data: Forward-fill for gaps \(\le\) 3 days, exclude assets with >5% missing data in any period Delisting handling: Assets delisted during study period are excluded from the relationship matrices after delisting date Relationship Matrix Computation: For frequency-domain and fundamental relationships, we compute pairwise similarities across all 50 assets, resulting in symmetric 50\(\times\)50 matrices. For knowledge graph relationships, we manually verified and annotated business relationships among these 50 entities using SEC 10-K filings, partnership announcements, and industry databases. The Amazon prediction task extracts the relevant row/column from these matrices corresponding to AMZN’s relationships with the other 49 assets. This design ensures that AMZN’s relationship modeling benefits from a rich, diverse set of comparable assets while maintaining strict temporal discipline across the entire universe. Knowledge Graph Construction and Domain Mapping Knowledge graph data construction involves a systematic process of mapping general knowledge bases to financial domain entities. We established comprehensive mappings through the following multi-step procedure: Step 1: Entity Identification and Mapping We constructed a mapping table linking general knowledge entities to financial assets through multiple identification mechanisms: Primary Mapping: Direct ticker symbol matching (e.g., DBpedia:Amazon.com \(\rightarrow\) NASDAQ:AMZN) Secondary Mapping: Company name disambiguation using ISIN codes and official registrations Tertiary Mapping: Cross-reference validation through multiple knowledge bases (DBpedia, Wikidata, OpenCorporates) Step 2: Relationship Extraction and Validation From the mapped entities, we extract structured relationships using SPARQL queries and natural language processing: Direct Business Relations: Partnership agreements, joint ventures, strategic alliances extracted from SEC filings and corporate announcements Ownership Structures: Parent-subsidiary relationships from corporate registrations and 10-K filings Supply Chain Networks: Customer-supplier relationships from business dependency disclosures Industry Classifications: GICS sector mappings validated against multiple classification systems (SIC, NAICS, ICB) Step 3: Relationship Strength Quantification We quantify relationship strengths through empirical analysis of historical market co-movements and fundamental connections, as detailed in Table 6. Step 4: Dynamic Relationship Updates The knowledge graph undergoes quarterly updates to reflect corporate actions and market structure changes: Corporate Actions: M&A announcements, spin-offs, and restructuring events Partnership Changes: New strategic alliances and partnership dissolutions Supply Chain Evolution: Customer/supplier relationship updates from annual reports Regulatory Reclassifications: GICS sector changes and industry standard updates This systematic approach ensures that our knowledge graph accurately reflects the evolving landscape of financial market relationships while maintaining high data quality and validation standards. The mapping process achieved 96.1% validation rate across all entity types, providing a robust foundation for relationship-aware modeling. To comprehensively understand the market behavior characteristics of Amazon stock and provide a basis for model design, we first conducted a detailed analysis of the price time series. Amazon stock price time series (2010-2025). As shown in Fig. 2, Amazon stock exhibited typical growth stock characteristics during the study period, with an overall price trend showing strong upward momentum. Several important phase characteristics can be clearly observed from Fig. 2: During 2010-2012, stock prices fluctuated at relatively low levels, with the price range mainly between \(\$5-25\), reflecting the company’s early market positioning and investor expectations; During 2013-2017, stock prices began to rise significantly, climbing from about \(\$25\) to nearly \(\$100\), corresponding to the rapid development of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and global expansion of e-commerce business; During 2018-2021, stock prices experienced more dramatic volatility, reaching a high of about \(\$180\) during the 2020 pandemic, followed by a significant pullback in 2022 with lows around \(\$80\), reflecting market reassessment of technology stock valuations; Since 2023, stock prices have rebounded strongly again, creating new highs in 2024 exceeding \(\$240\), mainly benefiting from artificial intelligence technology breakthroughs and optimistic market expectations for AI application prospects. To further understand market participation and liquidity characteristics, we analyzed the trading volume change patterns during the corresponding period, which is important for assessing the credibility of price fluctuations and market depth. Amazon stock trading volume time series (2010-2025). Figure 3 shows the trading volume change patterns during the corresponding period, providing important supplementary information for understanding market participation and price volatility. Several significant characteristics can be observed from the trading volume data in Fig. 3: First, trading volume typically shows significant amplification during major events, particularly during the initial outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020 and the market adjustment period in the second half of 2022, with daily trading volumes often exceeding 600–800 million shares, far above the normal level of 200–400 million shares; Second, the seasonal patterns of trading volume are relatively stable, usually increasing during earnings report seasons (January, April, July, October each year) and year-end/year-beginning periods; Finally, overall trading volume levels have increased in recent years with the proliferation of algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading, reflecting the evolution of market microstructure. Considering the important role of technical analysis in financial prediction, we need to examine price performance relative to key technical indicators to identify important trend signals and support/resistance levels, which will provide valuable learning targets for our temporal pattern extractor. Amazon stock price vs. moving averages comparison. Figure 4 further demonstrates the relationship between price and technical indicators. By comparing closing prices with 50-day and 200-day moving averages, we can identify important trend reversal points and technical signals. Fig. 4 clearly shows several important technical breakthroughs: the upward breakthrough of 50-day and 200-day moving averages in early 2013, marking the establishment of a long-term uptrend; two technical adjustments in late 2018 and early 2022, where stock prices fell below short-term moving averages but ultimately received support from long-term trend lines; the strong breakthrough in the second half of 2023, where stock prices regained footing above all major moving averages. These technical characteristics provide rich learning samples for our temporal pattern extractor. Finally, to understand the statistical distribution characteristics of returns and validate the necessity of extreme event handling in our model design, we analyzed the probability distribution characteristics of daily returns. Amazon stock daily returns distribution histogram. The daily returns distribution histogram in Fig. 5 reveals the statistical characteristics of Amazon stock returns, showing typical “fat-tailed” distribution characteristics of financial time series. From Fig. 5, it can be seen that the distribution center is close to zero, consistent with efficient market hypothesis expectations, but compared to standard normal distribution, this distribution shows obvious excess kurtosis and thicker tails. Specifically, about 68% of daily returns are concentrated in the −2% to +2% range, about 95% of observations are between −6% to +6%, but there are still considerable extreme values exceeding the expected range of normal distribution. This distribution characteristic indicates that financial markets have relatively frequent extreme events, validating the necessity of considering event-driven factors in our model design. To ensure experimental rigor and result reliability, we adopted a strict time series data partitioning strategy to avoid any form of future information leakage. The specific partitioning scheme is: the training set covers January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2020, totaling 11 years of historical data, providing sufficient learning samples for the model; the validation set is set from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2022, totaling 2 years of data, used for hyperparameter tuning and model selection; the test set includes January 1, 2023, to May 31, 2025, approximately 2.5 years of the latest data, used to evaluate model generalization performance in actual application scenarios. This partitioning design has important practical significance: the training set time span is sufficiently long, covering multiple complete market cycles, ensuring the model can learn patterns under various market conditions; the validation set corresponds to the post-pandemic market environment, including new market characteristics such as monetary policy shifts and rising inflation pressures, helping the model adapt to environmental changes; the test set is entirely in the period after model training, including unprecedented market events such as the latest interest rate hike cycle and AI technology breakthroughs, providing a severe test for evaluating the model’s true predictive capability. In the data preprocessing stage, we applied corresponding standardization methods for different types of data: price data was transformed through log returns to eliminate the effect of price levels; fundamental data used rolling Z-score standardization, maintaining temporal characteristics while eliminating dimensional differences; event data was encoded into fixed-dimension vector representations through pre-trained BERT models; relationship data was normalized to ensure comparability across different relationship types. These preprocessing steps laid a solid foundation for subsequent model training and evaluation. To comprehensively evaluate the performance advantages of DAFF-Net, we carefully selected eight representative baseline models that cover the complete spectrum from traditional statistical methods to the latest deep learning techniques, providing thorough validation of our method’s effectiveness and advancement. Traditional statistical models: We selected ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)33 as the representative of classical time series prediction methods. ARIMA has good theoretical foundations and interpretability, is widely applied in financial time series prediction, and provides an important benchmark for evaluating the improvement magnitude of deep learning methods. Classical deep learning models: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)7 as a representative of recurrent neural networks, can effectively handle long sequence dependencies and is a classical method in the time series prediction domain. TCN (Temporal Convolutional Network)34 adopts causal convolution design, has advantages in parallel training and good long-term dependency modeling capability, representing the application of convolutional neural networks in time series prediction. Attention mechanism models: Transformer9 as the pioneering work of attention mechanisms, achieves direct modeling of relationships between arbitrary positions in sequences through global self-attention mechanisms. Informer35 introduces sparse attention mechanisms based on Transformer, specifically optimized for long sequence prediction tasks, improving computational efficiency. Multimodal and relationship modeling methods: DUET36 as the direct foundation of our work, adopts dual clustering mechanisms to model in temporal and channel dimensions respectively, representing advanced methods in current time series prediction. MM-LSTM (Multimodal LSTM)37 fuses multiple data sources into the LSTM framework, providing baseline reference for multimodal time series prediction. Simple decision-focused baselines: To establish fundamental performance benchmarks, we include two essential naive baselines that represent the most basic prediction strategies. The No-Change baseline assumes that stock returns will be zero for all prediction horizons, representing the null hypothesis that prices follow a random walk without predictable drift. The Market Index baseline predicts individual stock returns based on the historical beta relationship with the NASDAQ-100 index: where \(\beta _{AMZN}\) is estimated using a 252-day rolling window of historical returns prior to the prediction date. This baseline represents a simple factor model approach commonly used in practical finance. These fundamental baselines are essential for validating that sophisticated models provide meaningful improvements over the most basic prediction strategies. All baseline models adopt the same data partitioning strategy and evaluation metrics, ensuring experimental fairness. Hyperparameters were optimized through grid search on the validation set, with each model achieving its optimal configuration. To comprehensively evaluate model prediction performance across different time spans, we adopted two complementary evaluation metrics. Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the primary metric can effectively measure the deviation between predicted and true values, is sensitive to outliers, and meets the needs of financial risk management. Coefficient of determination (\(\text {R}^{2}\)) as an auxiliary metric reflects the model’s ability to explain data variability and facilitates understanding of relative model performance. We set three prediction time spans: 1-day, 5-day, and 20-day, corresponding to the practical needs of short-term trading, medium-term investment, and long-term allocation respectively. This multi-horizon setup can comprehensively evaluate model generalization capability under different prediction difficulties. To ensure result reliability, all experiments were conducted in the same hardware environment using the same random seeds and training strategies. Each model was fully trained until convergence and evaluated on the test set for final assessment. Several important trends can be observed from the quantitative results in Table 7: Overall performance ranking: DAFF-Net achieved the best performance across all evaluation metrics, validating the effectiveness of our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion approach. Multimodal methods (MM-LSTM and DAFF-Net) significantly outperformed unimodal methods, demonstrating the importance of multi-source information fusion. Among unimodal methods, DUET as the most advanced baseline performed best, proving the value of the dual clustering concept. Prediction difficulty analysis: The performance of all models declined as the prediction time span increased, which aligns with general rules of financial prediction. Interestingly, DAFF-Net’s relative advantage is more pronounced in long-term prediction (20-day), with \(\text {R}^{2}\) reaching 0.51, while the strongest baseline MM-LSTM only achieved 0.45, representing a relative improvement of 13.3%. This indicates that our method has significant advantages in handling complex long-term dependencies. Method type comparison: Traditional statistical method ARIMA performed worst across all metrics, reflecting the limitations of linear methods in handling complex financial data. Deep learning methods generally outperformed statistical methods, with attention mechanism methods (Transformer, Informer) outperforming traditional recurrent and convolutional methods, demonstrating the advantages of attention mechanisms in capturing long-term dependencies. Relative improvement magnitude: Compared to the strongest unimodal baseline DUET, DAFF-Net reduced MSE by 15.2% (from 0.0171 to 0.0145) and improved \(\text {R}^{2}\) by 15.5% (from 0.58 to 0.67) in 1-day prediction. Compared to the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net reduced MSE by 10.5% and improved \(\text {R}^{2}\) by 9.8% in 1-day prediction, proving our technical innovation in multimodal fusion. Fundamental baseline validation: The inclusion of naive baselines provides essential context for evaluating model sophistication. The No-Change baseline achieved \(\text {R}^{2}\) scores of 0.17, 0.12, and 0.08 across the three prediction horizons, representing the null hypothesis performance. The Market Index baseline, utilizing beta-adjusted market returns, improved to \(\text {R}^{2}\) scores of 0.21, 0.18, and 0.13, demonstrating the value of incorporating systematic market factors. Notably, even the traditional ARIMA model substantially outperformed these fundamental baselines, validating the necessity of time series modeling techniques. DAFF-Net’s performance represents a 3.2\(\times\) improvement over the No-Change baseline and a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the Market Index baseline in 20-day prediction \(\text {R}^{2}\), confirming that our sophisticated multimodal approach provides meaningful predictive value beyond the most basic strategies. These quantitative results fully demonstrate the superiority of DAFF-Net in financial time series prediction tasks, particularly showcasing unique advantages in handling event-driven market dynamics and complex asset correlation relationships. To more intuitively demonstrate the performance advantages of DAFF-Net relative to various baseline models and deeply analyze the performance differences of different models on multi-time horizon prediction tasks, we conducted comprehensive analysis of experimental results through various visualization methods. First, to clearly compare the prediction errors of all models across different prediction time horizons, we used bar charts to display the comparison results of MSE metrics. MSE comparison bar chart for different models. Several important characteristics can be clearly observed from Fig. 6: First, DAFF-Net achieved the lowest MSE values across all three time horizons, where the yellow bars (1-day MSE), orange bars (5-day MSE), and red bars (20-day MSE) are all significantly lower than all other baseline models, validating the superiority of our method. The inclusion of fundamental baselines (No-Change and Market Index) provides essential context for evaluating model sophistication. These naive baselines achieved MSE values of 0.0312–0.0351 and 0.0298–0.0342 respectively, representing the most basic prediction strategies. Even the traditional ARIMA model substantially outperformed these fundamental approaches, validating the necessity of sophisticated modeling techniques. Second, the MSE values of all models increased significantly with increasing prediction time horizons, which aligns with general rules of time series prediction—long-term prediction is more challenging than short-term prediction. Particularly noteworthy is that the traditional ARIMA model achieved an MSE of 0.0348 for long-term prediction (20-day), almost 1.5 times that of DAFF-Net (0.0228), highlighting the advantages of deep learning methods in handling complex nonlinear relationships. The gaps between deep learning models are more pronounced in long-term prediction, indicating that the importance of architectural design becomes increasingly prominent as prediction difficulty increases. Next, to analyze the trend of each model’s explanatory capability with changing prediction time horizons, we displayed the variation patterns of R2 metrics across different prediction horizons through line charts. R2 score variation trends for different models. Figure 7 reveals the intrinsic patterns of model performance variation with prediction time horizons. From the figure, it can be observed that all models’ R2 scores show a declining trend with increasing prediction time horizons, but the decline magnitudes differ significantly. The fundamental baselines (No-Change and Market Index, represented by the bottom two lines) demonstrate the poorest performance, with R2 scores declining from 0.17 and 0.21 respectively in 1-day prediction to merely 0.08 and 0.13 in 20-day prediction. DAFF-Net (red line) maintained the highest R2 scores across all time horizons, particularly achieving an excellent performance of 0.67 in 1-day prediction, significantly surpassing all other methods. The performance gaps between different model categories become increasingly evident as prediction horizons extend: fundamental baselines plateau at very low R2 values, traditional statistical methods (ARIMA) show steep decline from 0.41 to 0.22, while sophisticated deep learning methods maintain more gradual degradation. DAFF-Net’s decline is remarkably stable, from 0.67 to 0.51, demonstrating superior stability and generalization capability. Notably, the spread between the best and worst performing models expands from 0.50 in 1-day prediction (0.67–0.17) to 0.43 in 20-day prediction (0.51–0.08), indicating that advanced modeling becomes even more critical for longer-horizon forecasting. Finally, to comprehensively evaluate the performance differences between DAFF-Net and major competitors from multiple dimensions, we selected the three best-performing models for radar chart comparison analysis. Comprehensive performance radar chart of DAFF-Net vs. baseline models. Figure 8 displays the performance of the three best models—DAFF-Net, DUET, and MM-LSTM—across six key dimensions through radar chart format. The six axes of the radar chart correspond to MSE-1d, MSE-5d, MSE-20d, R2−1d, R2−5d, and R2−20d respectively, where MSE metrics are transformed by reciprocal to maintain consistent directionality with R2 metrics (larger values indicate better performance). From the chart, it is evident that DAFF-Net (red line) forms the largest coverage area, outperforming or at least equaling the other two baseline models across all six dimensions. Particularly noteworthy is that DAFF-Net’s advantages are most significant in dimensions related to long-term prediction (MSE-20d and R2−20d), which again confirms the effectiveness of our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion mechanisms in handling complex long-term dependencies. DUET (yellow line), as the direct foundation of our work, is surpassed by DAFF-Net in all dimensions, validating the value of our technical improvements. MM-LSTM (orange line), although also adopting multimodal fusion strategies, still lags behind DAFF-Net in performance, indicating that our innovations in fusion mechanism design have substantial improvement effects. Based on the results of the above visualization analysis, we further conducted precise quantitative evaluation of DAFF-Net’s performance improvements. Fundamental baseline validation demonstrates the substantial value of sophisticated modeling: DAFF-Net’s performance represents a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the No-Change baseline and a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the Market Index baseline in 20-day prediction R2 (0.51 vs 0.13), confirming that our multimodal approach provides meaningful predictive value beyond the most basic strategies. Compared to the strongest unimodal baseline DUET, DAFF-Net achieved significant improvements in 1-day prediction tasks with MSE reduction of 15.2% (from 0.0171 to 0.0145) and R2 improvement of 15.5% (from 0.58 to 0.67). In the more challenging 20-day prediction task, the improvement magnitude is even more prominent, with MSE reduction of 12.3% (from 0.0260 to 0.0228) and R2 improvement of 21.4% (from 0.42 to 0.51). Compared to the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net also demonstrated stable performance advantages. In 1-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 10.5% and R2 improved by 9.8%; in 5-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 7.4% and R2 improved by 7.0%; in 20-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 9.2% and R2 improved by 13.3%. These quantitative results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed event-driven temporal pattern extraction and multi-dimensional relationship-aware fusion mechanisms. The hierarchical performance structure revealed by our comprehensive baseline comparison validates the progressive value of modeling sophistication: fundamental baselines (No-Change, Market Index) establish the baseline performance floor; traditional econometric methods (ARIMA) provide moderate improvements; deep learning approaches (LSTM, TCN, Transformer) achieve substantial gains; and multimodal fusion methods (MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net) deliver the highest performance. Crucially, DAFF-Net’s 13.3% improvement over the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM in 20-day prediction demonstrates that sophisticated fusion mechanisms provide meaningful benefits even among advanced multimodal approaches. Particularly worth emphasizing is that DAFF-Net’s relative advantages are more pronounced in long-term prediction, which has important significance for practical financial applications. In quantitative investment and risk management, the ability to accurately predict market trends over longer time horizons is often more valuable than short-term prediction, as it provides more sufficient time windows and more stable strategic foundations for investment decisions. Our experimental results indicate that through effective integration of event information and multi-dimensional relationship information, DAFF-Net can better capture long-term patterns in financial markets, thus having greater potential value in practical applications. To validate the individual contributions of DAFF-Net’s core technical innovations, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies by systematically removing or replacing key components. This analysis demonstrates the necessity and effectiveness of each proposed module. We design six ablation variants to isolate the contribution of each major component: DAFF-Net-NoEvent: Remove the entire event-driven temporal pattern extractor, using only price time series data DAFF-Net-NoRelation: Remove the multi-dimensional relationship-aware module, using only temporal features DAFF-Net-SingleRel: Replace multi-dimensional relationships with frequency-domain relationships only DAFF-Net-HardCluster: Replace soft clustering with hard k-means clustering (k=8) DAFF-Net-NoFusion: Remove contextual factor fusion, using simple concatenation instead DAFF-Net-NoRouter: Replace event-aware router with simple concatenation of events and time series Each ablation variant maintains the same training procedure and hyperparameter settings to ensure fair comparison. Table 8 presents the performance degradation when each component is removed or simplified. The ablation results reveal several important insights about the relative importance of different components: Event-Driven Module (Highest Impact): Removing the event-driven temporal pattern extractor causes the largest performance degradation (10.1% to 15.9% across metrics), confirming that event information provides crucial predictive signals that pure price-based models cannot capture. The impact is particularly pronounced for longer prediction horizons, supporting our hypothesis that events provide valuable information for understanding market narratives. Multi-Dimensional Relationships (Significant Impact): Complete removal of relationship modeling results in 6.1% to 9.9% performance loss, demonstrating the importance of cross-asset information. Interestingly, the relationship module’s contribution is more consistent across prediction horizons compared to the event module. Multi-Dimensional vs. Single-Dimensional Relationships: Using only frequency-domain relationships (DAFF-Net-SingleRel) leads to 3.5% to 5.6% degradation compared to the full multi-dimensional approach. This validates our hypothesis that different relationship types capture complementary information about asset correlations. Soft vs. Hard Clustering: The soft clustering mechanism provides consistent but moderate improvements (2.0% to 4.1%) over hard clustering. While the improvement is smaller than other components, it demonstrates the value of preserving nuanced relationship information. Contextual Factor Fusion: The specialized fusion mechanism contributes 4.8% to 7.6% improvement over simple concatenation, highlighting the importance of carefully designed information integration. Event-Aware Router: The sophisticated event routing provides 3.1% to 5.2% improvement over naive event concatenation, validating the value of learned event-pattern matching. To understand how components interact, we examine cumulative ablation effects (Table 9): The cumulative analysis shows that: (1) Core innovations (event processing + multi-dimensional relationships) contribute 21.6% of total performance; (2) Complete removal of all innovations results in 35.3% performance degradation; (3) The final price-only configuration performs similarly to advanced unimodal baselines like Transformer, validating our baseline comparisons. We observe interesting interaction effects between components: Event-Relationship Synergy: When both event and relationship modules are present, their combined effect (21.6% improvement) exceeds the sum of individual contributions (13.7% + 9.1% = 22.8%), suggesting slight negative interaction. This may indicate some information overlap between event signals and cross-asset relationships. Fusion Mechanism Dependency: The fusion module’s contribution increases when both primary streams are active, indicating that sophisticated fusion becomes more valuable as input complexity increases. This comprehensive ablation study confirms that each proposed component contributes meaningfully to DAFF-Net’s performance, with the event-driven module providing the largest individual benefit and multi-dimensional relationship modeling providing substantial complementary value. To evaluate the generalizability of DAFF-Net beyond the primary Amazon case study, we conducted additional validation experiments on a diverse set of stocks representing different sectors and market characteristics. This cross-asset analysis addresses concerns about sector-specific overfitting and demonstrates the broader applicability of our methodological approach. We selected four representative stocks from distinct sectors to provide comprehensive cross-validation: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ): Healthcare/Pharmaceutical sector, representing defensive value stocks with stable fundamentals and lower volatility JPMorgan Chase (JPM): Financial services sector, exhibiting strong sensitivity to macroeconomic events and interest rate changes ExxonMobil (XOM): Energy sector, characterized by commodity price dependencies and cyclical behavior patterns Tesla (TSLA): Electric vehicle/Technology sector, representing high-growth, high-volatility stocks with strong event-driven characteristics These assets were chosen to span the spectrum of market behaviors: from stable dividend-paying value stocks (JNJ) to highly volatile growth stocks (TSLA), from cyclical commodities exposure (XOM) to interest rate sensitive financials (JPM). Table 10 presents the comparative performance of DAFF-Net against the three strongest baseline models (DUET, MM-LSTM, Transformer) across all five assets for 20-day prediction tasks. The cross-asset validation reveals several important patterns: Consistent Performance Gains: DAFF-Net achieved performance improvements across all five assets, with MSE reductions ranging from 8.5% to 9.7% and \(\text {R}^{2}\) improvements from 10.2% to 15.4% compared to the strongest baseline MM-LSTM. This consistency suggests that our methodological innovations provide robust value across different market segments. Sector-Dependent Improvement Magnitudes: The relative improvements varied by sector characteristics. Energy stock XOM showed the largest \(\text {R}^{2}\) improvement (15.4%), potentially due to the sector’s strong sensitivity to macroeconomic events, which our event-driven approach effectively captures. Healthcare stock JNJ showed more modest improvements (10.2%), consistent with its lower event sensitivity and more stable fundamental-driven behavior. Volatility Adaptation: High-volatility stocks (TSLA, AMZN) and low-volatility stocks (JNJ) both benefited from DAFF-Net, though through different mechanisms. For volatile stocks, the event-driven pattern extraction provided significant value; for stable stocks, the multi-dimensional relationship modeling contributed more substantially. Event Sensitivity Correlation: Assets with higher event sensitivity (TSLA, XOM, AMZN) generally showed larger absolute performance improvements, validating the particular value of our event-aware routing mechanism for event-driven stocks. While these cross-asset results demonstrate promising generalizability, we acknowledge several limitations: (1) the validation remains within large-cap U.S. equities and may not extend to small-cap stocks, international markets, or other asset classes; (2) the 15-year study period, while comprehensive, represents specific market regimes and may not capture all possible market conditions; (3) the computational complexity of full multi-asset deployment remains a practical consideration for broader applications. The experimental results fully demonstrate the significant advantages of DAFF-Net in financial time series prediction tasks. These advantages mainly stem from our innovative breakthroughs at three key technical levels, as shown in Table 11, which presents a comparative analysis of DAFF-Net’s key technical innovations. First, the event-driven temporal pattern extractor achieves an important transition from pure data-driven to event-aware modeling38. Traditional time series prediction models, whether statistical methods like ARIMA33 or deep learning methods like LSTM7 and Transformer9, mainly rely on statistical features of historical price data for modeling. This approach often produces confusion when facing similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes16. For example, sharp stock price declines may stem from poor company performance39, industry policy adjustments, or overall market panic. Although the price performances are similar, their underlying mechanisms and subsequent evolution patterns are completely different. Our event-aware router can effectively distinguish these market patterns that appear similar on the surface but are essentially different by fusing time series data with event vectors40, thereby achieving more precise predictions. This innovation not only brings significant improvements in quantitative metrics but, more importantly, provides a new financial modeling paradigm that organically combines market “narrative logic” with “data logic.” Second, the multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module breaks through the limitations of traditional single-relationship modeling by constructing a more comprehensive and accurate asset correlation network through the fusion of relationships in three dimensions: frequency domain, fundamentals, and knowledge graphs41. Frequency domain relationships capture periodic similarities in price movements, reflecting technical correlations20; fundamental relationships are based on financial indicators and industry classifications, embodying fundamental similarities42; knowledge graph relationships quantify structured business-level connections. This multi-dimensional relationship modeling is not only more theoretically complete but also demonstrates obvious advantages in practice, particularly in capturing market systemic risks and sector rotation effects43. Compared to DUET’s36 single perspective considering only frequency domain relationships, our method can better understand complex market ecosystems, which has important practical significance for portfolio management and risk control. Third, the adoption of soft clustering mechanisms reflects our deep understanding of financial market complexity6. Unlike traditional hard clustering methods’ either-or approach, soft clustering allows assets to have different degrees of membership in multiple groups, which better aligns with actual financial market conditions44. In reality, a technology company may have industry correlations with other tech stocks, may also have connections with retail stocks due to its consumer business, and may form relationships with infrastructure stocks because of its cloud services. The soft clustering mechanism avoids information loss that hard partitioning might cause by preserving these subtle but important weak relationship information, enabling the model to capture market multi-level structures more precisely23. From deep analysis of experimental results, we found that DAFF-Net’s performance advantages are not uniformly distributed but present some interesting and meaningful patterns. The most significant finding is that the model’s relative advantages are more prominent in long-term prediction tasks, which reflects the core value of our technical innovations45. In 1-day prediction tasks, DAFF-Net’s improvement compared to the strongest baseline is approximately 10%, while in 20-day prediction tasks, this improvement magnitude expands to 13.3%. This advantage that amplifies with increasing prediction time horizons indicates that our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion mechanisms have unique capabilities in handling complex long-term dependencies11. Short-term prediction mainly relies on recent price momentum and technical indicators21, while long-term prediction requires understanding deeper market structures and fundamental logic, which is precisely the core advantage of our model design. Further analysis of different types of baseline model performance reveals a clear performance hierarchy. Traditional statistical method ARIMA33 performed worst across all metrics, which aligns with expectations since linear models struggle to capture nonlinear characteristics of financial data1. Unimodal deep learning methods (LSTM7, TCN34, Transformer9) showed moderate performance, with attention mechanism methods slightly outperforming recurrent and convolutional methods, demonstrating the advantages of global dependency modeling. Multimodal methods (MM-LSTM37, DAFF-Net) significantly outperformed unimodal methods, validating the value of multi-source information fusion24. Notably, even within multimodal methods, DAFF-Net significantly outperformed MM-LSTM, indicating that simple feature concatenation or early fusion is insufficient to fully exploit the potential of multimodal data and requires carefully designed fusion mechanisms like ours. From the perspective of different evaluation metrics, DAFF-Net achieved consistent improvements in both MSE and \(\text {R}^{2}\) metrics, indicating that the model’s advantages are comprehensive and stable. MSE as an absolute error metric reflects prediction accuracy; \(\text {R}^{2}\) as a relative metric reflects the model’s ability to explain data variability. Simultaneous improvement in both metrics indicates that DAFF-Net can not only reduce prediction errors but also better understand and explain the intrinsic patterns of financial data. This consistency has important significance for practical applications, as it demonstrates that the model’s improvements are substantial rather than incidental advantages in specific metrics. Table 12 further quantifies this performance improvement across different time horizons, revealing the sources and distribution characteristics of our technical advantages. Despite DAFF-Net’s excellent performance in experiments, we must objectively recognize the limitations of current research, which provide important guidance for future research directions46. First, while we conducted cross-asset validation on five stocks from different sectors, the scope remains limited to large-cap U.S. equities. Our primary analysis focuses on Amazon with supporting validation on four additional stocks (JNJ, JPM, XOM, TSLA). Although choosing Amazon has sufficient reasons (strong market representativeness, rich data, obvious event-driven characteristics), this single-target validation strategy still limits the universality of conclusions. Stocks in different industries have different price behavior characteristics, with significant differences in driving factors between cyclical industries (such as steel and chemicals) and growth industries (such as technology and biotechnology), and vastly different volatility patterns between traditional value stocks and emerging concept stocks13. Therefore, model performance in other asset classes (such as bonds, commodities, foreign exchange) and different market environments (such as emerging markets, small-cap stock markets) still needs further validation. Second, the complexity of technical implementation may affect the actual deployment efficiency of the model. The acquisition, processing, and encoding of event data is relatively complex, requiring real-time monitoring of multiple news sources, announcement platforms, and economic data release channels, which places high demands on data infrastructure and processing capabilities47. The construction and maintenance of knowledge graphs also require professional domain knowledge and continuous updating mechanisms. In comparison, traditional models based on price data are more straightforward to deploy. This technical complexity may limit the application of models in resource-constrained environments, particularly for small and medium-sized investment institutions. From a computational efficiency perspective, DAFF-Net’s multi-branch architecture and complex fusion mechanisms bring additional computational overhead. Although this overhead is acceptable in modern GPU environments, it may become a limiting factor in application scenarios that are extremely sensitive to latency, such as high-frequency trading4. Additionally, although the model’s interpretability has improved compared to pure black-box methods (through event routers and attention mechanisms), it still needs further enhancement in model decision transparency and interpretability for strictly regulated financial environments31. Looking toward future research directions, we believe there are several important development opportunities worth exploring. First is expanding validation scope by applying the model to more asset classes and market environments, constructing large-scale multi-asset prediction systems27. This can not only validate model universality but may also discover cross-asset synergies and systemic risk transmission mechanisms29. Second is technical optimization directions, including developing more efficient event information extraction and encoding methods, exploring lightweight model architectures, and researching incremental learning mechanisms to adapt to dynamic market environment changes. Third is enhancing model interpretability through visualization techniques and factor decomposition methods to make model decision processes more transparent, enhancing user trust and regulatory compliance46. Finally is exploration of practical applications by integrating the model into complete quantitative investment and risk management systems, validating performance and commercial value in real trading environments47. We believe that with in-depth research in these directions, event-driven and relationship-aware financial prediction methods will play increasingly important roles in future intelligent financial systems. While DAFF-Net demonstrates superior predictive performance, practical deployment requires careful consideration of infrastructure requirements, implementation complexity, and cost-benefit trade-offs. This section provides a realistic assessment of deployment challenges and offers scalable implementation strategies for different institutional contexts. Full Implementation Requirements: The complete DAFF-Net system demands substantial technical infrastructure: Real-time Data Pipeline: Continuous ingestion from multiple news feeds (Bloomberg, Reuters, PR Newswire), SEC EDGAR filings, and macroeconomic data sources, requiring robust data streaming architecture and 24/7 monitoring Natural Language Processing Infrastructure: High-performance GPU clusters for real-time BERT encoding of news articles and announcements, with typical latency requirements under 100ms for trading applications Knowledge Graph Maintenance: Quarterly updates requiring domain expertise to verify corporate relationships, supply chain changes, and regulatory reclassifications from multiple authoritative sources Computational Resources: Training infrastructure requiring NVIDIA A100-class GPUs and substantial memory for handling large-scale multimodal datasets Estimated Implementation Costs: Initial setup: \(\$200\text {K}-500\text {K}\) for infrastructure and data subscriptions Annual operational costs: \(\$150\text {K}-300\text {K}\) for data feeds, cloud computing, and maintenance Personnel requirements: 2–3 FTE including ML engineers, data engineers, and domain experts Recognizing that full implementation may be prohibitive for smaller institutions, we propose several graceful degradation strategies that preserve significant portions of DAFF-Net’s performance benefits: Tier 1: Simplified Event Integration Data Sources: Limit events to earnings announcements, major news headlines, and Fed policy statements Processing: Use pre-trained sentence transformers instead of full BERT encoding Update Frequency: Daily batch processing instead of real-time streaming Performance Impact: Retains approximately 80% of full model improvement Cost Reduction: 60–70% lower than full implementation Tier 2: Relationship-Only Implementation Focus: Implement only the multi-dimensional relationship module Data Sources: Use publicly available fundamental data and static knowledge graphs Event Component: Replace with simple sentiment scores from free news APIs Performance Impact: Retains approximately 60% of full model improvement Cost Reduction: 80% lower than full implementation Tier 3: Academic/Research Implementation Data Sources: Historical data only, using archived news and fundamental databases Processing: Offline batch processing suitable for research and backtesting Knowledge Graph: Simplified using Wikipedia/DBpedia relationships Performance Impact: Full research validation capability Cost: Under \(\$10\text {K}\) annually for academic research Phased Implementation Strategy: Phase 1 (Months 1–3): Implement Tier 3 version for backtesting and validation on institutional data Phase 2 (Months 4–6): Upgrade to Tier 2 with live fundamental data and basic event processing Phase 3 (Months 7–12): Full Tier 1 implementation with comprehensive event integration Phase 4 (Year 2+): Optimization and customization for specific use cases Risk Mitigation Strategies: Fallback Mechanisms: Maintain traditional LSTM/Transformer models as backup predictors Data Quality Monitoring: Implement automated data quality checks and anomaly detection Model Validation: Continuous out-of-sample testing and performance monitoring Regulatory Compliance: Ensure all data sources and model decisions meet financial regulatory requirements Large Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {10B}}+ {\textbf {AUM}}\)): Full implementation justified by potential alpha generation exceeding infrastructure costs. Conservative estimate of 0.5–1.5% annual alpha improvement can generate \(\$50-100\)M additional returns, easily justifying \(\$500\)K annual costs. Medium Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {1-10B AUM}}\)): Tier 1 implementation recommended. Estimated 0.3–0.7.3.7% alpha improvement generating \(\$3-70\)M additional returns versus \(\$200\)K annual costs provides strong ROI. Small Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {100M-1B AUM}}\)): Tier 2 implementation most appropriate. Even 0.2–0.4.2.4% alpha improvement generates \(\$200\)K-4M additional returns versus \(\$100\)K costs, maintaining positive ROI. Individual/Retail Investors: Tier 3 implementation suitable for educational purposes and personal portfolio management, with minimal costs and research-focused benefits. To facilitate broader adoption and academic research, we commit to: Open Source Release: Core model architecture and Tier 3 implementation within 6 months of publication Documentation: Comprehensive implementation guides and tutorials API Development: RESTful APIs for simplified integration with existing trading systems Community Support: GitHub repository with active maintenance and community contributions This practical implementation framework demonstrates that while DAFF-Net represents a sophisticated advancement in financial prediction, it can be deployed at various scales and resource levels, making its benefits accessible to a broad range of market participants. This study proposes the Dual-stream Alpha Factor Fusion Network (DAFF-Net), an innovative deep learning framework specifically designed for financial time series prediction tasks. Through the organic combination of an event-driven temporal pattern extractor and a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, DAFF-Net successfully addresses the limitations of traditional financial prediction models in handling complex market narratives and inter-asset correlations. Comprehensive experimental validation on Amazon stock data demonstrates that DAFF-Net significantly outperforms eight representative baseline models including ARIMA, LSTM, Transformer, and DUET across 1-day, 5-day, and 20-day prediction tasks, achieving 7.4%−15.2% improvement in MSE metrics and 7.0%−21.4% enhancement in \(\text {R}^{2}\) metrics compared to the strongest baselines, with particularly outstanding advantages in long-term prediction tasks. These results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of deep fusion of event information with multi-dimensional relationship information, providing new technical pathways and theoretical contributions to the field of financial time series prediction. Although current research still has limitations such as limited data coverage and complex technical implementation, DAFF-Net’s core concepts and technical framework open important directions for the development of quantitative investment, risk management, and intelligent financial systems, with broad application prospects and research value. Future work will focus on expanding model validation in multi-asset and cross-market environments, optimizing computational efficiency and deployment convenience, and further enhancing model interpretability to promote the widespread application of event-driven and relationship-aware financial prediction methods in actual financial business.

Financial time series prediction has consistently been one of the core research problems in the fields of econometrics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence1. Since the introduction of Brownian motion theory and the efficient market hypothesis in the mid-20th century2,3, scholars have been exploring how to accurately predict the price movements of financial assets. With the increasing complexity of global financial markets, accurate financial forecasting can not only provide scientific basis for investment decisions but also help financial institutions conduct effective risk management and asset allocation, and its importance is increasingly prominent. The complexity of today’s financial markets far exceeds the assumptions of traditional theoretical models. The exponential growth in information dissemination speed has changed the fundamental operating mechanisms of markets, and diversified information sources such as social media, news websites, and financial blogs enable market information to spread at unprecedented speeds, significantly shortening investors’ decision-making windows, making market reactions more rapid and prone to overreaction. The proliferation of algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading has fundamentally changed market microstructure4,5. According to statistics, algorithmic trading accounts for over 70% of trading volume in the U.S. stock market, and the interaction of these automated trading systems creates complex feedback mechanisms that traditional market models based on human behavior struggle to accurately describe. The deepening of globalization has further increased the complexity of financial markets6, with the correlation between different markets significantly increased, and volatility in a single market often rapidly transmitting to other global markets through various channels such as trade connections, capital flows, and investor sentiment. In recent years, deep learning technologies have achieved significant progress in the field of time series prediction, with models such as Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM)7, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)8, and Transformers9 demonstrating strong performance across multiple time series forecasting tasks10,11. However, existing methods primarily focus on the statistical properties of time series data itself, often overlooking two key factors that influence financial markets: first, external event information that drives market behavior (such as corporate announcements, macroeconomic events, and market sentiment)12,13, and second, the complex correlations between assets based on multi-dimensional relationships (such as industry relationships, supply chain relationships, competitive relationships, etc.)14,15. This single-perspective modeling approach limits the predictive accuracy and generalization capability of models in complex financial environments. Although existing research has attempted to address the aforementioned problems, there remain obvious research gaps and technical deficiencies. First, traditional time series models cannot distinguish similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes16. For example, the same price decline may stem from poor corporate earnings reports, overall market corrections, or sudden negative events, but existing models often treat them as identical patterns, leading to limited prediction accuracy17. Consider scenarios of sharp stock price declines where surface price behaviors might be completely identical (such as an 8% single-day drop), but the underlying driving factors are entirely different: earnings-driven declines usually accompanied by high trading volume and strong continuation after earnings announcements18,19; systematic risk declines affect entire sectors or even the entire market; technical adjustment declines usually have small trading volume and easily gain support at key technical levels20,21,22. Existing models often treat these essentially different decline patterns as the same “decline signal,” significantly reducing the accuracy of subsequent predictions. Second, existing multimodal fusion methods mostly adopt simple feature concatenation or early fusion strategies, lacking deep modeling of complex interactive relationships between event information and time series data23,24. These methods often directly concatenate different types of feature vectors, ignoring the intrinsic logical relationships between different modal information, and event information and price data differ in temporal granularity and impact duration, making simple alignment methods prone to information loss. Finally, in terms of asset relationship modeling, most methods only consider single-dimensional relationships (such as price correlations or industry classifications), failing to comprehensively capture the multi-dimensional, multi-level complex correlations among financial assets25. The correlations between financial assets are multi-dimensional, multi-level complex networks, but existing methods show obvious simplification tendencies in relationship modeling: most studies only consider price correlation as one dimension, ignoring other important dimensions such as fundamental similarity, business relevance, and supply chain relationships; many models assume that relationships between assets remain static, unable to adapt to relationship evolution caused by changing market environments26; in the few studies that consider multi-dimensional relationships, they often simply assign equal weights to various dimensions, lacking adaptive weight adjustment mechanisms. Beyond theoretical challenges, the development of actual financial business also places higher requirements on prediction models. Modern quantitative investment strategies require models not only to predict direction but also to predict magnitude and duration27, and investors want to understand the logic behind prediction results, especially when facing abnormal market conditions28. The 2008 financial crisis and 2020 pandemic shock demonstrated that traditional risk models based on historical data often fail when facing extreme events29, and financial institutions urgently need prediction tools that can integrate multi-source information and identify systemic risks in advance30. With the strengthening of fintech regulation, applications such as algorithmic trading and robo-advisors must possess certain interpretability31, and model decision-making processes need to be reasonably explained to regulatory agencies and customers. Based on these challenges, this study aims to address the following three key questions: How to effectively fuse event information with time series data, enabling models to understand the intrinsic meaning of price patterns under different event contexts; How to construct multi-dimensional asset relationship networks to more comprehensively capture complex correlations in financial markets; How to design effective fusion mechanisms to achieve deep integration of event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors.” To address the above problems, this paper proposes the Dual-stream Alpha Factor Fusion Network (DAFF-Net), which achieves deep understanding and accurate prediction of financial time series data through the organic combination of an event-driven temporal pattern extractor and a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module. The core innovations of DAFF-Net include: Event-aware routing mechanism: Designed an event-aware router that fuses time series data with contextual event information encoded from news, corporate announcements, and macroeconomic data, enabling the model to understand the underlying narratives behind market fluctuations and effectively distinguish market behavior patterns that appear similar on the surface but are essentially different. Multi-dimensional relationship adaptive fusion: Proposed a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module that constructs a comprehensive asset relationship network more effective than single-relationship methods through adaptive fusion of frequency domain, fundamental, and knowledge graph relationships, capable of dynamically adjusting the importance of different relationship dimensions according to market conditions. Soft clustering attention mechanism: Adopted soft clustering strategies to replace traditional hard clustering methods, preserving fine-grained weak relationship information and avoiding information loss that hard clustering might cause, which is particularly important in complex financial market environments. Dual-stream fusion architecture: Designed an innovative dual-stream fusion framework that achieves deep integration of event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors,” maximizing the synergistic effects of different modal information through carefully designed masked attention mechanisms. The structure of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a detailed introduction to the overall architectural design of DAFF-Net, including the event-driven temporal pattern extractor, multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, and contextual factor fusion with multi-horizon prediction mechanism; Section 3 presents comprehensive experimental validation on Amazon stock data, including dataset construction, baseline model comparisons, and result analysis; Section 4 provides in-depth discussion of the effectiveness of technical innovations, deep interpretation of model performance, and research limitations with future prospects; Section 5 summarizes the main contributions and practical application value of this research. DAFF-Net adopts a dual-stream fusion design philosophy, with its overall architecture shown in Fig. 1. The core idea of this architecture is to decompose the financial time series prediction task into two complementary learning processes: event-driven temporal pattern understanding and multi-dimensional relationship-aware cross-asset information fusion. As shown in the central part of Fig. 1, DAFF-Net receives three types of heterogeneous data inputs. Let the time series data be \(X \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times T \times D}\), where N represents the number of assets, T represents the time window length, and D represents the feature dimension. Event data is represented as \(E \in {\mathbb {R}}^{T \times D_e}\), where \(D_e\) is the event vector dimension. Relationship data includes fundamental information \(F \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_f}\) and knowledge graph structure \(G \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\). After instance normalization processing, the data streams are respectively fed into two parallel feature extraction branches: Left branch (as shown in the left panel of Fig. 1) is the event-driven temporal pattern extractor, which fuses temporal segments with event vectors through an event-aware router: where \({\textbf{h}}_{t} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{(D+D_e)}\) represents the fused representation at time t. Right branch (as shown in the right panel of Fig. 1) is the multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, which generates three types of relationship matrices in parallel. The frequency-domain relationship matrix is computed through fast Fourier transform: The fundamental relationship matrix computes similarity based on structured data: The knowledge graph relationship matrix is directly obtained from the graph structure: These three relationship matrices are integrated through an adaptive fusion module. As shown in the bottom right corner of Fig. 1, fusion weights are learned through a small neural network: The final fused relationship matrix is: where \(\odot\) denotes element-wise multiplication. As shown in the contextual factor fusion module in the center of Fig. 1, the outputs of the two branches are integrated through a masked attention mechanism. The event-aware temporal features \(Z_{\text {temporal}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_h}\) output from the left branch and the channel attention matrix \(A_{\text {channel}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\) output from the right branch are fused as: This fused representation is then passed to the multi-horizon prediction heads, as shown at the top of Fig. 1. The prediction heads consist of multiple feedforward networks that generate predictions for different time spans: where \(h \in \{1, 5, 20\}\) represents the prediction days, and \({\hat{Y}}_{h} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times 1}\) is the corresponding return prediction. Figure 1 clearly shows the information flow of the entire architecture: multimodal inputs at the bottom undergo feature extraction and relationship modeling through two specially designed branches, then achieve deep integration of “narrative factors” and “relationship factors” in the fusion module, and finally output prediction results for different time spans through multi-horizon prediction heads. This design enables DAFF-Net to simultaneously capture event-driven dynamics and complex inter-asset correlations in financial markets, achieving more accurate multi-horizon predictions. Overall architecture diagram of DAFF-Net. Traditional time series models in financial markets often face the “pattern confusion” problem, i.e., inability to distinguish similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes. For example, the same price decline may stem from poor corporate earnings reports, overall market corrections, or sudden negative events, but traditional models often treat them as identical patterns. To address this key problem, we designed an event-driven temporal pattern extractor, whose architecture is shown in the left panel of Fig. 1. The core of this module is the Event-Aware Router, which addresses the critical challenges of multi-source event integration and temporal alignment. Unlike simple concatenation approaches, our router employs a sophisticated event processing pipeline that handles heterogeneous event types with different temporal granularities and impact characteristics. Multi-Source Event Processing We employ BERT-base-uncased32 pre-trained transformer model for encoding textual event information into 768-dimensional dense representations. The BERT model processes concatenated news headlines and lead paragraphs, with maximum sequence length of 512 tokens. We first categorize events into three distinct types based on their market impact patterns and temporal characteristics: where: \(w_{news}, w_{corp}, w_{macro}\) are learnable event type weights \(\text {decay}(t - t_{news})\) models the temporal decay of news impact: \(\exp (-\lambda (t - t_{news}))\) \(\text {impact}(\text {type}_{corp})\) assigns different weights based on announcement types (earnings: 1.0, guidance: 0.8, strategic: 0.6, operational: 0.4) \(\text {persistence}(\text {policy}_{macro})\) captures the lasting effect of macroeconomic policies Temporal Alignment and Weighting To handle the temporal misalignment between high-frequency trading data and irregular event occurrences, we employ an attention-based temporal alignment mechanism: where \(Q_t\) represents the query vector from time series data at time t, \(K_e\) represents the key vector from event e, and \(\text {temporal}\_\text {mask}(t, t_e)\) applies exponential decay based on the time distance between the trading timestamp and event timestamp. Adaptive Event Fusion The final event representation integrates all event types through learned attention weights: where \(\alpha _i\) are dynamically computed attention weights based on current market volatility and \(\text {EventMemory}_{t-1}\) maintains a momentum term from previous significant events. Final Router Input The temporal segment and processed event vector are then fused: Traditional approaches often rely on generic knowledge bases without proper domain adaptation. Our method addresses this limitation through a systematic financial-domain knowledge graph construction process: Financial Entity Mapping We establish explicit mappings from generic knowledge entities to financial assets through: Relationship Strength Quantification Rather than using arbitrary fixed weights, we derive relationship strengths through empirical analysis of market co-movements and fundamental connections: where \(\rho _{*}\) are empirically derived scaling factors based on historical correlation analysis: Dynamic Relationship Updates The knowledge graph relationships are updated quarterly based on: Corporate action announcements (M&A, partnerships, spin-offs) Supply chain relationship changes (supplier/customer updates) Regulatory classification changes (GICS sector reclassifications) Cross-holdings and institutional ownership changes This enhanced event-aware routing mechanism ensures that: Different event types are processed according to their inherent characteristics Temporal misalignments are properly handled through attention mechanisms Event impacts are modeled with realistic decay patterns Knowledge graph relationships reflect actual financial market structures Relationship weights are empirically grounded rather than arbitrary The router matches current market conditions to a set of learnable temporal pattern prototypes \(\{P_1, P_2,\ldots , P_M\}\), where each prototype \(P_i \in {\mathbb {R}}^{D_p}\) represents a specific event-driven market behavior pattern. These prototypes are automatically learned through the training process, with typical patterns including (Table 1): Routing probabilities are computed through attention mechanism: where \(W_r \in {\mathbb {R}}^{(D+D_e) \times D_p}\) is a learnable projection matrix. Based on routing probabilities, the system selects Top-K most relevant Linear-based Pattern Extractors (LPEs). Each extractor \(\text {LPE}_i\) is an expert network specifically designed for particular patterns: The final output is obtained through weighted aggregation: Event-Driven Temporal Pattern Extraction The correlations between financial assets are multi-dimensional and dynamically changing, making it difficult for single relationship modeling methods to comprehensively capture this complexity. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 1, our proposed multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module addresses this problem by generating and fusing three types of relationship views in parallel. To ensure experimental validity and prevent any form of future information leakage, all relationship matrices and model components strictly adhere to temporal constraints. For any prediction at time t, we guarantee that: Frequency-domain relationships are computed using only historical price data from the sliding window \([t-L_{\text {freq}}, t-1]\), where \(L_{\text {freq}} = 60\) trading days: Fundamental relationships utilize only the most recent quarterly financial data available before time t, ensuring no forward-looking bias: Knowledge graph relationships reflect the corporate structure and business relationships as documented up to time \(t-1\), with quarterly updates based on publicly disclosed information: Adaptive fusion weights \(\varvec{\alpha }\) are learned exclusively on the training dataset (2010–2020) and remain frozen during validation (2021–2022) and testing (2023–2025) phases: This temporal discipline ensures that our experimental results reflect genuine predictive capability rather than information leakage artifacts. We verified compliance by re-computing all performance metrics with strict temporal validation protocols. Frequency-domain relationship matrix: Captures periodic similarities in price movements through real Fast Fourier Transform (rFFT): where \({\tilde{X}}_i^H\) denotes the complex conjugate transpose. Fundamental relationship matrix: Computes cosine similarity based on normalized fundamental data: where fundamental features include (Table 2): Knowledge graph relationship matrix: Quantifies structured relationships between entities by processing financial knowledge graphs. We conducted extensive parameter experiments to determine optimal relationship weights, as shown in Table 3. Based on comprehensive parameter experiments across multiple validation periods, the optimal knowledge graph relationship matrix is defined as: The parameter selection was validated through cross-validation on the training set (2010-2020) and confirmed on the validation set (2021-2022), ensuring robust performance across different market conditions (Table 4). The three relationship matrices are dynamically integrated through an adaptive fusion module. Fusion weights are learned through a multilayer perceptron that takes the current market state as input: The fused relationship matrix is: To achieve more robust “soft” clustering, we apply the Softmax function to each row of the fused matrix to generate a channel attention matrix: The advantage of this soft clustering method over hard clustering is that it preserves subtle weak relationship information, which is particularly important in financial markets. Multi-Dimensional Relation-Aware Soft Clustering The contextual factor fusion module is a key component of the DAFF-Net architecture, responsible for deep integration of heterogeneous information from the two branches. As shown in the fusion module at the center of Fig. 1, this module employs a masked attention mechanism: where \(Z_{\text {temporal}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_h}\) is the temporal features from the event-driven branch, and \(A_{\text {channel}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\) is the channel attention matrix from the relationship-aware branch. To enhance feature representation capability, we further introduce residual connections and layer normalization: The final fused representation is obtained through another feedforward network: The multi-horizon prediction heads adopt a design with shared bottom-layer features and independent prediction branches. For each prediction horizon \(h \in \{1, 5, 20\}\), we design independent prediction networks: where the parameters of each prediction head are independently optimized to adapt to the prediction characteristics of different time spans (Table 5). To simultaneously optimize prediction performance across multiple horizons, we adopt a weighted multi-task loss function: where the loss for each horizon is mean squared error: The weights \(\lambda _h\) are set according to prediction difficulty and practical application importance: \(\lambda _1 = 0.5\), \(\lambda _5 = 0.3\), \(\lambda _{20} = 0.2\). Contextual Factor Fusion and Multi-Horizon Prediction This design enables DAFF-Net to effectively integrate event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors,” while providing targeted optimization for prediction tasks across different time spans, thereby achieving excellent performance in multi-horizon financial prediction tasks. This study selects Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock as the primary research subject, based on several important considerations: First, as a global leading technology giant, Amazon’s stock price is subject to complex influences from multiple factors, including changes in company fundamentals, industry technological developments, macroeconomic policies, and market sentiment fluctuations, providing an ideal testing environment for validating our multimodal fusion method; Second, Amazon enjoys extremely high attention in capital markets, with abundant news reports, analyst research reports, and investor discussions, providing sufficient raw materials for constructing high-quality event datasets; Finally, as an important constituent stock of the NASDAQ market, Amazon has complex correlations with other technology stocks, consumer stocks, etc., helping to validate the effectiveness of our multi-dimensional relationship-aware module. We constructed a comprehensive multimodal dataset spanning from January 1, 2010, to May 31, 2025, totaling over 15 years of complete market data. This time span covers multiple important market cycles, including the technology stock recovery period of 2010-2015, the technology stock boom period of 2016-2020, the pandemic shock and recovery period of 2020-2022, and the interest rate hike cycle and artificial intelligence boom period of 2023-2025, ensuring the representativeness of the dataset and the generalization capability of the model. Data sources cover multiple authoritative financial data providers: quantitative trading data is mainly obtained from Yahoo Finance API and Refinitiv Eikon terminals, including daily open, high, low, close prices, volume, and adjusted prices; news and announcement data is collected in real-time through Bloomberg Terminal News Feed, supplemented by relevant reports from mainstream financial media such as Reuters and Wall Street Journal; fundamental data is extracted from Refinitiv and S&P Capital IQ databases, covering financial statements, valuation indicators, and industry classification information. While Amazon (AMZN) serves as our primary prediction target, the multi-dimensional relationship-aware module requires a comprehensive asset universe to construct meaningful N\(\times\)N relationship matrices. We carefully selected a universe of 50 large-cap technology and related stocks to ensure robust relationship modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. Asset Selection Criteria: Market capitalization > $50 billion as of December 2020 Primary listing on NASDAQ or NYSE Technology, consumer discretionary, or communication services sectors (GICS classification) Complete daily trading data availability from 2010–2025 Minimum average daily trading volume > 1 million shares Final Asset Universe (N=50): Core Technology: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, META, NFLX, NVDA, ORCL, CRM, ADBE, INTC, AMD, CSCO, AVGO, QCOM, TXN E-commerce & Consumer: AMZN, EBAY, SHOP, ETSY, WMT, TGT, COST, HD, NKE Cloud & Software: SNOW, PLTR, ZM, WORK, DDOG, NET, OKTA, MDB, CRWD Communication: VZ, T, TMUS, CHTR, CMCSA, DIS, NFLX Related Technology: TSLA, UBER, LYFT, SQ, PYPL, V, MA Temporal Data Handling: All 50 assets follow identical temporal splits: Training period: 2010–2020 (all assets) Validation period: 2021–2022 (all assets) Testing period: 2023–2025 (all assets) Missing data: Forward-fill for gaps \(\le\) 3 days, exclude assets with >5% missing data in any period Delisting handling: Assets delisted during study period are excluded from the relationship matrices after delisting date Relationship Matrix Computation: For frequency-domain and fundamental relationships, we compute pairwise similarities across all 50 assets, resulting in symmetric 50\(\times\)50 matrices. For knowledge graph relationships, we manually verified and annotated business relationships among these 50 entities using SEC 10-K filings, partnership announcements, and industry databases. The Amazon prediction task extracts the relevant row/column from these matrices corresponding to AMZN’s relationships with the other 49 assets. This design ensures that AMZN’s relationship modeling benefits from a rich, diverse set of comparable assets while maintaining strict temporal discipline across the entire universe. Knowledge Graph Construction and Domain Mapping Knowledge graph data construction involves a systematic process of mapping general knowledge bases to financial domain entities. We established comprehensive mappings through the following multi-step procedure: Step 1: Entity Identification and Mapping We constructed a mapping table linking general knowledge entities to financial assets through multiple identification mechanisms: Primary Mapping: Direct ticker symbol matching (e.g., DBpedia:Amazon.com \(\rightarrow\) NASDAQ:AMZN) Secondary Mapping: Company name disambiguation using ISIN codes and official registrations Tertiary Mapping: Cross-reference validation through multiple knowledge bases (DBpedia, Wikidata, OpenCorporates) Step 2: Relationship Extraction and Validation From the mapped entities, we extract structured relationships using SPARQL queries and natural language processing: Direct Business Relations: Partnership agreements, joint ventures, strategic alliances extracted from SEC filings and corporate announcements Ownership Structures: Parent-subsidiary relationships from corporate registrations and 10-K filings Supply Chain Networks: Customer-supplier relationships from business dependency disclosures Industry Classifications: GICS sector mappings validated against multiple classification systems (SIC, NAICS, ICB) Step 3: Relationship Strength Quantification We quantify relationship strengths through empirical analysis of historical market co-movements and fundamental connections, as detailed in Table 6. Step 4: Dynamic Relationship Updates The knowledge graph undergoes quarterly updates to reflect corporate actions and market structure changes: Corporate Actions: M&A announcements, spin-offs, and restructuring events Partnership Changes: New strategic alliances and partnership dissolutions Supply Chain Evolution: Customer/supplier relationship updates from annual reports Regulatory Reclassifications: GICS sector changes and industry standard updates This systematic approach ensures that our knowledge graph accurately reflects the evolving landscape of financial market relationships while maintaining high data quality and validation standards. The mapping process achieved 96.1% validation rate across all entity types, providing a robust foundation for relationship-aware modeling. To comprehensively understand the market behavior characteristics of Amazon stock and provide a basis for model design, we first conducted a detailed analysis of the price time series. Amazon stock price time series (2010-2025). As shown in Fig. 2, Amazon stock exhibited typical growth stock characteristics during the study period, with an overall price trend showing strong upward momentum. Several important phase characteristics can be clearly observed from Fig. 2: During 2010-2012, stock prices fluctuated at relatively low levels, with the price range mainly between \(\$5-25\), reflecting the company’s early market positioning and investor expectations; During 2013-2017, stock prices began to rise significantly, climbing from about \(\$25\) to nearly \(\$100\), corresponding to the rapid development of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and global expansion of e-commerce business; During 2018-2021, stock prices experienced more dramatic volatility, reaching a high of about \(\$180\) during the 2020 pandemic, followed by a significant pullback in 2022 with lows around \(\$80\), reflecting market reassessment of technology stock valuations; Since 2023, stock prices have rebounded strongly again, creating new highs in 2024 exceeding \(\$240\), mainly benefiting from artificial intelligence technology breakthroughs and optimistic market expectations for AI application prospects. To further understand market participation and liquidity characteristics, we analyzed the trading volume change patterns during the corresponding period, which is important for assessing the credibility of price fluctuations and market depth. Amazon stock trading volume time series (2010-2025). Figure 3 shows the trading volume change patterns during the corresponding period, providing important supplementary information for understanding market participation and price volatility. Several significant characteristics can be observed from the trading volume data in Fig. 3: First, trading volume typically shows significant amplification during major events, particularly during the initial outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020 and the market adjustment period in the second half of 2022, with daily trading volumes often exceeding 600–800 million shares, far above the normal level of 200–400 million shares; Second, the seasonal patterns of trading volume are relatively stable, usually increasing during earnings report seasons (January, April, July, October each year) and year-end/year-beginning periods; Finally, overall trading volume levels have increased in recent years with the proliferation of algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading, reflecting the evolution of market microstructure. Considering the important role of technical analysis in financial prediction, we need to examine price performance relative to key technical indicators to identify important trend signals and support/resistance levels, which will provide valuable learning targets for our temporal pattern extractor. Amazon stock price vs. moving averages comparison. Figure 4 further demonstrates the relationship between price and technical indicators. By comparing closing prices with 50-day and 200-day moving averages, we can identify important trend reversal points and technical signals. Fig. 4 clearly shows several important technical breakthroughs: the upward breakthrough of 50-day and 200-day moving averages in early 2013, marking the establishment of a long-term uptrend; two technical adjustments in late 2018 and early 2022, where stock prices fell below short-term moving averages but ultimately received support from long-term trend lines; the strong breakthrough in the second half of 2023, where stock prices regained footing above all major moving averages. These technical characteristics provide rich learning samples for our temporal pattern extractor. Finally, to understand the statistical distribution characteristics of returns and validate the necessity of extreme event handling in our model design, we analyzed the probability distribution characteristics of daily returns. Amazon stock daily returns distribution histogram. The daily returns distribution histogram in Fig. 5 reveals the statistical characteristics of Amazon stock returns, showing typical “fat-tailed” distribution characteristics of financial time series. From Fig. 5, it can be seen that the distribution center is close to zero, consistent with efficient market hypothesis expectations, but compared to standard normal distribution, this distribution shows obvious excess kurtosis and thicker tails. Specifically, about 68% of daily returns are concentrated in the −2% to +2% range, about 95% of observations are between −6% to +6%, but there are still considerable extreme values exceeding the expected range of normal distribution. This distribution characteristic indicates that financial markets have relatively frequent extreme events, validating the necessity of considering event-driven factors in our model design. To ensure experimental rigor and result reliability, we adopted a strict time series data partitioning strategy to avoid any form of future information leakage. The specific partitioning scheme is: the training set covers January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2020, totaling 11 years of historical data, providing sufficient learning samples for the model; the validation set is set from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2022, totaling 2 years of data, used for hyperparameter tuning and model selection; the test set includes January 1, 2023, to May 31, 2025, approximately 2.5 years of the latest data, used to evaluate model generalization performance in actual application scenarios. This partitioning design has important practical significance: the training set time span is sufficiently long, covering multiple complete market cycles, ensuring the model can learn patterns under various market conditions; the validation set corresponds to the post-pandemic market environment, including new market characteristics such as monetary policy shifts and rising inflation pressures, helping the model adapt to environmental changes; the test set is entirely in the period after model training, including unprecedented market events such as the latest interest rate hike cycle and AI technology breakthroughs, providing a severe test for evaluating the model’s true predictive capability. In the data preprocessing stage, we applied corresponding standardization methods for different types of data: price data was transformed through log returns to eliminate the effect of price levels; fundamental data used rolling Z-score standardization, maintaining temporal characteristics while eliminating dimensional differences; event data was encoded into fixed-dimension vector representations through pre-trained BERT models; relationship data was normalized to ensure comparability across different relationship types. These preprocessing steps laid a solid foundation for subsequent model training and evaluation. To comprehensively evaluate the performance advantages of DAFF-Net, we carefully selected eight representative baseline models that cover the complete spectrum from traditional statistical methods to the latest deep learning techniques, providing thorough validation of our method’s effectiveness and advancement. Traditional statistical models: We selected ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)33 as the representative of classical time series prediction methods. ARIMA has good theoretical foundations and interpretability, is widely applied in financial time series prediction, and provides an important benchmark for evaluating the improvement magnitude of deep learning methods. Classical deep learning models: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)7 as a representative of recurrent neural networks, can effectively handle long sequence dependencies and is a classical method in the time series prediction domain. TCN (Temporal Convolutional Network)34 adopts causal convolution design, has advantages in parallel training and good long-term dependency modeling capability, representing the application of convolutional neural networks in time series prediction. Attention mechanism models: Transformer9 as the pioneering work of attention mechanisms, achieves direct modeling of relationships between arbitrary positions in sequences through global self-attention mechanisms. Informer35 introduces sparse attention mechanisms based on Transformer, specifically optimized for long sequence prediction tasks, improving computational efficiency. Multimodal and relationship modeling methods: DUET36 as the direct foundation of our work, adopts dual clustering mechanisms to model in temporal and channel dimensions respectively, representing advanced methods in current time series prediction. MM-LSTM (Multimodal LSTM)37 fuses multiple data sources into the LSTM framework, providing baseline reference for multimodal time series prediction. Simple decision-focused baselines: To establish fundamental performance benchmarks, we include two essential naive baselines that represent the most basic prediction strategies. The No-Change baseline assumes that stock returns will be zero for all prediction horizons, representing the null hypothesis that prices follow a random walk without predictable drift. The Market Index baseline predicts individual stock returns based on the historical beta relationship with the NASDAQ-100 index: where \(\beta _{AMZN}\) is estimated using a 252-day rolling window of historical returns prior to the prediction date. This baseline represents a simple factor model approach commonly used in practical finance. These fundamental baselines are essential for validating that sophisticated models provide meaningful improvements over the most basic prediction strategies. All baseline models adopt the same data partitioning strategy and evaluation metrics, ensuring experimental fairness. Hyperparameters were optimized through grid search on the validation set, with each model achieving its optimal configuration. To comprehensively evaluate model prediction performance across different time spans, we adopted two complementary evaluation metrics. Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the primary metric can effectively measure the deviation between predicted and true values, is sensitive to outliers, and meets the needs of financial risk management. Coefficient of determination (\(\text {R}^{2}\)) as an auxiliary metric reflects the model’s ability to explain data variability and facilitates understanding of relative model performance. We set three prediction time spans: 1-day, 5-day, and 20-day, corresponding to the practical needs of short-term trading, medium-term investment, and long-term allocation respectively. This multi-horizon setup can comprehensively evaluate model generalization capability under different prediction difficulties. To ensure result reliability, all experiments were conducted in the same hardware environment using the same random seeds and training strategies. Each model was fully trained until convergence and evaluated on the test set for final assessment. Several important trends can be observed from the quantitative results in Table 7: Overall performance ranking: DAFF-Net achieved the best performance across all evaluation metrics, validating the effectiveness of our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion approach. Multimodal methods (MM-LSTM and DAFF-Net) significantly outperformed unimodal methods, demonstrating the importance of multi-source information fusion. Among unimodal methods, DUET as the most advanced baseline performed best, proving the value of the dual clustering concept. Prediction difficulty analysis: The performance of all models declined as the prediction time span increased, which aligns with general rules of financial prediction. Interestingly, DAFF-Net’s relative advantage is more pronounced in long-term prediction (20-day), with \(\text {R}^{2}\) reaching 0.51, while the strongest baseline MM-LSTM only achieved 0.45, representing a relative improvement of 13.3%. This indicates that our method has significant advantages in handling complex long-term dependencies. Method type comparison: Traditional statistical method ARIMA performed worst across all metrics, reflecting the limitations of linear methods in handling complex financial data. Deep learning methods generally outperformed statistical methods, with attention mechanism methods (Transformer, Informer) outperforming traditional recurrent and convolutional methods, demonstrating the advantages of attention mechanisms in capturing long-term dependencies. Relative improvement magnitude: Compared to the strongest unimodal baseline DUET, DAFF-Net reduced MSE by 15.2% (from 0.0171 to 0.0145) and improved \(\text {R}^{2}\) by 15.5% (from 0.58 to 0.67) in 1-day prediction. Compared to the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net reduced MSE by 10.5% and improved \(\text {R}^{2}\) by 9.8% in 1-day prediction, proving our technical innovation in multimodal fusion. Fundamental baseline validation: The inclusion of naive baselines provides essential context for evaluating model sophistication. The No-Change baseline achieved \(\text {R}^{2}\) scores of 0.17, 0.12, and 0.08 across the three prediction horizons, representing the null hypothesis performance. The Market Index baseline, utilizing beta-adjusted market returns, improved to \(\text {R}^{2}\) scores of 0.21, 0.18, and 0.13, demonstrating the value of incorporating systematic market factors. Notably, even the traditional ARIMA model substantially outperformed these fundamental baselines, validating the necessity of time series modeling techniques. DAFF-Net’s performance represents a 3.2\(\times\) improvement over the No-Change baseline and a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the Market Index baseline in 20-day prediction \(\text {R}^{2}\), confirming that our sophisticated multimodal approach provides meaningful predictive value beyond the most basic strategies. These quantitative results fully demonstrate the superiority of DAFF-Net in financial time series prediction tasks, particularly showcasing unique advantages in handling event-driven market dynamics and complex asset correlation relationships. To more intuitively demonstrate the performance advantages of DAFF-Net relative to various baseline models and deeply analyze the performance differences of different models on multi-time horizon prediction tasks, we conducted comprehensive analysis of experimental results through various visualization methods. First, to clearly compare the prediction errors of all models across different prediction time horizons, we used bar charts to display the comparison results of MSE metrics. MSE comparison bar chart for different models. Several important characteristics can be clearly observed from Fig. 6: First, DAFF-Net achieved the lowest MSE values across all three time horizons, where the yellow bars (1-day MSE), orange bars (5-day MSE), and red bars (20-day MSE) are all significantly lower than all other baseline models, validating the superiority of our method. The inclusion of fundamental baselines (No-Change and Market Index) provides essential context for evaluating model sophistication. These naive baselines achieved MSE values of 0.0312–0.0351 and 0.0298–0.0342 respectively, representing the most basic prediction strategies. Even the traditional ARIMA model substantially outperformed these fundamental approaches, validating the necessity of sophisticated modeling techniques. Second, the MSE values of all models increased significantly with increasing prediction time horizons, which aligns with general rules of time series prediction—long-term prediction is more challenging than short-term prediction. Particularly noteworthy is that the traditional ARIMA model achieved an MSE of 0.0348 for long-term prediction (20-day), almost 1.5 times that of DAFF-Net (0.0228), highlighting the advantages of deep learning methods in handling complex nonlinear relationships. The gaps between deep learning models are more pronounced in long-term prediction, indicating that the importance of architectural design becomes increasingly prominent as prediction difficulty increases. Next, to analyze the trend of each model’s explanatory capability with changing prediction time horizons, we displayed the variation patterns of R2 metrics across different prediction horizons through line charts. R2 score variation trends for different models. Figure 7 reveals the intrinsic patterns of model performance variation with prediction time horizons. From the figure, it can be observed that all models’ R2 scores show a declining trend with increasing prediction time horizons, but the decline magnitudes differ significantly. The fundamental baselines (No-Change and Market Index, represented by the bottom two lines) demonstrate the poorest performance, with R2 scores declining from 0.17 and 0.21 respectively in 1-day prediction to merely 0.08 and 0.13 in 20-day prediction. DAFF-Net (red line) maintained the highest R2 scores across all time horizons, particularly achieving an excellent performance of 0.67 in 1-day prediction, significantly surpassing all other methods. The performance gaps between different model categories become increasingly evident as prediction horizons extend: fundamental baselines plateau at very low R2 values, traditional statistical methods (ARIMA) show steep decline from 0.41 to 0.22, while sophisticated deep learning methods maintain more gradual degradation. DAFF-Net’s decline is remarkably stable, from 0.67 to 0.51, demonstrating superior stability and generalization capability. Notably, the spread between the best and worst performing models expands from 0.50 in 1-day prediction (0.67–0.17) to 0.43 in 20-day prediction (0.51–0.08), indicating that advanced modeling becomes even more critical for longer-horizon forecasting. Finally, to comprehensively evaluate the performance differences between DAFF-Net and major competitors from multiple dimensions, we selected the three best-performing models for radar chart comparison analysis. Comprehensive performance radar chart of DAFF-Net vs. baseline models. Figure 8 displays the performance of the three best models—DAFF-Net, DUET, and MM-LSTM—across six key dimensions through radar chart format. The six axes of the radar chart correspond to MSE-1d, MSE-5d, MSE-20d, R2−1d, R2−5d, and R2−20d respectively, where MSE metrics are transformed by reciprocal to maintain consistent directionality with R2 metrics (larger values indicate better performance). From the chart, it is evident that DAFF-Net (red line) forms the largest coverage area, outperforming or at least equaling the other two baseline models across all six dimensions. Particularly noteworthy is that DAFF-Net’s advantages are most significant in dimensions related to long-term prediction (MSE-20d and R2−20d), which again confirms the effectiveness of our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion mechanisms in handling complex long-term dependencies. DUET (yellow line), as the direct foundation of our work, is surpassed by DAFF-Net in all dimensions, validating the value of our technical improvements. MM-LSTM (orange line), although also adopting multimodal fusion strategies, still lags behind DAFF-Net in performance, indicating that our innovations in fusion mechanism design have substantial improvement effects. Based on the results of the above visualization analysis, we further conducted precise quantitative evaluation of DAFF-Net’s performance improvements. Fundamental baseline validation demonstrates the substantial value of sophisticated modeling: DAFF-Net’s performance represents a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the No-Change baseline and a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the Market Index baseline in 20-day prediction R2 (0.51 vs 0.13), confirming that our multimodal approach provides meaningful predictive value beyond the most basic strategies. Compared to the strongest unimodal baseline DUET, DAFF-Net achieved significant improvements in 1-day prediction tasks with MSE reduction of 15.2% (from 0.0171 to 0.0145) and R2 improvement of 15.5% (from 0.58 to 0.67). In the more challenging 20-day prediction task, the improvement magnitude is even more prominent, with MSE reduction of 12.3% (from 0.0260 to 0.0228) and R2 improvement of 21.4% (from 0.42 to 0.51). Compared to the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net also demonstrated stable performance advantages. In 1-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 10.5% and R2 improved by 9.8%; in 5-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 7.4% and R2 improved by 7.0%; in 20-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 9.2% and R2 improved by 13.3%. These quantitative results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed event-driven temporal pattern extraction and multi-dimensional relationship-aware fusion mechanisms. The hierarchical performance structure revealed by our comprehensive baseline comparison validates the progressive value of modeling sophistication: fundamental baselines (No-Change, Market Index) establish the baseline performance floor; traditional econometric methods (ARIMA) provide moderate improvements; deep learning approaches (LSTM, TCN, Transformer) achieve substantial gains; and multimodal fusion methods (MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net) deliver the highest performance. Crucially, DAFF-Net’s 13.3% improvement over the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM in 20-day prediction demonstrates that sophisticated fusion mechanisms provide meaningful benefits even among advanced multimodal approaches. Particularly worth emphasizing is that DAFF-Net’s relative advantages are more pronounced in long-term prediction, which has important significance for practical financial applications. In quantitative investment and risk management, the ability to accurately predict market trends over longer time horizons is often more valuable than short-term prediction, as it provides more sufficient time windows and more stable strategic foundations for investment decisions. Our experimental results indicate that through effective integration of event information and multi-dimensional relationship information, DAFF-Net can better capture long-term patterns in financial markets, thus having greater potential value in practical applications. To validate the individual contributions of DAFF-Net’s core technical innovations, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies by systematically removing or replacing key components. This analysis demonstrates the necessity and effectiveness of each proposed module. We design six ablation variants to isolate the contribution of each major component: DAFF-Net-NoEvent: Remove the entire event-driven temporal pattern extractor, using only price time series data DAFF-Net-NoRelation: Remove the multi-dimensional relationship-aware module, using only temporal features DAFF-Net-SingleRel: Replace multi-dimensional relationships with frequency-domain relationships only DAFF-Net-HardCluster: Replace soft clustering with hard k-means clustering (k=8) DAFF-Net-NoFusion: Remove contextual factor fusion, using simple concatenation instead DAFF-Net-NoRouter: Replace event-aware router with simple concatenation of events and time series Each ablation variant maintains the same training procedure and hyperparameter settings to ensure fair comparison. Table 8 presents the performance degradation when each component is removed or simplified. The ablation results reveal several important insights about the relative importance of different components: Event-Driven Module (Highest Impact): Removing the event-driven temporal pattern extractor causes the largest performance degradation (10.1% to 15.9% across metrics), confirming that event information provides crucial predictive signals that pure price-based models cannot capture. The impact is particularly pronounced for longer prediction horizons, supporting our hypothesis that events provide valuable information for understanding market narratives. Multi-Dimensional Relationships (Significant Impact): Complete removal of relationship modeling results in 6.1% to 9.9% performance loss, demonstrating the importance of cross-asset information. Interestingly, the relationship module’s contribution is more consistent across prediction horizons compared to the event module. Multi-Dimensional vs. Single-Dimensional Relationships: Using only frequency-domain relationships (DAFF-Net-SingleRel) leads to 3.5% to 5.6% degradation compared to the full multi-dimensional approach. This validates our hypothesis that different relationship types capture complementary information about asset correlations. Soft vs. Hard Clustering: The soft clustering mechanism provides consistent but moderate improvements (2.0% to 4.1%) over hard clustering. While the improvement is smaller than other components, it demonstrates the value of preserving nuanced relationship information. Contextual Factor Fusion: The specialized fusion mechanism contributes 4.8% to 7.6% improvement over simple concatenation, highlighting the importance of carefully designed information integration. Event-Aware Router: The sophisticated event routing provides 3.1% to 5.2% improvement over naive event concatenation, validating the value of learned event-pattern matching. To understand how components interact, we examine cumulative ablation effects (Table 9): The cumulative analysis shows that: (1) Core innovations (event processing + multi-dimensional relationships) contribute 21.6% of total performance; (2) Complete removal of all innovations results in 35.3% performance degradation; (3) The final price-only configuration performs similarly to advanced unimodal baselines like Transformer, validating our baseline comparisons. We observe interesting interaction effects between components: Event-Relationship Synergy: When both event and relationship modules are present, their combined effect (21.6% improvement) exceeds the sum of individual contributions (13.7% + 9.1% = 22.8%), suggesting slight negative interaction. This may indicate some information overlap between event signals and cross-asset relationships. Fusion Mechanism Dependency: The fusion module’s contribution increases when both primary streams are active, indicating that sophisticated fusion becomes more valuable as input complexity increases. This comprehensive ablation study confirms that each proposed component contributes meaningfully to DAFF-Net’s performance, with the event-driven module providing the largest individual benefit and multi-dimensional relationship modeling providing substantial complementary value. To evaluate the generalizability of DAFF-Net beyond the primary Amazon case study, we conducted additional validation experiments on a diverse set of stocks representing different sectors and market characteristics. This cross-asset analysis addresses concerns about sector-specific overfitting and demonstrates the broader applicability of our methodological approach. We selected four representative stocks from distinct sectors to provide comprehensive cross-validation: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ): Healthcare/Pharmaceutical sector, representing defensive value stocks with stable fundamentals and lower volatility JPMorgan Chase (JPM): Financial services sector, exhibiting strong sensitivity to macroeconomic events and interest rate changes ExxonMobil (XOM): Energy sector, characterized by commodity price dependencies and cyclical behavior patterns Tesla (TSLA): Electric vehicle/Technology sector, representing high-growth, high-volatility stocks with strong event-driven characteristics These assets were chosen to span the spectrum of market behaviors: from stable dividend-paying value stocks (JNJ) to highly volatile growth stocks (TSLA), from cyclical commodities exposure (XOM) to interest rate sensitive financials (JPM). Table 10 presents the comparative performance of DAFF-Net against the three strongest baseline models (DUET, MM-LSTM, Transformer) across all five assets for 20-day prediction tasks. The cross-asset validation reveals several important patterns: Consistent Performance Gains: DAFF-Net achieved performance improvements across all five assets, with MSE reductions ranging from 8.5% to 9.7% and \(\text {R}^{2}\) improvements from 10.2% to 15.4% compared to the strongest baseline MM-LSTM. This consistency suggests that our methodological innovations provide robust value across different market segments. Sector-Dependent Improvement Magnitudes: The relative improvements varied by sector characteristics. Energy stock XOM showed the largest \(\text {R}^{2}\) improvement (15.4%), potentially due to the sector’s strong sensitivity to macroeconomic events, which our event-driven approach effectively captures. Healthcare stock JNJ showed more modest improvements (10.2%), consistent with its lower event sensitivity and more stable fundamental-driven behavior. Volatility Adaptation: High-volatility stocks (TSLA, AMZN) and low-volatility stocks (JNJ) both benefited from DAFF-Net, though through different mechanisms. For volatile stocks, the event-driven pattern extraction provided significant value; for stable stocks, the multi-dimensional relationship modeling contributed more substantially. Event Sensitivity Correlation: Assets with higher event sensitivity (TSLA, XOM, AMZN) generally showed larger absolute performance improvements, validating the particular value of our event-aware routing mechanism for event-driven stocks. While these cross-asset results demonstrate promising generalizability, we acknowledge several limitations: (1) the validation remains within large-cap U.S. equities and may not extend to small-cap stocks, international markets, or other asset classes; (2) the 15-year study period, while comprehensive, represents specific market regimes and may not capture all possible market conditions; (3) the computational complexity of full multi-asset deployment remains a practical consideration for broader applications. The experimental results fully demonstrate the significant advantages of DAFF-Net in financial time series prediction tasks. These advantages mainly stem from our innovative breakthroughs at three key technical levels, as shown in Table 11, which presents a comparative analysis of DAFF-Net’s key technical innovations. First, the event-driven temporal pattern extractor achieves an important transition from pure data-driven to event-aware modeling38. Traditional time series prediction models, whether statistical methods like ARIMA33 or deep learning methods like LSTM7 and Transformer9, mainly rely on statistical features of historical price data for modeling. This approach often produces confusion when facing similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes16. For example, sharp stock price declines may stem from poor company performance39, industry policy adjustments, or overall market panic. Although the price performances are similar, their underlying mechanisms and subsequent evolution patterns are completely different. Our event-aware router can effectively distinguish these market patterns that appear similar on the surface but are essentially different by fusing time series data with event vectors40, thereby achieving more precise predictions. This innovation not only brings significant improvements in quantitative metrics but, more importantly, provides a new financial modeling paradigm that organically combines market “narrative logic” with “data logic.” Second, the multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module breaks through the limitations of traditional single-relationship modeling by constructing a more comprehensive and accurate asset correlation network through the fusion of relationships in three dimensions: frequency domain, fundamentals, and knowledge graphs41. Frequency domain relationships capture periodic similarities in price movements, reflecting technical correlations20; fundamental relationships are based on financial indicators and industry classifications, embodying fundamental similarities42; knowledge graph relationships quantify structured business-level connections. This multi-dimensional relationship modeling is not only more theoretically complete but also demonstrates obvious advantages in practice, particularly in capturing market systemic risks and sector rotation effects43. Compared to DUET’s36 single perspective considering only frequency domain relationships, our method can better understand complex market ecosystems, which has important practical significance for portfolio management and risk control. Third, the adoption of soft clustering mechanisms reflects our deep understanding of financial market complexity6. Unlike traditional hard clustering methods’ either-or approach, soft clustering allows assets to have different degrees of membership in multiple groups, which better aligns with actual financial market conditions44. In reality, a technology company may have industry correlations with other tech stocks, may also have connections with retail stocks due to its consumer business, and may form relationships with infrastructure stocks because of its cloud services. The soft clustering mechanism avoids information loss that hard partitioning might cause by preserving these subtle but important weak relationship information, enabling the model to capture market multi-level structures more precisely23. From deep analysis of experimental results, we found that DAFF-Net’s performance advantages are not uniformly distributed but present some interesting and meaningful patterns. The most significant finding is that the model’s relative advantages are more prominent in long-term prediction tasks, which reflects the core value of our technical innovations45. In 1-day prediction tasks, DAFF-Net’s improvement compared to the strongest baseline is approximately 10%, while in 20-day prediction tasks, this improvement magnitude expands to 13.3%. This advantage that amplifies with increasing prediction time horizons indicates that our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion mechanisms have unique capabilities in handling complex long-term dependencies11. Short-term prediction mainly relies on recent price momentum and technical indicators21, while long-term prediction requires understanding deeper market structures and fundamental logic, which is precisely the core advantage of our model design. Further analysis of different types of baseline model performance reveals a clear performance hierarchy. Traditional statistical method ARIMA33 performed worst across all metrics, which aligns with expectations since linear models struggle to capture nonlinear characteristics of financial data1. Unimodal deep learning methods (LSTM7, TCN34, Transformer9) showed moderate performance, with attention mechanism methods slightly outperforming recurrent and convolutional methods, demonstrating the advantages of global dependency modeling. Multimodal methods (MM-LSTM37, DAFF-Net) significantly outperformed unimodal methods, validating the value of multi-source information fusion24. Notably, even within multimodal methods, DAFF-Net significantly outperformed MM-LSTM, indicating that simple feature concatenation or early fusion is insufficient to fully exploit the potential of multimodal data and requires carefully designed fusion mechanisms like ours. From the perspective of different evaluation metrics, DAFF-Net achieved consistent improvements in both MSE and \(\text {R}^{2}\) metrics, indicating that the model’s advantages are comprehensive and stable. MSE as an absolute error metric reflects prediction accuracy; \(\text {R}^{2}\) as a relative metric reflects the model’s ability to explain data variability. Simultaneous improvement in both metrics indicates that DAFF-Net can not only reduce prediction errors but also better understand and explain the intrinsic patterns of financial data. This consistency has important significance for practical applications, as it demonstrates that the model’s improvements are substantial rather than incidental advantages in specific metrics. Table 12 further quantifies this performance improvement across different time horizons, revealing the sources and distribution characteristics of our technical advantages. Despite DAFF-Net’s excellent performance in experiments, we must objectively recognize the limitations of current research, which provide important guidance for future research directions46. First, while we conducted cross-asset validation on five stocks from different sectors, the scope remains limited to large-cap U.S. equities. Our primary analysis focuses on Amazon with supporting validation on four additional stocks (JNJ, JPM, XOM, TSLA). Although choosing Amazon has sufficient reasons (strong market representativeness, rich data, obvious event-driven characteristics), this single-target validation strategy still limits the universality of conclusions. Stocks in different industries have different price behavior characteristics, with significant differences in driving factors between cyclical industries (such as steel and chemicals) and growth industries (such as technology and biotechnology), and vastly different volatility patterns between traditional value stocks and emerging concept stocks13. Therefore, model performance in other asset classes (such as bonds, commodities, foreign exchange) and different market environments (such as emerging markets, small-cap stock markets) still needs further validation. Second, the complexity of technical implementation may affect the actual deployment efficiency of the model. The acquisition, processing, and encoding of event data is relatively complex, requiring real-time monitoring of multiple news sources, announcement platforms, and economic data release channels, which places high demands on data infrastructure and processing capabilities47. The construction and maintenance of knowledge graphs also require professional domain knowledge and continuous updating mechanisms. In comparison, traditional models based on price data are more straightforward to deploy. This technical complexity may limit the application of models in resource-constrained environments, particularly for small and medium-sized investment institutions. From a computational efficiency perspective, DAFF-Net’s multi-branch architecture and complex fusion mechanisms bring additional computational overhead. Although this overhead is acceptable in modern GPU environments, it may become a limiting factor in application scenarios that are extremely sensitive to latency, such as high-frequency trading4. Additionally, although the model’s interpretability has improved compared to pure black-box methods (through event routers and attention mechanisms), it still needs further enhancement in model decision transparency and interpretability for strictly regulated financial environments31. Looking toward future research directions, we believe there are several important development opportunities worth exploring. First is expanding validation scope by applying the model to more asset classes and market environments, constructing large-scale multi-asset prediction systems27. This can not only validate model universality but may also discover cross-asset synergies and systemic risk transmission mechanisms29. Second is technical optimization directions, including developing more efficient event information extraction and encoding methods, exploring lightweight model architectures, and researching incremental learning mechanisms to adapt to dynamic market environment changes. Third is enhancing model interpretability through visualization techniques and factor decomposition methods to make model decision processes more transparent, enhancing user trust and regulatory compliance46. Finally is exploration of practical applications by integrating the model into complete quantitative investment and risk management systems, validating performance and commercial value in real trading environments47. We believe that with in-depth research in these directions, event-driven and relationship-aware financial prediction methods will play increasingly important roles in future intelligent financial systems. While DAFF-Net demonstrates superior predictive performance, practical deployment requires careful consideration of infrastructure requirements, implementation complexity, and cost-benefit trade-offs. This section provides a realistic assessment of deployment challenges and offers scalable implementation strategies for different institutional contexts. Full Implementation Requirements: The complete DAFF-Net system demands substantial technical infrastructure: Real-time Data Pipeline: Continuous ingestion from multiple news feeds (Bloomberg, Reuters, PR Newswire), SEC EDGAR filings, and macroeconomic data sources, requiring robust data streaming architecture and 24/7 monitoring Natural Language Processing Infrastructure: High-performance GPU clusters for real-time BERT encoding of news articles and announcements, with typical latency requirements under 100ms for trading applications Knowledge Graph Maintenance: Quarterly updates requiring domain expertise to verify corporate relationships, supply chain changes, and regulatory reclassifications from multiple authoritative sources Computational Resources: Training infrastructure requiring NVIDIA A100-class GPUs and substantial memory for handling large-scale multimodal datasets Estimated Implementation Costs: Initial setup: \(\$200\text {K}-500\text {K}\) for infrastructure and data subscriptions Annual operational costs: \(\$150\text {K}-300\text {K}\) for data feeds, cloud computing, and maintenance Personnel requirements: 2–3 FTE including ML engineers, data engineers, and domain experts Recognizing that full implementation may be prohibitive for smaller institutions, we propose several graceful degradation strategies that preserve significant portions of DAFF-Net’s performance benefits: Tier 1: Simplified Event Integration Data Sources: Limit events to earnings announcements, major news headlines, and Fed policy statements Processing: Use pre-trained sentence transformers instead of full BERT encoding Update Frequency: Daily batch processing instead of real-time streaming Performance Impact: Retains approximately 80% of full model improvement Cost Reduction: 60–70% lower than full implementation Tier 2: Relationship-Only Implementation Focus: Implement only the multi-dimensional relationship module Data Sources: Use publicly available fundamental data and static knowledge graphs Event Component: Replace with simple sentiment scores from free news APIs Performance Impact: Retains approximately 60% of full model improvement Cost Reduction: 80% lower than full implementation Tier 3: Academic/Research Implementation Data Sources: Historical data only, using archived news and fundamental databases Processing: Offline batch processing suitable for research and backtesting Knowledge Graph: Simplified using Wikipedia/DBpedia relationships Performance Impact: Full research validation capability Cost: Under \(\$10\text {K}\) annually for academic research Phased Implementation Strategy: Phase 1 (Months 1–3): Implement Tier 3 version for backtesting and validation on institutional data Phase 2 (Months 4–6): Upgrade to Tier 2 with live fundamental data and basic event processing Phase 3 (Months 7–12): Full Tier 1 implementation with comprehensive event integration Phase 4 (Year 2+): Optimization and customization for specific use cases Risk Mitigation Strategies: Fallback Mechanisms: Maintain traditional LSTM/Transformer models as backup predictors Data Quality Monitoring: Implement automated data quality checks and anomaly detection Model Validation: Continuous out-of-sample testing and performance monitoring Regulatory Compliance: Ensure all data sources and model decisions meet financial regulatory requirements Large Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {10B}}+ {\textbf {AUM}}\)): Full implementation justified by potential alpha generation exceeding infrastructure costs. Conservative estimate of 0.5–1.5% annual alpha improvement can generate \(\$50-100\)M additional returns, easily justifying \(\$500\)K annual costs. Medium Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {1-10B AUM}}\)): Tier 1 implementation recommended. Estimated 0.3–0.7.3.7% alpha improvement generating \(\$3-70\)M additional returns versus \(\$200\)K annual costs provides strong ROI. Small Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {100M-1B AUM}}\)): Tier 2 implementation most appropriate. Even 0.2–0.4.2.4% alpha improvement generates \(\$200\)K-4M additional returns versus \(\$100\)K costs, maintaining positive ROI. Individual/Retail Investors: Tier 3 implementation suitable for educational purposes and personal portfolio management, with minimal costs and research-focused benefits. To facilitate broader adoption and academic research, we commit to: Open Source Release: Core model architecture and Tier 3 implementation within 6 months of publication Documentation: Comprehensive implementation guides and tutorials API Development: RESTful APIs for simplified integration with existing trading systems Community Support: GitHub repository with active maintenance and community contributions This practical implementation framework demonstrates that while DAFF-Net represents a sophisticated advancement in financial prediction, it can be deployed at various scales and resource levels, making its benefits accessible to a broad range of market participants. This study proposes the Dual-stream Alpha Factor Fusion Network (DAFF-Net), an innovative deep learning framework specifically designed for financial time series prediction tasks. Through the organic combination of an event-driven temporal pattern extractor and a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, DAFF-Net successfully addresses the limitations of traditional financial prediction models in handling complex market narratives and inter-asset correlations. Comprehensive experimental validation on Amazon stock data demonstrates that DAFF-Net significantly outperforms eight representative baseline models including ARIMA, LSTM, Transformer, and DUET across 1-day, 5-day, and 20-day prediction tasks, achieving 7.4%−15.2% improvement in MSE metrics and 7.0%−21.4% enhancement in \(\text {R}^{2}\) metrics compared to the strongest baselines, with particularly outstanding advantages in long-term prediction tasks. These results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of deep fusion of event information with multi-dimensional relationship information, providing new technical pathways and theoretical contributions to the field of financial time series prediction. Although current research still has limitations such as limited data coverage and complex technical implementation, DAFF-Net’s core concepts and technical framework open important directions for the development of quantitative investment, risk management, and intelligent financial systems, with broad application prospects and research value. Future work will focus on expanding model validation in multi-asset and cross-market environments, optimizing computational efficiency and deployment convenience, and further enhancing model interpretability to promote the widespread application of event-driven and relationship-aware financial prediction methods in actual financial business.

Financial time series prediction has consistently been one of the core research problems in the fields of econometrics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence1. Since the introduction of Brownian motion theory and the efficient market hypothesis in the mid-20th century2,3, scholars have been exploring how to accurately predict the price movements of financial assets. With the increasing complexity of global financial markets, accurate financial forecasting can not only provide scientific basis for investment decisions but also help financial institutions conduct effective risk management and asset allocation, and its importance is increasingly prominent. The complexity of today’s financial markets far exceeds the assumptions of traditional theoretical models. The exponential growth in information dissemination speed has changed the fundamental operating mechanisms of markets, and diversified information sources such as social media, news websites, and financial blogs enable market information to spread at unprecedented speeds, significantly shortening investors’ decision-making windows, making market reactions more rapid and prone to overreaction. The proliferation of algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading has fundamentally changed market microstructure4,5. According to statistics, algorithmic trading accounts for over 70% of trading volume in the U.S. stock market, and the interaction of these automated trading systems creates complex feedback mechanisms that traditional market models based on human behavior struggle to accurately describe. The deepening of globalization has further increased the complexity of financial markets6, with the correlation between different markets significantly increased, and volatility in a single market often rapidly transmitting to other global markets through various channels such as trade connections, capital flows, and investor sentiment. In recent years, deep learning technologies have achieved significant progress in the field of time series prediction, with models such as Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM)7, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)8, and Transformers9 demonstrating strong performance across multiple time series forecasting tasks10,11. However, existing methods primarily focus on the statistical properties of time series data itself, often overlooking two key factors that influence financial markets: first, external event information that drives market behavior (such as corporate announcements, macroeconomic events, and market sentiment)12,13, and second, the complex correlations between assets based on multi-dimensional relationships (such as industry relationships, supply chain relationships, competitive relationships, etc.)14,15. This single-perspective modeling approach limits the predictive accuracy and generalization capability of models in complex financial environments. Although existing research has attempted to address the aforementioned problems, there remain obvious research gaps and technical deficiencies. First, traditional time series models cannot distinguish similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes16. For example, the same price decline may stem from poor corporate earnings reports, overall market corrections, or sudden negative events, but existing models often treat them as identical patterns, leading to limited prediction accuracy17. Consider scenarios of sharp stock price declines where surface price behaviors might be completely identical (such as an 8% single-day drop), but the underlying driving factors are entirely different: earnings-driven declines usually accompanied by high trading volume and strong continuation after earnings announcements18,19; systematic risk declines affect entire sectors or even the entire market; technical adjustment declines usually have small trading volume and easily gain support at key technical levels20,21,22. Existing models often treat these essentially different decline patterns as the same “decline signal,” significantly reducing the accuracy of subsequent predictions. Second, existing multimodal fusion methods mostly adopt simple feature concatenation or early fusion strategies, lacking deep modeling of complex interactive relationships between event information and time series data23,24. These methods often directly concatenate different types of feature vectors, ignoring the intrinsic logical relationships between different modal information, and event information and price data differ in temporal granularity and impact duration, making simple alignment methods prone to information loss. Finally, in terms of asset relationship modeling, most methods only consider single-dimensional relationships (such as price correlations or industry classifications), failing to comprehensively capture the multi-dimensional, multi-level complex correlations among financial assets25. The correlations between financial assets are multi-dimensional, multi-level complex networks, but existing methods show obvious simplification tendencies in relationship modeling: most studies only consider price correlation as one dimension, ignoring other important dimensions such as fundamental similarity, business relevance, and supply chain relationships; many models assume that relationships between assets remain static, unable to adapt to relationship evolution caused by changing market environments26; in the few studies that consider multi-dimensional relationships, they often simply assign equal weights to various dimensions, lacking adaptive weight adjustment mechanisms. Beyond theoretical challenges, the development of actual financial business also places higher requirements on prediction models. Modern quantitative investment strategies require models not only to predict direction but also to predict magnitude and duration27, and investors want to understand the logic behind prediction results, especially when facing abnormal market conditions28. The 2008 financial crisis and 2020 pandemic shock demonstrated that traditional risk models based on historical data often fail when facing extreme events29, and financial institutions urgently need prediction tools that can integrate multi-source information and identify systemic risks in advance30. With the strengthening of fintech regulation, applications such as algorithmic trading and robo-advisors must possess certain interpretability31, and model decision-making processes need to be reasonably explained to regulatory agencies and customers. Based on these challenges, this study aims to address the following three key questions: How to effectively fuse event information with time series data, enabling models to understand the intrinsic meaning of price patterns under different event contexts; How to construct multi-dimensional asset relationship networks to more comprehensively capture complex correlations in financial markets; How to design effective fusion mechanisms to achieve deep integration of event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors.” To address the above problems, this paper proposes the Dual-stream Alpha Factor Fusion Network (DAFF-Net), which achieves deep understanding and accurate prediction of financial time series data through the organic combination of an event-driven temporal pattern extractor and a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module. The core innovations of DAFF-Net include: Event-aware routing mechanism: Designed an event-aware router that fuses time series data with contextual event information encoded from news, corporate announcements, and macroeconomic data, enabling the model to understand the underlying narratives behind market fluctuations and effectively distinguish market behavior patterns that appear similar on the surface but are essentially different. Multi-dimensional relationship adaptive fusion: Proposed a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module that constructs a comprehensive asset relationship network more effective than single-relationship methods through adaptive fusion of frequency domain, fundamental, and knowledge graph relationships, capable of dynamically adjusting the importance of different relationship dimensions according to market conditions. Soft clustering attention mechanism: Adopted soft clustering strategies to replace traditional hard clustering methods, preserving fine-grained weak relationship information and avoiding information loss that hard clustering might cause, which is particularly important in complex financial market environments. Dual-stream fusion architecture: Designed an innovative dual-stream fusion framework that achieves deep integration of event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors,” maximizing the synergistic effects of different modal information through carefully designed masked attention mechanisms. The structure of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a detailed introduction to the overall architectural design of DAFF-Net, including the event-driven temporal pattern extractor, multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, and contextual factor fusion with multi-horizon prediction mechanism; Section 3 presents comprehensive experimental validation on Amazon stock data, including dataset construction, baseline model comparisons, and result analysis; Section 4 provides in-depth discussion of the effectiveness of technical innovations, deep interpretation of model performance, and research limitations with future prospects; Section 5 summarizes the main contributions and practical application value of this research. DAFF-Net adopts a dual-stream fusion design philosophy, with its overall architecture shown in Fig. 1. The core idea of this architecture is to decompose the financial time series prediction task into two complementary learning processes: event-driven temporal pattern understanding and multi-dimensional relationship-aware cross-asset information fusion. As shown in the central part of Fig. 1, DAFF-Net receives three types of heterogeneous data inputs. Let the time series data be \(X \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times T \times D}\), where N represents the number of assets, T represents the time window length, and D represents the feature dimension. Event data is represented as \(E \in {\mathbb {R}}^{T \times D_e}\), where \(D_e\) is the event vector dimension. Relationship data includes fundamental information \(F \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_f}\) and knowledge graph structure \(G \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\). After instance normalization processing, the data streams are respectively fed into two parallel feature extraction branches: Left branch (as shown in the left panel of Fig. 1) is the event-driven temporal pattern extractor, which fuses temporal segments with event vectors through an event-aware router: where \({\textbf{h}}_{t} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{(D+D_e)}\) represents the fused representation at time t. Right branch (as shown in the right panel of Fig. 1) is the multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, which generates three types of relationship matrices in parallel. The frequency-domain relationship matrix is computed through fast Fourier transform: The fundamental relationship matrix computes similarity based on structured data: The knowledge graph relationship matrix is directly obtained from the graph structure: These three relationship matrices are integrated through an adaptive fusion module. As shown in the bottom right corner of Fig. 1, fusion weights are learned through a small neural network: The final fused relationship matrix is: where \(\odot\) denotes element-wise multiplication. As shown in the contextual factor fusion module in the center of Fig. 1, the outputs of the two branches are integrated through a masked attention mechanism. The event-aware temporal features \(Z_{\text {temporal}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_h}\) output from the left branch and the channel attention matrix \(A_{\text {channel}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\) output from the right branch are fused as: This fused representation is then passed to the multi-horizon prediction heads, as shown at the top of Fig. 1. The prediction heads consist of multiple feedforward networks that generate predictions for different time spans: where \(h \in \{1, 5, 20\}\) represents the prediction days, and \({\hat{Y}}_{h} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times 1}\) is the corresponding return prediction. Figure 1 clearly shows the information flow of the entire architecture: multimodal inputs at the bottom undergo feature extraction and relationship modeling through two specially designed branches, then achieve deep integration of “narrative factors” and “relationship factors” in the fusion module, and finally output prediction results for different time spans through multi-horizon prediction heads. This design enables DAFF-Net to simultaneously capture event-driven dynamics and complex inter-asset correlations in financial markets, achieving more accurate multi-horizon predictions. Overall architecture diagram of DAFF-Net. Traditional time series models in financial markets often face the “pattern confusion” problem, i.e., inability to distinguish similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes. For example, the same price decline may stem from poor corporate earnings reports, overall market corrections, or sudden negative events, but traditional models often treat them as identical patterns. To address this key problem, we designed an event-driven temporal pattern extractor, whose architecture is shown in the left panel of Fig. 1. The core of this module is the Event-Aware Router, which addresses the critical challenges of multi-source event integration and temporal alignment. Unlike simple concatenation approaches, our router employs a sophisticated event processing pipeline that handles heterogeneous event types with different temporal granularities and impact characteristics. Multi-Source Event Processing We employ BERT-base-uncased32 pre-trained transformer model for encoding textual event information into 768-dimensional dense representations. The BERT model processes concatenated news headlines and lead paragraphs, with maximum sequence length of 512 tokens. We first categorize events into three distinct types based on their market impact patterns and temporal characteristics: where: \(w_{news}, w_{corp}, w_{macro}\) are learnable event type weights \(\text {decay}(t - t_{news})\) models the temporal decay of news impact: \(\exp (-\lambda (t - t_{news}))\) \(\text {impact}(\text {type}_{corp})\) assigns different weights based on announcement types (earnings: 1.0, guidance: 0.8, strategic: 0.6, operational: 0.4) \(\text {persistence}(\text {policy}_{macro})\) captures the lasting effect of macroeconomic policies Temporal Alignment and Weighting To handle the temporal misalignment between high-frequency trading data and irregular event occurrences, we employ an attention-based temporal alignment mechanism: where \(Q_t\) represents the query vector from time series data at time t, \(K_e\) represents the key vector from event e, and \(\text {temporal}\_\text {mask}(t, t_e)\) applies exponential decay based on the time distance between the trading timestamp and event timestamp. Adaptive Event Fusion The final event representation integrates all event types through learned attention weights: where \(\alpha _i\) are dynamically computed attention weights based on current market volatility and \(\text {EventMemory}_{t-1}\) maintains a momentum term from previous significant events. Final Router Input The temporal segment and processed event vector are then fused: Traditional approaches often rely on generic knowledge bases without proper domain adaptation. Our method addresses this limitation through a systematic financial-domain knowledge graph construction process: Financial Entity Mapping We establish explicit mappings from generic knowledge entities to financial assets through: Relationship Strength Quantification Rather than using arbitrary fixed weights, we derive relationship strengths through empirical analysis of market co-movements and fundamental connections: where \(\rho _{*}\) are empirically derived scaling factors based on historical correlation analysis: Dynamic Relationship Updates The knowledge graph relationships are updated quarterly based on: Corporate action announcements (M&A, partnerships, spin-offs) Supply chain relationship changes (supplier/customer updates) Regulatory classification changes (GICS sector reclassifications) Cross-holdings and institutional ownership changes This enhanced event-aware routing mechanism ensures that: Different event types are processed according to their inherent characteristics Temporal misalignments are properly handled through attention mechanisms Event impacts are modeled with realistic decay patterns Knowledge graph relationships reflect actual financial market structures Relationship weights are empirically grounded rather than arbitrary The router matches current market conditions to a set of learnable temporal pattern prototypes \(\{P_1, P_2,\ldots , P_M\}\), where each prototype \(P_i \in {\mathbb {R}}^{D_p}\) represents a specific event-driven market behavior pattern. These prototypes are automatically learned through the training process, with typical patterns including (Table 1): Routing probabilities are computed through attention mechanism: where \(W_r \in {\mathbb {R}}^{(D+D_e) \times D_p}\) is a learnable projection matrix. Based on routing probabilities, the system selects Top-K most relevant Linear-based Pattern Extractors (LPEs). Each extractor \(\text {LPE}_i\) is an expert network specifically designed for particular patterns: The final output is obtained through weighted aggregation: Event-Driven Temporal Pattern Extraction The correlations between financial assets are multi-dimensional and dynamically changing, making it difficult for single relationship modeling methods to comprehensively capture this complexity. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 1, our proposed multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module addresses this problem by generating and fusing three types of relationship views in parallel. To ensure experimental validity and prevent any form of future information leakage, all relationship matrices and model components strictly adhere to temporal constraints. For any prediction at time t, we guarantee that: Frequency-domain relationships are computed using only historical price data from the sliding window \([t-L_{\text {freq}}, t-1]\), where \(L_{\text {freq}} = 60\) trading days: Fundamental relationships utilize only the most recent quarterly financial data available before time t, ensuring no forward-looking bias: Knowledge graph relationships reflect the corporate structure and business relationships as documented up to time \(t-1\), with quarterly updates based on publicly disclosed information: Adaptive fusion weights \(\varvec{\alpha }\) are learned exclusively on the training dataset (2010–2020) and remain frozen during validation (2021–2022) and testing (2023–2025) phases: This temporal discipline ensures that our experimental results reflect genuine predictive capability rather than information leakage artifacts. We verified compliance by re-computing all performance metrics with strict temporal validation protocols. Frequency-domain relationship matrix: Captures periodic similarities in price movements through real Fast Fourier Transform (rFFT): where \({\tilde{X}}_i^H\) denotes the complex conjugate transpose. Fundamental relationship matrix: Computes cosine similarity based on normalized fundamental data: where fundamental features include (Table 2): Knowledge graph relationship matrix: Quantifies structured relationships between entities by processing financial knowledge graphs. We conducted extensive parameter experiments to determine optimal relationship weights, as shown in Table 3. Based on comprehensive parameter experiments across multiple validation periods, the optimal knowledge graph relationship matrix is defined as: The parameter selection was validated through cross-validation on the training set (2010-2020) and confirmed on the validation set (2021-2022), ensuring robust performance across different market conditions (Table 4). The three relationship matrices are dynamically integrated through an adaptive fusion module. Fusion weights are learned through a multilayer perceptron that takes the current market state as input: The fused relationship matrix is: To achieve more robust “soft” clustering, we apply the Softmax function to each row of the fused matrix to generate a channel attention matrix: The advantage of this soft clustering method over hard clustering is that it preserves subtle weak relationship information, which is particularly important in financial markets. Multi-Dimensional Relation-Aware Soft Clustering The contextual factor fusion module is a key component of the DAFF-Net architecture, responsible for deep integration of heterogeneous information from the two branches. As shown in the fusion module at the center of Fig. 1, this module employs a masked attention mechanism: where \(Z_{\text {temporal}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_h}\) is the temporal features from the event-driven branch, and \(A_{\text {channel}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\) is the channel attention matrix from the relationship-aware branch. To enhance feature representation capability, we further introduce residual connections and layer normalization: The final fused representation is obtained through another feedforward network: The multi-horizon prediction heads adopt a design with shared bottom-layer features and independent prediction branches. For each prediction horizon \(h \in \{1, 5, 20\}\), we design independent prediction networks: where the parameters of each prediction head are independently optimized to adapt to the prediction characteristics of different time spans (Table 5). To simultaneously optimize prediction performance across multiple horizons, we adopt a weighted multi-task loss function: where the loss for each horizon is mean squared error: The weights \(\lambda _h\) are set according to prediction difficulty and practical application importance: \(\lambda _1 = 0.5\), \(\lambda _5 = 0.3\), \(\lambda _{20} = 0.2\). Contextual Factor Fusion and Multi-Horizon Prediction This design enables DAFF-Net to effectively integrate event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors,” while providing targeted optimization for prediction tasks across different time spans, thereby achieving excellent performance in multi-horizon financial prediction tasks. This study selects Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock as the primary research subject, based on several important considerations: First, as a global leading technology giant, Amazon’s stock price is subject to complex influences from multiple factors, including changes in company fundamentals, industry technological developments, macroeconomic policies, and market sentiment fluctuations, providing an ideal testing environment for validating our multimodal fusion method; Second, Amazon enjoys extremely high attention in capital markets, with abundant news reports, analyst research reports, and investor discussions, providing sufficient raw materials for constructing high-quality event datasets; Finally, as an important constituent stock of the NASDAQ market, Amazon has complex correlations with other technology stocks, consumer stocks, etc., helping to validate the effectiveness of our multi-dimensional relationship-aware module. We constructed a comprehensive multimodal dataset spanning from January 1, 2010, to May 31, 2025, totaling over 15 years of complete market data. This time span covers multiple important market cycles, including the technology stock recovery period of 2010-2015, the technology stock boom period of 2016-2020, the pandemic shock and recovery period of 2020-2022, and the interest rate hike cycle and artificial intelligence boom period of 2023-2025, ensuring the representativeness of the dataset and the generalization capability of the model. Data sources cover multiple authoritative financial data providers: quantitative trading data is mainly obtained from Yahoo Finance API and Refinitiv Eikon terminals, including daily open, high, low, close prices, volume, and adjusted prices; news and announcement data is collected in real-time through Bloomberg Terminal News Feed, supplemented by relevant reports from mainstream financial media such as Reuters and Wall Street Journal; fundamental data is extracted from Refinitiv and S&P Capital IQ databases, covering financial statements, valuation indicators, and industry classification information. While Amazon (AMZN) serves as our primary prediction target, the multi-dimensional relationship-aware module requires a comprehensive asset universe to construct meaningful N\(\times\)N relationship matrices. We carefully selected a universe of 50 large-cap technology and related stocks to ensure robust relationship modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. Asset Selection Criteria: Market capitalization > $50 billion as of December 2020 Primary listing on NASDAQ or NYSE Technology, consumer discretionary, or communication services sectors (GICS classification) Complete daily trading data availability from 2010–2025 Minimum average daily trading volume > 1 million shares Final Asset Universe (N=50): Core Technology: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, META, NFLX, NVDA, ORCL, CRM, ADBE, INTC, AMD, CSCO, AVGO, QCOM, TXN E-commerce & Consumer: AMZN, EBAY, SHOP, ETSY, WMT, TGT, COST, HD, NKE Cloud & Software: SNOW, PLTR, ZM, WORK, DDOG, NET, OKTA, MDB, CRWD Communication: VZ, T, TMUS, CHTR, CMCSA, DIS, NFLX Related Technology: TSLA, UBER, LYFT, SQ, PYPL, V, MA Temporal Data Handling: All 50 assets follow identical temporal splits: Training period: 2010–2020 (all assets) Validation period: 2021–2022 (all assets) Testing period: 2023–2025 (all assets) Missing data: Forward-fill for gaps \(\le\) 3 days, exclude assets with >5% missing data in any period Delisting handling: Assets delisted during study period are excluded from the relationship matrices after delisting date Relationship Matrix Computation: For frequency-domain and fundamental relationships, we compute pairwise similarities across all 50 assets, resulting in symmetric 50\(\times\)50 matrices. For knowledge graph relationships, we manually verified and annotated business relationships among these 50 entities using SEC 10-K filings, partnership announcements, and industry databases. The Amazon prediction task extracts the relevant row/column from these matrices corresponding to AMZN’s relationships with the other 49 assets. This design ensures that AMZN’s relationship modeling benefits from a rich, diverse set of comparable assets while maintaining strict temporal discipline across the entire universe. Knowledge Graph Construction and Domain Mapping Knowledge graph data construction involves a systematic process of mapping general knowledge bases to financial domain entities. We established comprehensive mappings through the following multi-step procedure: Step 1: Entity Identification and Mapping We constructed a mapping table linking general knowledge entities to financial assets through multiple identification mechanisms: Primary Mapping: Direct ticker symbol matching (e.g., DBpedia:Amazon.com \(\rightarrow\) NASDAQ:AMZN) Secondary Mapping: Company name disambiguation using ISIN codes and official registrations Tertiary Mapping: Cross-reference validation through multiple knowledge bases (DBpedia, Wikidata, OpenCorporates) Step 2: Relationship Extraction and Validation From the mapped entities, we extract structured relationships using SPARQL queries and natural language processing: Direct Business Relations: Partnership agreements, joint ventures, strategic alliances extracted from SEC filings and corporate announcements Ownership Structures: Parent-subsidiary relationships from corporate registrations and 10-K filings Supply Chain Networks: Customer-supplier relationships from business dependency disclosures Industry Classifications: GICS sector mappings validated against multiple classification systems (SIC, NAICS, ICB) Step 3: Relationship Strength Quantification We quantify relationship strengths through empirical analysis of historical market co-movements and fundamental connections, as detailed in Table 6. Step 4: Dynamic Relationship Updates The knowledge graph undergoes quarterly updates to reflect corporate actions and market structure changes: Corporate Actions: M&A announcements, spin-offs, and restructuring events Partnership Changes: New strategic alliances and partnership dissolutions Supply Chain Evolution: Customer/supplier relationship updates from annual reports Regulatory Reclassifications: GICS sector changes and industry standard updates This systematic approach ensures that our knowledge graph accurately reflects the evolving landscape of financial market relationships while maintaining high data quality and validation standards. The mapping process achieved 96.1% validation rate across all entity types, providing a robust foundation for relationship-aware modeling. To comprehensively understand the market behavior characteristics of Amazon stock and provide a basis for model design, we first conducted a detailed analysis of the price time series. Amazon stock price time series (2010-2025). As shown in Fig. 2, Amazon stock exhibited typical growth stock characteristics during the study period, with an overall price trend showing strong upward momentum. Several important phase characteristics can be clearly observed from Fig. 2: During 2010-2012, stock prices fluctuated at relatively low levels, with the price range mainly between \(\$5-25\), reflecting the company’s early market positioning and investor expectations; During 2013-2017, stock prices began to rise significantly, climbing from about \(\$25\) to nearly \(\$100\), corresponding to the rapid development of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and global expansion of e-commerce business; During 2018-2021, stock prices experienced more dramatic volatility, reaching a high of about \(\$180\) during the 2020 pandemic, followed by a significant pullback in 2022 with lows around \(\$80\), reflecting market reassessment of technology stock valuations; Since 2023, stock prices have rebounded strongly again, creating new highs in 2024 exceeding \(\$240\), mainly benefiting from artificial intelligence technology breakthroughs and optimistic market expectations for AI application prospects. To further understand market participation and liquidity characteristics, we analyzed the trading volume change patterns during the corresponding period, which is important for assessing the credibility of price fluctuations and market depth. Amazon stock trading volume time series (2010-2025). Figure 3 shows the trading volume change patterns during the corresponding period, providing important supplementary information for understanding market participation and price volatility. Several significant characteristics can be observed from the trading volume data in Fig. 3: First, trading volume typically shows significant amplification during major events, particularly during the initial outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020 and the market adjustment period in the second half of 2022, with daily trading volumes often exceeding 600–800 million shares, far above the normal level of 200–400 million shares; Second, the seasonal patterns of trading volume are relatively stable, usually increasing during earnings report seasons (January, April, July, October each year) and year-end/year-beginning periods; Finally, overall trading volume levels have increased in recent years with the proliferation of algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading, reflecting the evolution of market microstructure. Considering the important role of technical analysis in financial prediction, we need to examine price performance relative to key technical indicators to identify important trend signals and support/resistance levels, which will provide valuable learning targets for our temporal pattern extractor. Amazon stock price vs. moving averages comparison. Figure 4 further demonstrates the relationship between price and technical indicators. By comparing closing prices with 50-day and 200-day moving averages, we can identify important trend reversal points and technical signals. Fig. 4 clearly shows several important technical breakthroughs: the upward breakthrough of 50-day and 200-day moving averages in early 2013, marking the establishment of a long-term uptrend; two technical adjustments in late 2018 and early 2022, where stock prices fell below short-term moving averages but ultimately received support from long-term trend lines; the strong breakthrough in the second half of 2023, where stock prices regained footing above all major moving averages. These technical characteristics provide rich learning samples for our temporal pattern extractor. Finally, to understand the statistical distribution characteristics of returns and validate the necessity of extreme event handling in our model design, we analyzed the probability distribution characteristics of daily returns. Amazon stock daily returns distribution histogram. The daily returns distribution histogram in Fig. 5 reveals the statistical characteristics of Amazon stock returns, showing typical “fat-tailed” distribution characteristics of financial time series. From Fig. 5, it can be seen that the distribution center is close to zero, consistent with efficient market hypothesis expectations, but compared to standard normal distribution, this distribution shows obvious excess kurtosis and thicker tails. Specifically, about 68% of daily returns are concentrated in the −2% to +2% range, about 95% of observations are between −6% to +6%, but there are still considerable extreme values exceeding the expected range of normal distribution. This distribution characteristic indicates that financial markets have relatively frequent extreme events, validating the necessity of considering event-driven factors in our model design. To ensure experimental rigor and result reliability, we adopted a strict time series data partitioning strategy to avoid any form of future information leakage. The specific partitioning scheme is: the training set covers January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2020, totaling 11 years of historical data, providing sufficient learning samples for the model; the validation set is set from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2022, totaling 2 years of data, used for hyperparameter tuning and model selection; the test set includes January 1, 2023, to May 31, 2025, approximately 2.5 years of the latest data, used to evaluate model generalization performance in actual application scenarios. This partitioning design has important practical significance: the training set time span is sufficiently long, covering multiple complete market cycles, ensuring the model can learn patterns under various market conditions; the validation set corresponds to the post-pandemic market environment, including new market characteristics such as monetary policy shifts and rising inflation pressures, helping the model adapt to environmental changes; the test set is entirely in the period after model training, including unprecedented market events such as the latest interest rate hike cycle and AI technology breakthroughs, providing a severe test for evaluating the model’s true predictive capability. In the data preprocessing stage, we applied corresponding standardization methods for different types of data: price data was transformed through log returns to eliminate the effect of price levels; fundamental data used rolling Z-score standardization, maintaining temporal characteristics while eliminating dimensional differences; event data was encoded into fixed-dimension vector representations through pre-trained BERT models; relationship data was normalized to ensure comparability across different relationship types. These preprocessing steps laid a solid foundation for subsequent model training and evaluation. To comprehensively evaluate the performance advantages of DAFF-Net, we carefully selected eight representative baseline models that cover the complete spectrum from traditional statistical methods to the latest deep learning techniques, providing thorough validation of our method’s effectiveness and advancement. Traditional statistical models: We selected ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)33 as the representative of classical time series prediction methods. ARIMA has good theoretical foundations and interpretability, is widely applied in financial time series prediction, and provides an important benchmark for evaluating the improvement magnitude of deep learning methods. Classical deep learning models: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)7 as a representative of recurrent neural networks, can effectively handle long sequence dependencies and is a classical method in the time series prediction domain. TCN (Temporal Convolutional Network)34 adopts causal convolution design, has advantages in parallel training and good long-term dependency modeling capability, representing the application of convolutional neural networks in time series prediction. Attention mechanism models: Transformer9 as the pioneering work of attention mechanisms, achieves direct modeling of relationships between arbitrary positions in sequences through global self-attention mechanisms. Informer35 introduces sparse attention mechanisms based on Transformer, specifically optimized for long sequence prediction tasks, improving computational efficiency. Multimodal and relationship modeling methods: DUET36 as the direct foundation of our work, adopts dual clustering mechanisms to model in temporal and channel dimensions respectively, representing advanced methods in current time series prediction. MM-LSTM (Multimodal LSTM)37 fuses multiple data sources into the LSTM framework, providing baseline reference for multimodal time series prediction. Simple decision-focused baselines: To establish fundamental performance benchmarks, we include two essential naive baselines that represent the most basic prediction strategies. The No-Change baseline assumes that stock returns will be zero for all prediction horizons, representing the null hypothesis that prices follow a random walk without predictable drift. The Market Index baseline predicts individual stock returns based on the historical beta relationship with the NASDAQ-100 index: where \(\beta _{AMZN}\) is estimated using a 252-day rolling window of historical returns prior to the prediction date. This baseline represents a simple factor model approach commonly used in practical finance. These fundamental baselines are essential for validating that sophisticated models provide meaningful improvements over the most basic prediction strategies. All baseline models adopt the same data partitioning strategy and evaluation metrics, ensuring experimental fairness. Hyperparameters were optimized through grid search on the validation set, with each model achieving its optimal configuration. To comprehensively evaluate model prediction performance across different time spans, we adopted two complementary evaluation metrics. Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the primary metric can effectively measure the deviation between predicted and true values, is sensitive to outliers, and meets the needs of financial risk management. Coefficient of determination (\(\text {R}^{2}\)) as an auxiliary metric reflects the model’s ability to explain data variability and facilitates understanding of relative model performance. We set three prediction time spans: 1-day, 5-day, and 20-day, corresponding to the practical needs of short-term trading, medium-term investment, and long-term allocation respectively. This multi-horizon setup can comprehensively evaluate model generalization capability under different prediction difficulties. To ensure result reliability, all experiments were conducted in the same hardware environment using the same random seeds and training strategies. Each model was fully trained until convergence and evaluated on the test set for final assessment. Several important trends can be observed from the quantitative results in Table 7: Overall performance ranking: DAFF-Net achieved the best performance across all evaluation metrics, validating the effectiveness of our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion approach. Multimodal methods (MM-LSTM and DAFF-Net) significantly outperformed unimodal methods, demonstrating the importance of multi-source information fusion. Among unimodal methods, DUET as the most advanced baseline performed best, proving the value of the dual clustering concept. Prediction difficulty analysis: The performance of all models declined as the prediction time span increased, which aligns with general rules of financial prediction. Interestingly, DAFF-Net’s relative advantage is more pronounced in long-term prediction (20-day), with \(\text {R}^{2}\) reaching 0.51, while the strongest baseline MM-LSTM only achieved 0.45, representing a relative improvement of 13.3%. This indicates that our method has significant advantages in handling complex long-term dependencies. Method type comparison: Traditional statistical method ARIMA performed worst across all metrics, reflecting the limitations of linear methods in handling complex financial data. Deep learning methods generally outperformed statistical methods, with attention mechanism methods (Transformer, Informer) outperforming traditional recurrent and convolutional methods, demonstrating the advantages of attention mechanisms in capturing long-term dependencies. Relative improvement magnitude: Compared to the strongest unimodal baseline DUET, DAFF-Net reduced MSE by 15.2% (from 0.0171 to 0.0145) and improved \(\text {R}^{2}\) by 15.5% (from 0.58 to 0.67) in 1-day prediction. Compared to the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net reduced MSE by 10.5% and improved \(\text {R}^{2}\) by 9.8% in 1-day prediction, proving our technical innovation in multimodal fusion. Fundamental baseline validation: The inclusion of naive baselines provides essential context for evaluating model sophistication. The No-Change baseline achieved \(\text {R}^{2}\) scores of 0.17, 0.12, and 0.08 across the three prediction horizons, representing the null hypothesis performance. The Market Index baseline, utilizing beta-adjusted market returns, improved to \(\text {R}^{2}\) scores of 0.21, 0.18, and 0.13, demonstrating the value of incorporating systematic market factors. Notably, even the traditional ARIMA model substantially outperformed these fundamental baselines, validating the necessity of time series modeling techniques. DAFF-Net’s performance represents a 3.2\(\times\) improvement over the No-Change baseline and a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the Market Index baseline in 20-day prediction \(\text {R}^{2}\), confirming that our sophisticated multimodal approach provides meaningful predictive value beyond the most basic strategies. These quantitative results fully demonstrate the superiority of DAFF-Net in financial time series prediction tasks, particularly showcasing unique advantages in handling event-driven market dynamics and complex asset correlation relationships. To more intuitively demonstrate the performance advantages of DAFF-Net relative to various baseline models and deeply analyze the performance differences of different models on multi-time horizon prediction tasks, we conducted comprehensive analysis of experimental results through various visualization methods. First, to clearly compare the prediction errors of all models across different prediction time horizons, we used bar charts to display the comparison results of MSE metrics. MSE comparison bar chart for different models. Several important characteristics can be clearly observed from Fig. 6: First, DAFF-Net achieved the lowest MSE values across all three time horizons, where the yellow bars (1-day MSE), orange bars (5-day MSE), and red bars (20-day MSE) are all significantly lower than all other baseline models, validating the superiority of our method. The inclusion of fundamental baselines (No-Change and Market Index) provides essential context for evaluating model sophistication. These naive baselines achieved MSE values of 0.0312–0.0351 and 0.0298–0.0342 respectively, representing the most basic prediction strategies. Even the traditional ARIMA model substantially outperformed these fundamental approaches, validating the necessity of sophisticated modeling techniques. Second, the MSE values of all models increased significantly with increasing prediction time horizons, which aligns with general rules of time series prediction—long-term prediction is more challenging than short-term prediction. Particularly noteworthy is that the traditional ARIMA model achieved an MSE of 0.0348 for long-term prediction (20-day), almost 1.5 times that of DAFF-Net (0.0228), highlighting the advantages of deep learning methods in handling complex nonlinear relationships. The gaps between deep learning models are more pronounced in long-term prediction, indicating that the importance of architectural design becomes increasingly prominent as prediction difficulty increases. Next, to analyze the trend of each model’s explanatory capability with changing prediction time horizons, we displayed the variation patterns of R2 metrics across different prediction horizons through line charts. R2 score variation trends for different models. Figure 7 reveals the intrinsic patterns of model performance variation with prediction time horizons. From the figure, it can be observed that all models’ R2 scores show a declining trend with increasing prediction time horizons, but the decline magnitudes differ significantly. The fundamental baselines (No-Change and Market Index, represented by the bottom two lines) demonstrate the poorest performance, with R2 scores declining from 0.17 and 0.21 respectively in 1-day prediction to merely 0.08 and 0.13 in 20-day prediction. DAFF-Net (red line) maintained the highest R2 scores across all time horizons, particularly achieving an excellent performance of 0.67 in 1-day prediction, significantly surpassing all other methods. The performance gaps between different model categories become increasingly evident as prediction horizons extend: fundamental baselines plateau at very low R2 values, traditional statistical methods (ARIMA) show steep decline from 0.41 to 0.22, while sophisticated deep learning methods maintain more gradual degradation. DAFF-Net’s decline is remarkably stable, from 0.67 to 0.51, demonstrating superior stability and generalization capability. Notably, the spread between the best and worst performing models expands from 0.50 in 1-day prediction (0.67–0.17) to 0.43 in 20-day prediction (0.51–0.08), indicating that advanced modeling becomes even more critical for longer-horizon forecasting. Finally, to comprehensively evaluate the performance differences between DAFF-Net and major competitors from multiple dimensions, we selected the three best-performing models for radar chart comparison analysis. Comprehensive performance radar chart of DAFF-Net vs. baseline models. Figure 8 displays the performance of the three best models—DAFF-Net, DUET, and MM-LSTM—across six key dimensions through radar chart format. The six axes of the radar chart correspond to MSE-1d, MSE-5d, MSE-20d, R2−1d, R2−5d, and R2−20d respectively, where MSE metrics are transformed by reciprocal to maintain consistent directionality with R2 metrics (larger values indicate better performance). From the chart, it is evident that DAFF-Net (red line) forms the largest coverage area, outperforming or at least equaling the other two baseline models across all six dimensions. Particularly noteworthy is that DAFF-Net’s advantages are most significant in dimensions related to long-term prediction (MSE-20d and R2−20d), which again confirms the effectiveness of our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion mechanisms in handling complex long-term dependencies. DUET (yellow line), as the direct foundation of our work, is surpassed by DAFF-Net in all dimensions, validating the value of our technical improvements. MM-LSTM (orange line), although also adopting multimodal fusion strategies, still lags behind DAFF-Net in performance, indicating that our innovations in fusion mechanism design have substantial improvement effects. Based on the results of the above visualization analysis, we further conducted precise quantitative evaluation of DAFF-Net’s performance improvements. Fundamental baseline validation demonstrates the substantial value of sophisticated modeling: DAFF-Net’s performance represents a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the No-Change baseline and a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the Market Index baseline in 20-day prediction R2 (0.51 vs 0.13), confirming that our multimodal approach provides meaningful predictive value beyond the most basic strategies. Compared to the strongest unimodal baseline DUET, DAFF-Net achieved significant improvements in 1-day prediction tasks with MSE reduction of 15.2% (from 0.0171 to 0.0145) and R2 improvement of 15.5% (from 0.58 to 0.67). In the more challenging 20-day prediction task, the improvement magnitude is even more prominent, with MSE reduction of 12.3% (from 0.0260 to 0.0228) and R2 improvement of 21.4% (from 0.42 to 0.51). Compared to the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net also demonstrated stable performance advantages. In 1-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 10.5% and R2 improved by 9.8%; in 5-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 7.4% and R2 improved by 7.0%; in 20-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 9.2% and R2 improved by 13.3%. These quantitative results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed event-driven temporal pattern extraction and multi-dimensional relationship-aware fusion mechanisms. The hierarchical performance structure revealed by our comprehensive baseline comparison validates the progressive value of modeling sophistication: fundamental baselines (No-Change, Market Index) establish the baseline performance floor; traditional econometric methods (ARIMA) provide moderate improvements; deep learning approaches (LSTM, TCN, Transformer) achieve substantial gains; and multimodal fusion methods (MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net) deliver the highest performance. Crucially, DAFF-Net’s 13.3% improvement over the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM in 20-day prediction demonstrates that sophisticated fusion mechanisms provide meaningful benefits even among advanced multimodal approaches. Particularly worth emphasizing is that DAFF-Net’s relative advantages are more pronounced in long-term prediction, which has important significance for practical financial applications. In quantitative investment and risk management, the ability to accurately predict market trends over longer time horizons is often more valuable than short-term prediction, as it provides more sufficient time windows and more stable strategic foundations for investment decisions. Our experimental results indicate that through effective integration of event information and multi-dimensional relationship information, DAFF-Net can better capture long-term patterns in financial markets, thus having greater potential value in practical applications. To validate the individual contributions of DAFF-Net’s core technical innovations, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies by systematically removing or replacing key components. This analysis demonstrates the necessity and effectiveness of each proposed module. We design six ablation variants to isolate the contribution of each major component: DAFF-Net-NoEvent: Remove the entire event-driven temporal pattern extractor, using only price time series data DAFF-Net-NoRelation: Remove the multi-dimensional relationship-aware module, using only temporal features DAFF-Net-SingleRel: Replace multi-dimensional relationships with frequency-domain relationships only DAFF-Net-HardCluster: Replace soft clustering with hard k-means clustering (k=8) DAFF-Net-NoFusion: Remove contextual factor fusion, using simple concatenation instead DAFF-Net-NoRouter: Replace event-aware router with simple concatenation of events and time series Each ablation variant maintains the same training procedure and hyperparameter settings to ensure fair comparison. Table 8 presents the performance degradation when each component is removed or simplified. The ablation results reveal several important insights about the relative importance of different components: Event-Driven Module (Highest Impact): Removing the event-driven temporal pattern extractor causes the largest performance degradation (10.1% to 15.9% across metrics), confirming that event information provides crucial predictive signals that pure price-based models cannot capture. The impact is particularly pronounced for longer prediction horizons, supporting our hypothesis that events provide valuable information for understanding market narratives. Multi-Dimensional Relationships (Significant Impact): Complete removal of relationship modeling results in 6.1% to 9.9% performance loss, demonstrating the importance of cross-asset information. Interestingly, the relationship module’s contribution is more consistent across prediction horizons compared to the event module. Multi-Dimensional vs. Single-Dimensional Relationships: Using only frequency-domain relationships (DAFF-Net-SingleRel) leads to 3.5% to 5.6% degradation compared to the full multi-dimensional approach. This validates our hypothesis that different relationship types capture complementary information about asset correlations. Soft vs. Hard Clustering: The soft clustering mechanism provides consistent but moderate improvements (2.0% to 4.1%) over hard clustering. While the improvement is smaller than other components, it demonstrates the value of preserving nuanced relationship information. Contextual Factor Fusion: The specialized fusion mechanism contributes 4.8% to 7.6% improvement over simple concatenation, highlighting the importance of carefully designed information integration. Event-Aware Router: The sophisticated event routing provides 3.1% to 5.2% improvement over naive event concatenation, validating the value of learned event-pattern matching. To understand how components interact, we examine cumulative ablation effects (Table 9): The cumulative analysis shows that: (1) Core innovations (event processing + multi-dimensional relationships) contribute 21.6% of total performance; (2) Complete removal of all innovations results in 35.3% performance degradation; (3) The final price-only configuration performs similarly to advanced unimodal baselines like Transformer, validating our baseline comparisons. We observe interesting interaction effects between components: Event-Relationship Synergy: When both event and relationship modules are present, their combined effect (21.6% improvement) exceeds the sum of individual contributions (13.7% + 9.1% = 22.8%), suggesting slight negative interaction. This may indicate some information overlap between event signals and cross-asset relationships. Fusion Mechanism Dependency: The fusion module’s contribution increases when both primary streams are active, indicating that sophisticated fusion becomes more valuable as input complexity increases. This comprehensive ablation study confirms that each proposed component contributes meaningfully to DAFF-Net’s performance, with the event-driven module providing the largest individual benefit and multi-dimensional relationship modeling providing substantial complementary value. To evaluate the generalizability of DAFF-Net beyond the primary Amazon case study, we conducted additional validation experiments on a diverse set of stocks representing different sectors and market characteristics. This cross-asset analysis addresses concerns about sector-specific overfitting and demonstrates the broader applicability of our methodological approach. We selected four representative stocks from distinct sectors to provide comprehensive cross-validation: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ): Healthcare/Pharmaceutical sector, representing defensive value stocks with stable fundamentals and lower volatility JPMorgan Chase (JPM): Financial services sector, exhibiting strong sensitivity to macroeconomic events and interest rate changes ExxonMobil (XOM): Energy sector, characterized by commodity price dependencies and cyclical behavior patterns Tesla (TSLA): Electric vehicle/Technology sector, representing high-growth, high-volatility stocks with strong event-driven characteristics These assets were chosen to span the spectrum of market behaviors: from stable dividend-paying value stocks (JNJ) to highly volatile growth stocks (TSLA), from cyclical commodities exposure (XOM) to interest rate sensitive financials (JPM). Table 10 presents the comparative performance of DAFF-Net against the three strongest baseline models (DUET, MM-LSTM, Transformer) across all five assets for 20-day prediction tasks. The cross-asset validation reveals several important patterns: Consistent Performance Gains: DAFF-Net achieved performance improvements across all five assets, with MSE reductions ranging from 8.5% to 9.7% and \(\text {R}^{2}\) improvements from 10.2% to 15.4% compared to the strongest baseline MM-LSTM. This consistency suggests that our methodological innovations provide robust value across different market segments. Sector-Dependent Improvement Magnitudes: The relative improvements varied by sector characteristics. Energy stock XOM showed the largest \(\text {R}^{2}\) improvement (15.4%), potentially due to the sector’s strong sensitivity to macroeconomic events, which our event-driven approach effectively captures. Healthcare stock JNJ showed more modest improvements (10.2%), consistent with its lower event sensitivity and more stable fundamental-driven behavior. Volatility Adaptation: High-volatility stocks (TSLA, AMZN) and low-volatility stocks (JNJ) both benefited from DAFF-Net, though through different mechanisms. For volatile stocks, the event-driven pattern extraction provided significant value; for stable stocks, the multi-dimensional relationship modeling contributed more substantially. Event Sensitivity Correlation: Assets with higher event sensitivity (TSLA, XOM, AMZN) generally showed larger absolute performance improvements, validating the particular value of our event-aware routing mechanism for event-driven stocks. While these cross-asset results demonstrate promising generalizability, we acknowledge several limitations: (1) the validation remains within large-cap U.S. equities and may not extend to small-cap stocks, international markets, or other asset classes; (2) the 15-year study period, while comprehensive, represents specific market regimes and may not capture all possible market conditions; (3) the computational complexity of full multi-asset deployment remains a practical consideration for broader applications. The experimental results fully demonstrate the significant advantages of DAFF-Net in financial time series prediction tasks. These advantages mainly stem from our innovative breakthroughs at three key technical levels, as shown in Table 11, which presents a comparative analysis of DAFF-Net’s key technical innovations. First, the event-driven temporal pattern extractor achieves an important transition from pure data-driven to event-aware modeling38. Traditional time series prediction models, whether statistical methods like ARIMA33 or deep learning methods like LSTM7 and Transformer9, mainly rely on statistical features of historical price data for modeling. This approach often produces confusion when facing similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes16. For example, sharp stock price declines may stem from poor company performance39, industry policy adjustments, or overall market panic. Although the price performances are similar, their underlying mechanisms and subsequent evolution patterns are completely different. Our event-aware router can effectively distinguish these market patterns that appear similar on the surface but are essentially different by fusing time series data with event vectors40, thereby achieving more precise predictions. This innovation not only brings significant improvements in quantitative metrics but, more importantly, provides a new financial modeling paradigm that organically combines market “narrative logic” with “data logic.” Second, the multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module breaks through the limitations of traditional single-relationship modeling by constructing a more comprehensive and accurate asset correlation network through the fusion of relationships in three dimensions: frequency domain, fundamentals, and knowledge graphs41. Frequency domain relationships capture periodic similarities in price movements, reflecting technical correlations20; fundamental relationships are based on financial indicators and industry classifications, embodying fundamental similarities42; knowledge graph relationships quantify structured business-level connections. This multi-dimensional relationship modeling is not only more theoretically complete but also demonstrates obvious advantages in practice, particularly in capturing market systemic risks and sector rotation effects43. Compared to DUET’s36 single perspective considering only frequency domain relationships, our method can better understand complex market ecosystems, which has important practical significance for portfolio management and risk control. Third, the adoption of soft clustering mechanisms reflects our deep understanding of financial market complexity6. Unlike traditional hard clustering methods’ either-or approach, soft clustering allows assets to have different degrees of membership in multiple groups, which better aligns with actual financial market conditions44. In reality, a technology company may have industry correlations with other tech stocks, may also have connections with retail stocks due to its consumer business, and may form relationships with infrastructure stocks because of its cloud services. The soft clustering mechanism avoids information loss that hard partitioning might cause by preserving these subtle but important weak relationship information, enabling the model to capture market multi-level structures more precisely23. From deep analysis of experimental results, we found that DAFF-Net’s performance advantages are not uniformly distributed but present some interesting and meaningful patterns. The most significant finding is that the model’s relative advantages are more prominent in long-term prediction tasks, which reflects the core value of our technical innovations45. In 1-day prediction tasks, DAFF-Net’s improvement compared to the strongest baseline is approximately 10%, while in 20-day prediction tasks, this improvement magnitude expands to 13.3%. This advantage that amplifies with increasing prediction time horizons indicates that our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion mechanisms have unique capabilities in handling complex long-term dependencies11. Short-term prediction mainly relies on recent price momentum and technical indicators21, while long-term prediction requires understanding deeper market structures and fundamental logic, which is precisely the core advantage of our model design. Further analysis of different types of baseline model performance reveals a clear performance hierarchy. Traditional statistical method ARIMA33 performed worst across all metrics, which aligns with expectations since linear models struggle to capture nonlinear characteristics of financial data1. Unimodal deep learning methods (LSTM7, TCN34, Transformer9) showed moderate performance, with attention mechanism methods slightly outperforming recurrent and convolutional methods, demonstrating the advantages of global dependency modeling. Multimodal methods (MM-LSTM37, DAFF-Net) significantly outperformed unimodal methods, validating the value of multi-source information fusion24. Notably, even within multimodal methods, DAFF-Net significantly outperformed MM-LSTM, indicating that simple feature concatenation or early fusion is insufficient to fully exploit the potential of multimodal data and requires carefully designed fusion mechanisms like ours. From the perspective of different evaluation metrics, DAFF-Net achieved consistent improvements in both MSE and \(\text {R}^{2}\) metrics, indicating that the model’s advantages are comprehensive and stable. MSE as an absolute error metric reflects prediction accuracy; \(\text {R}^{2}\) as a relative metric reflects the model’s ability to explain data variability. Simultaneous improvement in both metrics indicates that DAFF-Net can not only reduce prediction errors but also better understand and explain the intrinsic patterns of financial data. This consistency has important significance for practical applications, as it demonstrates that the model’s improvements are substantial rather than incidental advantages in specific metrics. Table 12 further quantifies this performance improvement across different time horizons, revealing the sources and distribution characteristics of our technical advantages. Despite DAFF-Net’s excellent performance in experiments, we must objectively recognize the limitations of current research, which provide important guidance for future research directions46. First, while we conducted cross-asset validation on five stocks from different sectors, the scope remains limited to large-cap U.S. equities. Our primary analysis focuses on Amazon with supporting validation on four additional stocks (JNJ, JPM, XOM, TSLA). Although choosing Amazon has sufficient reasons (strong market representativeness, rich data, obvious event-driven characteristics), this single-target validation strategy still limits the universality of conclusions. Stocks in different industries have different price behavior characteristics, with significant differences in driving factors between cyclical industries (such as steel and chemicals) and growth industries (such as technology and biotechnology), and vastly different volatility patterns between traditional value stocks and emerging concept stocks13. Therefore, model performance in other asset classes (such as bonds, commodities, foreign exchange) and different market environments (such as emerging markets, small-cap stock markets) still needs further validation. Second, the complexity of technical implementation may affect the actual deployment efficiency of the model. The acquisition, processing, and encoding of event data is relatively complex, requiring real-time monitoring of multiple news sources, announcement platforms, and economic data release channels, which places high demands on data infrastructure and processing capabilities47. The construction and maintenance of knowledge graphs also require professional domain knowledge and continuous updating mechanisms. In comparison, traditional models based on price data are more straightforward to deploy. This technical complexity may limit the application of models in resource-constrained environments, particularly for small and medium-sized investment institutions. From a computational efficiency perspective, DAFF-Net’s multi-branch architecture and complex fusion mechanisms bring additional computational overhead. Although this overhead is acceptable in modern GPU environments, it may become a limiting factor in application scenarios that are extremely sensitive to latency, such as high-frequency trading4. Additionally, although the model’s interpretability has improved compared to pure black-box methods (through event routers and attention mechanisms), it still needs further enhancement in model decision transparency and interpretability for strictly regulated financial environments31. Looking toward future research directions, we believe there are several important development opportunities worth exploring. First is expanding validation scope by applying the model to more asset classes and market environments, constructing large-scale multi-asset prediction systems27. This can not only validate model universality but may also discover cross-asset synergies and systemic risk transmission mechanisms29. Second is technical optimization directions, including developing more efficient event information extraction and encoding methods, exploring lightweight model architectures, and researching incremental learning mechanisms to adapt to dynamic market environment changes. Third is enhancing model interpretability through visualization techniques and factor decomposition methods to make model decision processes more transparent, enhancing user trust and regulatory compliance46. Finally is exploration of practical applications by integrating the model into complete quantitative investment and risk management systems, validating performance and commercial value in real trading environments47. We believe that with in-depth research in these directions, event-driven and relationship-aware financial prediction methods will play increasingly important roles in future intelligent financial systems. While DAFF-Net demonstrates superior predictive performance, practical deployment requires careful consideration of infrastructure requirements, implementation complexity, and cost-benefit trade-offs. This section provides a realistic assessment of deployment challenges and offers scalable implementation strategies for different institutional contexts. Full Implementation Requirements: The complete DAFF-Net system demands substantial technical infrastructure: Real-time Data Pipeline: Continuous ingestion from multiple news feeds (Bloomberg, Reuters, PR Newswire), SEC EDGAR filings, and macroeconomic data sources, requiring robust data streaming architecture and 24/7 monitoring Natural Language Processing Infrastructure: High-performance GPU clusters for real-time BERT encoding of news articles and announcements, with typical latency requirements under 100ms for trading applications Knowledge Graph Maintenance: Quarterly updates requiring domain expertise to verify corporate relationships, supply chain changes, and regulatory reclassifications from multiple authoritative sources Computational Resources: Training infrastructure requiring NVIDIA A100-class GPUs and substantial memory for handling large-scale multimodal datasets Estimated Implementation Costs: Initial setup: \(\$200\text {K}-500\text {K}\) for infrastructure and data subscriptions Annual operational costs: \(\$150\text {K}-300\text {K}\) for data feeds, cloud computing, and maintenance Personnel requirements: 2–3 FTE including ML engineers, data engineers, and domain experts Recognizing that full implementation may be prohibitive for smaller institutions, we propose several graceful degradation strategies that preserve significant portions of DAFF-Net’s performance benefits: Tier 1: Simplified Event Integration Data Sources: Limit events to earnings announcements, major news headlines, and Fed policy statements Processing: Use pre-trained sentence transformers instead of full BERT encoding Update Frequency: Daily batch processing instead of real-time streaming Performance Impact: Retains approximately 80% of full model improvement Cost Reduction: 60–70% lower than full implementation Tier 2: Relationship-Only Implementation Focus: Implement only the multi-dimensional relationship module Data Sources: Use publicly available fundamental data and static knowledge graphs Event Component: Replace with simple sentiment scores from free news APIs Performance Impact: Retains approximately 60% of full model improvement Cost Reduction: 80% lower than full implementation Tier 3: Academic/Research Implementation Data Sources: Historical data only, using archived news and fundamental databases Processing: Offline batch processing suitable for research and backtesting Knowledge Graph: Simplified using Wikipedia/DBpedia relationships Performance Impact: Full research validation capability Cost: Under \(\$10\text {K}\) annually for academic research Phased Implementation Strategy: Phase 1 (Months 1–3): Implement Tier 3 version for backtesting and validation on institutional data Phase 2 (Months 4–6): Upgrade to Tier 2 with live fundamental data and basic event processing Phase 3 (Months 7–12): Full Tier 1 implementation with comprehensive event integration Phase 4 (Year 2+): Optimization and customization for specific use cases Risk Mitigation Strategies: Fallback Mechanisms: Maintain traditional LSTM/Transformer models as backup predictors Data Quality Monitoring: Implement automated data quality checks and anomaly detection Model Validation: Continuous out-of-sample testing and performance monitoring Regulatory Compliance: Ensure all data sources and model decisions meet financial regulatory requirements Large Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {10B}}+ {\textbf {AUM}}\)): Full implementation justified by potential alpha generation exceeding infrastructure costs. Conservative estimate of 0.5–1.5% annual alpha improvement can generate \(\$50-100\)M additional returns, easily justifying \(\$500\)K annual costs. Medium Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {1-10B AUM}}\)): Tier 1 implementation recommended. Estimated 0.3–0.7.3.7% alpha improvement generating \(\$3-70\)M additional returns versus \(\$200\)K annual costs provides strong ROI. Small Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {100M-1B AUM}}\)): Tier 2 implementation most appropriate. Even 0.2–0.4.2.4% alpha improvement generates \(\$200\)K-4M additional returns versus \(\$100\)K costs, maintaining positive ROI. Individual/Retail Investors: Tier 3 implementation suitable for educational purposes and personal portfolio management, with minimal costs and research-focused benefits. To facilitate broader adoption and academic research, we commit to: Open Source Release: Core model architecture and Tier 3 implementation within 6 months of publication Documentation: Comprehensive implementation guides and tutorials API Development: RESTful APIs for simplified integration with existing trading systems Community Support: GitHub repository with active maintenance and community contributions This practical implementation framework demonstrates that while DAFF-Net represents a sophisticated advancement in financial prediction, it can be deployed at various scales and resource levels, making its benefits accessible to a broad range of market participants. This study proposes the Dual-stream Alpha Factor Fusion Network (DAFF-Net), an innovative deep learning framework specifically designed for financial time series prediction tasks. Through the organic combination of an event-driven temporal pattern extractor and a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, DAFF-Net successfully addresses the limitations of traditional financial prediction models in handling complex market narratives and inter-asset correlations. Comprehensive experimental validation on Amazon stock data demonstrates that DAFF-Net significantly outperforms eight representative baseline models including ARIMA, LSTM, Transformer, and DUET across 1-day, 5-day, and 20-day prediction tasks, achieving 7.4%−15.2% improvement in MSE metrics and 7.0%−21.4% enhancement in \(\text {R}^{2}\) metrics compared to the strongest baselines, with particularly outstanding advantages in long-term prediction tasks. These results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of deep fusion of event information with multi-dimensional relationship information, providing new technical pathways and theoretical contributions to the field of financial time series prediction. Although current research still has limitations such as limited data coverage and complex technical implementation, DAFF-Net’s core concepts and technical framework open important directions for the development of quantitative investment, risk management, and intelligent financial systems, with broad application prospects and research value. Future work will focus on expanding model validation in multi-asset and cross-market environments, optimizing computational efficiency and deployment convenience, and further enhancing model interpretability to promote the widespread application of event-driven and relationship-aware financial prediction methods in actual financial business.

Financial time series prediction has consistently been one of the core research problems in the fields of econometrics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence1. Since the introduction of Brownian motion theory and the efficient market hypothesis in the mid-20th century2,3, scholars have been exploring how to accurately predict the price movements of financial assets. With the increasing complexity of global financial markets, accurate financial forecasting can not only provide scientific basis for investment decisions but also help financial institutions conduct effective risk management and asset allocation, and its importance is increasingly prominent. The complexity of today’s financial markets far exceeds the assumptions of traditional theoretical models. The exponential growth in information dissemination speed has changed the fundamental operating mechanisms of markets, and diversified information sources such as social media, news websites, and financial blogs enable market information to spread at unprecedented speeds, significantly shortening investors’ decision-making windows, making market reactions more rapid and prone to overreaction. The proliferation of algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading has fundamentally changed market microstructure4,5. According to statistics, algorithmic trading accounts for over 70% of trading volume in the U.S. stock market, and the interaction of these automated trading systems creates complex feedback mechanisms that traditional market models based on human behavior struggle to accurately describe. The deepening of globalization has further increased the complexity of financial markets6, with the correlation between different markets significantly increased, and volatility in a single market often rapidly transmitting to other global markets through various channels such as trade connections, capital flows, and investor sentiment. In recent years, deep learning technologies have achieved significant progress in the field of time series prediction, with models such as Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM)7, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)8, and Transformers9 demonstrating strong performance across multiple time series forecasting tasks10,11. However, existing methods primarily focus on the statistical properties of time series data itself, often overlooking two key factors that influence financial markets: first, external event information that drives market behavior (such as corporate announcements, macroeconomic events, and market sentiment)12,13, and second, the complex correlations between assets based on multi-dimensional relationships (such as industry relationships, supply chain relationships, competitive relationships, etc.)14,15. This single-perspective modeling approach limits the predictive accuracy and generalization capability of models in complex financial environments. Although existing research has attempted to address the aforementioned problems, there remain obvious research gaps and technical deficiencies. First, traditional time series models cannot distinguish similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes16. For example, the same price decline may stem from poor corporate earnings reports, overall market corrections, or sudden negative events, but existing models often treat them as identical patterns, leading to limited prediction accuracy17. Consider scenarios of sharp stock price declines where surface price behaviors might be completely identical (such as an 8% single-day drop), but the underlying driving factors are entirely different: earnings-driven declines usually accompanied by high trading volume and strong continuation after earnings announcements18,19; systematic risk declines affect entire sectors or even the entire market; technical adjustment declines usually have small trading volume and easily gain support at key technical levels20,21,22. Existing models often treat these essentially different decline patterns as the same “decline signal,” significantly reducing the accuracy of subsequent predictions. Second, existing multimodal fusion methods mostly adopt simple feature concatenation or early fusion strategies, lacking deep modeling of complex interactive relationships between event information and time series data23,24. These methods often directly concatenate different types of feature vectors, ignoring the intrinsic logical relationships between different modal information, and event information and price data differ in temporal granularity and impact duration, making simple alignment methods prone to information loss. Finally, in terms of asset relationship modeling, most methods only consider single-dimensional relationships (such as price correlations or industry classifications), failing to comprehensively capture the multi-dimensional, multi-level complex correlations among financial assets25. The correlations between financial assets are multi-dimensional, multi-level complex networks, but existing methods show obvious simplification tendencies in relationship modeling: most studies only consider price correlation as one dimension, ignoring other important dimensions such as fundamental similarity, business relevance, and supply chain relationships; many models assume that relationships between assets remain static, unable to adapt to relationship evolution caused by changing market environments26; in the few studies that consider multi-dimensional relationships, they often simply assign equal weights to various dimensions, lacking adaptive weight adjustment mechanisms. Beyond theoretical challenges, the development of actual financial business also places higher requirements on prediction models. Modern quantitative investment strategies require models not only to predict direction but also to predict magnitude and duration27, and investors want to understand the logic behind prediction results, especially when facing abnormal market conditions28. The 2008 financial crisis and 2020 pandemic shock demonstrated that traditional risk models based on historical data often fail when facing extreme events29, and financial institutions urgently need prediction tools that can integrate multi-source information and identify systemic risks in advance30. With the strengthening of fintech regulation, applications such as algorithmic trading and robo-advisors must possess certain interpretability31, and model decision-making processes need to be reasonably explained to regulatory agencies and customers. Based on these challenges, this study aims to address the following three key questions: How to effectively fuse event information with time series data, enabling models to understand the intrinsic meaning of price patterns under different event contexts; How to construct multi-dimensional asset relationship networks to more comprehensively capture complex correlations in financial markets; How to design effective fusion mechanisms to achieve deep integration of event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors.” To address the above problems, this paper proposes the Dual-stream Alpha Factor Fusion Network (DAFF-Net), which achieves deep understanding and accurate prediction of financial time series data through the organic combination of an event-driven temporal pattern extractor and a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module. The core innovations of DAFF-Net include: Event-aware routing mechanism: Designed an event-aware router that fuses time series data with contextual event information encoded from news, corporate announcements, and macroeconomic data, enabling the model to understand the underlying narratives behind market fluctuations and effectively distinguish market behavior patterns that appear similar on the surface but are essentially different. Multi-dimensional relationship adaptive fusion: Proposed a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module that constructs a comprehensive asset relationship network more effective than single-relationship methods through adaptive fusion of frequency domain, fundamental, and knowledge graph relationships, capable of dynamically adjusting the importance of different relationship dimensions according to market conditions. Soft clustering attention mechanism: Adopted soft clustering strategies to replace traditional hard clustering methods, preserving fine-grained weak relationship information and avoiding information loss that hard clustering might cause, which is particularly important in complex financial market environments. Dual-stream fusion architecture: Designed an innovative dual-stream fusion framework that achieves deep integration of event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors,” maximizing the synergistic effects of different modal information through carefully designed masked attention mechanisms. The structure of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a detailed introduction to the overall architectural design of DAFF-Net, including the event-driven temporal pattern extractor, multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, and contextual factor fusion with multi-horizon prediction mechanism; Section 3 presents comprehensive experimental validation on Amazon stock data, including dataset construction, baseline model comparisons, and result analysis; Section 4 provides in-depth discussion of the effectiveness of technical innovations, deep interpretation of model performance, and research limitations with future prospects; Section 5 summarizes the main contributions and practical application value of this research. DAFF-Net adopts a dual-stream fusion design philosophy, with its overall architecture shown in Fig. 1. The core idea of this architecture is to decompose the financial time series prediction task into two complementary learning processes: event-driven temporal pattern understanding and multi-dimensional relationship-aware cross-asset information fusion. As shown in the central part of Fig. 1, DAFF-Net receives three types of heterogeneous data inputs. Let the time series data be \(X \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times T \times D}\), where N represents the number of assets, T represents the time window length, and D represents the feature dimension. Event data is represented as \(E \in {\mathbb {R}}^{T \times D_e}\), where \(D_e\) is the event vector dimension. Relationship data includes fundamental information \(F \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_f}\) and knowledge graph structure \(G \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\). After instance normalization processing, the data streams are respectively fed into two parallel feature extraction branches: Left branch (as shown in the left panel of Fig. 1) is the event-driven temporal pattern extractor, which fuses temporal segments with event vectors through an event-aware router: where \({\textbf{h}}_{t} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{(D+D_e)}\) represents the fused representation at time t. Right branch (as shown in the right panel of Fig. 1) is the multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, which generates three types of relationship matrices in parallel. The frequency-domain relationship matrix is computed through fast Fourier transform: The fundamental relationship matrix computes similarity based on structured data: The knowledge graph relationship matrix is directly obtained from the graph structure: These three relationship matrices are integrated through an adaptive fusion module. As shown in the bottom right corner of Fig. 1, fusion weights are learned through a small neural network: The final fused relationship matrix is: where \(\odot\) denotes element-wise multiplication. As shown in the contextual factor fusion module in the center of Fig. 1, the outputs of the two branches are integrated through a masked attention mechanism. The event-aware temporal features \(Z_{\text {temporal}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_h}\) output from the left branch and the channel attention matrix \(A_{\text {channel}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\) output from the right branch are fused as: This fused representation is then passed to the multi-horizon prediction heads, as shown at the top of Fig. 1. The prediction heads consist of multiple feedforward networks that generate predictions for different time spans: where \(h \in \{1, 5, 20\}\) represents the prediction days, and \({\hat{Y}}_{h} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times 1}\) is the corresponding return prediction. Figure 1 clearly shows the information flow of the entire architecture: multimodal inputs at the bottom undergo feature extraction and relationship modeling through two specially designed branches, then achieve deep integration of “narrative factors” and “relationship factors” in the fusion module, and finally output prediction results for different time spans through multi-horizon prediction heads. This design enables DAFF-Net to simultaneously capture event-driven dynamics and complex inter-asset correlations in financial markets, achieving more accurate multi-horizon predictions. Overall architecture diagram of DAFF-Net. Traditional time series models in financial markets often face the “pattern confusion” problem, i.e., inability to distinguish similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes. For example, the same price decline may stem from poor corporate earnings reports, overall market corrections, or sudden negative events, but traditional models often treat them as identical patterns. To address this key problem, we designed an event-driven temporal pattern extractor, whose architecture is shown in the left panel of Fig. 1. The core of this module is the Event-Aware Router, which addresses the critical challenges of multi-source event integration and temporal alignment. Unlike simple concatenation approaches, our router employs a sophisticated event processing pipeline that handles heterogeneous event types with different temporal granularities and impact characteristics. Multi-Source Event Processing We employ BERT-base-uncased32 pre-trained transformer model for encoding textual event information into 768-dimensional dense representations. The BERT model processes concatenated news headlines and lead paragraphs, with maximum sequence length of 512 tokens. We first categorize events into three distinct types based on their market impact patterns and temporal characteristics: where: \(w_{news}, w_{corp}, w_{macro}\) are learnable event type weights \(\text {decay}(t - t_{news})\) models the temporal decay of news impact: \(\exp (-\lambda (t - t_{news}))\) \(\text {impact}(\text {type}_{corp})\) assigns different weights based on announcement types (earnings: 1.0, guidance: 0.8, strategic: 0.6, operational: 0.4) \(\text {persistence}(\text {policy}_{macro})\) captures the lasting effect of macroeconomic policies Temporal Alignment and Weighting To handle the temporal misalignment between high-frequency trading data and irregular event occurrences, we employ an attention-based temporal alignment mechanism: where \(Q_t\) represents the query vector from time series data at time t, \(K_e\) represents the key vector from event e, and \(\text {temporal}\_\text {mask}(t, t_e)\) applies exponential decay based on the time distance between the trading timestamp and event timestamp. Adaptive Event Fusion The final event representation integrates all event types through learned attention weights: where \(\alpha _i\) are dynamically computed attention weights based on current market volatility and \(\text {EventMemory}_{t-1}\) maintains a momentum term from previous significant events. Final Router Input The temporal segment and processed event vector are then fused: Traditional approaches often rely on generic knowledge bases without proper domain adaptation. Our method addresses this limitation through a systematic financial-domain knowledge graph construction process: Financial Entity Mapping We establish explicit mappings from generic knowledge entities to financial assets through: Relationship Strength Quantification Rather than using arbitrary fixed weights, we derive relationship strengths through empirical analysis of market co-movements and fundamental connections: where \(\rho _{*}\) are empirically derived scaling factors based on historical correlation analysis: Dynamic Relationship Updates The knowledge graph relationships are updated quarterly based on: Corporate action announcements (M&A, partnerships, spin-offs) Supply chain relationship changes (supplier/customer updates) Regulatory classification changes (GICS sector reclassifications) Cross-holdings and institutional ownership changes This enhanced event-aware routing mechanism ensures that: Different event types are processed according to their inherent characteristics Temporal misalignments are properly handled through attention mechanisms Event impacts are modeled with realistic decay patterns Knowledge graph relationships reflect actual financial market structures Relationship weights are empirically grounded rather than arbitrary The router matches current market conditions to a set of learnable temporal pattern prototypes \(\{P_1, P_2,\ldots , P_M\}\), where each prototype \(P_i \in {\mathbb {R}}^{D_p}\) represents a specific event-driven market behavior pattern. These prototypes are automatically learned through the training process, with typical patterns including (Table 1): Routing probabilities are computed through attention mechanism: where \(W_r \in {\mathbb {R}}^{(D+D_e) \times D_p}\) is a learnable projection matrix. Based on routing probabilities, the system selects Top-K most relevant Linear-based Pattern Extractors (LPEs). Each extractor \(\text {LPE}_i\) is an expert network specifically designed for particular patterns: The final output is obtained through weighted aggregation: Event-Driven Temporal Pattern Extraction The correlations between financial assets are multi-dimensional and dynamically changing, making it difficult for single relationship modeling methods to comprehensively capture this complexity. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 1, our proposed multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module addresses this problem by generating and fusing three types of relationship views in parallel. To ensure experimental validity and prevent any form of future information leakage, all relationship matrices and model components strictly adhere to temporal constraints. For any prediction at time t, we guarantee that: Frequency-domain relationships are computed using only historical price data from the sliding window \([t-L_{\text {freq}}, t-1]\), where \(L_{\text {freq}} = 60\) trading days: Fundamental relationships utilize only the most recent quarterly financial data available before time t, ensuring no forward-looking bias: Knowledge graph relationships reflect the corporate structure and business relationships as documented up to time \(t-1\), with quarterly updates based on publicly disclosed information: Adaptive fusion weights \(\varvec{\alpha }\) are learned exclusively on the training dataset (2010–2020) and remain frozen during validation (2021–2022) and testing (2023–2025) phases: This temporal discipline ensures that our experimental results reflect genuine predictive capability rather than information leakage artifacts. We verified compliance by re-computing all performance metrics with strict temporal validation protocols. Frequency-domain relationship matrix: Captures periodic similarities in price movements through real Fast Fourier Transform (rFFT): where \({\tilde{X}}_i^H\) denotes the complex conjugate transpose. Fundamental relationship matrix: Computes cosine similarity based on normalized fundamental data: where fundamental features include (Table 2): Knowledge graph relationship matrix: Quantifies structured relationships between entities by processing financial knowledge graphs. We conducted extensive parameter experiments to determine optimal relationship weights, as shown in Table 3. Based on comprehensive parameter experiments across multiple validation periods, the optimal knowledge graph relationship matrix is defined as: The parameter selection was validated through cross-validation on the training set (2010-2020) and confirmed on the validation set (2021-2022), ensuring robust performance across different market conditions (Table 4). The three relationship matrices are dynamically integrated through an adaptive fusion module. Fusion weights are learned through a multilayer perceptron that takes the current market state as input: The fused relationship matrix is: To achieve more robust “soft” clustering, we apply the Softmax function to each row of the fused matrix to generate a channel attention matrix: The advantage of this soft clustering method over hard clustering is that it preserves subtle weak relationship information, which is particularly important in financial markets. Multi-Dimensional Relation-Aware Soft Clustering The contextual factor fusion module is a key component of the DAFF-Net architecture, responsible for deep integration of heterogeneous information from the two branches. As shown in the fusion module at the center of Fig. 1, this module employs a masked attention mechanism: where \(Z_{\text {temporal}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_h}\) is the temporal features from the event-driven branch, and \(A_{\text {channel}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\) is the channel attention matrix from the relationship-aware branch. To enhance feature representation capability, we further introduce residual connections and layer normalization: The final fused representation is obtained through another feedforward network: The multi-horizon prediction heads adopt a design with shared bottom-layer features and independent prediction branches. For each prediction horizon \(h \in \{1, 5, 20\}\), we design independent prediction networks: where the parameters of each prediction head are independently optimized to adapt to the prediction characteristics of different time spans (Table 5). To simultaneously optimize prediction performance across multiple horizons, we adopt a weighted multi-task loss function: where the loss for each horizon is mean squared error: The weights \(\lambda _h\) are set according to prediction difficulty and practical application importance: \(\lambda _1 = 0.5\), \(\lambda _5 = 0.3\), \(\lambda _{20} = 0.2\). Contextual Factor Fusion and Multi-Horizon Prediction This design enables DAFF-Net to effectively integrate event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors,” while providing targeted optimization for prediction tasks across different time spans, thereby achieving excellent performance in multi-horizon financial prediction tasks. This study selects Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock as the primary research subject, based on several important considerations: First, as a global leading technology giant, Amazon’s stock price is subject to complex influences from multiple factors, including changes in company fundamentals, industry technological developments, macroeconomic policies, and market sentiment fluctuations, providing an ideal testing environment for validating our multimodal fusion method; Second, Amazon enjoys extremely high attention in capital markets, with abundant news reports, analyst research reports, and investor discussions, providing sufficient raw materials for constructing high-quality event datasets; Finally, as an important constituent stock of the NASDAQ market, Amazon has complex correlations with other technology stocks, consumer stocks, etc., helping to validate the effectiveness of our multi-dimensional relationship-aware module. We constructed a comprehensive multimodal dataset spanning from January 1, 2010, to May 31, 2025, totaling over 15 years of complete market data. This time span covers multiple important market cycles, including the technology stock recovery period of 2010-2015, the technology stock boom period of 2016-2020, the pandemic shock and recovery period of 2020-2022, and the interest rate hike cycle and artificial intelligence boom period of 2023-2025, ensuring the representativeness of the dataset and the generalization capability of the model. Data sources cover multiple authoritative financial data providers: quantitative trading data is mainly obtained from Yahoo Finance API and Refinitiv Eikon terminals, including daily open, high, low, close prices, volume, and adjusted prices; news and announcement data is collected in real-time through Bloomberg Terminal News Feed, supplemented by relevant reports from mainstream financial media such as Reuters and Wall Street Journal; fundamental data is extracted from Refinitiv and S&P Capital IQ databases, covering financial statements, valuation indicators, and industry classification information. While Amazon (AMZN) serves as our primary prediction target, the multi-dimensional relationship-aware module requires a comprehensive asset universe to construct meaningful N\(\times\)N relationship matrices. We carefully selected a universe of 50 large-cap technology and related stocks to ensure robust relationship modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. Asset Selection Criteria: Market capitalization > $50 billion as of December 2020 Primary listing on NASDAQ or NYSE Technology, consumer discretionary, or communication services sectors (GICS classification) Complete daily trading data availability from 2010–2025 Minimum average daily trading volume > 1 million shares Final Asset Universe (N=50): Core Technology: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, META, NFLX, NVDA, ORCL, CRM, ADBE, INTC, AMD, CSCO, AVGO, QCOM, TXN E-commerce & Consumer: AMZN, EBAY, SHOP, ETSY, WMT, TGT, COST, HD, NKE Cloud & Software: SNOW, PLTR, ZM, WORK, DDOG, NET, OKTA, MDB, CRWD Communication: VZ, T, TMUS, CHTR, CMCSA, DIS, NFLX Related Technology: TSLA, UBER, LYFT, SQ, PYPL, V, MA Temporal Data Handling: All 50 assets follow identical temporal splits: Training period: 2010–2020 (all assets) Validation period: 2021–2022 (all assets) Testing period: 2023–2025 (all assets) Missing data: Forward-fill for gaps \(\le\) 3 days, exclude assets with >5% missing data in any period Delisting handling: Assets delisted during study period are excluded from the relationship matrices after delisting date Relationship Matrix Computation: For frequency-domain and fundamental relationships, we compute pairwise similarities across all 50 assets, resulting in symmetric 50\(\times\)50 matrices. For knowledge graph relationships, we manually verified and annotated business relationships among these 50 entities using SEC 10-K filings, partnership announcements, and industry databases. The Amazon prediction task extracts the relevant row/column from these matrices corresponding to AMZN’s relationships with the other 49 assets. This design ensures that AMZN’s relationship modeling benefits from a rich, diverse set of comparable assets while maintaining strict temporal discipline across the entire universe. Knowledge Graph Construction and Domain Mapping Knowledge graph data construction involves a systematic process of mapping general knowledge bases to financial domain entities. We established comprehensive mappings through the following multi-step procedure: Step 1: Entity Identification and Mapping We constructed a mapping table linking general knowledge entities to financial assets through multiple identification mechanisms: Primary Mapping: Direct ticker symbol matching (e.g., DBpedia:Amazon.com \(\rightarrow\) NASDAQ:AMZN) Secondary Mapping: Company name disambiguation using ISIN codes and official registrations Tertiary Mapping: Cross-reference validation through multiple knowledge bases (DBpedia, Wikidata, OpenCorporates) Step 2: Relationship Extraction and Validation From the mapped entities, we extract structured relationships using SPARQL queries and natural language processing: Direct Business Relations: Partnership agreements, joint ventures, strategic alliances extracted from SEC filings and corporate announcements Ownership Structures: Parent-subsidiary relationships from corporate registrations and 10-K filings Supply Chain Networks: Customer-supplier relationships from business dependency disclosures Industry Classifications: GICS sector mappings validated against multiple classification systems (SIC, NAICS, ICB) Step 3: Relationship Strength Quantification We quantify relationship strengths through empirical analysis of historical market co-movements and fundamental connections, as detailed in Table 6. Step 4: Dynamic Relationship Updates The knowledge graph undergoes quarterly updates to reflect corporate actions and market structure changes: Corporate Actions: M&A announcements, spin-offs, and restructuring events Partnership Changes: New strategic alliances and partnership dissolutions Supply Chain Evolution: Customer/supplier relationship updates from annual reports Regulatory Reclassifications: GICS sector changes and industry standard updates This systematic approach ensures that our knowledge graph accurately reflects the evolving landscape of financial market relationships while maintaining high data quality and validation standards. The mapping process achieved 96.1% validation rate across all entity types, providing a robust foundation for relationship-aware modeling. To comprehensively understand the market behavior characteristics of Amazon stock and provide a basis for model design, we first conducted a detailed analysis of the price time series. Amazon stock price time series (2010-2025). As shown in Fig. 2, Amazon stock exhibited typical growth stock characteristics during the study period, with an overall price trend showing strong upward momentum. Several important phase characteristics can be clearly observed from Fig. 2: During 2010-2012, stock prices fluctuated at relatively low levels, with the price range mainly between \(\$5-25\), reflecting the company’s early market positioning and investor expectations; During 2013-2017, stock prices began to rise significantly, climbing from about \(\$25\) to nearly \(\$100\), corresponding to the rapid development of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and global expansion of e-commerce business; During 2018-2021, stock prices experienced more dramatic volatility, reaching a high of about \(\$180\) during the 2020 pandemic, followed by a significant pullback in 2022 with lows around \(\$80\), reflecting market reassessment of technology stock valuations; Since 2023, stock prices have rebounded strongly again, creating new highs in 2024 exceeding \(\$240\), mainly benefiting from artificial intelligence technology breakthroughs and optimistic market expectations for AI application prospects. To further understand market participation and liquidity characteristics, we analyzed the trading volume change patterns during the corresponding period, which is important for assessing the credibility of price fluctuations and market depth. Amazon stock trading volume time series (2010-2025). Figure 3 shows the trading volume change patterns during the corresponding period, providing important supplementary information for understanding market participation and price volatility. Several significant characteristics can be observed from the trading volume data in Fig. 3: First, trading volume typically shows significant amplification during major events, particularly during the initial outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020 and the market adjustment period in the second half of 2022, with daily trading volumes often exceeding 600–800 million shares, far above the normal level of 200–400 million shares; Second, the seasonal patterns of trading volume are relatively stable, usually increasing during earnings report seasons (January, April, July, October each year) and year-end/year-beginning periods; Finally, overall trading volume levels have increased in recent years with the proliferation of algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading, reflecting the evolution of market microstructure. Considering the important role of technical analysis in financial prediction, we need to examine price performance relative to key technical indicators to identify important trend signals and support/resistance levels, which will provide valuable learning targets for our temporal pattern extractor. Amazon stock price vs. moving averages comparison. Figure 4 further demonstrates the relationship between price and technical indicators. By comparing closing prices with 50-day and 200-day moving averages, we can identify important trend reversal points and technical signals. Fig. 4 clearly shows several important technical breakthroughs: the upward breakthrough of 50-day and 200-day moving averages in early 2013, marking the establishment of a long-term uptrend; two technical adjustments in late 2018 and early 2022, where stock prices fell below short-term moving averages but ultimately received support from long-term trend lines; the strong breakthrough in the second half of 2023, where stock prices regained footing above all major moving averages. These technical characteristics provide rich learning samples for our temporal pattern extractor. Finally, to understand the statistical distribution characteristics of returns and validate the necessity of extreme event handling in our model design, we analyzed the probability distribution characteristics of daily returns. Amazon stock daily returns distribution histogram. The daily returns distribution histogram in Fig. 5 reveals the statistical characteristics of Amazon stock returns, showing typical “fat-tailed” distribution characteristics of financial time series. From Fig. 5, it can be seen that the distribution center is close to zero, consistent with efficient market hypothesis expectations, but compared to standard normal distribution, this distribution shows obvious excess kurtosis and thicker tails. Specifically, about 68% of daily returns are concentrated in the −2% to +2% range, about 95% of observations are between −6% to +6%, but there are still considerable extreme values exceeding the expected range of normal distribution. This distribution characteristic indicates that financial markets have relatively frequent extreme events, validating the necessity of considering event-driven factors in our model design. To ensure experimental rigor and result reliability, we adopted a strict time series data partitioning strategy to avoid any form of future information leakage. The specific partitioning scheme is: the training set covers January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2020, totaling 11 years of historical data, providing sufficient learning samples for the model; the validation set is set from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2022, totaling 2 years of data, used for hyperparameter tuning and model selection; the test set includes January 1, 2023, to May 31, 2025, approximately 2.5 years of the latest data, used to evaluate model generalization performance in actual application scenarios. This partitioning design has important practical significance: the training set time span is sufficiently long, covering multiple complete market cycles, ensuring the model can learn patterns under various market conditions; the validation set corresponds to the post-pandemic market environment, including new market characteristics such as monetary policy shifts and rising inflation pressures, helping the model adapt to environmental changes; the test set is entirely in the period after model training, including unprecedented market events such as the latest interest rate hike cycle and AI technology breakthroughs, providing a severe test for evaluating the model’s true predictive capability. In the data preprocessing stage, we applied corresponding standardization methods for different types of data: price data was transformed through log returns to eliminate the effect of price levels; fundamental data used rolling Z-score standardization, maintaining temporal characteristics while eliminating dimensional differences; event data was encoded into fixed-dimension vector representations through pre-trained BERT models; relationship data was normalized to ensure comparability across different relationship types. These preprocessing steps laid a solid foundation for subsequent model training and evaluation. To comprehensively evaluate the performance advantages of DAFF-Net, we carefully selected eight representative baseline models that cover the complete spectrum from traditional statistical methods to the latest deep learning techniques, providing thorough validation of our method’s effectiveness and advancement. Traditional statistical models: We selected ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)33 as the representative of classical time series prediction methods. ARIMA has good theoretical foundations and interpretability, is widely applied in financial time series prediction, and provides an important benchmark for evaluating the improvement magnitude of deep learning methods. Classical deep learning models: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)7 as a representative of recurrent neural networks, can effectively handle long sequence dependencies and is a classical method in the time series prediction domain. TCN (Temporal Convolutional Network)34 adopts causal convolution design, has advantages in parallel training and good long-term dependency modeling capability, representing the application of convolutional neural networks in time series prediction. Attention mechanism models: Transformer9 as the pioneering work of attention mechanisms, achieves direct modeling of relationships between arbitrary positions in sequences through global self-attention mechanisms. Informer35 introduces sparse attention mechanisms based on Transformer, specifically optimized for long sequence prediction tasks, improving computational efficiency. Multimodal and relationship modeling methods: DUET36 as the direct foundation of our work, adopts dual clustering mechanisms to model in temporal and channel dimensions respectively, representing advanced methods in current time series prediction. MM-LSTM (Multimodal LSTM)37 fuses multiple data sources into the LSTM framework, providing baseline reference for multimodal time series prediction. Simple decision-focused baselines: To establish fundamental performance benchmarks, we include two essential naive baselines that represent the most basic prediction strategies. The No-Change baseline assumes that stock returns will be zero for all prediction horizons, representing the null hypothesis that prices follow a random walk without predictable drift. The Market Index baseline predicts individual stock returns based on the historical beta relationship with the NASDAQ-100 index: where \(\beta _{AMZN}\) is estimated using a 252-day rolling window of historical returns prior to the prediction date. This baseline represents a simple factor model approach commonly used in practical finance. These fundamental baselines are essential for validating that sophisticated models provide meaningful improvements over the most basic prediction strategies. All baseline models adopt the same data partitioning strategy and evaluation metrics, ensuring experimental fairness. Hyperparameters were optimized through grid search on the validation set, with each model achieving its optimal configuration. To comprehensively evaluate model prediction performance across different time spans, we adopted two complementary evaluation metrics. Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the primary metric can effectively measure the deviation between predicted and true values, is sensitive to outliers, and meets the needs of financial risk management. Coefficient of determination (\(\text {R}^{2}\)) as an auxiliary metric reflects the model’s ability to explain data variability and facilitates understanding of relative model performance. We set three prediction time spans: 1-day, 5-day, and 20-day, corresponding to the practical needs of short-term trading, medium-term investment, and long-term allocation respectively. This multi-horizon setup can comprehensively evaluate model generalization capability under different prediction difficulties. To ensure result reliability, all experiments were conducted in the same hardware environment using the same random seeds and training strategies. Each model was fully trained until convergence and evaluated on the test set for final assessment. Several important trends can be observed from the quantitative results in Table 7: Overall performance ranking: DAFF-Net achieved the best performance across all evaluation metrics, validating the effectiveness of our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion approach. Multimodal methods (MM-LSTM and DAFF-Net) significantly outperformed unimodal methods, demonstrating the importance of multi-source information fusion. Among unimodal methods, DUET as the most advanced baseline performed best, proving the value of the dual clustering concept. Prediction difficulty analysis: The performance of all models declined as the prediction time span increased, which aligns with general rules of financial prediction. Interestingly, DAFF-Net’s relative advantage is more pronounced in long-term prediction (20-day), with \(\text {R}^{2}\) reaching 0.51, while the strongest baseline MM-LSTM only achieved 0.45, representing a relative improvement of 13.3%. This indicates that our method has significant advantages in handling complex long-term dependencies. Method type comparison: Traditional statistical method ARIMA performed worst across all metrics, reflecting the limitations of linear methods in handling complex financial data. Deep learning methods generally outperformed statistical methods, with attention mechanism methods (Transformer, Informer) outperforming traditional recurrent and convolutional methods, demonstrating the advantages of attention mechanisms in capturing long-term dependencies. Relative improvement magnitude: Compared to the strongest unimodal baseline DUET, DAFF-Net reduced MSE by 15.2% (from 0.0171 to 0.0145) and improved \(\text {R}^{2}\) by 15.5% (from 0.58 to 0.67) in 1-day prediction. Compared to the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net reduced MSE by 10.5% and improved \(\text {R}^{2}\) by 9.8% in 1-day prediction, proving our technical innovation in multimodal fusion. Fundamental baseline validation: The inclusion of naive baselines provides essential context for evaluating model sophistication. The No-Change baseline achieved \(\text {R}^{2}\) scores of 0.17, 0.12, and 0.08 across the three prediction horizons, representing the null hypothesis performance. The Market Index baseline, utilizing beta-adjusted market returns, improved to \(\text {R}^{2}\) scores of 0.21, 0.18, and 0.13, demonstrating the value of incorporating systematic market factors. Notably, even the traditional ARIMA model substantially outperformed these fundamental baselines, validating the necessity of time series modeling techniques. DAFF-Net’s performance represents a 3.2\(\times\) improvement over the No-Change baseline and a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the Market Index baseline in 20-day prediction \(\text {R}^{2}\), confirming that our sophisticated multimodal approach provides meaningful predictive value beyond the most basic strategies. These quantitative results fully demonstrate the superiority of DAFF-Net in financial time series prediction tasks, particularly showcasing unique advantages in handling event-driven market dynamics and complex asset correlation relationships. To more intuitively demonstrate the performance advantages of DAFF-Net relative to various baseline models and deeply analyze the performance differences of different models on multi-time horizon prediction tasks, we conducted comprehensive analysis of experimental results through various visualization methods. First, to clearly compare the prediction errors of all models across different prediction time horizons, we used bar charts to display the comparison results of MSE metrics. MSE comparison bar chart for different models. Several important characteristics can be clearly observed from Fig. 6: First, DAFF-Net achieved the lowest MSE values across all three time horizons, where the yellow bars (1-day MSE), orange bars (5-day MSE), and red bars (20-day MSE) are all significantly lower than all other baseline models, validating the superiority of our method. The inclusion of fundamental baselines (No-Change and Market Index) provides essential context for evaluating model sophistication. These naive baselines achieved MSE values of 0.0312–0.0351 and 0.0298–0.0342 respectively, representing the most basic prediction strategies. Even the traditional ARIMA model substantially outperformed these fundamental approaches, validating the necessity of sophisticated modeling techniques. Second, the MSE values of all models increased significantly with increasing prediction time horizons, which aligns with general rules of time series prediction—long-term prediction is more challenging than short-term prediction. Particularly noteworthy is that the traditional ARIMA model achieved an MSE of 0.0348 for long-term prediction (20-day), almost 1.5 times that of DAFF-Net (0.0228), highlighting the advantages of deep learning methods in handling complex nonlinear relationships. The gaps between deep learning models are more pronounced in long-term prediction, indicating that the importance of architectural design becomes increasingly prominent as prediction difficulty increases. Next, to analyze the trend of each model’s explanatory capability with changing prediction time horizons, we displayed the variation patterns of R2 metrics across different prediction horizons through line charts. R2 score variation trends for different models. Figure 7 reveals the intrinsic patterns of model performance variation with prediction time horizons. From the figure, it can be observed that all models’ R2 scores show a declining trend with increasing prediction time horizons, but the decline magnitudes differ significantly. The fundamental baselines (No-Change and Market Index, represented by the bottom two lines) demonstrate the poorest performance, with R2 scores declining from 0.17 and 0.21 respectively in 1-day prediction to merely 0.08 and 0.13 in 20-day prediction. DAFF-Net (red line) maintained the highest R2 scores across all time horizons, particularly achieving an excellent performance of 0.67 in 1-day prediction, significantly surpassing all other methods. The performance gaps between different model categories become increasingly evident as prediction horizons extend: fundamental baselines plateau at very low R2 values, traditional statistical methods (ARIMA) show steep decline from 0.41 to 0.22, while sophisticated deep learning methods maintain more gradual degradation. DAFF-Net’s decline is remarkably stable, from 0.67 to 0.51, demonstrating superior stability and generalization capability. Notably, the spread between the best and worst performing models expands from 0.50 in 1-day prediction (0.67–0.17) to 0.43 in 20-day prediction (0.51–0.08), indicating that advanced modeling becomes even more critical for longer-horizon forecasting. Finally, to comprehensively evaluate the performance differences between DAFF-Net and major competitors from multiple dimensions, we selected the three best-performing models for radar chart comparison analysis. Comprehensive performance radar chart of DAFF-Net vs. baseline models. Figure 8 displays the performance of the three best models—DAFF-Net, DUET, and MM-LSTM—across six key dimensions through radar chart format. The six axes of the radar chart correspond to MSE-1d, MSE-5d, MSE-20d, R2−1d, R2−5d, and R2−20d respectively, where MSE metrics are transformed by reciprocal to maintain consistent directionality with R2 metrics (larger values indicate better performance). From the chart, it is evident that DAFF-Net (red line) forms the largest coverage area, outperforming or at least equaling the other two baseline models across all six dimensions. Particularly noteworthy is that DAFF-Net’s advantages are most significant in dimensions related to long-term prediction (MSE-20d and R2−20d), which again confirms the effectiveness of our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion mechanisms in handling complex long-term dependencies. DUET (yellow line), as the direct foundation of our work, is surpassed by DAFF-Net in all dimensions, validating the value of our technical improvements. MM-LSTM (orange line), although also adopting multimodal fusion strategies, still lags behind DAFF-Net in performance, indicating that our innovations in fusion mechanism design have substantial improvement effects. Based on the results of the above visualization analysis, we further conducted precise quantitative evaluation of DAFF-Net’s performance improvements. Fundamental baseline validation demonstrates the substantial value of sophisticated modeling: DAFF-Net’s performance represents a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the No-Change baseline and a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the Market Index baseline in 20-day prediction R2 (0.51 vs 0.13), confirming that our multimodal approach provides meaningful predictive value beyond the most basic strategies. Compared to the strongest unimodal baseline DUET, DAFF-Net achieved significant improvements in 1-day prediction tasks with MSE reduction of 15.2% (from 0.0171 to 0.0145) and R2 improvement of 15.5% (from 0.58 to 0.67). In the more challenging 20-day prediction task, the improvement magnitude is even more prominent, with MSE reduction of 12.3% (from 0.0260 to 0.0228) and R2 improvement of 21.4% (from 0.42 to 0.51). Compared to the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net also demonstrated stable performance advantages. In 1-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 10.5% and R2 improved by 9.8%; in 5-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 7.4% and R2 improved by 7.0%; in 20-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 9.2% and R2 improved by 13.3%. These quantitative results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed event-driven temporal pattern extraction and multi-dimensional relationship-aware fusion mechanisms. The hierarchical performance structure revealed by our comprehensive baseline comparison validates the progressive value of modeling sophistication: fundamental baselines (No-Change, Market Index) establish the baseline performance floor; traditional econometric methods (ARIMA) provide moderate improvements; deep learning approaches (LSTM, TCN, Transformer) achieve substantial gains; and multimodal fusion methods (MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net) deliver the highest performance. Crucially, DAFF-Net’s 13.3% improvement over the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM in 20-day prediction demonstrates that sophisticated fusion mechanisms provide meaningful benefits even among advanced multimodal approaches. Particularly worth emphasizing is that DAFF-Net’s relative advantages are more pronounced in long-term prediction, which has important significance for practical financial applications. In quantitative investment and risk management, the ability to accurately predict market trends over longer time horizons is often more valuable than short-term prediction, as it provides more sufficient time windows and more stable strategic foundations for investment decisions. Our experimental results indicate that through effective integration of event information and multi-dimensional relationship information, DAFF-Net can better capture long-term patterns in financial markets, thus having greater potential value in practical applications. To validate the individual contributions of DAFF-Net’s core technical innovations, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies by systematically removing or replacing key components. This analysis demonstrates the necessity and effectiveness of each proposed module. We design six ablation variants to isolate the contribution of each major component: DAFF-Net-NoEvent: Remove the entire event-driven temporal pattern extractor, using only price time series data DAFF-Net-NoRelation: Remove the multi-dimensional relationship-aware module, using only temporal features DAFF-Net-SingleRel: Replace multi-dimensional relationships with frequency-domain relationships only DAFF-Net-HardCluster: Replace soft clustering with hard k-means clustering (k=8) DAFF-Net-NoFusion: Remove contextual factor fusion, using simple concatenation instead DAFF-Net-NoRouter: Replace event-aware router with simple concatenation of events and time series Each ablation variant maintains the same training procedure and hyperparameter settings to ensure fair comparison. Table 8 presents the performance degradation when each component is removed or simplified. The ablation results reveal several important insights about the relative importance of different components: Event-Driven Module (Highest Impact): Removing the event-driven temporal pattern extractor causes the largest performance degradation (10.1% to 15.9% across metrics), confirming that event information provides crucial predictive signals that pure price-based models cannot capture. The impact is particularly pronounced for longer prediction horizons, supporting our hypothesis that events provide valuable information for understanding market narratives. Multi-Dimensional Relationships (Significant Impact): Complete removal of relationship modeling results in 6.1% to 9.9% performance loss, demonstrating the importance of cross-asset information. Interestingly, the relationship module’s contribution is more consistent across prediction horizons compared to the event module. Multi-Dimensional vs. Single-Dimensional Relationships: Using only frequency-domain relationships (DAFF-Net-SingleRel) leads to 3.5% to 5.6% degradation compared to the full multi-dimensional approach. This validates our hypothesis that different relationship types capture complementary information about asset correlations. Soft vs. Hard Clustering: The soft clustering mechanism provides consistent but moderate improvements (2.0% to 4.1%) over hard clustering. While the improvement is smaller than other components, it demonstrates the value of preserving nuanced relationship information. Contextual Factor Fusion: The specialized fusion mechanism contributes 4.8% to 7.6% improvement over simple concatenation, highlighting the importance of carefully designed information integration. Event-Aware Router: The sophisticated event routing provides 3.1% to 5.2% improvement over naive event concatenation, validating the value of learned event-pattern matching. To understand how components interact, we examine cumulative ablation effects (Table 9): The cumulative analysis shows that: (1) Core innovations (event processing + multi-dimensional relationships) contribute 21.6% of total performance; (2) Complete removal of all innovations results in 35.3% performance degradation; (3) The final price-only configuration performs similarly to advanced unimodal baselines like Transformer, validating our baseline comparisons. We observe interesting interaction effects between components: Event-Relationship Synergy: When both event and relationship modules are present, their combined effect (21.6% improvement) exceeds the sum of individual contributions (13.7% + 9.1% = 22.8%), suggesting slight negative interaction. This may indicate some information overlap between event signals and cross-asset relationships. Fusion Mechanism Dependency: The fusion module’s contribution increases when both primary streams are active, indicating that sophisticated fusion becomes more valuable as input complexity increases. This comprehensive ablation study confirms that each proposed component contributes meaningfully to DAFF-Net’s performance, with the event-driven module providing the largest individual benefit and multi-dimensional relationship modeling providing substantial complementary value. To evaluate the generalizability of DAFF-Net beyond the primary Amazon case study, we conducted additional validation experiments on a diverse set of stocks representing different sectors and market characteristics. This cross-asset analysis addresses concerns about sector-specific overfitting and demonstrates the broader applicability of our methodological approach. We selected four representative stocks from distinct sectors to provide comprehensive cross-validation: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ): Healthcare/Pharmaceutical sector, representing defensive value stocks with stable fundamentals and lower volatility JPMorgan Chase (JPM): Financial services sector, exhibiting strong sensitivity to macroeconomic events and interest rate changes ExxonMobil (XOM): Energy sector, characterized by commodity price dependencies and cyclical behavior patterns Tesla (TSLA): Electric vehicle/Technology sector, representing high-growth, high-volatility stocks with strong event-driven characteristics These assets were chosen to span the spectrum of market behaviors: from stable dividend-paying value stocks (JNJ) to highly volatile growth stocks (TSLA), from cyclical commodities exposure (XOM) to interest rate sensitive financials (JPM). Table 10 presents the comparative performance of DAFF-Net against the three strongest baseline models (DUET, MM-LSTM, Transformer) across all five assets for 20-day prediction tasks. The cross-asset validation reveals several important patterns: Consistent Performance Gains: DAFF-Net achieved performance improvements across all five assets, with MSE reductions ranging from 8.5% to 9.7% and \(\text {R}^{2}\) improvements from 10.2% to 15.4% compared to the strongest baseline MM-LSTM. This consistency suggests that our methodological innovations provide robust value across different market segments. Sector-Dependent Improvement Magnitudes: The relative improvements varied by sector characteristics. Energy stock XOM showed the largest \(\text {R}^{2}\) improvement (15.4%), potentially due to the sector’s strong sensitivity to macroeconomic events, which our event-driven approach effectively captures. Healthcare stock JNJ showed more modest improvements (10.2%), consistent with its lower event sensitivity and more stable fundamental-driven behavior. Volatility Adaptation: High-volatility stocks (TSLA, AMZN) and low-volatility stocks (JNJ) both benefited from DAFF-Net, though through different mechanisms. For volatile stocks, the event-driven pattern extraction provided significant value; for stable stocks, the multi-dimensional relationship modeling contributed more substantially. Event Sensitivity Correlation: Assets with higher event sensitivity (TSLA, XOM, AMZN) generally showed larger absolute performance improvements, validating the particular value of our event-aware routing mechanism for event-driven stocks. While these cross-asset results demonstrate promising generalizability, we acknowledge several limitations: (1) the validation remains within large-cap U.S. equities and may not extend to small-cap stocks, international markets, or other asset classes; (2) the 15-year study period, while comprehensive, represents specific market regimes and may not capture all possible market conditions; (3) the computational complexity of full multi-asset deployment remains a practical consideration for broader applications. The experimental results fully demonstrate the significant advantages of DAFF-Net in financial time series prediction tasks. These advantages mainly stem from our innovative breakthroughs at three key technical levels, as shown in Table 11, which presents a comparative analysis of DAFF-Net’s key technical innovations. First, the event-driven temporal pattern extractor achieves an important transition from pure data-driven to event-aware modeling38. Traditional time series prediction models, whether statistical methods like ARIMA33 or deep learning methods like LSTM7 and Transformer9, mainly rely on statistical features of historical price data for modeling. This approach often produces confusion when facing similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes16. For example, sharp stock price declines may stem from poor company performance39, industry policy adjustments, or overall market panic. Although the price performances are similar, their underlying mechanisms and subsequent evolution patterns are completely different. Our event-aware router can effectively distinguish these market patterns that appear similar on the surface but are essentially different by fusing time series data with event vectors40, thereby achieving more precise predictions. This innovation not only brings significant improvements in quantitative metrics but, more importantly, provides a new financial modeling paradigm that organically combines market “narrative logic” with “data logic.” Second, the multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module breaks through the limitations of traditional single-relationship modeling by constructing a more comprehensive and accurate asset correlation network through the fusion of relationships in three dimensions: frequency domain, fundamentals, and knowledge graphs41. Frequency domain relationships capture periodic similarities in price movements, reflecting technical correlations20; fundamental relationships are based on financial indicators and industry classifications, embodying fundamental similarities42; knowledge graph relationships quantify structured business-level connections. This multi-dimensional relationship modeling is not only more theoretically complete but also demonstrates obvious advantages in practice, particularly in capturing market systemic risks and sector rotation effects43. Compared to DUET’s36 single perspective considering only frequency domain relationships, our method can better understand complex market ecosystems, which has important practical significance for portfolio management and risk control. Third, the adoption of soft clustering mechanisms reflects our deep understanding of financial market complexity6. Unlike traditional hard clustering methods’ either-or approach, soft clustering allows assets to have different degrees of membership in multiple groups, which better aligns with actual financial market conditions44. In reality, a technology company may have industry correlations with other tech stocks, may also have connections with retail stocks due to its consumer business, and may form relationships with infrastructure stocks because of its cloud services. The soft clustering mechanism avoids information loss that hard partitioning might cause by preserving these subtle but important weak relationship information, enabling the model to capture market multi-level structures more precisely23. From deep analysis of experimental results, we found that DAFF-Net’s performance advantages are not uniformly distributed but present some interesting and meaningful patterns. The most significant finding is that the model’s relative advantages are more prominent in long-term prediction tasks, which reflects the core value of our technical innovations45. In 1-day prediction tasks, DAFF-Net’s improvement compared to the strongest baseline is approximately 10%, while in 20-day prediction tasks, this improvement magnitude expands to 13.3%. This advantage that amplifies with increasing prediction time horizons indicates that our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion mechanisms have unique capabilities in handling complex long-term dependencies11. Short-term prediction mainly relies on recent price momentum and technical indicators21, while long-term prediction requires understanding deeper market structures and fundamental logic, which is precisely the core advantage of our model design. Further analysis of different types of baseline model performance reveals a clear performance hierarchy. Traditional statistical method ARIMA33 performed worst across all metrics, which aligns with expectations since linear models struggle to capture nonlinear characteristics of financial data1. Unimodal deep learning methods (LSTM7, TCN34, Transformer9) showed moderate performance, with attention mechanism methods slightly outperforming recurrent and convolutional methods, demonstrating the advantages of global dependency modeling. Multimodal methods (MM-LSTM37, DAFF-Net) significantly outperformed unimodal methods, validating the value of multi-source information fusion24. Notably, even within multimodal methods, DAFF-Net significantly outperformed MM-LSTM, indicating that simple feature concatenation or early fusion is insufficient to fully exploit the potential of multimodal data and requires carefully designed fusion mechanisms like ours. From the perspective of different evaluation metrics, DAFF-Net achieved consistent improvements in both MSE and \(\text {R}^{2}\) metrics, indicating that the model’s advantages are comprehensive and stable. MSE as an absolute error metric reflects prediction accuracy; \(\text {R}^{2}\) as a relative metric reflects the model’s ability to explain data variability. Simultaneous improvement in both metrics indicates that DAFF-Net can not only reduce prediction errors but also better understand and explain the intrinsic patterns of financial data. This consistency has important significance for practical applications, as it demonstrates that the model’s improvements are substantial rather than incidental advantages in specific metrics. Table 12 further quantifies this performance improvement across different time horizons, revealing the sources and distribution characteristics of our technical advantages. Despite DAFF-Net’s excellent performance in experiments, we must objectively recognize the limitations of current research, which provide important guidance for future research directions46. First, while we conducted cross-asset validation on five stocks from different sectors, the scope remains limited to large-cap U.S. equities. Our primary analysis focuses on Amazon with supporting validation on four additional stocks (JNJ, JPM, XOM, TSLA). Although choosing Amazon has sufficient reasons (strong market representativeness, rich data, obvious event-driven characteristics), this single-target validation strategy still limits the universality of conclusions. Stocks in different industries have different price behavior characteristics, with significant differences in driving factors between cyclical industries (such as steel and chemicals) and growth industries (such as technology and biotechnology), and vastly different volatility patterns between traditional value stocks and emerging concept stocks13. Therefore, model performance in other asset classes (such as bonds, commodities, foreign exchange) and different market environments (such as emerging markets, small-cap stock markets) still needs further validation. Second, the complexity of technical implementation may affect the actual deployment efficiency of the model. The acquisition, processing, and encoding of event data is relatively complex, requiring real-time monitoring of multiple news sources, announcement platforms, and economic data release channels, which places high demands on data infrastructure and processing capabilities47. The construction and maintenance of knowledge graphs also require professional domain knowledge and continuous updating mechanisms. In comparison, traditional models based on price data are more straightforward to deploy. This technical complexity may limit the application of models in resource-constrained environments, particularly for small and medium-sized investment institutions. From a computational efficiency perspective, DAFF-Net’s multi-branch architecture and complex fusion mechanisms bring additional computational overhead. Although this overhead is acceptable in modern GPU environments, it may become a limiting factor in application scenarios that are extremely sensitive to latency, such as high-frequency trading4. Additionally, although the model’s interpretability has improved compared to pure black-box methods (through event routers and attention mechanisms), it still needs further enhancement in model decision transparency and interpretability for strictly regulated financial environments31. Looking toward future research directions, we believe there are several important development opportunities worth exploring. First is expanding validation scope by applying the model to more asset classes and market environments, constructing large-scale multi-asset prediction systems27. This can not only validate model universality but may also discover cross-asset synergies and systemic risk transmission mechanisms29. Second is technical optimization directions, including developing more efficient event information extraction and encoding methods, exploring lightweight model architectures, and researching incremental learning mechanisms to adapt to dynamic market environment changes. Third is enhancing model interpretability through visualization techniques and factor decomposition methods to make model decision processes more transparent, enhancing user trust and regulatory compliance46. Finally is exploration of practical applications by integrating the model into complete quantitative investment and risk management systems, validating performance and commercial value in real trading environments47. We believe that with in-depth research in these directions, event-driven and relationship-aware financial prediction methods will play increasingly important roles in future intelligent financial systems. While DAFF-Net demonstrates superior predictive performance, practical deployment requires careful consideration of infrastructure requirements, implementation complexity, and cost-benefit trade-offs. This section provides a realistic assessment of deployment challenges and offers scalable implementation strategies for different institutional contexts. Full Implementation Requirements: The complete DAFF-Net system demands substantial technical infrastructure: Real-time Data Pipeline: Continuous ingestion from multiple news feeds (Bloomberg, Reuters, PR Newswire), SEC EDGAR filings, and macroeconomic data sources, requiring robust data streaming architecture and 24/7 monitoring Natural Language Processing Infrastructure: High-performance GPU clusters for real-time BERT encoding of news articles and announcements, with typical latency requirements under 100ms for trading applications Knowledge Graph Maintenance: Quarterly updates requiring domain expertise to verify corporate relationships, supply chain changes, and regulatory reclassifications from multiple authoritative sources Computational Resources: Training infrastructure requiring NVIDIA A100-class GPUs and substantial memory for handling large-scale multimodal datasets Estimated Implementation Costs: Initial setup: \(\$200\text {K}-500\text {K}\) for infrastructure and data subscriptions Annual operational costs: \(\$150\text {K}-300\text {K}\) for data feeds, cloud computing, and maintenance Personnel requirements: 2–3 FTE including ML engineers, data engineers, and domain experts Recognizing that full implementation may be prohibitive for smaller institutions, we propose several graceful degradation strategies that preserve significant portions of DAFF-Net’s performance benefits: Tier 1: Simplified Event Integration Data Sources: Limit events to earnings announcements, major news headlines, and Fed policy statements Processing: Use pre-trained sentence transformers instead of full BERT encoding Update Frequency: Daily batch processing instead of real-time streaming Performance Impact: Retains approximately 80% of full model improvement Cost Reduction: 60–70% lower than full implementation Tier 2: Relationship-Only Implementation Focus: Implement only the multi-dimensional relationship module Data Sources: Use publicly available fundamental data and static knowledge graphs Event Component: Replace with simple sentiment scores from free news APIs Performance Impact: Retains approximately 60% of full model improvement Cost Reduction: 80% lower than full implementation Tier 3: Academic/Research Implementation Data Sources: Historical data only, using archived news and fundamental databases Processing: Offline batch processing suitable for research and backtesting Knowledge Graph: Simplified using Wikipedia/DBpedia relationships Performance Impact: Full research validation capability Cost: Under \(\$10\text {K}\) annually for academic research Phased Implementation Strategy: Phase 1 (Months 1–3): Implement Tier 3 version for backtesting and validation on institutional data Phase 2 (Months 4–6): Upgrade to Tier 2 with live fundamental data and basic event processing Phase 3 (Months 7–12): Full Tier 1 implementation with comprehensive event integration Phase 4 (Year 2+): Optimization and customization for specific use cases Risk Mitigation Strategies: Fallback Mechanisms: Maintain traditional LSTM/Transformer models as backup predictors Data Quality Monitoring: Implement automated data quality checks and anomaly detection Model Validation: Continuous out-of-sample testing and performance monitoring Regulatory Compliance: Ensure all data sources and model decisions meet financial regulatory requirements Large Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {10B}}+ {\textbf {AUM}}\)): Full implementation justified by potential alpha generation exceeding infrastructure costs. Conservative estimate of 0.5–1.5% annual alpha improvement can generate \(\$50-100\)M additional returns, easily justifying \(\$500\)K annual costs. Medium Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {1-10B AUM}}\)): Tier 1 implementation recommended. Estimated 0.3–0.7.3.7% alpha improvement generating \(\$3-70\)M additional returns versus \(\$200\)K annual costs provides strong ROI. Small Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {100M-1B AUM}}\)): Tier 2 implementation most appropriate. Even 0.2–0.4.2.4% alpha improvement generates \(\$200\)K-4M additional returns versus \(\$100\)K costs, maintaining positive ROI. Individual/Retail Investors: Tier 3 implementation suitable for educational purposes and personal portfolio management, with minimal costs and research-focused benefits. To facilitate broader adoption and academic research, we commit to: Open Source Release: Core model architecture and Tier 3 implementation within 6 months of publication Documentation: Comprehensive implementation guides and tutorials API Development: RESTful APIs for simplified integration with existing trading systems Community Support: GitHub repository with active maintenance and community contributions This practical implementation framework demonstrates that while DAFF-Net represents a sophisticated advancement in financial prediction, it can be deployed at various scales and resource levels, making its benefits accessible to a broad range of market participants. This study proposes the Dual-stream Alpha Factor Fusion Network (DAFF-Net), an innovative deep learning framework specifically designed for financial time series prediction tasks. Through the organic combination of an event-driven temporal pattern extractor and a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, DAFF-Net successfully addresses the limitations of traditional financial prediction models in handling complex market narratives and inter-asset correlations. Comprehensive experimental validation on Amazon stock data demonstrates that DAFF-Net significantly outperforms eight representative baseline models including ARIMA, LSTM, Transformer, and DUET across 1-day, 5-day, and 20-day prediction tasks, achieving 7.4%−15.2% improvement in MSE metrics and 7.0%−21.4% enhancement in \(\text {R}^{2}\) metrics compared to the strongest baselines, with particularly outstanding advantages in long-term prediction tasks. These results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of deep fusion of event information with multi-dimensional relationship information, providing new technical pathways and theoretical contributions to the field of financial time series prediction. Although current research still has limitations such as limited data coverage and complex technical implementation, DAFF-Net’s core concepts and technical framework open important directions for the development of quantitative investment, risk management, and intelligent financial systems, with broad application prospects and research value. Future work will focus on expanding model validation in multi-asset and cross-market environments, optimizing computational efficiency and deployment convenience, and further enhancing model interpretability to promote the widespread application of event-driven and relationship-aware financial prediction methods in actual financial business.

Apple is on a record-setting streak. Shares of Apple (AAPL) were up more than 3% in extended trading Thursday, topping their recent highs after the iPhone maker posted earnings that exceeded analysts' estimates and CEO Tim Cook gave an upbeat outlook for the holiday season. Apple reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.85 on revenue that rose 8% year-over-year to $102.47 billion. Both figures came in ahead of analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha, as Apple's services revenue climbed to a record high of $28.75 billion. Growth in Apple's iPhone sales also helped drive the better-than-expected results, after the company launched its iPhone 17 lineup in September. Sales of iPhones rose 6% to $49.03 billion in the fourth quarter, contributing the bulk of Apple's product revenue. The figure also represented a September quarter revenue record for the iPhone, with CEO Tim Cook suggesting that could mean a record holiday season ahead. "We expect December-quarter revenue to be the best ever for the company and the best ever for iPhone," Cook said on the company's earnings call Thursday, anticipating 10% to 12% revenue growth. Analysts were looking for 6%. Apple shares were up about 8% for 2025 through Thursday's close. This week's gains have boosted Apple's market capitalization above $4 trillion, making it the word's second-most-valuable company behind only AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA).

October 30, 2025 13:30 ET | Source: Groupe Casino Groupe Casino THIRD-QUARTER 2025 Continuation of the first half-year's growth dynamic Growth in net sales: +0.5% LFL in Q3 and +0.6% over the first nine months The initial results of the “Renouveau” plan are confirmed, and the Group is again reporting like-for-like net sales growth this quarter. Increase in cumulative adjusted EBITDA1 at end-September: +13% Cost cutting and the bulk of the work already carried out on streamlining the store network enabled the Group to increase its adjusted EBITDA over the first nine months of the year: Compliance with the covenant and slight upturn in cash flow Improved free cash flow before financial expenses: -€39m at end-September 2025 (-€48m at end-June), underpinned by growth in adjusted EBITDA after lease payments. The Group reiterates that the basis of comparison was adversely affected by the payment in H1 2024 of €153m in social security and tax liabilities placed under moratorium in 2023. After financial expenses, free cash flow amounted to -€198 million. The Group's liquidity1 stood at €1.22bn at 30 September 2025. Covenant requirements were satisfied, with a “Covenant net debt/Covenant adjusted EBITDA” ratio of 7.68x at end-September 2025, below the threshold of 8.34x. The Group is maintaining its objective of returning to break-even free cash flow before financial expenses in 2026 and confirms the financial objectives set out in its “Renouveau 2028” strategic plan. SALES AND ADJUSTED EBITDA In Q3 2025, net sales amounted to €2,002m, up +0.5% on a like-for-like basis, with convenience brands up +1.1% in Q3. After taking into account a -0.2-pt calendar effect and the roughly -3.5 pt effect of streamlining the convenience brand store network, Q3 sales were down -3.2%. Over the first nine months of 2025, consolidated net sales amounted to €6,080m, up +0.6% like-for-like, with convenience brands up +1.1%. After considering a -0.6-pt calendar effect (leap year in 2024) and the roughly -2.9 pt effect of streamlining the convenience brand store network, total sales for the first nine months were down -2.9%. Group adjusted EBITDA stood at €456m (+13%) over the first nine months of 2025, lifting the margin to 7.5% (+106 bps). Group adjusted EBITDA after lease payments amounted to €112m (vs. €59m over the first nine months of 2024). Monoprix Growth was driven by food sales (+0.9%), once again underpinned by a good performance in fresh products (+2.1%), particularly fruit and vegetables, which continued to benefit from marketing initiatives including the price repositioning initiated in H1 2025. Non-food sales were stable this quarter, as the Fashion & Home segment continued to outperform the market. Monoprix also continued to develop its "La Cantine" food concept, launched in April, with the roll-out of 3 additional stores in Paris and the Paris region, bringing the number of stores converted to the new concept by end-September to 6, with the aim of extending the concept to around 10 stores by the end of the year. Over the quarter, the streamlining of the store network resulted in the closure of 3 stores and the transfer of 3 owned stores to franchises at Monoprix (16 closures and 3 transfers since the beginning of the year). The brand also opened 8 new outlets during the quarter (19 since the beginning of the year). Franprix The positive impact of the "prix francs” (fair prices) campaign, with price cuts and price freezes on 50 private-label products, and the good performance of stores converted to the "Oxygène" concept, helped to support this trend over the quarter. The concept was extended to a further 25 stores over the quarter, bringing the total number of stores converted to the new concept to 75 at end-September, outperforming the rest of the store network (like-for-like sales growth of +2.3% over the quarter vs. -0.2% for the store network as a whole). Franprix continued to expand its quick meal solutions offer at end-September with the roll-out of two low-cost meal deals (breakfast and lunch).Changes within the Franprix network continued during the quarter with 24 store closures, 5 openings (64 closures, 22 openings and 6 transfers of owned stores to franchises or business leases since the beginning of the year). Casino/Spar/Vival This performance was underpinned by strong momentum in July (+3.6%) and September (+2.0%), ahead of a +0.3% improvement in August. Seasonal stores once again supported the trend this quarter, with a good summer season in the mountains for the Spar and Sherpa stores. Over the quarter, the Casino, Spar and Vival owned stores recorded a -1.2% decline in customer traffic (compared with a -0.2% decline in Q2 and a -2.9% decline in Q1).The roll-out of the "Coeur de Blé" quick meal solutions concept continued with 22 new dedicated outlets opened this quarter (36 at end-September) and 26 more planned by the end of the year. The new Spar "Origines" concept, which saw its first store opening in Luynes (Bouches-du-Rhône) this summer, confirmed the net sales growth prospects. The brand plans to open 4 more new stores by the end of the year, and to accelerate roll-out in 2026.The store network saw 98 stores leave the network in Q3 2025, 37 store openings and 19 transfers from owned stores to franchises (866 exits, 101 openings and 67 transfers to franchises since the beginning of the year). Naturalia This performance was boosted by a good momentum in the organic market, amplified by the effectiveness of in-store initiatives and the ongoing success of the "La Ferme" concept, rolled out in 3 additional stores this quarter (23 stores rolled out at end-September). The momentum of e-commerce sales continued, with +27% growth for the brand’s website, while Naturalia continues to expand its quick commerce business with the expansion of its Uber Eats partnership to 9 new stores over the quarter (47 stores at end-September). The quick meal solutions offer further expanded its roll-out: 3 new stores switched to the organic snacking concept this quarter, bringing the number of stores in the test phase to 9. Naturalia closed 1 store and opened 1 store in Q3 2025 (12 closures, 1 opening and 1 transfer from an owned store to a business lease since the beginning of the year). Cdiscount Driven by the marketing reinvestment plan, brand awareness rose significantly and new customer acquisition accelerated (+41% in Q3 2025 after +37% in H1). Cdiscount net sales fell by -2.9% on a like-for-like basis, reflecting the priority given to profitability through the momentum of the Marketplace and the moderate decline in direct sales. Cdiscount Advertising's momentum (revenues up +7.8%) continued with the launch of a new Retail Media product, “Sponsored Brand Video”. Other and Quatrim OTHER FINANCIAL INDICATORS Free cash flow before financial expenses – Continuing operations Over the first nine months of 2025, free cash flow before financial expenses stood at -€39m (-€48m at end-June), driven by growth in adjusted EBITDA after lease payments. It therefore improved by +€500m compared with the first nine months of 2024 (-€539m) and by +€347m excluding the repayment in H1 2024 of €153m in social security and tax liabilities placed under moratorium in 2023. Liquidity7 at 30 September 2025 At 30 September 2025, the Group had liquidity reserves of €1.22bn, including: These amounts are available immediately in full. Covenants Net leverage ratio7 The scope of the covenant test corresponds to the Group adjusted for Quatrim and, to a lesser extent, the subsidiaries Mayland in Poland and Wilkes in Brazil. The “Covenant net debt/Covenant adjusted EBITDA” ratio stood at 7.68x, below the ratio requirement of 8.34x. The Group states that the EBITDA forecasts for Q4 2025 should ensure compliance with the next test, which will take place on 31 December 2025. HIGHLIGHTS Real estate disposals Quatrim and its subsidiaries disposed of €14m in real estate assets in Q3 2025. On 1 August, the Group repaid €20m of the secured debt carried by Quatrim, enabling reduction of the nominal value of this debt to €198m at 30 September 2025. Assaí procedure Since the press release dated 26 September 2025 concerning the request for provisional measures submitted by Sendas Distribuidora S.A. (see press release), Casino Guichard Perrachon SA and Segisor (collectively "Casino") have had access to the file and Casino has presented its defence to the judge. The proceedings are in progress. Proceedings before the Paris Court Casino, Guichard-Perrachon was referred to the Paris Criminal Court following the preliminary investigation by the Financial Public Prosecutor (Parquet National Financier – PNF) for alleged stock price manipulation and private corruption dating back to 2018 and 2019. The hearing before the Paris Criminal Court took place from 1 to 22 October 2025. The Financial Public Prosecutor requested (i) that Casino Guichard Perrachon be ordered to pay a fine of €75m and (ii) that it be prohibited from making an offer to the public of securities and from having its securities admitted to trading on a regulated market for a period of three years, suspended in its entirety, and that it be subject to a compliance programme supervised by the French Anti-Corruption Agency (Agence Française Anticorruption – AFA). These requisitions do not constitute a court decision and the Financial Public Prosecutor's requests are not binding on the Court. Casino Guichard Perrachon contests the fact that it can be personally accused of an offence and asserts that it did not, in any way, benefit from the alleged events mentioned in this dispute. The Group points out that no provision has been recorded in its financial statements in this respect. Judgement is expected to be handed down on 29 January 2026. Franchising of 27 Monop’ stores The Group announces the franchising of 27 Monop’ stores in Paris and the Île-de-France region as part of the joint venture between Monoprix and the Zouari family (7 stores on 28 October, 11 on 29 October and 9 on 30 October).

Title: Amazon Is Set To Report Earnings Today. Here's What Investors Should Know

Time Published: 2025-10-30T16:55:58Z
Full Content:
Amazon is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings after markets close on Thursday, and all eyes are likely to be on the e-commerce giant’s cloud business. Amazon is expected to report third-quarter revenue of about $178 billion, a 12% increase from last year, according to analyst estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Its earnings are expected to increase 10% to $1.57 a share. While Amazon’s e-commerce operation makes up the bulk of its business, investors will be most focused on its AI efforts, represented by cloud revenue and capital expenditures. Amazon’s cloud growth of 17.5% in the second quarter exceeded official expectations, but disappointed Wall Street after two blowout reports from competitors Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG). On Wednesday, both of those companies again posted cloud revenue well ahead of Wall Street’s estimates, setting another high bar for Amazon to clear. Amazon's array of businesses spans e-commerce, logistics, advertising, cloud computing and more, making its results a partial reflection of the financial health of U.S. consumers and businesses. Its market capitalization—well over $2 trillion as of midday Thursday—makes its stock one of the most influential in the stock market. Investors may also be primed for Amazon to increase its capital expenditures guidance after Alphabet and Meta Platforms (META) did so with their reports Wednesday. Amazon’s second-quarter capex of $32.2 billion was about 25% higher than analysts expected. Wedbush analysts expect Amazon’s full-year capex to total $119 billion, implying growth of about 10% between the first and second halves of this year. “We are constructive on the setup leading into the report given positive commentary around [Amazon Web Services] growth, healthy trends for the core retail business, and strong advertiser demand,” wrote Wedbush analysts in a note late last week. Amazon stock has been the laggard of the Magnificent Seven recently, with shares up just 3% since the start of the year. Concerns about tariffs and lagging cloud growth have weighed on the stock. Some investors see the potential for shares to close the gap with the rest of the Mag 7 after earnings. Options prices on Thursday morning suggest traders expect Amazon stock to move about 6.3% in either direction by end of the week. A move higher off of Wednesday’s closing price would put shares around $244.75, which would be their first all-time high since early February, while an equivalent decline would put the stock at about $216. Wall Street is generally bullish on the outlook for Amazon stock, with all 22 of the analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha assigning it a “Buy” rating. Their median price target of $270 is nearly 20% above the stock’s intraday price on Thursday. This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect analysts’ estimates for Amazon's diluted earnings per share.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Despite Broadcom climbing 13% in the last week, its competitor Nvidia might be a more attractive option. Regularly assessing alternatives is fundamental to a solid investment strategy. Nvidia (NVDA) stock displays better revenue growth over significant periods, greater profitability, and a relatively lower valuation compared to Broadcom (AVGO) stock, indicating that investing in NVDA may be advantageous. Nvidia’s vertically integrated platform, including its cutting-edge Blackwell GPUs, NVLink interconnects, and proprietary CUDA software stack make it indispensable for AI data centers needing massive parallel processing power. In comparison, Broadcom’s custom silicon (ASICs) and AI networking solutions serve specific client needs through long-term contracts, representing a potentially lower long term growth model. Quiz time: Over the past 5 years, which index do you believe the Trefis High Quality Portfolio outperformed—the S&P 500, S&P 1500 Equal Weighted, or both? The answer might surprise you. Discover how our advisory framework increases your chances of success. AVGO designs and provides semiconductor devices and infrastructure software, offering solutions such as set-top box system-on-chips, cable, DSL, and passive optical networking. NVDA delivers graphics, computing, and networking solutions for gaming, visualization, data centers, and automotive markets. Valuation & Performance Overview Note: For “Last 3 Year Return” metric, the preferred stock is the one with higher returns unless the returns are exceedingly high (>300%), which poses a risk of sell-off.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) has soared 13% in a week, driven by significant momentum in the AI sector. This surge is fueled by two major catalysts: Given this dramatic 13% increase, it is a fundamental part of a robust investment strategy to re-evaluate the stock’s position. Below is a comparison of Broadcom against its peers, focusing on key financial metrics such as size, valuation, growth, and margin. For some context, Broadcom delivers semiconductor devices and infrastructure software, which includes set-top box system-on-chips, cable, DSL, and passive optical networking solutions. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like AVGO, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Why does this matter? AVGO recently rose by 17% in a month – a peer comparison places stock performance, valuation, and financials in a broader context – indicating whether it is genuinely outperforming, lagging behind, and ultimately – can this trend continue? Read Buy or Sell AVGO Stock to determine if Broadcom stands as a solid investment. Additionally, there is always a possibility of a decline following a significant rally – observe how the stock has historically dipped and recovered through AVGO Dip Buyer Analysis perspective. Investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Stock futures are losing ground amid a barrage of earnings reports from major companies, as investors assess the latest developments in trade talks and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's warning that more rate cuts aren't a certainty; President Donald Trump said his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping resulted in a rare earths mineral agreement and a reduction in certain tariffs on China; shares of Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are losing ground after the Magnificent Seven members reported results late yesterday, while Alphabet (GOOG) shares are surging after the Google parent reported more than $100 billion in quarterly sales; Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) are due to release their quarterly reports after the closing bell; and Eli Lilly (LLY) shares are rising after the company reported strong sales of weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are lower as investors digest a flurry of corporate earnings reports and evaluate the results of trade talks between the U.S. and China. The major indexes hit record highs yesterday but gave back early gains after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that another interest rate cut at the upcoming December meeting was “not a foregone conclusion—far from it." The comments came after the Fed trimmed its benchmark rate for the second time in as many months to support a labor market that has weakened. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 0.4% recently, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq slipped 0.2%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on a wide array of consumer and business loans, was at 4.10%, up from 4.06% at yesterday's close and at its highest level in three weeks. Bitcoin was at $109,800, down from an overnight high of around $111,600. Gold futures fell slightly from yesterday's close to $3,985 an ounce, and are well off the record high of near $4,400 set early last week. President Trump reportedly said that “a lot of decisions were made” in his meeting with Chinese leader Xi on Thursday, potentially signaling a thaw in trade relations between the two nations. Trump said that an agreement on rare earth minerals was reached after China restricted exports of the key product for high-tech manufacturing. The agreement will need to be renewed every year. Trump also said that U.S. tariffs targeting China’s fentanyl production were reduced to 10% from 20%, taking overall U.S. tariffs on Chinese products down to 47%. More negotiations could be coming as Trump said he will visit China in April, with Xi making a visit to the U.S. sometime after that. The agreements are expected to add some certainty to U.S. trade policy after tariff announcements roiled markets earlier this year. Shares of Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) are lower in premarket trading after the Magnificent Seven members delivered their highly anticipated quarterly results, while Alphabet (GOOG) stock soared after the Google-parent hit a new revenue milestone. Alphabet’s earnings topped Wall Street expectations as quarterly revenues topped $100 billion for the first time, with each of its major business segments reporting sales growth of at least 10%. Microsoft also posted better-than-expected earnings as quarterly revenue jumped 18% year-over-year, led by 28% growth in cloud sales, though the stock fell amid concerns about the company's capital spending plan. Facebook parent Meta also reported strong revenue growth, but a one-time $16 billion tax charge helped sink its earnings well below estimates. Alphabet shares were up about 8% ahead of the opening bell, while Meta tumbled 9% and Microsoft declined 2%.. More Magnificent Seven company earnings are on tap today, with Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) set to release results after the closing bell. Apple shares hit record highs recently, boosting its market capitalization above $4 trillion (only Nvidia and Microsoft have higher market values), following a report that showed solid sales of newly released iPhone 17 models. Apple’s stock has fallen after recent earnings reports on investor worries over its progress on AI products. Meanwhile, Amazon has been the laggard among “Mag 7” stocks this year, and options pricing suggests that traders expect a big move for the online retailer’s share price after the earnings report is released today. Apple shares were up 0.5% in recent premarket trading, while Amazon stock fell more than 1%. Eli Lilly (LLY) shares are rising after the drugmaker reported better-than-expected earnings on strong demand for its weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro. Lilly reported third-quarter revenue of $17.6 billion, a jump of 54% over the prior year and ahead of analyst estimates of $16.1 billion as tracked by Visible Alpha. The company’s adjusted earnings per share of $7.02 beat the consensus estimate of $5.91. Eli Lilly reported strong sales growth of key drugs, with worldwide Mounjaro revenue doubling to $6.52 billion, while U.S. sales of Zepbound nearly tripled to $3.57 billion. Eli Lilly shares were up 4% in recent premarket trading.

Title: OpenAI Reportedly Planning ‘Up to $1 Trillion’ IPO as Early as Next Year

Time Published: 2025-10-30T10:30:37Z
Full Content:
Reading time 2 minutes An anonymously sourced report from Reuters claims that OpenAI is planning an initial public offering that would value the AI colossus at “up to $1 trillion.” Just on Tuesday the company formally completed its slow evolution from an ambiguous non-profit to a for-profit company. Now it appears to be formalizing plans to become one of the world’s centers of economic powerâat least on paper.Â Â The $1 trillion report comes from “three people familiar with the matter.” Reuters’ sources claimed that OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar has been telling OpenAI “associates” that an IPO is coming in 2027, but that actually it could come in late 2026.Â Judging by the current ranking of companies by market capitalization, a $1 trillion valuation would make OpenAI the 12th most valuable publicly traded firm on Earth, just below Berkshire Hathaway, and just above JPMorgan Chase and Walmart.Â A publicly traded OpenAI would make for a fascinating case study, since shareholders really do expect companies to bring in money instead of just spending itâsomething OpenAI has notoriously had a hard time doing so far. As Elon Musk once put it, “There’s immense pressure on a public company to not have a bad quarter.”Â Becoming public can force a lot of information about a company’s real value into public viewâquarterly and annual reports on finances most famously, but also everything about the company’s history that goes in an IPO prospectus. Institutional investors buy shares based on that prospectus, and when the company does go public, its merits can be judged harshly by Wall Street traders, as happened with Uber when it went public in 2019, and its stock price immediately plunged. Companies can also sense which way the wind is blowing if things aren’t going well, and withdraw an IPO before the company gets humiliated, as happened with Ari Emmanuel’s talent agency Endeavor Group in the same year as Uber’s humiliating debut. In a livestream on Tuesday, Sam Altman made similarly grandiose claims about 13-figure sums of money. According to Axios, he said eventually he’d like to build one gigawatt’s worth of new data center capacity per week, which he expects to cost 20 billion per gigawatt. Add it up yourself, and that’s over $1 trillion per year. “Eventually we need to get to hundreds of billions a year in revenue, and we’re on a pretty steep curve towards that,” he claimed. He also added (again, per Axios) that going public “is the most likely path for us given the capital needs that we’ll have and, sort of, the size of the company.”Â Explore more on these topics Share this story Subscribe and interact with our community, get up to date with our customised Newsletters and much more. The group also includes Bandai, NHK, Square Enix, and Toho. Step 1: Ditch Altman. Step 2: Merge with Anthropic. Step 3: ??? Step 4: Profit. AWS joins OpenAI's tangled web of dealmaking. The "electrocution" in this analogy is a lawsuit. OpenAI has been catching more heat for alleged copyright infringement, and now companies like Square Enix and Ghibli have put their foot down. The de Blasio "impersonator" was profiled in 2020. But he didn't have AI back then. Â©2025 GIZMODO USA LLC. All rights reserved.

Title: 5 Shopify Mistakes That Kill Holiday Profits

Time Published: 2025-10-30T09:00:42Z

Minor configuration mistakes during the busy Christmas selling season can seriously harm ecommerce profits. Shopify remains the most popular ecommerce platform in the United States. Various sources report that the company has about 29% of the total U.S. hosted ecommerce platform market, or about 21% of the top 1 million ecommerce sites worldwide. Shopify is popular, in part, because of its relative ease of use. The setup is speedy for online sellers willing to accept out-of-the-box themes and a default configuration. Unfortunately, that configuration can also lead to mistakes. What follows are five Shopify setup errors that kill profits when holiday sales rev up. Product feeds to Google and Meta can fail silently. A price mismatch, missing GTIN, or out-of-stock flag can lead to disapprovals that stop some ads from running even while the campaign spends otherwise. Before the holiday rush, store owners and managers should review product feeds aimed at dynamic advertising. In Shopify, this means checking “Google & YouTube,” “Facebook & Instagram,” and any other connected sales app. Each should show products approved and synchronized. A merchant might also notice this when checking product sales channels. Shopify adds a warning if there is a feed problem. A store manager checking for missing channels (below) might have noticed something wrong with the “Google & YouTube” feed. Shopify merchants sometimes assume that publishing a product to their online store automatically makes it visible on Google Shopping, Meta, the Shop app, and Pinterest. It does not. Shopify treats each sales channel separately, and products do not appear in a channel unless explicitly added. This may be true even when an app is installed correctly. Channel exclusion happens frequently for stores selling print-on-demand products such as t-shirts. A shopkeeper might design and publish a t-shirt with Printful and add it to a Shopify collection, unaware that it wasn’t added to every channel. To check, go to “Products” in Shopify and filter by excluded sales channels. Bulk-add any missing channels. Visibility is a foundation of conversion. If an item is not syndicated to every active channel, it might as well not exist. Shopify’s shipping options are flexible and configurable. They can be confusing, too, prompting some ecommerce operations to select a few simple options. Unfortunately, keeping it simple may not work during the holiday crunch. Last-minute holiday shoppers often want lightning-fast delivery and are willing to pay for it. The trouble is that many stores never offer it. In Shopify, go to “Settings” > “Shipping and Delivery.” Open each profile and make sure every product belongs to it. Add at least one two-day or overnight option using carrier-calculated rates. Consider posting a clear cutoff message — such as “Order by Dec. 18 for Christmas delivery.” — on product detail pages. Fast, flexible fulfillment often matters more than price in late December. Shoppers will not buy without a proper delivery option. Shopify’s discount system is powerful and literal. Run multiple promotions at once, and the platform could apply them all unless told otherwise. Ensure discounts work as expected. To be clear, applying multiple discounts to a single order, product, or transaction simultaneously is a valid sales tactic. Plenty of retailers use this approach. Hence discount stacking is built into Shopify. A storewide 20% sale, combined with free shipping and a loyalty code, can materially boost holiday revenue and, potentially, instantly erase margins. Before launching any campaign, open “Discounts” and check for overlapping date ranges or stackable coupons. Consider limiting the store to one automatic or sitewide discount at a time — test checkouts with several products in the cart. Merchants on Shopify Plus may also want to audit their Scripts or Functions. Strong Christmas sales can push a store past tax nexus thresholds — the point at which a merchant is legally required to collect and remit sales tax in a state. Shopify doesn’t necessarily detect new tax requirements automatically. The store may owe taxes if its revenue or transaction volume crosses a given state’s threshold. The problem usually shows up after December, when accountants discover a state in which the store met the threshold but never registered. That missed setup can mean back taxes, penalties, and months of cleanup. Before peak season, review Shopify tax settings. Add every state where the business has physical presence, employees, warehouses, or meets an economic nexus threshold. That threshold is often $100,000 in annual sales or 200 transactions. Enable Shopify Tax or a third-party app such as Avalara to maintain accurate rates. International stores should check “Markets” to confirm the correct VAT and customs settings.
