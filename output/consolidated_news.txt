View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AA.wdun44ema Share article Print article Just for a moment this week, Larry Ellison, co-founder of US cloud computing company Oracle, became the world’s richest person. The octogenarian tech titan briefly overtook Elon Musk after Oracle’s share price rocketed 43% in a day, adding about US$100 billion (A$150 billion) to his wealth. The reason? Oracle inked a deal to provide artificial intelligence (AI) giant OpenAI with US$300 billion (A$450 billion) in computing power over five years. While Ellison’s moment in the spotlight was fleeting, it also illuminated something far more significant: AI has created extraordinary levels of concentration in global financial markets. This raises an uncomfortable question not only for seasoned investors – but also for everyday Australians who hold shares in AI companies via their superannuation. Just how exposed are even our supposedly “safe”, “diversified” investments to the AI boom? As billionaires go, Ellison isn’t as much of a household name as Tesla and SpaceX’s Musk or Amazon’s Jeff Bezos. But he’s been building wealth from enterprise technology for nearly five decades. Ellison co-founded Oracle in 1977, transforming it into one of the world’s largest database software companies. For decades, Oracle provided the unglamorous but essential plumbing that kept many corporate systems running. The AI revolution changed everything. Oracle’s cloud computing infrastructure, which helps companies store and process vast amounts of data, became critical infrastructure for the AI boom. Every time a company wants to train large language models or run machine learning algorithms, they need huge amounts of computing power and data storage. That’s precisely where Oracle excels. When Oracle reported stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings this week, driven largely by soaring AI demand, its share price spiked. That response wasn’t just about Oracle’s business fundamentals. It was about the entire AI ecosystem that has been reshaping global markets since ChatGPT’s public debut in late 2022. Oracle’s story is part of a much larger phenomenon reshaping global markets. The so-called “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks – Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Tesla and Nvidia – now control an unprecedented share of major stock indices. Year-to-date in 2025, these seven companies have come to represent approximately 39% of the US S&P500’s total value. For the tech-heavy NASDAQ100, the figure is a whopping 74%. This means if you invest in an exchange-traded fund that tracks the S&P500 index, often considered the gold standard of diversified investing, you’re making an increasingly concentrated bet on AI, whether you realise it or not. This level of concentration has not been seen since the late 1990s. Back then, investors were swept up in “dot-com mania”, driving technology stock prices to unsustainable levels. When reality finally hit in March 2000, the tech-heavy Nasdaq crashed 77% over two years, wiping out trillions in wealth. Today’s AI concentration raises some similar red flags. Nvidia, which controls an estimated 90% of the AI chip market, currently trades at more than 30 times expected earnings. This is expensive for any stock, let alone one carrying the hopes of an entire technological revolution. Yet, unlike the dot-com era, today’s AI leaders are profitable companies with real revenue streams. Microsoft, Apple and Google aren’t cash-burning startups. They are established giants, using AI to enhance existing businesses while generating substantial profits. This makes the current situation more complicated than a simple “bubble” comparison. The academic literature on market bubbles suggests genuine technological innovation often coincides with speculative excess. The question isn’t whether AI is transformative; it clearly is. Rather, the question is whether current valuations reflect realistic expectations about future profitability. For Australians, the AI concentration problem hits remarkably close to home through our superannuation system. Many balanced super fund options include substantial allocations to international shares, typically 20–30% of their portfolios. When your super fund buys international shares, it’s often getting heavy exposure to those same AI giants dominating US markets. The concentration risk extends beyond direct investments in tech companies. Australian mining companies, such as BHP and Fortescue, have become indirect AI players because their copper, lithium and rare earth minerals are essential for AI infrastructure. Even diversifying away from technology doesn’t fully escape AI-related risks. Research on portfolio concentration shows when major indices become dominated by a few large stocks, the benefits of diversification diminish significantly. If AI stocks experience a significant correction or crash, it could disproportionately impact Australians’ retirement nest eggs. This situation represents what’s called “systemic concentration risk”. This is a specific form of systemic risk where supposedly diversified investments become correlated through common underlying factors or exposures. It’s reminiscent of the 2008 financial crisis, when seemingly separate housing markets across different regions all collapsed simultaneously. That was because they were all exposed to subprime mortgages with high risk of default. This does not mean anyone should panic. But regulators, super fund trustees and individual investors should all be aware of these risks. Diversification only works if returns come from a broad range of companies and industries.

Title: Trailblazer Tania Rosser brings a different school of thought to Gonzaga head coach role

It’s a Thursday afternoon, Tania Rosser is on her way to Gonzaga College in Ranelagh, south Dublin, to take training for the senior cycle rugby players. First though, before they hit the pitches, about 50 of those pupils will do yoga, an innovation she has introduced since taking the position of head coach to the Senior Cup team during the summer. It’s a statement appointment, and not in a headline-courting manner. In coming through an interview process conducted by principal Damien McCaul and vice principal Stephen Carey, she wasn’t just the best woman for the position – she was the preferred and best applicant. The New Zealand native, who arrived in Ireland 23 years ago, played international rugby across three different codes – touch, sevens and XVs. She won 58 caps for Ireland and participated in three World Cups, during the last of which she came out of retirement to help orchestrate Ireland’s victory over New Zealand in 2014. Rosser was a player-coach at DLSP and Blackrock College, coached J1 (seconds) men’s team and did skills work with the AIL squad in Clontarf. She coached the women’s team in Old Belvedere and several of the Irish touch rugby international teams before leading the Leinster women to back-to-back interprovincial titles during a three-year tenure that started in 2021. Her passion for rugby stems from childhood. The youngest of five siblings to Denis and Nancy, she grew up on a “massive farm” in Hawke’s Bay before the family subsequently moved into the town of Hastings when she was a little older. Brothers Ray and Dan were sent to boarding school and the only time she got to see them was at rugby matches on weekends. Rosser admits to being the tiresome little sister, a shadow for her brothers who were eight and 10 years older. She wanted to play rugby but her parents forbade it, directing her towards netball and basketball, at which she excelled. She used to sneak out to play rugby until she was caught and grounded. That rebellious streak – the refusal to have other people define her boundaries – has travelled with her in life. She badgered her father to set up a touch rugby footie team, to legitimise her participation. The first time her parents saw her play rugby was for Ireland in a 43-0 defeat to France at the 2006 World Cup in Edmonton, Canada. She wanted to be a police officer but qualified as a primary schoolteacher at the behest of her mother, who thought the former occupation was too dangerous. She then moved to Ireland with her husband Simon Broughton, who had received a rugby-playing offer from Ballymena in the All-Ireland League. It was supposed to be two years but relocating to Dublin changed the plan. Simon – now the Leinster Academy manager – played with DLSP and Leinster, as did Tania. Her first coach at the Kilternan club was George Hook. During Covid she enrolled in a high-performance coaching course with World Rugby. Former England and Australia backs coach Scott Wisemantel was one of the mentors, while she got to do online workshops with former Ireland coach Eddie O’Sullivan and New Zealand mental skills guru Gilbert Enoka. When her three years at Leinster finished, she was on the lookout for another challenge and decided to pursue the position at Gonzaga. Long-time Senior Cup team (SCT) coach Declan Fassbender, who led his alma mater to three Senior Cup finals including a first ever success in 2023, vacated the role to concentrate on coaching Lansdowne. So why Gonzaga? “I just decided to throw my name in, send in my CV in and see what would come of it. “I (was) really disappointed that I couldn’t keep going with Leinster. So, I was looking for a new challenge and thought why not apply? I got the interview, went in and met the principal and deputy principal and had an honest conversation. They seemed open to it.” She’s not the first woman to be involved in coaching an SCT team, even in Ranelagh. Sandford Park school, a middling punt from the entrance to Gonzaga, had former New Zealand sevens and rugby league international Mere Baker – she also worked with the Railway Union club at the time – as part of their senior coaching team in the early to mid-2010s. Rosser started working with her new charges during the summer. “The boys started doing strength and conditioning in July, about 40 kids. I thought it would be a good idea to go in, sit with them, meet them one-on-one, find out what’s driving them, what they like about rugby, what they don’t like about rugby, just asking them a bit about themselves. “And just having that opportunity to say to them, look, my job is to make sure that they’re okay as people first. If they’re not well, or if they’re struggling in school or something, it’s okay – just come and tell me before training, and then we know that you’re off. “Sometimes when these players turn up, we don’t know what’s happening at home or at school, or if they’ve had a hard day. And a lot of times these kids don’t get to say it because they’re too afraid. It’s taken the boys a while to warm to being open with their feelings but there has been a little purchase of late.” Rosser’s principles in coaching young people is refreshing. “My whole thing is, there has to be life after this (schools rugby) for them. Too many kids don’t go on and play club rugby after the Senior Cup because they’re beaten up or broken, or they haven’t enjoyed it. “So how can I keep them, give them longevity, because there’s a long journey in their life and rugby career, if they continue to play club rugby. It’s just a holistic approach. It’s probably very different from other Senior Cup teams and I’m okay with it. I’m okay with people going ‘she’s mad’ or ‘this is ridiculous’. “I don’t care what people think outside the programme or the environment. I look at doing things differently – bringing in yoga, making the boys bring recovery food to every single session before they get on the pitch, checking in with them. “I like using different approaches. I shared with them my journey growing up, you know, facing racism (her mum is Maori), and being on an isolated farm, so they got a sense of who I was. The most important thing I said, the first thing is, I’m a mum. “By the time we get through this campaign, you’ll be like my kid. If you need me, if you give me all you can, I’ll always have your back, on and off the pitch. It’s just how I am with players.” Rosser looks to empower them on the pitch too. Her coaching operandi is inclusive rather than despotic. She’s had conversations with the boys, teasing out options for the game plan on the basis that if they don’t work, they can be discarded. It’s an interaction that wouldn’t be commonplace. At home there is a fair amount of rugby talk with Simon as Leinster academy manager and her son Serge, a pupil at St Andrew’s College and part of the Leinster Under-19s squad. He’s a scrumhalf, like mum, “only better”, in her words. He’s named after the great French fullback Serge Blanco, whom both his parents loved as a player. Serge was very nearly called Fionn. Tania couldn’t pronounce the name adequately with her Kiwi accent, so her then-Ireland rugby teammates advised her not to go there. She’s never been cowed by how others perceive her and is excited for what lies ahead. Rosser doesn’t look at glass ceilings, she just does what she has to do because it never occurred to her not to. She has encountered misogyny, asked whether she was the physio or the manager, but it doesn’t ruffle her savoir-faire. In the past, she’s noticed that “between a male counterpart in my role and myself, I’d say that the male counterpart gets things a lot easier than I would”. She added: “And I’m okay with that. I’m okay with working to try and break down barriers. I’ll push the boundaries as far as I can, ask questions and try to make things better for our set-up.” The Gonzaga boys will be the latest beneficiaries of that mindset. From her childhood days, she’s had to persuade people to give her an opportunity and that she’d take care of the rest. The level of success that ensued speaks for itself. A trailblazer and a woman for others, to tweak the Jesuit mantra. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Avalanche Targets $1 Billion Fundraising Goal For Two AVAX Treasuries

Time Published: 2025-09-12T04:00:01Z

The Avalanche Foundation, a non-profit organization that supports the Avalanche (AVAX) blockchain ecosystem, is reportedly seeking to raise $1 billion through a major fundraising campaign to create two AVAX treasuries. This initiative aligns with a broader trend in the cryptocurrency space, where various organizations and traditional finance firms are experimenting with crypto treasury models to strengthen their financial stability and operational capabilities. According to the Financial Times, the Avalanche Foundation is in advanced talks to create two crypto treasuries in the United States. These moves come at a time when the foundation is gaining traction among institutional investors, with firms like BlackRock and Visa already utilizing the Avalanche blockchain for their operations. The foundation’s strategy involves launching one digital asset treasury company while converting an existing firm into a treasury vehicle. The goal is to secure approximately $1 billion, with the expectation to finalize these deals within weeks. The funds raised are earmarked for the acquisition of millions of AVAX tokens, which will be offered at a discounted price directly from the Avalanche Foundation. This approach is aimed to not only support the foundation’s growth but also to enhance the liquidity and market presence of AVAX amid an increasingly competitive treasury companies landscape. Per the report, the first fundraising deal aims to secure up to $500 million through a private investment led by Hivemind Capital, with expectations to finalize the agreement by the end of the month. Notably, Anthony Scaramucci, a crypto investor and former White House press secretary, is advising on this initiative. The second funding endeavor involves a special purpose acquisition vehicle (SPAC) sponsored by Dragonfly Capital, which is also targeting a $500 million raise. This deal may take longer to conclude, potentially stretching into October. Both initiatives will focus on purchasing discounted AVAX tokens held by the Avalanche Foundation, which has a total supply of 720 million tokens, with approximately 420 million currently circulating. The broader cryptocurrency market has seen a surge in fundraising activities this year. Companies have raised over $16 billion to stockpile crypto assets, often inspired by the successful Bitcoin (BTC) treasury model of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). Tokens associated with other blockchains, such as Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), have also seen significant price increases. These tokens were selected by major publicly traded companies in the US for their respective crypto-focused treasuries. Although AVAX has not experienced the same upward momentum, CoinGecko data shows that it has recorded gains of up to 17% in the weekly time frame. As of this writing, the AVAX price is approaching the key $30 mark, a level not seen since February of this year.

Title: XRP, Dogecoin, Cardano Could Lead Explosive Altcoin Rally, Analyst Says

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Crypto markets are “on the edge” of a broad altcoin breakout, with XRP, Dogecoin, and Cardano positioned to lead, according to technical strategist CryptoInsightUK. In a video analysis released today, the analyst argues that structural signals across major charts—supported by improving macro conditions—tilt the risk-reward toward a decisive upside move, provided US inflation data doesn’t deliver a negative surprise. The setup begins with Bitcoin grinding higher into range highs while still sitting in what he calls “a position of potential reversal,” a juncture he links to today’s US CPI print after a softer-than-expected PPI reading. “If CPI comes in weak today, I think the markets will rip,” he said, framing inflation as the swing factor that could unlock risk appetite across crypto. He contends the strongest signals are emerging away from Bitcoin and Ethereum. On Ethereum, liquidity “still” sits below price around $4,100, with a pocket of resting orders above, leaving open the possibility of “a quick flush… to take that” before higher levels are attacked. “How much of a drop would we need to sweep this liquidity? Six percent,” he said, adding that the base of recent transactions “looks pretty good as a support,” even if a brief downside wick cannot be ruled out. The case for altcoins rests largely on visible liquidity concentrations and higher-timeframe structures. Cardano (ADA), he said, exhibits a favorable imbalance with “a… load of liquidity” stacked above “around one dollar,” and additional magnets in the $1.21 and $1.40 areas if momentum expands. He emphasized the sequence of higher lows and higher highs that preceded a consolidation, a pattern he compared across several charts. Dogecoin (DOGE), in his view, mirrors the same anatomy on a larger timeframe: a prior higher-high/higher-low sequence, a tightening range, and “liquidity above us,” with a push through $0.29 opening a path to targeting $0.45. “I’ve been saying for a while tokens like DOGE look like they are going to absolutely send it,” he said. For XRP, he argued that price action has “led the cycle” and recently broke a well-tracked downtrend on the daily and four-hour charts, while shorter-term liquidity maps now show concentrations overhead. Beyond single names, he anchored his thesis in market-wide breadth gauges. He highlighted “Total 3”—the combined market capitalization of all crypto assets excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum—pressing against prior highs and “knocking at the door… for price discovery.” In a closely related lens, he said “Total 2” (market cap ex-Bitcoin) is one incremental push away—“half a percent higher”—from a highest-ever weekly close, with three days left in the candle. The evolving formations, he added, can be interpreted as an “ascending wedge” that morphs into a “cup and handle” after a textbook Wyckoff-style accumulation and back-test, the kind of structural progression that often resolves with a powerful range break. Rotation dynamics are at the core of his call. Drawing on an ETH-vs-BTC dominance composite, he said the tape “looks like weakness” for the pair, with heavier volume on down moves in that ratio—an indication, he believes, that capital is migrating from Bitcoin and Ethereum into the broader altcoin complex. “If [Bitcoin] dominance breaks down… it’s better for altcoins,” he said. “As long as capital’s flowing into the market, I don’t really mind which starts to outperform which… but if we have a significant rise in Bitcoin’s price and a drop in dominance, it means that altcoins are going to be absolutely sending it.” At the same time, he flagged the near-term fork in the road. Markets are testing “decision” levels into macro data, and a brief liquidity sweep lower—on Bitcoin and ETH in particular—remains plausible before any sustained impulse. “We’re not in a breakout territory here yet,” he cautioned. “We’ve seen the first signs of it… [and] we could reject here and consolidate for a little bit longer… but one catalyst here and it’s green season in my opinion for crypto generally.” Throughout the analysis, the analyst returned to a handful of price signposts traders are likely to watch: ADA gravity around $1.00 with follow-ups near $1.21 and $1.40; DOGE confirmation above ~$0.29 and then $0.45 as the next objective; and XRP’s break of descending resistance with liquidity pools sitting overhead on intraday maps. If the macro side cooperates, his base case is unambiguous. “I think the breakout is imminent,” he said, pointing to synchronized strength across Total 2 and Total 3, gold’s recent breakout, and equities at or near all-time highs. “This is the sort of time where we’re going to break out,” he added. “Massive breakouts” in altcoins, when they come, often unfold as “a few weeks or a few days of massively green candles.” Even so, he closed with a reminder that timing remains hostage to catalysts. “It’s decision time for the market,” he said. “Could reject here and consolidate… but one catalyst here and it’s green season.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.99.

Did I mention there is a must-see exhibit in London to check out? Yep, that too! Art —Marie Antoinette Style exhibit at Victoria & Albert Museum, London If you will be in London between September 20th through March 22nd of 2026, and if Marie Antoinette’s style piques your interest, be sure to put a visit to the Victoria & Albert Museum on your itinerary. The Maria Antoinette Style exhibit centers around the “complex fashion icon, Marie Antoinette’s timeless appeal, [ever so much] defined by her style, youth and notoriety. Explore the lasting influence of the most fashionable (and ill-fated) queen in history – with over 250 years of design, fashion, film and art.” Books —Beyond Blue and White: The Hidden History of Delftware and the Women Behind the Iconic Ceramic by Genevieve Wheeler Brown Delft anything. Vases, tiles, bowls, you name it, most of us can identify these beautiful pieces when we see them, but where did it all begin and how did they become iconic? And more interestingly, who are the women that were part of the history that made it so? All of this is the focus of Genevieve Wheeler Brown’s new book Beyond Blue and White. Having read a recent review in the WSJ, and being fortunate to have found a Delft vase that I now regularly use and love, I always love learning more about the history of items that catch my eye, and Delftware is one of them. In the book you will “meet female Delftware makers, including Barbara Rotteveel founder of ‘The Three Bells’ Delftware factory in 1671, be introduced to female Delftware patrons such as Queen Mary II, who found her means of expression while creating a vogue in the 17th century for Delft blue and white across royal courts. And then there are the female collectors beginning in the 19th century who saw the artistry and craft in these ceramics others had overlooked. Foremost among them was Mrs. J. Pierpont Morgan and Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt II who came together with fellow New York women and laid the groundwork for women in the museum world while preserving decorative arts with an educational mission.” “What begins as a curatorial exercise quickly evolves not only into an exploration of this colorful, expressive, and sometimes even humorous decorative art, coveted for hundreds of years, but also an unexpected uncovering of forceful female lives yet untold.” —Books: A Manifesto, Or, How to Build a Library by Ian Patterson Looking forward to getting my hands on this one and adding it to my library, and if you too are a fellow bibliophile, this is a book for you! Currently only available in the UK (ship to the US from Blackwells), Books: A Manifesto, or How to Build a Library is “Wise, irreverent and exhilaratingly wide-ranging” Ian Patterson “insists on reading not as a luxury but a necessary part of reality: we live within language, and when we think, it’s with the tools that reading gives us.” “Our time of cultural and political crisis demands more than books – but without them, and without the breadth of knowledge, sense of history, awareness of alternatives and hope for the future they offer, things will not get better. At once a primer for enriching your own library and a manifesto for why that matters, this book is an invitation to a deeper, richer world of thought and feeling – and a reminder of just how much books matter.” Just released yesterday on September 11th, you can find it available to ship now from Blackwells. —History Matters by David McCullough A book about and written by one of the bestselling historians of the 20th and early 21st century, History Matters, released on Tuesday the 16th, is a posthumous collection of thought-provoking essays—many never published before—[from] Pulitzer Prize–winning historian and author David McCullough affirms the value of history, how we can be guided by its lessons, and the enduring legacy of American ideals.” “Edited by McCullough’s daughter, Dorie McCullough Lawson, and his longtime researcher, Michael Hill, History Matters is a tribute to a master historian and offers fresh insights into McCullough’s enduring interests and writing life. McCullough highlights the importance of character in political leaders, with Harry Truman and George Washington serving as exemplars of American values like optimism and determination. He shares his early influences, from the books he cherished in his youth to the people who mentored him. He also pays homage to those who inspired him, such as writer Paul Horgan and painter Thomas Eakins, illustrating the diverse influences on his writing as well as the influence of art.” To be released on September 16th One of my favorite titles by McCullough was The Greater Journey: Americans in Paris —Hope for Cynics: The Surprising Science of Human Goodness by Jamil Zaki Released earlier this month, and a book determined to demonstrate how the less we know and take at face value – headlines, screaming viral social media moments, you get the idea – the more we can buy the hype of hopelessness. Thankfully, Hope for Cynics argues that “we don’t have to remain stuck in this cynicism trap. Through science and storytelling, Jamil Zaki imparts the secret for beating back cynicism: hopeful skepticism—thinking critically about people and our problems, while honoring and encouraging our strengths. Far from being naïve, hopeful skepticism is a precise way of understanding others that can rebalance our view of human nature and help us build the world we truly want.” I am here for it. Thank you Zaki for writing this book. —No Fault: A Memoir of Romance and Divorce by Haley Mlotek While listening to book recommendations from the staff of NPR as they shared what they read and enjoyed this summer, Haley Mletek’s memoir sounded intriguing. No Fault: A Memoir of Romance and Divorce was inspired by the author’s own navigation through divorce and comes at this often talked about subject in a different way. Released back in February, Mlotek “combines her personal story while searching social and literary exploration [to share] a deeply felt and radiant account of 21st century divorce—the remarkably common and seemingly singular experience, and what it reveals about our society and our desires for family, love, and friendship. Mlotek asks profound questions about what divorce should be, who it is for, and why the institution of marriage maintains its power, all while charting a poignant and cathartic journey away from her own marriage towards an unknown future.” —Protocols: An Operating Manual for the Human Body by Andrew D. Huberman, Ph.D From the podcaster behind Huberman Lab, and neuroscientist and tenured professor at Stanford School of Medicine, Dr. Andrew Huberman “introduces Protocols, an essential guide to improving brain function, enhancing mood and energy, optimizing bodily health and physical performance, and rewiring your nervous system to learn new skills and behaviors that can transform your life.” Being released next Tuesday, “Protocols provides simple, powerful, and evidence-based solutions to life’s most common challenges. Designed to improve your mental health, physical health, and performance, these guidelines are customizable, allowing you to adapt them to your specific needs. With his clear and engaging style, Dr. Huberman explains the scientific principles behind each protocol and how they can deliver immediate, effective results.” British Finds —Barbour x Tuckernuck collection Tuckernuck has partnered up with a favorite long-standing British brand, Barbour, to come up with a collection of quite a few good items for the autumn wardrobe. Loving the scarves, the travel umbrella, and there are a few classic quilted Barbour coats to peek at was well. Don’t forget about the sweaters and button-ups. I have shopped a few below in the scroll. —SHOP THE COLLECTION: —Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale It’s here folks. Both absolutely beyond eager to watch, and yet, reticent as well. Reviewers are in agreement that the finale will please fans – read NYTimes review here, Daily Beast and AP, with The Guardian is skeptical this film will really be the true finale of the Crawleys. And at some point this weekend, I will be watching it in the theater where it deserves to be watched. If you too will be joining the throng of crowds, I hope you enjoy the two hours of this captivating family’s story we’ve been watching since September 2010. Watch an official clip from the film about why Lady Mary’s divorce occurred that begins the film. Cookbooks —Abundance: Stories and Recipes from a Gardening Cook by Mark Diacono Only available in the UK (but you can have it shipped to the US from Blackwells), Abundance: Eating And Living with the Seasons from cook and gardener Mark Diacono looks delicious both in its approach and in its ideas. “With his days distracted by the ping of communication and the tug of commitments, Mark Diacono wondered how he might better savour this one precious life. He started to write and photograph each week, hoping that this simple commitment might sharpen his appreciation of the magic in the everyday and his time spent in the kitchen. It reminds us that abundance comes in many forms – the passing of the seasons, our connection to the world around us, and the wealth that a garden, a town and its surrounding landscapes offers. “With over 80 recipes like Early summer shakshuka, Salsify and radicchio gratin, Onion seed and oregano flower focaccia, Fig leaf and olive oil ice cream, and a Mulberry martini, there are dishes to inspire and satisfy every week as the year unfolds before you.” —Good Things: Recipes and Rituals to Share with People You Love by Samin Nosrat Long awaited from international bestselling cookbook author and star of the Netflix series inspired by the book, Samin Nosrat’s new book Good Things will be released on Tuesday. Described as ” an essential, joyful guide to cooking and living, whether you’re looking for a comforting tomato soup to console a struggling friend, seeking a deeper sense of connection in your life, or hosting a dinner for ten in your too-small dining room. Here you’ll find go-to recipes for ricotta custard pancakes, a showstopping roast chicken burnished with saffron, a crunchy, tingly Calabrian chili crisp, super-chewy sky-high focaccia, and a decades-in-the-making, childhood-evoking yellow cake with chocolate frosting. Along the way, you’ll also find plenty of tips, techniques, and lessons, from how to buy olive oil (check the harvest date) to when to splurge (salad dressing is where you want to use your best ingredients) to the best uses for your pressure cooker (chicken stock and dulce de leche, naturally).” “Enjoy 125 meticulously tested, flavor-forward, soul-nourishing recipes that bring joy and a sense of communion.” Film —Looking Through Water Almost immediately, this new film, starring Michael Douglas and his son, reminded me of On Golden Pond where another real-life parent and child take to the screen to tell a familiar story of healing. Looking Through Water will premiere this weekend in select theaters and tells the story of a father’s attempt to reconnect with his estranged son, doing so by inviting him to compete in a father-son fishing competition.” Have a look at the trailer below. Francophile Finds —French Country Crocks New to the shop at Farm House Pottery from Farmhouse Pottery fromVivi et Margot are French Country Crocks drawing inspiration from “the charm of the French countryside blended with Vermont’s artisanal spirit. These handmade crocks, available in two distinct stoneware finishes, reflect the calming hues of nature and the timeless art of wheel-thrown pottery. Perfect for any kitchen looking to add a touch of rustic beauty, each crock is designed to be a treasured piece in your home, blending form and function for generations to come.” —Van Gogh’s Lover: A Novel by Michael Hetzer I want to first begin by thanking TSLL long-time reader and member Christine for recommending this book to our community. Knowing that art and of course France are frequent subjects of interest, this title is definitely one I think many will enjoy. Released eaerlier this year, Van Gogh’s Lover is inspired by the true story of Vincent Van Gogh’s years in France. The plot begins twelve years after “a high school accident derailed Jane’s once-promising future. When the owners of the powerful Firth Gallery invite Jane to bring her beloved family painting, The Lover, to Switzerland, it looks like a second chance. But on her first night in Geneva, the painting goes missing, and she suspects the Firths.” “Determined to recover her painting, Jane is led to a dying village in the high Alps where an enigmatic man living in a château is waiting for her. Within the château’s walls, she uncovers a history of lies, murder, and, at its heart, an appalling injustice that will shake the art world to its core.” “But not everyone wants these facts brought to light. Jane will need to find the strength she lost in her accident and face the shocking truth about her past, her painting, and, finally, an epic love affair between a destitute painter named Vincent Van Gogh and a mysterious woman who inspired a portrait that may be his greatest work.” Shopping —Banana Republic’s Friends & Family Event, 40% off full priced purchase Beginning today (12th) and running through the 21st, enjoy 40% off any full priced purchase.

The subtle slouch totes are quite popular at the moment, and so long as they provide the structure and the storage paired with comfort to swing over your shoulder, I will take note. RSVP Paris’ parachute appears to check all the boxes. —Varley’s Enrico Knit Jacket, three colors available Autumn is for all intents and purposes, has technically arrived here in Bend, and this knit jacket with flattering collar (and thus warmth when needed but only when needed) with its zipped front looks to be a go-to item to elevate a casual outfit. —Varley’s Tomlinson Belted Long Coat This coat has been getting a lot of buzz as of late, and for good reason. For fewer than $500, a timeless houndstooth (puppytooth, technically) long coat. Not a bad price if it fits your silhouette, and I think it just might fit even thos of us who are tall! Made with double-faced, unlined Melton fabric, it would be a wonderful autumn coat as we transition from cool to colder temps. —Vince scarves, various fabrics Light cotton gauze or sheer wool fabric, the simple color choices to flatter your skin tone, choose a solid or a stripe, and this accessory will be with you for years.

And on Sunday at 5pm Pacific time (8pm Eastern), the 77th annual show takes place. Cue the premieres of just about every returning and new show to begin in the days and weeks to come. —High Potential, season 2 (US version) ABC/Hulu Speaking of which, the mystery series adapted from the original French series HPI (Haut Potentiel Intellectuel) – which by the way you can watch on Hulu as well!, is returning for a second season. High Potential premieres Tuesday September 16th on ABC/Hulu. Having watched a the latest season (4th) of the French version (there are five seasons so far – the fifth is being developed right now), I am curious to know if the American version will follow the same storyline for its main characters.

And boy, does it look to be high drama scene after scene! Whoa!

Wednesday evenings are booked! Have a look at the trailer below and enjoy 10 episodes, taking us all the way to middle of November. The rain came, continued to fall, gushed, created temporary ponds in the roads and roundabouts, then Mother Nature gave us a day of sunshine before cuing the rain’s return. As many will have guessed, the happy dances at Le Papillon were in full swing! So happy am I that we are now tuckered as Nelle demonstrates above. But tuckered in a very good way ☺️. With the weather as it was, the encouragement to stay inside after our walks, meant quite a bit of work occurred on the fourth book, and as I put in the last few sections that after two months away from the book this summer, I realized the book would absolutely do well to have, we’re getting close to done. And that feels amazing. 😌 Last weekend a new family member for the garden was planted, a tree I thought I would have to wait until spring to plant, but it sort of plopped into my lap and I couldn’t say no. I will be sure to share exactly what and where it is in the Garden post later this month, and TOP Tier members can look for the monthly Ponderings . . . post to be shared this weekend. We will be talking about all sorts of stuff including the beginning steps on the Guest Bedroom project. Now that the peaches have been made into jam after sharing the rest with the neighbors, weekends shift away from garden projects (although soon, soon! the cottage gate will be installed!) and into home and life projects which coordinates well with the seasonal shift. Wearing my first scarf on a walk this week, the Outfits of the Month post is full of five outfits taking inspiration from the British while we bring on the layers for fall. And on Monday, Part Trois (3) of What Lies at the Heart of Living Simply Luxuriously was shared as we talked about savoring the everyday ‘sides’ of living well. And before I sign off and send you exploring the links below, check out this photo by enrollee of TSLL’s Intro to French Cooking class. Cassandra knocked it out of the park with her Tian de Légumes didn’t she?

Valuations remain neutral, and our models indicate that the economy has entered a risk-recovery cycle. Having deployed ~15% cash and moderately raised portfolio beta, we believe the major overhang from tariff uncertainty and FII selling is largely behind us. Strong domestic macros—robust GDP growth, GST reforms, tax and rate cuts, low inflation, healthy liquidity, supportive DXY and bond yields, alongside peaked-out downgrades and mutual fund cash levels at 5–6%—all point to a firm base for Indian equities. While global risks persist, the improving US-India dialogue, stable domestic inflows, and improving factor spreads set the stage for a broad-based recovery over the next 12–18 months*. This makes it an opportune time to shift from a defensive to a moderately aggressive stance. Given the low factor spread regime, we are running a balanced multi-factor profile, unlike in the past when we adopted larger style tilts. Large- and mid-caps remain our core focus at ~80% allocation (40% each), with small-caps kept below 20%. Sectorally, our overweight remains in Materials and Financials, supported by selective exposure to Consumption (Discretionary), Industrials, Autos, and Healthcare. Within Financials, we prefer Capital Markets, AMCs, and select NBFCs; within Materials, Metals, Mining, Cement, and Chemicals continue to offer attractive growth and valuation opportunities. Recent portfolio winners include AB Capital, LTF, Radico, HDFC AMC, Endurance, MOSL, Bharti Airtel, Chalet Hotels, Hindalco, Tata Steel, and GMDC”. India’s equity benchmarks are likely to open higher on Friday, tracking global gains, as softer US jobs data overshadowed a hotter-than-expected inflation reading and bolstered bets for Federal Reserve rate cuts. Gift Nifty futures were trading at 25,194 points as of 07:58 a.m. IST, indicating that the benchmark Nifty 50 will open above Thursday’s close of 25,005.5. The number of Americans filing for jobless benefits rose sharply last week, confirming the softness in the labour market, while US retail inflation rose 0.4 per cent month-on-month in August. Indian equity benchmarks set to open higher on Friday, driven by global gains and expectations of Fed rate cuts. The stock of ​Tata Technologies ​has appreciated 4.5 per cent so far this week. On Wednesday, it broke out of the resistance at ₹690, and the price is now above both 21- and 50-day moving averages.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Sept. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the September 30, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day.

More Info Investors in Saudi Aramco’s Jafurah natural gas project have approached a group of lenders to secure $10.3 billion in funding for the project. Jafurah is at the center of Saudi Arabia’s plans to develop its natural gas resources, diversifying from crude oil. With a price tag of a total $100 billion, the Jafurah development is described as the largest unconventional gas development outside the United States. Its reserves are estimated at some 229 trillion cu ft of natural gas plus 75 billion barrels of condensate. Production has been scheduled to start in the current quarter. According to Reuters, BlackRock, via Global Infrastructure Partners, is in talks with potential lenders interested in funding the project. These include JP Morgan and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, unnamed sources in the know told the publication. The source said BlackRock will contribute $1.8 billion of its own money to the total. According to Bloomberg, which also cited unnamed sources, the funding has already been secured. Per the Bloomberg sources, the funding package consists of a seven-year loan that could be refinanced on the bond market and a 19-year loan facility. In addition to the abovementioned banks, the banks involved in the loans also include Citi, Mitsubishi UFJ, and Mizuho. The news of the loan deal comes a month after Aramco sealed a deal with Blackrock’s Global Infrastructure Partners to invest $11 billion in a lease deal for Jafurah. Under the agreement, the BlackRock-led group will lease midstream facilities that serve Jafurah and then lease them back to Aramco for 20 years. The two set up a subsidiary company to manage the midstream facilities that BlackRock will lease, in which Aramco got 51% and BlackRock got 49%. Earlier in the year, Aramco also announced the signing of a slew of contracts for the Phase 2 development of Jafurah. The contracts’ total value was $12.4 billion, to involve the construction of gas compression facilities and associated pipelines, expansion of the Jafurah Gas Plant—including the construction of gas processing trains—and utilities, sulfur, and export facilities. Another $8.8 billion worth of contractual work was awarded to companies that will expand the project’s Master Gas System to boost its total capacity by an additional 3.15 billion standard cubic feet per day by 2028 through the installation of around 4,000 km (2,485 miles) of pipelines and 17 new gas compression trains. The billions have been piling up as Aramco moves the project closer to commercial production. While not known for being stingy, Saudi Arabia has clearly made a priority of developing its natural gas reserves and not a moment too soon, either. Despite attempts by the climate change activist lobby to discourage natural gas use due to emissions—natural gas demand has been on a strong and steady rise. The latest driver of this demand, of course, is the artificial intelligence race between IT giants that everyone in forecasting expects will fuel a veritable surge in electricity demand. Just this week, the Energy Information Administration reiterated its prediction that electricity consumption in the United States this year and next will hit a record high. America’s power use will hit 4,187 billion kilowatt-hours in 2025 and then rise to 4,305 billion kWh in 2026, according to the latest edition of the EIA’s Short-Term Energy Outlook. The previous record of 4,097 billion kWh was set in 2024. Gas demand is rising globally, too, opening up a growing market to Aramco, which plans to ramp up the country’s natural gas production by as much as 60% by 2030 from 2021 levels, when gas production stood at 10.1 billion cu ft, according to Aramco.

Title: LNG carbon bomb tops Carney’s list of major projects

Time Published: 2025-09-11T22:17:15Z

Prime Minister Mark Carney hammers a few nails at a carpentry school before announcing five major projects as part of his plan for Canada to navigate changing trade relationships in Edmonton on Thursday September 11, 2025. Photo by: Amber Bracken / The Canadian Press A major carbon bomb sits atop Prime Minister Mark Carney’s first tranche of major projects, sparking backlash from environmental and Indigenous communities who say that doubling down on liquified natural gas is placing a dangerous bet on Canada’s future. The LNG Canada terminal in Kitimat, BC, is the primary way to export liquified natural gas (LNG) from the Montney Play. This region of British Columbia and Alberta is home to gas fields that, if fully tapped, would surpass Canada’s 2030 emissions targets 30 times over. It is a globally recognized “carbon bomb,” and LNG Canada Phase 2 — that doubles capacity at the site, making it the second largest facility of its kind in the world — was announced Thursday as a priority for Ottawa. The remaining projects include: The Darlington New Nuclear project in Ontario; The Port of Montreal’s Contrecœur terminal expansion in Quebec; McIlvenna Bay Foran Copper Mine project in Saskatchewan; Red Chris Mine expansion project in BC. Thursday’s announcement is a major step on a central campaign promise made by Carney to rapidly build major infrastructure. Speaking in Edmonton, he said the first batch of major projects would add $60 billion to the country’s economy. “For too long, when federal agencies have examined a project, their immediate question has been, ‘Why?’” Carney said. “From now on, Canada's new government starts by asking ourselves for major projects: How? How can we do it bigger? How can we do it faster?” Carney did not say how much federal financial support the companies building these projects would receive, but acknowledged projects would likely get some federal funding. Regardless, even by sending them to the newly launched Major Projects Office to help coordinate financing, public resources are being spent to push these projects over the finish line. The five projects Carney will now send to the Major Projects Office for review were already well under development, with some scheduled to begin operations next year. He acknowledged as much, noting that the first tranche of projects are owned by proponents who “have already done much of the hard work,” and “already meet many of the necessary regulatory standards.” In fact, government sources earlier told Canada’s National Observer that having the project already underway was one of two basic criteria used to choose the first round, making it easier for Ottawa to score political points for successfully completing it. The other was that the project is considered “stuck” in the regulatory process. “I'm not at all surprised they would pick projects that are already in the system,” said Martin Olszynski, an associate professor and chair of energy, resources and sustainability at the University of Calgary. “The idea is they'll be hustled the rest of the way.” At an estimated cost of $25 billion, LNG Canada Phase 2 is the largest in the first round of major projects. Environmental advocates and Indigenous leaders, key constituents and rights-holders who Carney has promised to respect, were quick to condemn it. Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs president, said in a statement he was “gravely concerned” that the federal government is “deliberately” sidestepping its duty to consult First Nations. “Rather than being met with partnership, we are given an ultimatum: accept fossil fuel expansion or be pushed aside,” he said. “LNG Canada is not only a massive source of greenhouse gas emissions, but also drives destructive fracking, further threatening our lands, waters and communities — emissions do not recognize territorial boundaries. “We reject any process that tramples our inherent and constitutionally protected title and rights, ignores free, prior and informed consent, and sacrifices the climate for foreign corporate profits,” he added. LNG Canada’s owners are Shell, Mitsubishi, the Korea Gas Corporation, Petronas and PetroChina. An analysis from TD described Carney’s inclusion of LNG Canada Phase 2 as “superficial support,” because whether or not the project actually goes ahead depends on its owners. The bank said it would have liked to have seen the Ksi Lisims LNG and related Prince Rupert Gas Transmission Pipeline projects included to indicate federal support for the LNG sector. An analysis from Clean Energy Canada, published last year, estimates the greenhouse gas emissions from the already operating LNG Canada site are economically devastating. Doubling the export terminals capacity dramatically increases that harm. Specifically, the think tank found that the annual social cost of carbon — a widely used metric to approximate economic damages (such as health care costs) per tonne of greenhouse gas emissions — estimates $11.1 billion in damages by 2030 and annual costs of $14.8 billion by 2050. If Phase 2 were built, by 2050 the annual social cost of carbon emissions from the LNG Canada site soars to $29.6 billion. Over the project’s decades-long lifecycle, both phases of the project amount to nearly $1 trillion in damages — a supreme liability hanging over the country’s head, following the International Court of Justice’s finding this summer that countries could be held responsible for knowingly committing climate harm. Beyond its climate harm, forecasts suggest a global supply glut of LNG is looming, making new investments economically risky. “It's not in our national interest to increase our carbon emissions when we've had devastating fires year after year,” said Richard Brooks, climate finance director with Stand.earth. “They're exactly the opposite of what we should be doing.” Olszynski said he understands why many will be upset about LNG Canada Phase 2’s inclusion, but given the economic system we have, it’s not surprising to see it included. Even if risking “white elephants” — a term for major stranded assets — if banks are willing to invest, projects are likely to see those investment dollars flow. “There's the world that we want, and the world as it is,” he said. There’s a constant tension in market-based economies between planning for the future and market forces looking to profit in the short term. “There will always be forces pushing for more planning [and] for more logic, and then there will be those who push very strongly against them, and say that is contrary to market principles where the market will decide, that markets are efficient, and that markets will figure this out.” “(Former prime minister) Trudeau probably was prepared to tip the scales more towards planning [than] the current prime minister,” he said. Given the trade threats from the United States and push to diversify Canada’s trading partners, alongside the state of the Canadian economy as is, Carney “is saying I can't keep pissing those guys off — the folks who control the purse strings.” The Darlington nuclear project is a multi-billion dollar investment in small modular reactors. Once in operation, Carney said it would drive $500 million annually into Ontario’s nuclear supply chain and provide enough electricity to power 1.2 million homes. Ontario Power Generation was granted a licence earlier this year to begin construction. The two mining projects in the first tranche, the McIlvenna Bay copper mine in Saskatchewan and the Red Chris copper and gold mine in northwestern BC, Carney said would strengthen Canada’s position in the global critical minerals trade. The Red Chris copper mine, owned by Colorado-headquartered Newmont — whose majority shareholders include powerful US financial firms Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street and Van Eck Associates — has been fought by conservation groups and First Nations warning of risks to the environment. In a letter filed with the BC government, the SkeenaWild Conservation Trust warns the planned expansion will lead to sulphate, copper and selenium concentrations “exceeding” BC water quality guidelines. Similarly, a letter from the Central Council of the Tlingit & Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska says “we are alarmed by reports of ongoing seepage at the Red Chris site and the failure to contain contaminated surface waters.” “This is an urgent matter that demands enforcement action — not expansion,” the letter adds. Foran Mining Corporation — whose major shareholders include US-based Agnico Eagle Mines, Toronto-headquartered Fairfax Financial and the Public Sector Pension Investment Board — is developing the McIlvenna Bay Copper Mine in Saskatchewan. In recent years, the project has been protested by members of the Peter Ballantyne Cree Nation. The mining project threatens at-risk woodland caribou and 13 hectares of muskeg — valuable peatlands that absorb carbon dioxide from the air. Carney had previously teased that the Contrecœur expansion project at the Port of Montreal would make his list of major projects. The expansion, fought by environmentalists due to its impact on critical habitats for fish and frogs, involves a new container terminal to handle an additional 1.1 million containers per year, and was already planned and receiving cash from Quebec. It is scheduled to begin operations in 2029. Earlier this year, Xavier Barsalou-Duval, transportation, infrastructure and communities critic with the Bloc Québécois called on Carney to not include it as a project in the national interest. “A project of this magnitude should only proceed if it can be demonstrated that it can be carried out in strict compliance with existing environmental standards,” he said. “This burden, which falls to the Port of Montreal, must not be shirked or truncated by the Liberal government.” Carney said several other major projects are far from being ready, but are worth considering. He is asking the Major Projects Office to create business development teams to help advance them. The Major Projects Office will consider regulations, financing and supply chains for critical minerals, including in the priority areas of Ontario’s Ring of Fire, the Slave Geological Area in the Northwest Territories and in the Labrador Trough overlapping Québec and Labrador. The office will also study large-scale clean power with a focus on Nova Scotia’s proposed Wind West project. Carney said the offshore wind megaproject could generate one quarter of Canada’s entire electricity demand, and should be studied in tandem with the Energy East Partnership (a proposal to strengthen Atlantic Canada’s power grids) and the development of Gull Island being pursued by Québec and Newfoundland and Labrador. An “Arctic Economic and Security Corridor” will also be pursued, Carney said. The project would be anchored by a new port at Grays Bay in Nunavut, and include new roads and military capabilities. Upgrading the Port of Churchill will also be considered with plans to increase port capacity, rail lines, marine ice-breaking capabilities and an “energy corridor” to be studied, he said. The project would be developed with Manitoba’s Crown-Indigenous Corporation. Delivering on high-speed rail between Quebec City and Toronto is also a goal the Major Projects Office will study, with plans to be put in place within four years. Carney said the Major Projects Office will also help develop a “Canadian Sovereign Cloud,” to build computing capacity and data centres he framed as essential to economic competitiveness with artificial intelligence and quantum computing. The last major initiative the Major Projects Office will study promises to be controversial. The Pathways Alliance’s $16.5-billion proposal to pipe carbon dioxide captured from oilsands sites in northern Alberta to an underground storage site south of Cold Lake, will be considered. Carney dubbed the project “Pathways Plus” — with the plus being the possibility of a new oil pipeline being built, if the carbon capture megaproject is built. He framed the possibility as a way to strike a grand bargain as Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has called for, that could see “decarbonized oil” flow to new markets. As previously reported by Canada’s National Observer, “decarbonized oil” is not a credible term, leading climate scientists say. Carney said a second tranche of major projects to be referred to the Major Projects Office would be announced by Nov. 16. Geoffrey Pounder | September 11th 2025, 04:37 pm Carney: “For too long, when federal agencies have examined a project, their immediate question has been, ‘Why?’ From now on, Canada's new government starts by asking ourselves for major projects: How? How can we do it bigger? How can we do it faster?” Yes, let's not ask ourselves why or if we should build a project. Let's not ask ourselves whether a project is worth doing. Let's not conduct a cost-benefit analysis. Let's not identify and quantify the impacts of projects, singly and cumulatively. Let's just do it. Let's just go straight to figuring out how to build projects. Bigger and faster. In what world does that strategy make a lick of sense? In what world does failure to plan not lead to disaster? Cost overruns, delays, bad design, unforeseen consequences, not to mention local opposition? How is this good government? Geoffrey Pounder | September 11th 2025, 04:39 pm Article: "Environmental advocates and Indigenous leaders, key constituents and rights-holders who Carney has promised to respect, were quick to condemn it." Our trusty reporter fails to mention the not inconsiderable indigenous support for LNG: - Haisla Nation: A majority owner of the Cedar LNG project, partnering with Pembina Pipeline Corporation. - Nisg̱a'a Nation: A joint venture partner in the Ksi Lisims LNG project. - Gitxaala, Kitselas, Yekooche, and Stellat'en First Nations have signed benefits agreements related to LNG development. - Gitxsan Nation: Supports the natural gas pipeline that would supply the Ksi Lisims LNG project. Some indigenous communities see fossil-fuel "development" as their path out of decades of poverty. To what extent indigenous support is coerced is another question. If they do not have the right to say NO, their YES does not mean much. Alex Botta | September 12th 2025, 01:07 pm In reply to Article: "Environmental… by Geoffrey Pounder Yes, there is Indigenous support for LNG. There are are also Indigenous opponents, and that has caused a division among and within First Nations. Those who have an equity stake will enjoy significant revenue up to what ever ceiling evolves, perhaps less than the original hype due to cost overruns during the construction of supply infrastructure meeting a supply glut and undercutting international competition. Or perhaps a longer run of returns into the mid-2030s out to 2040 where a peak in demand is looming. Either way, support among BC's First Nations for LNG, as mixed as it is, will never in a million years be reflected in another Northern Gateway pipeline proposal carrying diluted bitumen. Roy Brander | September 12th 2025, 09:08 am It's a mistake to think Carney has that much agency. His votes were a frankly unnatural reverse of what was going to happen, last election. It could flip back any time if he is seen as "weak". (Biden didn't fall because he sounded senile; Trump has sounded senile for years. Biden's sin was to appear weak.) The (insane, but real) prevailing belief is that traditional solutions are "strong" and new, untried technologies are "weak". Those who remember PCs vs Mainframes in 1980s corporations recall when that was the dynamic for IT. The LNG expansion is the hardest proposal to fight, because it leverages the sunk cost of the existing plant, the site and the foundations and pipes and powerlines to it. It's the smallest concession he could make, frankly. And climate activists should have a little confidence that the new technologies are not weak, and that their strength will be quite obvious to all, not just to experts, in five more years. By the time this expansion is built, there will be no calls for more. Tris Pargeter | September 12th 2025, 11:07 am Martin Olszynski is right; he sees the POLITICAL realities that unfortunately but absolutely NECESSARILY preclude the full-scale climate change action required, a situation that is also very much mirrored in Europe right now, making Carney's unprecedented effort to turn away from the States and toward the EU the most important message. Ultimately, that involves OUR economy as it IS, banks and big corporations very much included, unfortunately. So for all the purists and activists who are currently threatening what political capital progressives currently HAVE, barely but most fortuitously wrested away from the cons, again I point out that you are ALL becoming part of the problem, heroic though you claim to be. For many of you, I quote Falstaff who said "honor is a mere scutcheon," and for many more I'd say wake up and smell the coffee because this is as good as it gets UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, which we ALL are, always. The Liberals are also forming an environmental caucus for us all, proof of why they are the only rational choice and we're lucky to have them AND Carney, period. He summed up the situation recently when a reporter questioned his choice of an adviser who was involved with the tobacco industry by pointing out that last time he checked that although he doesn't approve of any of it, there IS a tobacco industry and it is NOT illegal to smoke. The same can unfortunately still be said for the fossil fuel industry, but people still need to heat their homes and drive their cars to work. Because the stakes are much higher, in fact couldn't be higher, all the more reason we need unusually adroit leadership, which we fortunately HAVE. Paul Berger | September 12th 2025, 09:13 pm In reply to Martin Olszynski is right;… by Tris Pargeter Causing the immense suffering of others may be slightly better than causing very immense suffering, but that's a very low bar. We would be fortunate if the Liberals had been climate leaders in any real sense in the last decade. No matter what Carney does, he's already lost in sending the message, consistent with JT, that we're not in a climate emergency. For shame.

Adobe (ADBE) just reported record quarterly revenue driven by artificial intelligence gains. Will it revive confidence in the stock? The creative software giant late Thursday posted adjusted earnings per share of $5.31 on revenue that jumped 11% year-over-year to a record $5.99 billion in the fiscal third quarter, above analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha, as AI revenues topped company targets. CEO Shantanu Narayen said that with the third-quarter's revenue driven by AI, Adobe has already surpassed its "AI-first" revenue goals for the year, leading the company to boost its outlook. The company said it now anticipates full-year adjusted earnings of $20.80 to $20.85 per share and revenue of $23.65 billion to $23.7 billion, up from adjusted earnings of $20.50 to $20.70 on revenue of $23.50 billion to $23.6 billion previously. Shares of Adobe were recently rising in late trading. But they've had a tough year so far, with the stock down more than 20% for 2025 through Thursday's close amid worries about the company's AI progress and growing competition. Wall Street is optimistic. The shares finished Thursday a bit below $351, and the mean price target as tracked by Visible Alpha, above $461, represents a more than 30% premium. Most of the analysts tracking the stock have "buy" ratings. But even that target represents a degree of caution in the context of recent highs. The shares were above $600 in February 2024.

Title: David Ellison shows he's serious about fighting Netflix and Disney for Hollywood's crown

Time Published: 2025-09-11T21:13:39Z
Full Content:
David Ellison just showed he's serious about challenging Netflix and Disney for the Hollywood crown — and he's moving at lightning speed. The media mogul and his new company, Paramount Skydance, are preparing a bid for rival Warner Bros. Discovery, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. Business Insider couldn't independently confirm the report. WBD declined to comment, and Paramount didn't respond to requests for comments. The news sent waves through the media industry, in part because of how quickly Ellison seems to be moving to consolidate power. As a reminder, the deal that combined his company, Skydance, with Paramount closed just last month. It helps that Ellison has the financial backing of his father, Larry Ellison, who briefly surpassed Elon Musk as the world's richest person this week. WBD had planned to split into two companies, Warner Bros. and Discovery Global, next year. Paramount is preparing a majority cash bid for the whole company, backed by the Ellison family, the WSJ reported. Together, Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery — which owns assets like the Warner Bros. film and TV studios and the HBO Max streaming service — would create a Hollywood titan. "There's absolutely no doubt that a combination of these two companies would result in the deepest roster of blockbuster franchise IP in all of Hollywood," said Brandon Katz, the insights and content strategy director at entertainment data provider Greenlight Analytics. It would also give Ellison a host of cable TV networks like CNN and some additional sports rights, and create potential antitrust scrutiny. Such a merger would make it clear that Ellison wants to compete with the industry leaders, not just shepherd Paramount into the streaming era. Before this news, Ellison had already hinted at grander ambitions, signing a $7.7 billion UFC deal less than a week after the Paramount-Skydance deal closed. Even with the merger, competing with Netflix and Disney would be an uphill battle. Paramount+ and HBO Max combined would have ranked fifth among streaming services in watchtime on US connected TVs in July, according to Nielsen — behind YouTube, Netflix, Disney+ with Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video. "A mash-up of both streaming services would require a very expensive and long technological revamp that isn't guaranteed to spur subscriber growth and slow churn," Katz said. Still, Wall Street is thrilled with the potential combination. On Thursday afternoon, WBD's stock soared as much as 37%, while Paramount shares spiked more than 10%. One reason: potential cost savings. A marriage between two major studios would lead to efficiencies, likely including major layoffs. For Hollywood's creative community, it would mean one fewer buyer, further consolidating Tinseltown. "There's one less green light place in town, which puts pressure on the agents and managers," an advisor close to both companies said. But that one company would also have a lot of money to spend, this person added. On Wednesday at a Goldmach Sachs media conference, WBD CEO David Zaslav predicted the streaming landscape would "rationalize" further, leaving just a few superpowers remaining. "Right now, there's only five global players: there's Amazon, Netflix, Disney, us, and YouTube," Zaslav said. He didn't mention Paramount. With such a deal, Ellison would show he's committed to being one of the entertainment giants left standing. Jump to

The report comes in the same week as Nasdaq filed with the SEC to trade tokenized stocks and ETFs on its platform. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock explores tokenizing exchange-traded fund (ETF) shares as part of its push to expand its digital asset infrastructure beyond traditional market boundaries. As Bloomberg News reported on Sept. 11, the firm weighs creating blockchain-based versions of ETFs tied to real-world assets (RWA), including stocks, according to sources familiar with the confidential planning. The initiative builds on BlackRock’s $2.2 billion BUIDL tokenized money-market fund, launched in March 2024, two months after the debut of its Bitcoin ETF. CEO Larry Fink previously stated that every financial asset can be tokenized, most recently reiterating it in his 2025 annual letter to investors. Tokenized ETF shares would enable trading beyond Wall Street’s standard hours, improve international access to US products, and create new collateral opportunities within crypto networks. The report comes in the same week as Nasdaq filed with the SEC to trade tokenized stocks and ETFs on its platform. BlackRock has tested tokenized fund shares through JPMorgan’s Kinexys infrastructure and positioned itself as an early adopter of digital settlement models.

Stay connected via Money-market funds from Franklin Templeton and BlackRock opened the pathway for the largest tokenization efforts. Excluding private credit, tokenized money funds are the largest RWA category, with a $7.4 billion market cap as of Sept. 11. At the same time, ETFs offer broader asset exposure and trading mechanics that are well-suited for blockchain deployment. Exchanges including Kraken, Robinhood, and Coinbase already offer tokenized stocks internationally or plan to do so. However, the report noted that current challenges include reconciling ETF settlement through Wall Street clearinghouses with blockchain’s instant, 24-hour trading capabilities. These challenges create technical and regulatory questions for custodians managing the transition between traditional and digital infrastructure. BlackRock’s exploration reflects mainstream finance’s evaluation of blockchain technology for enhancing market infrastructure, including improvements in collateral flows and settlement speed. The firm’s digital asset advocacy, combined with regulatory shifts, positions tokenized ETFs as another bridge between traditional and decentralized finance systems.

September 11, 2025 16:24 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Sept. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Novo Nordisk A/S ("Novo" or the "Company") (NYSE: NVO) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form-3?prid=166368&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until September 30, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate. WHY LEVI & KORSINSKY: Over the past 20 years, the team at Levi & Korsinsky has secured hundreds of millions of dollars for aggrieved shareholders and built a track record of winning high-stakes cases. Our firm has extensive expertise representing investors in complex securities litigation and a team of over 70 employees to serve our clients.

Shares in the New York-based firm are expected to begin trading Friday, concluding the IPO process that first began when it filed its intentions with the SEC in June. Here’s everything you need to know about the Gemini IPO. More than 16 million shares of GEMI will be offered by the exchange in the price range of $24-26, potentially netting the firm around $433 million in IPO proceeds based on its recent upsized filing. Even at that number, which increased from a previously expected share price range of $17-19, Reuters reported that the firm’s offering was oversubscribed by as much as 20 times. Based on the upper range of the expected share price, Gemini could surpass an initial valuation of $3 billion. Though the firm is offering up 16.67 million shares, it requested that underwriters reserve 10% of the supply—or around 1.67 million shares—for sale through a “directed share program,” which will offer them exclusively to select parties. Gemini is perhaps best known for its co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, early Bitcoin and cryptocurrency believers that vocally and financially supported President Donald Trump in his bid to reclaim the presidency in 2024. They also played a key role in the creation of Facebook, as chronicled in the film “The Social Network.” The firm primarily generates its revenue from trading fees earned via the use of its centralized exchange. According to its IPO filing, nearly 70% of the firm’s revenue was earned in this manner during 2024. Last year, the firm generated $142.2 million in revenue, yet sustained a net income loss of $158.5 million. Through the first six months of this year, the firm’s percentage of trading fee revenue dipped to 65.5%, pulling in total revenue of $68.6 million. That puts it on track to finish just below last year’s revenue number. In the same timeframe, the firm generated a net income loss of $282.5 million. Despite the sagging income numbers, the firm remains optimistic about its future. Gemini wrote in its filing that based on its “focus on innovation and a long history of firsts in the crypto industry, we believe our products and services can fulfill the needs of our ever-expanding user base, including as traditional financial market participants enter the space.” Gemini’s intentions to go public came shortly after the massively successful IPO of stablecoin issuer, Circle. Like Gemini, Circle upsized its IPO and still more than tripled the offering price on the first day of trading, outperforming public launches from tech giants like Meta and Airbnb in the process. Since Circle’s IPO, crypto exchanges like Kraken and Gemini filed their intentions to go public. Crypto exchange Bullish also recently completed its IPO, similarly screaming out of the gate and tripling after hitting the market. American Bitcoin, the BTC mining firm co-founded by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, also surged after its recent launch. On Thursday, crypto lender Figure raised more than $787 million in its IPO, ultimately notching a valuation of $5.29 billion. Shares jumped more than 24% from the IPO price once they hit the market for trading. As barriers to entry for buying and selling cryptocurrency have decreased, centralized exchanges like Gemini and rivals Coinbase and Binance have become increasingly competitive in trying to acquire and maintain users. Based on its filing, Gemini is hoping to increase both its monthly transacting users and the average daily trading volume of those users. It aims to do so via expanding its product suite, expanding internationally, and growing its derivative offerings—and a big chunk of IPO cash could help it accomplish those goals.

September 11, 2025 15:36 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Sept. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases.

Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

BlackRock is exploring how to bring exchange-traded funds (ETFs) onto public blockchains, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. The sources said the asset manager is weighing tokenizing funds tied to real-world assets such as stocks, though any rollout would depend on regulatory approval. The discussions follow BlackRock’s first experiment with tokenization last year. The firm introduced the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, also known as BUIDL. The fund, which is backed by short-term U.S. Treasuries, repurchase agreements and cash, has quickly grown into the world’s largest tokenized Treasury product, managing nearly $2.2 billion. Tokenizing ETFs would represent a deeper step into blockchain-based financial products. In practice, it would mean that shares of the funds — traditionally traded on stock exchanges during market hours — could be issued and transacted as tokens on chain. Proponents argue this shift could bring clear benefits. A tokenized ETF could be traded around the clock, rather than only during exchange hours. Settlement, which often takes two business days in traditional finance, could be completed within minutes. Investors in markets where ETFs are not easily accessible might gain exposure through blockchain rails. The products are pending a green light from regulators, the people said. BlackRock’s exploration underscores a wider trend across finance, as banks, fintechs and asset managers test blockchain rails for bonds, private credit and now mainstream equity funds.

Title: Watch These Broadcom Price Levels After Stock's Recent Rally on AI Optimism

Broadcom (AVGO) shares rallied to an all-time high this week as the chipmaker positions itself as a key competitor to AI favorite Nvidia (NVDA). The stock surged nearly 10% to a record close near $370 Wednesday, before pulling back slightly in Thursday's session. They've added more than half their value since the start of the year, with a close to 20% gain over the past five days alone, boosted by the company’s strong quarterly results, a new $10 billion customer, and the resurgence of the AI trade after Oracle (ORCL) reported a massive increase in its backlog. In a note to clients on Monday, Melius Research analysts said they expect Broadcom could gain about 30% of the AI compute market, while Nvidia’s market share falls over time. Below, we break down the technicals on Broadcom’s weekly chart and identify key price levels to watch after the stock’s recent bullish run. After retracing just below the 50-week moving average in March, Broadcom shares have staged an impressive reversal, with gains accelerating recently after the chipmaker’s quarterly results. While above-average trading volume has signaled buying conviction, the relative strength index warns of overbought conditions, with the indicator reaching a level that preceded major consolidation phases in the stock during late 2021 and mid-2023. Let’s use technical analysis to forecast how a long-term uptrend for Broadcom could play out, and also identify support levels worth watching during potential retracements. Investors can use bars pattern analysis to project a potential bullish price target and speculate how high the stock could go from here. When applying the technique to Broadcom’s chart, we take the stock’s uptrend from May 2023 to June 2024 and overlay it from the start of last week’s bullish move. This indicates a period of consolidation for several months before a possible rally toward $680 by October next year, if price action rhymes with the prior trend. The earlier trend began with two weekly price bars that delivered a combined gain of 27%, compared to the over 20% cumulative advance of the two most recent weekly bars. During potential pullbacks in the stock, it’s initially worth tracking the $250 level. This area on the chart may provide support near the stock’s December and January twin peaks. Selling below this level could see the Broadcom shares revisit lower support around $185. Investors may seek entry points in this location near the upper range of a consolidation period that formed on the chart between June and November last year.

Meta Ray-Bans have often been very difficult to find in stock at both retailers and online stores for the past two years -- and they rarely go on sale. But one of the best ways to not only get a 20% discount but also find some of the styles that have been discontinued or are rarely ever in stock is to use the little-known Meta Refurbished AI Glasses online store. I recently ordered a pair of Meta Ray-Bans in the Skylar style with the Shiny Caramel finish with Polar Brown lenses. If you've followed Meta Ray-Bans, then you've probably seen these before because they are in a lot of the Meta promotional materials. The frames themselves are semi-transparent, so you can see a lot of the technology inside. And the lenses have that amber tint that's popular in lots of sunglasses because it gives the world a bit of warm orange glow. I was able to buy these for $263, even though they normally retail for $329. Other configurations, like the black with blue transition lenses, were as much as $76 off. As of the writing of this article, Meta's refurbished store was selling the Wayfarer, Headliner, and Skyler styles. The Wayfarer is the most common style, while the Headliner and Skyler can be more difficult to find. Also: 5 Meta Ray-Ban upgrades I want to see on September 17 When my transparent brown Meta Ray-Bans arrived, they were in the original box and it was unopened, with the perforated pull tag still in perfect condition -- no different than the box of the original pair of black Meta Ray-Bans I bought when the product first launched two years ago. When I opened the box, everything was in perfect order, just like a new pair. All the accessories, booklets, polishing cloth, and even the paper protectors over the arms of the glasses were just as they are in the packaging of a brand-new pair of Meta Ray-Bans that you'd buy at retail or online. Also: I tried Meta's new Oakley smart glasses in my production studio - my verdict as a content creator I pulled the little protective tab inside the case to activate charging and plugged the case into a USB. After about 30 minutes, I opened the Meta AI app, tapped the glasses button on the far right, hit the plus sign in the upper right corner, and tapped on the Ray-Ban | Meta button. The software immediately recognized that a pair of glasses was in a case nearby. I accepted the prompt and tapped through the menus. I pulled the glasses out of the case and examined them, and they were in perfect condition. I put them on and immediately started using them like the other pairs of Meta Ray-Bans I've been testing and using for the past couple of years. So if these are just like new and sold at a discount, then what does it mean when you buy a refurbished tech product? These are typically products that have been lightly used and a customer returned or traded in for another product, or that originally had small defects. They go back to the manufacturer for inspection, cleaning, repair (if needed), and another round of quality assurance. Also: I tried smart glasses with a built-in display, and they beat my Meta Ray-Bans in key ways They are then repacked, often in the same original packaging as new products. However, both the US and the European Union have regulations that require refurbished products to be marked and sold as refurbished, and can't be passed off as new products. That's why they are typically discounted, even though in many cases they are as good as new. In the case of refurbished Meta Ray-Bans, when you buy through the Meta Refurbished AI Glasses online store, then Meta offers a 30-day return policy and a 1-year warranty. Based on my experience, I have no problem recommending that you buy a refurbished pair of these smart glasses, if one of the styles you like is available. Keep in mind that Meta is likely to unveil its next-generation Meta Ray-Bans Smart Glasses on September 17 at its Meta Connect event. These could have new features like longer battery life and better cameras -- two of the items on my wish list. It's unclear if they will be more expensive, but it appears possible if they are integrating better technology, and there's also the uncertain US tariff situation that could impact the cost of parts. The recently released Oakley Meta Smart Glasses have some nice tech upgrades and retail for $400-$500. That could be an indication of where the prices of the new Meta Ray-Bans are going to land. If that's the case, the deal on these refurbished Meta Ray-Bans could look even better.

Title: If There Is No Welfare State, What Would Europe’s Social Contract Be?
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/09/if-there-is-no-welfare-state-what-would-europes-social-contract-be.html
Time Published: 2025-09-11T18:00:46Z
Full Content:
The underlying social contract between individuals and the state in Western European nations over the last hundred years has been that the state would grow to regulate and tax virtually every sphere of life—public or private—in exchange for a measure of order and comfort for its citizens. If the state begins to reduce those comforts as order starts disintegrating, but continues to grow and to tax even more, it could be interpreted as a breach of the terms of the agreement. As I was finishing this article, France’s youngest citizens took to the streets to defend the welfare state under the banner of the “Block Everything” movement. Their demands include greater investment in public health and education, rent controls, retirement at 60, and stronger environmental policies. Protesters have erected barricades, blocked highways and public-transport stations, in an effort to bring the country to a standstill. More than 400 people were arrested. The demonstrations erupted after President Macron appointed Sébastien Lecornu as prime minister, a move widely seen as signaling the continuation of his predecessor’s austerity policies. These protests underscore the central argument of this article: the welfare state is the social contract that binds Western European citizens to their governments. When those benefits are eroded, many view it as a breach of that contract—one that, in their eyes, justifies civil disobedience. Friedrich Merz, often dubbed Germany’s “BlackRock” chancellor, has already indicated that there has to be a reduction in state benefits: “The welfare state as we know it today is no longer economically sustainable with what we are producing as a national economy.” That the welfare state suffers from a viability problem is not news. What is news is that the head of the largest economy in the eurozone, with a relatively low debt-to-GDP ratio (~65%), is publicly preparing citizens for a rollback of state benefits. But Germany is not alone in this conundrum. France’s government, the second-largest economy in the eurozone, with a much higher debt-to-GDP ratio (~119%), has lost a confidence vote in parliament and been dissolved over a budget that slashes public spending. According to deposed Prime Minister François Bayrou, nearly €44 billion in cuts is necessary because, he argues, France has not balanced its budget for roughly 50 years. The economy is expected to grow by no more than 0.6% in 2025, with a public deficit of about 6%. Some have even floated the prospect of an IMF bailout. Another European nation that might need an IMF bailout—perhaps even more urgently than France—is the UK. The UK’s debt is becoming significantly more expensive to service due to a sharp rise in borrowing costs, which now amount to over £100 billion annually—nearly 10% of the national budget. This comes despite decades of mass privatization of social services. According to many economists, both France and the UK are going downhill in slow motion toward a debt crisis. The Wall Street Journal, of course, has no doubt why this is happening: “Britain and France aren’t illiquid. They’re insolvent. Their future spending commitments, primarily in the form of expected social-welfare and old-age benefit payouts, far exceed any realistic estimate of the economic growth that will be available to pay those bills.” Other European nations, such as Spain—whose GDP is expected to grow around 2.5% in 2025—will face a very similar problem with their welfare systems. Spain’s debt-to-GDP ratio is around 100% (compared to Germany’s ~65%), but its share of the budget devoted to social services is almost identical. Spain’s current growth is predicated on a general increase in the money supply and a relatively successful immigration strategy over the last two decades. The immigrant population has gone from 3.5 million in 2005 to 7 million in 2025. This has contributed to lower GDP per capita, which is why many Spaniards have barely felt the macroeconomic growth. Despite immigration, the birth rate in Spain is among the lowest in Europe (1.12, lower than Germany, France, and the UK), which makes the long-term sustainability of the welfare state questionable under the logic that it is the current workforce that pays for it. The case for slashing public spending is usually the same: slower economic growth and a smaller workforce reduce the state’s revenues, while the aging population continues to grow and unemployment rises due to slower economic growth. This discourse presents budget cuts as almost inevitable and frames “slower economic growth” as a natural phenomenon, almost like a drought, occurring outside the control of politicians. That it is outside the control of politicians—who have limited control over financial policy—might be correct for the most part. However, to present it as a natural phenomenon implies assuming that markets operate under objective natural forces, like gravity, unaffected by the actors involved. That is simply not the case. The “markets” respond to the actions of individuals and companies. A case in point is the 2008 crash, which was brought about by a set of specific practices, such as the sale of mortgage derivatives, which were known—at least by some—to be fraudulent and to potentially cause the collapse of the entire system. The 2008 crisis is a good example because the financial crisis engineered by big financiers, with or without knowledge, was ultimately paid for by ordinary citizens, and virtually no one was held accountable. It will again be ordinary citizens who pay the price of the geopolitical crisis that now affects Europe with the war in Ukraine. The conflict has unleashed war momentum against the interests of most European citizens, both economically and existentially, which could have been avoided or at least settled early on. Its effects are now precipitating a collapse of European economies and societies. It is not that Europe did not have structural problems before—such as severe demographic decline, chronic underinvestment in digital technologies, a fiscal sustainability problem, or the loss of national sovereignty to an unelected bureaucratic class—but with the war in Ukraine, all these issues have become more pronounced. These problems have been compounded by the loss of cheap energy supplies from Russia—which were a lifeline to both industry and individuals—and the Trump administration’s demand that Europe foot the bill for the war in Ukraine and pay back the U.S. for years of supposedly favorable trade terms. While Merz warns Germans that they should be ready to see cuts in public spending, he continues to support Ukraine with €9 billion this year and has changed the country’s debt rules, which will skyrocket the debt-to-GDP ratio. According to a recent interview, he claimed that if he had not done so, the “NATO alliance would have disintegrated in June.” NATO member states, compelled at Trump’s behest to raise defense spending to 5% of GDP, will necessarily see cuts in public spending to offset this defense rise. Germany, France, and the UK are leading European support for Ukraine, promising to give Ukraine €100 billion to buy arms from the U.S. To this spending on Ukraine must be added the “Rearm Europe” plan, which, as Conor Gallagher very aptly argues, will result in armies ill-equipped to face Russia’s forces but well suited to face Europe’s own citizens: “Defense spending by EU member states is now projected to reach 381 billion euros this year, up over last year’s record of 343 billion. Despite all the money being burned at the altar of Project Ukraine, sober analysts conclude that European nations are woefully ill-equipped to successfully do much of any fighting there, and no amount of money is going to change that for the foreseeable future (…) But all the additional weaponry and surveillance goodies that aren’t immediately tossed into the corrupt pit of death that is Ukraine could be more likely to be used on an increasingly discontented population rather than against Russia. We’re already seeing it happen.” No wonder many Europeans are discontent when they are told that the basic underlying logic of their relationship with the state—the social contract embodied in the welfare state—has changed, yet they are unable to exit the contract. They are told there is no money for education, healthcare, or pensions, yet there appears to be an unending flow of money for weapons and war—a war that does not seem to be in the interests of most European citizens. The sovereignty of modern nation-states, which are paradigmatic European creations, rests on the assumption that the state embodies the “will of the people.” The somewhat abstract concept of “will to representation” is converted into “sovereign will” and vested in the “state.” This presupposes that the role of the state and the state bureaucracy is to safeguard the interests of its citizens. In Europe, the rise of the welfare state dates back to the end of the First World War. But it was really after the Second World War, in a Europe destroyed and impoverished, that the Western European states, with the help of the Marshall Plan, began developing a new social model. The war had left Europe ideologically and morally dead, so rather than ideals or morals, the state offered comfort and security in exchange for obedience and taxes. This model seemed to work and offered a compromise—a European way—between the capitalist model of the U.S. and the communist one of the Soviet Union. Although some of this is true, the success of the model was predicated on and expanded through the economic preeminence of Western Europe allied to the U.S.—some would say a vassal—especially after the fall of the Soviet Union. Parallel to, and as a consequence of, the rise of the welfare system was the growth of the state and the ever-increasing tax burden on its citizens. Starting in the 1960s, to finance the state, the value-added tax was implemented—first in France and later throughout Europe. The justification for this new tax was that the state needed the funds to finance welfare benefits. Europeans accepted this and other substantial tax increases, as well as sweeping new laws and regulations, afraid of returning to a pre-war scenario and comfortable with state benefits. So much so that, in Europe, “the state” has become almost synonymous with “the welfare state.” This logic—Europe’s underlying social contract—has held Western European society together. Though not without critique, it was widely accepted. When François Bayrou proposed the €44 billion cut to social services that ended his government, both the right and the left voted against it. In France, where society is currently extremely polarized, this is not a minor detail but a significant indicator. The protests that have erupted in defense of the welfare state—on which both left and right are trying to capitalize—are further proof. The current push for costly military readiness and arms spending seems to go against the logic of the welfare state, which is to say, against the interests of ordinary Europeans, thus changing the state’s side of the social contract. Now the state offers security and protection, not order and welfare, and asks more—not less—of citizens. That logic, in turn, requires new threats and enemies—and the launching of new wars. This happens because the state is, economically and ideologically, bankrupt. This is not an anomaly but a feature of this model of state sovereignty as now embodied in the European Union. If the state embodies the “will of the people,” then the goal of the state, conceived as an expression of sovereign will, has to be nothing more than its perpetual existence. “It is not an end among others; it is that end for which all others can be sacrificed,” writes Paul W. Kahn in Putting Liberalism in Its Place. Well with people like Kaja Kallas, they will go from fighting Russia to the last Ukrainian to fighting Russia to the last European. Seems like a natural progression. Those living in democratic Western nations have always had the opportunity to oppose military buildups in preparation for war with Russia. Yet, they chose not to. If they end up living in hunger and poverty, they will only have themselves to blame. >>>If they end up living in hunger and poverty, they will only have themselves to blame. Just like us Americans who despite keeping voting for change keep getting shafted by both the Democrats and the Republicans? I don’t know much about European politics, but I think that European politics, just like American politics, is rigged to favor the oligarchs and the politicians who serve them. Sadly, in the UK we have lived under an increasingly party-based authoritarian liberal oligarchy dressed with a rapidly fading and shrinking tinsel of electoral democracy wrapped around it. The BBC, funded by every license holder, lies, both by commission and omission, as does the MSM and the channels the MSM supports on Youtube, &c (no, the Times and Telegraph channels may sound like derivatives of ‘Round the Horne’ but, alas, they are not). The UK is not very different from other European countries which seem to be responding in similar ways by supporting new parties which wish to cast aside many of the constraints imposed by tradition and more recent custom and practice. We Brits have attempted to control HMG’s willingness to go down to defeat in wars the USA has embroiled us from Korea, by acts of civil disobedience and political demonstrations, through the Cruise missile crisis and the wonderful women of Greenham Common, the vicious war against civil rights activists in Ulster, the destruction of Serbia’s territorial integrity, the illegal invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, the overthrow and murder of Gadaffi and other leaders in North and sub-Saharan Africa, and the murderous regime put in place by the US and British Ukrainian coup and the subsequent conflict over Russian civil rights in the Donbass leading to the SMO. Sadly, none of our efforts worked. So the only option is to support completely new parties and to clean house even more thoroughly than Cromwell did. The real choice at the next election will be between Reform and Your Party. The same process is occurring or has occurred in countries on the European mainland and it looks as if many governments are more than prepared to go to war against their own people to maintain the privileges of the politcal and financial élite. The British have been prepared to give their lives for liberty in the past and will do so again. And this is true of every European nation. Our future is one of economic decline unless we come to terms with the emerging new world order and this pressure will only intensify the movement towards the most unLampedusa-like changes in the body politic. Is there any possibility that a potential future target of the new European militarism might be to the south of the continent, across the sea? A second prize of resources, if first prize (Russia) doesn’t pan out? European entities seem to devolve toward the principle of following the will of the right people. Elitism can take many forms, from directing the lower orders to getting exclusive access to perks. More transparency showing the hidden levers and accounts would be a start toward citizen understanding. Who pushes so hard for weaponry and war, and why? And how do a few individuals get to cause so many problems? Looking at BoJo, for one. Who wants country welfare programs to be overwhelmed by migrants, political, economic or otherwise? It looks like a real race to the end is looming in Europe. Who will be killed off first? The destructor propagators of mass death – Leyen Kallas Rutte Merz Macron Starmer et al Or millions of individuals among the people of Europe, some of whom are slowly coming to realise what trap is being set up for them. People in all of Europe – Germans, Spaniards, Serbs, Italians, Poles, Brits. Everyone. The financial data suggest the OK Coral is a low single digits of years away. Scary. The European welfare state, along with Social Security and other programs in the US, was created in part to keep those filthy commies at bay, not out of the goodness of the elite heart. Once there was no more USSR to worry about…. I don’t think it’s a coincidence the concrete material benefits for citizens have been on the decline while the wealth disparity has increased drastically for the last 40 years or so. Nazis, the West is fine with – many Western countries gladly invited them in after hostilities were over. It’s the sharing bit that just can’t be tolerated. This is simply not true about the experience of Western Europe. Most Western European states had some form of welfare system in place by the inter-war years not least because of trades union pressure and the need to support the dependents of the lost male population during the Great War. Bismark created the German welfare state as part of his effort to ensure the unification of Germany and to provide a secure basis for German industrial workers and soldiers – and it worked, and the rest of us followed in Germany’s wake. But something else happened during The Great War–something in Russia. Surely this had an effect on how European governments treated the working class. Then when that thing was finally defeated ideologically Thatcher could proclaim “there is no alternative.” Which is not to argue that political ideas control history but rather to agree with Stephen Douglas that “power concedes nothing without a demand.” The Russian Revolution was that demand scared the Euro aristocracy mightily. Some effect, maybe. The move towards the welfare state in Europe began before that, however (1880s in Germany, 1900s in Britain… I think most European countries started introducing key elements of modern welfare systems like old age pension schemes, somewhere in 1880-1910s; the only one I can find quickly that could conceivably be blamed on us is Italy, 1919 – there are many other examples outside of Europe, and there things may have been different). It was influenced in large part by domestic “demand”, or by the desire to stave off their own socialist and unionist movements, but there were other considerations as well: inter-European competition; wanting to keep the race in shape to keep down the colonial populations; even, though you may dismiss that, Christian paternalism, patriotism and/or social progressivism as elements of elite ideology and self-image. The Great October Socialist Revolution/October coup did influence later development to some extent, but it merely reinforced preexisting trends. I am not sure if its influence was always a helpful one for this, for that matter – it also helped start a powerful right-wing backlash that did not compare to what existed before the war. And I’d say it’s also an example of how ideas do control history – if people in and out of power had not conceived of such reforms, no one would have enacted them. The development of the welfare states of Europe can be traced well back to the mid-19th Century at least – they were arguably the result of the weakening of religion and the strengthening of the secular state, but you can trace its origins well back to medieval times – many towns and cities has surprisingly sophisticated social systems designed to protect the poorest organised by various forms of town governance (councils/guilds,etc). The motives were the usual complex mix of compassion, religious belief, social pressure, ideology and fear. They long predate any fear of socialism, although not of course fear of peasant uprisings. Later northern European welfare systems, developed as private companies became larger and more influential and developed their own health/welfare systems (often, of course, under trade union pressure), and these in time became generalised by the State in order to iron out social pressures between those protected by those corporate systems and those (not necessarily poor) on the outside. The complexity of the history is one reason why these systems are so complex (a health economist friend was fond of joking that there are only about 3 people alive who understand how the Dutch health system works) and have roots that go well beyond the notional ‘start’ of any particular scheme. Its also a key reason as to why there are so many deep differences between their design and implementation across Europe. Even between quite ‘similar’ countries – such as Denmark and Sweden – there are often very fundamental differences in both the background politics and the nuts and bolts of implementation of these systems. For the most part, they work surprisingly well, despite several decades of attacks by neoliberals (even Thatcher feared tackling the NHS). The key threat, as the article alludes – is that the pension/care systems are for the most part based on assumptions of rising population/economic growth which no longer hold. This is, in my opinion, a key reason why domestic politicians have been so reluctant to tackle immigration. The projections are horrible if you rely on domestic fertility – but this applies now all over the developed and intermediately developed world. Its a nettle that has yet to be firmly grasped by any country. Oh, of course – I specifically meant the comparatively standardised and systematic modern welfare systems as pioneered by Bismarck or Lloyd George, but depending on one’s definitions, some forms of state (or, more often, municipal?) welfare existed for centuries or indeed for as long as human civilisation. Standardised welfare of the Bismarck type is, to my knowledge, a 19th century European novelty; so is the ideologically-driven rejection of state welfare, though indeed, even such fanatics as Thatcher had a healthy fear of going too far in attacking what people had come to rely on. ” Stephen” Douglas? Surely you mean Frederick Douglas. Yes sorry for the senior moment. And to the other replies to my comment I’ll just point out that the Russian revolution was preceded by others in Europe and perhaps most importantly our own which rejected a king (coming soon as Ken Burns PBS doc). I think the statement made by Frederick Douglas is to the point and that point is that those at the pinnacle of power do not back down other than from the threat of violence since violence is how they maintain their position. Even in enlightened 19th century Britain (paging Dickens) you could still be drawn and quartered. Of course democracy is supposed to provide another path which is why they are doing so much to undermine it. There are a lot of problems here, and a lot of misguided prejudices (I am not refering to the article, but about common knowledge). Europe, except the USSR, the last European power, was done in 1945. It was pretty clear in the Suez crisis. Yes, they were important countries in a slow decline, but decline. EEC-EU-Europe, or Euroamerica, is a marginal side of the US hegemonic system. The EEC was a optimizing system for the main economies of Western Europe, it was never designed for advanced but small countries like Sweden, Switzerland or Austria, not at all for undeveloped like Greece, Spain, Portugal, let alone ex-COMECON and the lot, not even the fiasco of a United Germany. It became a chaos. It was a economic device, not even a political one, the Paris-Berlin axis was a mirage (because of German partition), it lasted until 1990s, UK was ever a disloyal member, and the like. The political device was, and is, NATO, all the powerful countries of the EU are nothing without it, and the traction of NATO was to make the EU as similar to the US as possible as fast as possible. The welfare state was a concession by fear of the Soviet Union, which exists no more. There is no reason not to carry the EU to the same social welfare standards of the US, which is what is happening. Corruption is massive, as ever was, so if we don’t see things from this point of view, we hardly understand anything. Taxes are lower than ever, in the sense that they are not extracting money where it is, in fact they collect less and less in a suicidal temptative to keep alive the system. If things were that far away without resistance, it’s more than dubious they are going to change in the next few years. Firstly, people must be aware about reality, not the bubble where they forced to live, and only after that, something could happen. Or not. All these comments are well and good, but of course, the interesting part is the question of what Putin’s motivations are. Is the attack on Poland because of internal failures in Russia, or are their other reasons? Putin obviously has his eyes on Latvia and Estonia, where a goodly portion of the population is Russian. One would have thought that they would be easier anti-Nato targets. There is obviously a ‘message’ here. Poland has historically been vulnerable because it is flat, and a convenient invasion corridor. Back in the day, when the European militaries worried about mass invasions by tanks, that made sense. Mutandis mutandi, it’s a drone’s world now. And it’s not like Israel, which gets its military weapons free, courtesy of ‘foreign aid’ from the US. Putin has to pay for all the Iranian drones and missles as well as domestic arms production. Has something changed internally that makes expansion of hostilities desirable? I’m sure the there’s ‘less here than meets the eye’, but being merely a slightly astute citizen myself, I can’t suss it out. Was there even an attack on Poland? Even that badic premise remains unclear. One might as well ask what the Poles were thinking at Gleiwitz, 1939. Ukraine did hack Russia drones, then send them through Belarus. Belarus even warned Poland about the drones. Fun fact. The drones that entered Poland did not have the range to reach there if launched from Russian positions. It was too far as the Russians pointed out. So either they were taken there by magical tailwinds that no weather report shows or else these were captured drones that were launched by Zelensky to bring Poland and NATO into the fighting. I’m going with Door Number Two. UK media has commented that they were launched from Belarus. Reports from Belarus said that they had a few enter their airspace which were shot down so gave Poland a heads up that they might have a few come their way. As for UK media, they are on par with Oz media or German media which is not a high bar. Some Brits say that the BBC actually stands for the British Bull******* Corporation as an example. Bad Old debating Technique- answering a question with a question. Maybe they were just playing questions- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3xIs0aajN4 “The underlying social contract between individuals and the state in Western European nations over the last hundred years has been that the state would grow to regulate and tax virtually every sphere of life—public or private—in exchange for a measure of order and comfort for its citizens…” Even though the final para states “This is not an anomaly but a feature of this model of state sovereignty as now embodied in the European Union. ..” the author doesn’t appear to acknowledge that the underlying European social contract between individuals and the nation state was effectively broken with the adoption of the financially unfederated Brussels governed administered common currency structure of European Union 26 yrs ago. The individual nation states in adopting the Euro surrendered their capacity to deliver on that social contract to unelected administrators in Brussels. Each Eurozone member state in abandoning their national currency, gave up their fiscal sovereignty to adopt the Euro – effectively a foreign issued currency. Together with accepting an arbitrarily Brussels enforced annual 3% fiscal deficit limit it was inevitable that expanded state monetary needs for industry/population growth would eat into the available funds necessary to deliver on that social contract. The US, itself a nation of 50 fully financially federated states, knew full well the implications of that structure – a stealthy ploy to slowly but surely destroy European socialism. IMHO a structure designed to keep Europe down, socially divided with vassalised financial elites in firm, ever growing control. An article worth re-reading (after 13 yrs) by Greg Palas is ‘Robert Mundell, evil genius of the euro.’ Any residual social contract in the UK was erased from 1980 when unemployment first hit 2m down to the Thatcherite dogma that unemployment was “a price worth paying”. The loss of trust in the political class during deindustrialisation, and social insecurity, has led to the rise of right wing populist insurgents preying on disaffection. Any of the European nations which has experienced youth unemployment over 20% and poor real wage increases over the last few decades is likely to have the same social insecurity. I agree. The state demands you obey the laws, keep the peace, respect your fellow citizens. In other words, to put the common good before your individual good. In return the state must give you the opportunity to thrive within those constraints. If it doesn’t all bets are off. “Another European nation that might need an IMF bailout—perhaps even more urgently than France—is the UK. The UK’s debt is becoming significantly more expensive to service due to a sharp rise in borrowing costs, which now amount to over £100 billion annually—nearly 10% of the national budget…” The UK does not need an IMF bailout – The UK is the sole fully sovereign issuer of the UK£. It can pay any debt it incurs denominated in the UK£. When will journalists ever spend the time researching how National monetary systems actually function? In a democracy with well informed citizens then the choice between having billionaires or having a social safety net would be easy. As is then I’d say that either the citizens aren’t well-informed and we have democracy or we don’t have democracy and what we do have is oligarchy. A subtle choice of words can be used when engaging in propaganda. The difference in outcome between asking if people want a welfare state or if they want a social safety net is (at least in my strong belief) huge. I believe that as long as the ‘opposition’ to the status quo are using phrases suggested by supporters of the status quo then the ‘opposition’ will not drive any change.

The underlying social contract between individuals and the state in Western European nations over the last hundred years has been that the state would grow to regulate and tax virtually every sphere of life—public or private—in exchange for a measure of order and comfort for its citizens. If the state begins to reduce those comforts as order starts disintegrating, but continues to grow and to tax even more, it could be interpreted as a breach of the terms of the agreement. As I was finishing this article, France’s youngest citizens took to the streets to defend the welfare state under the banner of the “Block Everything” movement. Their demands include greater investment in public health and education, rent controls, retirement at 60, and stronger environmental policies. Protesters have erected barricades, blocked highways and public-transport stations, in an effort to bring the country to a standstill. More than 400 people were arrested. The demonstrations erupted after President Macron appointed Sébastien Lecornu as prime minister, a move widely seen as signaling the continuation of his predecessor’s austerity policies. These protests underscore the central argument of this article: the welfare state is the social contract that binds Western European citizens to their governments. When those benefits are eroded, many view it as a breach of that contract—one that, in their eyes, justifies civil disobedience. Friedrich Merz, often dubbed Germany’s “BlackRock” chancellor, has already indicated that there has to be a reduction in state benefits: “The welfare state as we know it today is no longer economically sustainable with what we are producing as a national economy.” That the welfare state suffers from a viability problem is not news. What is news is that the head of the largest economy in the eurozone, with a relatively low debt-to-GDP ratio (~65%), is publicly preparing citizens for a rollback of state benefits. But Germany is not alone in this conundrum. France’s government, the second-largest economy in the eurozone, with a much higher debt-to-GDP ratio (~119%), has lost a confidence vote in parliament and been dissolved over a budget that slashes public spending. According to deposed Prime Minister François Bayrou, nearly €44 billion in cuts is necessary because, he argues, France has not balanced its budget for roughly 50 years. The economy is expected to grow by no more than 0.6% in 2025, with a public deficit of about 6%. Some have even floated the prospect of an IMF bailout. Another European nation that might need an IMF bailout—perhaps even more urgently than France—is the UK. The UK’s debt is becoming significantly more expensive to service due to a sharp rise in borrowing costs, which now amount to over £100 billion annually—nearly 10% of the national budget. This comes despite decades of mass privatization of social services. According to many economists, both France and the UK are going downhill in slow motion toward a debt crisis. The Wall Street Journal, of course, has no doubt why this is happening: “Britain and France aren’t illiquid. They’re insolvent. Their future spending commitments, primarily in the form of expected social-welfare and old-age benefit payouts, far exceed any realistic estimate of the economic growth that will be available to pay those bills.” Other European nations, such as Spain—whose GDP is expected to grow around 2.5% in 2025—will face a very similar problem with their welfare systems. Spain’s debt-to-GDP ratio is around 100% (compared to Germany’s ~65%), but its share of the budget devoted to social services is almost identical. Spain’s current growth is predicated on a general increase in the money supply and a relatively successful immigration strategy over the last two decades. The immigrant population has gone from 3.5 million in 2005 to 7 million in 2025. This has contributed to lower GDP per capita, which is why many Spaniards have barely felt the macroeconomic growth. Despite immigration, the birth rate in Spain is among the lowest in Europe (1.12, lower than Germany, France, and the UK), which makes the long-term sustainability of the welfare state questionable under the logic that it is the current workforce that pays for it. The case for slashing public spending is usually the same: slower economic growth and a smaller workforce reduce the state’s revenues, while the aging population continues to grow and unemployment rises due to slower economic growth. This discourse presents budget cuts as almost inevitable and frames “slower economic growth” as a natural phenomenon, almost like a drought, occurring outside the control of politicians. That it is outside the control of politicians—who have limited control over financial policy—might be correct for the most part. However, to present it as a natural phenomenon implies assuming that markets operate under objective natural forces, like gravity, unaffected by the actors involved. That is simply not the case. The “markets” respond to the actions of individuals and companies. A case in point is the 2008 crash, which was brought about by a set of specific practices, such as the sale of mortgage derivatives, which were known—at least by some—to be fraudulent and to potentially cause the collapse of the entire system. The 2008 crisis is a good example because the financial crisis engineered by big financiers, with or without knowledge, was ultimately paid for by ordinary citizens, and virtually no one was held accountable. It will again be ordinary citizens who pay the price of the geopolitical crisis that now affects Europe with the war in Ukraine. The conflict has unleashed war momentum against the interests of most European citizens, both economically and existentially, which could have been avoided or at least settled early on. Its effects are now precipitating a collapse of European economies and societies. It is not that Europe did not have structural problems before—such as severe demographic decline, chronic underinvestment in digital technologies, a fiscal sustainability problem, or the loss of national sovereignty to an unelected bureaucratic class—but with the war in Ukraine, all these issues have become more pronounced. These problems have been compounded by the loss of cheap energy supplies from Russia—which were a lifeline to both industry and individuals—and the Trump administration’s demand that Europe foot the bill for the war in Ukraine and pay back the U.S. for years of supposedly favorable trade terms. While Merz warns Germans that they should be ready to see cuts in public spending, he continues to support Ukraine with €9 billion this year and has changed the country’s debt rules, which will skyrocket the debt-to-GDP ratio. According to a recent interview, he claimed that if he had not done so, the “NATO alliance would have disintegrated in June.” NATO member states, compelled at Trump’s behest to raise defense spending to 5% of GDP, will necessarily see cuts in public spending to offset this defense rise. Germany, France, and the UK are leading European support for Ukraine, promising to give Ukraine €100 billion to buy arms from the U.S. To this spending on Ukraine must be added the “Rearm Europe” plan, which, as Conor Gallagher very aptly argues, will result in armies ill-equipped to face Russia’s forces but well suited to face Europe’s own citizens: “Defense spending by EU member states is now projected to reach 381 billion euros this year, up over last year’s record of 343 billion. Despite all the money being burned at the altar of Project Ukraine, sober analysts conclude that European nations are woefully ill-equipped to successfully do much of any fighting there, and no amount of money is going to change that for the foreseeable future (…) But all the additional weaponry and surveillance goodies that aren’t immediately tossed into the corrupt pit of death that is Ukraine could be more likely to be used on an increasingly discontented population rather than against Russia. We’re already seeing it happen.” No wonder many Europeans are discontent when they are told that the basic underlying logic of their relationship with the state—the social contract embodied in the welfare state—has changed, yet they are unable to exit the contract. They are told there is no money for education, healthcare, or pensions, yet there appears to be an unending flow of money for weapons and war—a war that does not seem to be in the interests of most European citizens. The sovereignty of modern nation-states, which are paradigmatic European creations, rests on the assumption that the state embodies the “will of the people.” The somewhat abstract concept of “will to representation” is converted into “sovereign will” and vested in the “state.” This presupposes that the role of the state and the state bureaucracy is to safeguard the interests of its citizens. In Europe, the rise of the welfare state dates back to the end of the First World War. But it was really after the Second World War, in a Europe destroyed and impoverished, that the Western European states, with the help of the Marshall Plan, began developing a new social model. The war had left Europe ideologically and morally dead, so rather than ideals or morals, the state offered comfort and security in exchange for obedience and taxes. This model seemed to work and offered a compromise—a European way—between the capitalist model of the U.S. and the communist one of the Soviet Union. Although some of this is true, the success of the model was predicated on and expanded through the economic preeminence of Western Europe allied to the U.S.—some would say a vassal—especially after the fall of the Soviet Union. Parallel to, and as a consequence of, the rise of the welfare system was the growth of the state and the ever-increasing tax burden on its citizens. Starting in the 1960s, to finance the state, the value-added tax was implemented—first in France and later throughout Europe. The justification for this new tax was that the state needed the funds to finance welfare benefits. Europeans accepted this and other substantial tax increases, as well as sweeping new laws and regulations, afraid of returning to a pre-war scenario and comfortable with state benefits. So much so that, in Europe, “the state” has become almost synonymous with “the welfare state.” This logic—Europe’s underlying social contract—has held Western European society together. Though not without critique, it was widely accepted. When François Bayrou proposed the €44 billion cut to social services that ended his government, both the right and the left voted against it. In France, where society is currently extremely polarized, this is not a minor detail but a significant indicator. The protests that have erupted in defense of the welfare state—on which both left and right are trying to capitalize—are further proof. The current push for costly military readiness and arms spending seems to go against the logic of the welfare state, which is to say, against the interests of ordinary Europeans, thus changing the state’s side of the social contract. Now the state offers security and protection, not order and welfare, and asks more—not less—of citizens. That logic, in turn, requires new threats and enemies—and the launching of new wars. This happens because the state is, economically and ideologically, bankrupt. This is not an anomaly but a feature of this model of state sovereignty as now embodied in the European Union. If the state embodies the “will of the people,” then the goal of the state, conceived as an expression of sovereign will, has to be nothing more than its perpetual existence. “It is not an end among others; it is that end for which all others can be sacrificed,” writes Paul W. Kahn in Putting Liberalism in Its Place. Well with people like Kaja Kallas, they will go from fighting Russia to the last Ukrainian to fighting Russia to the last European. Seems like a natural progression. Those living in democratic Western nations have always had the opportunity to oppose military buildups in preparation for war with Russia. Yet, they chose not to. If they end up living in hunger and poverty, they will only have themselves to blame. >>>If they end up living in hunger and poverty, they will only have themselves to blame. Just like us Americans who despite keeping voting for change keep getting shafted by both the Democrats and the Republicans? I don’t know much about European politics, but I think that European politics, just like American politics, is rigged to favor the oligarchs and the politicians who serve them. Sadly, in the UK we have lived under an increasingly party-based authoritarian liberal oligarchy dressed with a rapidly fading and shrinking tinsel of electoral democracy wrapped around it. The BBC, funded by every license holder, lies, both by commission and omission, as does the MSM and the channels the MSM supports on Youtube, &c (no, the Times and Telegraph channels may sound like derivatives of ‘Round the Horne’ but, alas, they are not). The UK is not very different from other European countries which seem to be responding in similar ways by supporting new parties which wish to cast aside many of the constraints imposed by tradition and more recent custom and practice.

Sadly, none of our efforts worked. So the only option is to support completely new parties and to clean house even more thoroughly than Cromwell did.

Nazis, the West is fine with – many Western countries gladly invited them in after hostilities were over. It’s the sharing bit that just can’t be tolerated. This is simply not true about the experience of Western Europe. Most Western European states had some form of welfare system in place by the inter-war years not least because of trades union pressure and the need to support the dependents of the lost male population during the Great War. Bismark created the German welfare state as part of his effort to ensure the unification of Germany and to provide a secure basis for German industrial workers and soldiers – and it worked, and the rest of us followed in Germany’s wake. But something else happened during The Great War–something in Russia. Surely this had an effect on how European governments treated the working class. Then when that thing was finally defeated ideologically Thatcher could proclaim “there is no alternative.” Which is not to argue that political ideas control history but rather to agree with Stephen Douglas that “power concedes nothing without a demand.” The Russian Revolution was that demand scared the Euro aristocracy mightily. Some effect, maybe. The move towards the welfare state in Europe began before that, however (1880s in Germany, 1900s in Britain… I think most European countries started introducing key elements of modern welfare systems like old age pension schemes, somewhere in 1880-1910s; the only one I can find quickly that could conceivably be blamed on us is Italy, 1919 – there are many other examples outside of Europe, and there things may have been different). It was influenced in large part by domestic “demand”, or by the desire to stave off their own socialist and unionist movements, but there were other considerations as well: inter-European competition; wanting to keep the race in shape to keep down the colonial populations; even, though you may dismiss that, Christian paternalism, patriotism and/or social progressivism as elements of elite ideology and self-image. The Great October Socialist Revolution/October coup did influence later development to some extent, but it merely reinforced preexisting trends. I am not sure if its influence was always a helpful one for this, for that matter – it also helped start a powerful right-wing backlash that did not compare to what existed before the war. And I’d say it’s also an example of how ideas do control history – if people in and out of power had not conceived of such reforms, no one would have enacted them. The development of the welfare states of Europe can be traced well back to the mid-19th Century at least – they were arguably the result of the weakening of religion and the strengthening of the secular state, but you can trace its origins well back to medieval times – many towns and cities has surprisingly sophisticated social systems designed to protect the poorest organised by various forms of town governance (councils/guilds,etc). The motives were the usual complex mix of compassion, religious belief, social pressure, ideology and fear. They long predate any fear of socialism, although not of course fear of peasant uprisings. Later northern European welfare systems, developed as private companies became larger and more influential and developed their own health/welfare systems (often, of course, under trade union pressure), and these in time became generalised by the State in order to iron out social pressures between those protected by those corporate systems and those (not necessarily poor) on the outside. The complexity of the history is one reason why these systems are so complex (a health economist friend was fond of joking that there are only about 3 people alive who understand how the Dutch health system works) and have roots that go well beyond the notional ‘start’ of any particular scheme. Its also a key reason as to why there are so many deep differences between their design and implementation across Europe. Even between quite ‘similar’ countries – such as Denmark and Sweden – there are often very fundamental differences in both the background politics and the nuts and bolts of implementation of these systems. For the most part, they work surprisingly well, despite several decades of attacks by neoliberals (even Thatcher feared tackling the NHS). The key threat, as the article alludes – is that the pension/care systems are for the most part based on assumptions of rising population/economic growth which no longer hold. This is, in my opinion, a key reason why domestic politicians have been so reluctant to tackle immigration. The projections are horrible if you rely on domestic fertility – but this applies now all over the developed and intermediately developed world. Its a nettle that has yet to be firmly grasped by any country. Oh, of course – I specifically meant the comparatively standardised and systematic modern welfare systems as pioneered by Bismarck or Lloyd George, but depending on one’s definitions, some forms of state (or, more often, municipal?) welfare existed for centuries or indeed for as long as human civilisation. Standardised welfare of the Bismarck type is, to my knowledge, a 19th century European novelty; so is the ideologically-driven rejection of state welfare, though indeed, even such fanatics as Thatcher had a healthy fear of going too far in attacking what people had come to rely on. ” Stephen” Douglas? Surely you mean Frederick Douglas. Yes sorry for the senior moment. And to the other replies to my comment I’ll just point out that the Russian revolution was preceded by others in Europe and perhaps most importantly our own which rejected a king (coming soon as Ken Burns PBS doc). I think the statement made by Frederick Douglas is to the point and that point is that those at the pinnacle of power do not back down other than from the threat of violence since violence is how they maintain their position. Even in enlightened 19th century Britain (paging Dickens) you could still be drawn and quartered. Of course democracy is supposed to provide another path which is why they are doing so much to undermine it. There are a lot of problems here, and a lot of misguided prejudices (I am not refering to the article, but about common knowledge). Europe, except the USSR, the last European power, was done in 1945. It was pretty clear in the Suez crisis. Yes, they were important countries in a slow decline, but decline. EEC-EU-Europe, or Euroamerica, is a marginal side of the US hegemonic system. The EEC was a optimizing system for the main economies of Western Europe, it was never designed for advanced but small countries like Sweden, Switzerland or Austria, not at all for undeveloped like Greece, Spain, Portugal, let alone ex-COMECON and the lot, not even the fiasco of a United Germany. It became a chaos. It was a economic device, not even a political one, the Paris-Berlin axis was a mirage (because of German partition), it lasted until 1990s, UK was ever a disloyal member, and the like. The political device was, and is, NATO, all the powerful countries of the EU are nothing without it, and the traction of NATO was to make the EU as similar to the US as possible as fast as possible. The welfare state was a concession by fear of the Soviet Union, which exists no more. There is no reason not to carry the EU to the same social welfare standards of the US, which is what is happening. Corruption is massive, as ever was, so if we don’t see things from this point of view, we hardly understand anything. Taxes are lower than ever, in the sense that they are not extracting money where it is, in fact they collect less and less in a suicidal temptative to keep alive the system. If things were that far away without resistance, it’s more than dubious they are going to change in the next few years. Firstly, people must be aware about reality, not the bubble where they forced to live, and only after that, something could happen. Or not. All these comments are well and good, but of course, the interesting part is the question of what Putin’s motivations are. Is the attack on Poland because of internal failures in Russia, or are their other reasons? Putin obviously has his eyes on Latvia and Estonia, where a goodly portion of the population is Russian. One would have thought that they would be easier anti-Nato targets. There is obviously a ‘message’ here. Poland has historically been vulnerable because it is flat, and a convenient invasion corridor. Back in the day, when the European militaries worried about mass invasions by tanks, that made sense. Mutandis mutandi, it’s a drone’s world now. And it’s not like Israel, which gets its military weapons free, courtesy of ‘foreign aid’ from the US. Putin has to pay for all the Iranian drones and missles as well as domestic arms production. Has something changed internally that makes expansion of hostilities desirable? I’m sure the there’s ‘less here than meets the eye’, but being merely a slightly astute citizen myself, I can’t suss it out. Was there even an attack on Poland? Even that badic premise remains unclear. One might as well ask what the Poles were thinking at Gleiwitz, 1939. Ukraine did hack Russia drones, then send them through Belarus. Belarus even warned Poland about the drones. Fun fact. The drones that entered Poland did not have the range to reach there if launched from Russian positions. It was too far as the Russians pointed out. So either they were taken there by magical tailwinds that no weather report shows or else these were captured drones that were launched by Zelensky to bring Poland and NATO into the fighting. I’m going with Door Number Two. UK media has commented that they were launched from Belarus. Reports from Belarus said that they had a few enter their airspace which were shot down so gave Poland a heads up that they might have a few come their way. As for UK media, they are on par with Oz media or German media which is not a high bar. Some Brits say that the BBC actually stands for the British Bull******* Corporation as an example. Bad Old debating Technique- answering a question with a question. Maybe they were just playing questions- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3xIs0aajN4 “The underlying social contract between individuals and the state in Western European nations over the last hundred years has been that the state would grow to regulate and tax virtually every sphere of life—public or private—in exchange for a measure of order and comfort for its citizens…” Even though the final para states “This is not an anomaly but a feature of this model of state sovereignty as now embodied in the European Union. ..” the author doesn’t appear to acknowledge that the underlying European social contract between individuals and the nation state was effectively broken with the adoption of the financially unfederated Brussels governed administered common currency structure of European Union 26 yrs ago. The individual nation states in adopting the Euro surrendered their capacity to deliver on that social contract to unelected administrators in Brussels. Each Eurozone member state in abandoning their national currency, gave up their fiscal sovereignty to adopt the Euro – effectively a foreign issued currency. Together with accepting an arbitrarily Brussels enforced annual 3% fiscal deficit limit it was inevitable that expanded state monetary needs for industry/population growth would eat into the available funds necessary to deliver on that social contract. The US, itself a nation of 50 fully financially federated states, knew full well the implications of that structure – a stealthy ploy to slowly but surely destroy European socialism. IMHO a structure designed to keep Europe down, socially divided with vassalised financial elites in firm, ever growing control. An article worth re-reading (after 13 yrs) by Greg Palas is ‘Robert Mundell, evil genius of the euro.’ Any residual social contract in the UK was erased from 1980 when unemployment first hit 2m down to the Thatcherite dogma that unemployment was “a price worth paying”. The loss of trust in the political class during deindustrialisation, and social insecurity, has led to the rise of right wing populist insurgents preying on disaffection. Any of the European nations which has experienced youth unemployment over 20% and poor real wage increases over the last few decades is likely to have the same social insecurity. I agree. The state demands you obey the laws, keep the peace, respect your fellow citizens. In other words, to put the common good before your individual good. In return the state must give you the opportunity to thrive within those constraints. If it doesn’t all bets are off. “Another European nation that might need an IMF bailout—perhaps even more urgently than France—is the UK. The UK’s debt is becoming significantly more expensive to service due to a sharp rise in borrowing costs, which now amount to over £100 billion annually—nearly 10% of the national budget…” The UK does not need an IMF bailout – The UK is the sole fully sovereign issuer of the UK£. It can pay any debt it incurs denominated in the UK£. When will journalists ever spend the time researching how National monetary systems actually function? In a democracy with well informed citizens then the choice between having billionaires or having a social safety net would be easy. As is then I’d say that either the citizens aren’t well-informed and we have democracy or we don’t have democracy and what we do have is oligarchy. A subtle choice of words can be used when engaging in propaganda. The difference in outcome between asking if people want a welfare state or if they want a social safety net is (at least in my strong belief) huge. I believe that as long as the ‘opposition’ to the status quo are using phrases suggested by supporters of the status quo then the ‘opposition’ will not drive any change.

Title: CIA/Mossad False Flag Psyop Kicks Off on First Day of Skool While Antichrist Peter Thiel Takes Control of Government

Editor Podcasts Jeff Berwick, The Dollar Vigilante It’s hard to believe, but summer is already wrapping up (for most, anyway). That one went fast. We’re sliding into the exact window I said would bring a major crash/collapse, but I’ll circle back to that shortly. The young minds of the USSA are already being marched back into the camps, to be reshaped and conditioned until they’re ready to wear that Saturn cube on their heads, provided they obey well enough. And, right on cue, day one brought the first psy-op of the skool year, staged and broadcast by the CIA/Mossad tag team through their media mouthpieces. On August 27, 23-year-old Robin/Robert Westman, a former student at Annunciation Catholic Skool in Minneapolis, supposedly showed up at the connected church with a rifle, a shotgun, and a pistol (all “legally purchased,” of course), and blasted through stained glass windows into a packed Mass. An 8-year-old and a 10-year-old were killed. Seventeen others wounded – 14 kids and 3 elderly parishioners in their 80s. Tragic. Terrifying. And, if you’re paying attention, textbook. At this point, you almost don’t even need to look into the details anymore, because every skool shooting in the USSA might as well be stamped “CIA/Mossad Production” right from the start. Usually, after a few minutes of digging, you’ll see the fingerprints: a trans MK Ultra patsy, the same shady networks funding and covering, and, surprise, surprise, BlackRock lurking in the background. But this time? They didn’t even bother hiding it. The shooter’s weapon literally had “Sponsored by BlackRock” scribbled on it. And headlines screamed things like: “Minneapolis shooter was ‘tired of being trans’ and had been ‘brainwashed’ into being female.” Translation: yes, the shooter was under mind control. They said it out loud. So, let’s ask the investigator’s first question: Who benefits? Well, the shooter’s gun was also covered with scribbles like “6 million wasn’t enough,” “Jew Gas,” “Burn Israel,” “Israel must fall.” And just like that, the script kicked in. Agenda #1: Call it an “anti-semitic hate crime.” Even though the target was a Catholic skool. Even though neither shooter nor victims were “semitic” in any sense of the word (and let’s be honest, most people in Israhell aren’t either). Still, headlines push the “anti-semitic” label, and in the background, laws and crackdowns on so-called hate speech get ratcheted up another notch. Agenda #2: Who, right now, is openly bloodthirsty for killing goyim children? Exactly. And here it is again, reframed as an “attack on the chosen,” while they do the very thing they accuse others of. They’re masters at flipping the script. Agenda #3: Victim politics. Somehow, this was also spun into another notch in the “trans people are under attack” narrative. They never miss a beat. Agenda #4: Gun grab. Fox News, politicians, the usual suspects paraded in front of cameras, calling to ban “assault rifles.” Some even floated the idea that young white men, specifically, should be disarmed. Agenda #5: Surveillance expansion. Calls for “pre-crime” systems à la Palantir. The idea? That the government should know everything you think, feel, and intend before you even act. Predictive policing, Minority Report, straight-up thought-crime. All from one operation. Problem → Reaction → Solution. The Hegelian dialectic is alive and well. And, that’s just one op layered with multiple payoffs. There are plenty more running in parallel right now. But what they really need is a global event – something catastrophic enough to make normies beg for the digital prison. Something that makes people say, “Please, track me, watch me, jab me, save me.” That’s where September might very likely come in. For example: A staged strike blamed on Russia, or Iran, could flip the switch. “Pearl Harbor 2.0” to rally the sheep. One missile, one explosion, one “accident” in September could be all it takes to justify the next forever war. Or, maybe a Plandemic 2.0 rollout. Already, the headlines whisper about “new variants.” Masks creeping back. There’s no stopping the Crime And Death Corporation (CDC), who now has a Peter Thiel inner-circle crony as its new CEO. Notice the timing. Right before September, they prime the headlines with “rising Covid variants”, with ‘no symptoms’ still a terrifying, invisible symptom. Don’t worry if you can’t get your 11th booster immediately, RFK Jr. will soon be rolling out the all encompassing natural immunity mRNA jab. Or, a massive ‘climate change’ apocalyptic event. Or, a Titanic-sized market crash. This time, they want everyone in the pen. But, this time, instead of lockdowns first, they’ll use digital ID + AI as the solution. “Want to work? Want to travel? Want to eat? Just hitch your vax pass and your digital money to Palantir’s fascist technocrat wagon. You can’t make this shit up. Round Two will be smoother, faster, harder to escape. The only question left is: which card will they play first?

What Happened? On July 29, 2025, Novo Nordisk cut its previously issued fiscal year 2025 guidance, lowering sales growth from 13-21% to 8-14%, and operating profit from 16-24% to 10-16%. The Company cited lower growth expectations for both Ozempic and Wegovy on the back of a slowdown in market expansion, competition, and the alleged continued use of compounded GLP-1s. On this news, Novo Nordisk’s stock price fell $15.06, or 21.8%, to close at $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, thereby injuring investors. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Novo Nordisk repeatedly ignored and minimized the significance of the personalization exception for GLP-1 compounding, greatly overestimated its ability to capture patients coming off of compounded treatments, and was ultimately ill equipped to capitalize upon the purported significant unmet patient population; and (2) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than September 30, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

REUTERS/Amit Dave/File Photo/File Photo | Photo Credit: AMIT DAVE Indian and foreign lenders have significantly increased their exposure to the Adani group over the past 12-15 months, betting on its infrastructure play consisting of cash flow generating real assets. The exposure of Indian lenders has risen over 50 per cent to over ₹1.3 lakh crore, while that of foreign banks has risen 16 per cent to ₹71,744 crore. Domestic lenders’ share in the total debt has risen to over 50 per cent now from 40 per cent last year. This comes at a time when billionaire founder of the group Gautam Adani is being investigated by US regulators for alleged wire and securities fraud and a bribery scheme. Funding through US dollar bonds, a favourite avenue for the group, has fallen 11 per cent during the period as the group has consciously stayed away from the overseas public bond markets pending the settlement of the ongoing probes against it. In April, it did raise $750 million through a private bond sale, a third of which was subscribed by Blackrock. Its overseas bond holders are long-only investors and includes names such as Blackrock, AIA, Pimco, Fidelity, Apollo Global, MetLife, Cigna and Goldman Sachs. The group has been aggressively tapping Indian institutions, and proof of the trust placed in it is the ₹5,000 crore that Life Insurance Corporation invested in the non-convertible debentures issued by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone in May this year, to refinance short-term debt. Most of the rise in exposure by Indian lenders is accounted for by public sector banks led by State Bank of India and non-bank and institutional lenders. Sources pointed out that the lenders are getting comfort from its robust cash flows – well over ₹60,000 crore or about a quarter of its total debt – and that it is creating long-term infrastructure assets. For instance, around 80 per cent of its recent capital expenditure has gone into expanding its green energy portfolio. It is planning to spend around $70 billion in green investments. Last financial year the group’s capex was close to $15 billion, and Adani has indicated an annual spend of $15-20 billion over the next five years. Of its total EBITDA of close to ₹90,000 crore, over 80 per cent is accounted for by its core infrastructure businesses that comprise its energy portfolio, transport and the businesses being incubated under Adani Enterprises, such as airports. The energy companies in its portfolio have entered into long term power purchase agreements that provide cash visibility for extended periods. For instance, in May, Adani Green Energy signed a 40-year PPA for a 1.25 GW pumped hydro project in Uttar Pradesh. Adani Power also has a 25-year agreement to supply thermal power to the State.

Title: Oracle CEO Safra Catz’s personal net worth jumped by over $400 million in just 6 hours, thanks to contracts with the ‘who’s who of AI’
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/09/11/oracle-ceo-safra-catz-net-worth-surge-tech-firm-stock-jump-like-billionaire-larry-ellison-partnership-openai-meta/
Time Published: 2025-09-11T15:39:53Z
Full Content:
Preston Fore is a reporter at Fortune, covering education and personal finance for the Success team. 2025 might just be the year of Oracle. The 48-year-old tech company’s stock value has doubled year-to-date, and just in the last week, soared by over 30% off the heels of a bullish earnings report. Oracle’s market cap is now valued over $920 billion—higher than that of Walmart and JPMorgan Chase. This substantial stock performance has boosted the wealth of Oracle’s investors, namely Larry Ellison. As the company’s founder, chairman, and chief technology officer, his wealth has grown to over $350 billion, putting him neck-and-neck with Elon Musk as the world’s richest person. But it’s not just Ellison who’s been owed all the credit—or the award. Oracle’s CEO Safra Catz has been at the helm of the company for over a decade, and her wealth jumped by over $400 million in just six hours on Wednesday to $3.4 billion, according to Forbes. “Clearly, we had an amazing start to the year because Oracle has become the go-to place for AI workloads,” Catz said during Tuesday’s earnings call. “We have signed significant cloud contracts with the who’s who of AI, including OpenAI, xAI, Meta, Nvidia, AMD and many others.” Catz’s leadership successes at Oracle have cemented her as one of the richest self-made women in the world, having climbed the ladder first on Wall Street as an investment banker before heading to Silicon Valley to join Oracle (the tech firm later moved to Austin in 2020). And part of what has helped drive the tech company to succeed is her mantra to always be the best. “We don’t want to follow others. We always try to do something differently,” she told CNBC earlier this year. “Being No. 1 is very, very important. It also means you’re the best and solving customers’ needs. On the surface level, Oracle’s recent stock success is somewhat head-scratching. The company has been around for over four decades, and other big-name tech companies, such as IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon, have made the cloud services market more crowded than ever. Moreover, during Tuesday’s earnings report, Oracle announced it actually had slightly missed earnings and revenue projections. However, investors have been more impressed with what Oracle has coming down the pipeline, namely its plan to 14x its cloud infrastructure revenue. By fiscal year 2030, its cloud infrastructure revenue will be $144 billion—up from fiscal year 2025’s $10.3 billion. Just this week, OpenAI signed a $300 billion cloud contract with Oracle for the construction of data centers over the next five years, according to The New York Times. As the roughly 41% stakeholder in Oracle, Ellison has reaped the greatest benefits from his tech company’s 450% share price growth over the last five years. The 81-year-old also has gained substantial wealth from previous involvement in Tesla, as well as now owning close to 50% in Paramount Skydance. Catz too owes her billionaire status to Oracle. Although her base salary is $950,000, the majority of her wealth is connected to the market. She maintains about 1.1 million in shares but regularly receives and exercises stock options; earlier this year, she sold stock options worth some $1.8 billion, according to Bloomberg. Fortune reached out to Oracle for comment. Catz is a double graduate from the University of Pennsylvania, having gone to law school shortly after graduating with a business-focused bachelor’s degree. And even though she ultimately decided to forgo a career in law, she has no regrets. “My best decision was to choose to go to Wall Street over law. I learned a lot and focused on the expanding software industry at a time when the independent software industry was just beginning,” she told Time in 2010. “That ultimately brought me to Oracle.” And as a leader, one of her core principles is always keeping an open mind. “Listen, think and don’t be afraid to change your position based on new facts,” she told Fortune in 2015 after being asked the biggest leadership lesson she’d learned over the past year. The then-newly minted co-CEO of Oracle added that employees deserve to be heard out in every meeting. “If something doesn’t make sense, give them the respect of asking tough questions,” she said. “Think about what you’ve been told because if it doesn’t make sense to you, then it may not make sense at all. But, then again, they just might be right.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Nvidia has finally won over one of its biggest Wall Street bears
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-stock-price-prediction-nvda-outlook-ai-chips-gpu-demand-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-11T14:31:25Z
Full Content:
It seems that Nvidia's success is too great for one of Wall Street's biggest bears to ignore. In an update to clients, DA Davidson raised its rating on Nvidia stock from "neutral" to "buy" and raised its price target from $195 to $210 a share. That implies around 18% upside from current levels. It also reflects a sharp change in sentiment from what the firm has previously said about the stock, with analysts predicting as much as a 48% drop in March. "Our increasingly optimistic view of the growth in AI compute demand supersedes our list of concerns regarding NVDA," analysts led by Gil Luria, the firm's head of technology research, wrote. In the past, Luria and his team warned that spending from hyperscalers—mega-cap tech firms that are shelling out billions to further their AI ambitions—could peak in 2026, which could significantly impact Nvidia's business. The use cases for AI also need to be more significant to justify how much money comapnies are pouring into Nvidia, they added. But things have changed over the last six months. In a note shortly after Nvidia's second-quarter earnings report, Luria said the firm's perspective on the stock had "shifted quite a bit" over the past half-year, thanks to the rapid development and adoption of AI among companies. Hyperscaler spending, meanwhile, doesn't look to be nearing a peak. "It does mean that the most important thing—the overwhelming growth in demand for compute—is the only thing that matters," Luria and other analysts wrote. "NVIDIA should be able to sustain growth over the next two years, regardless of which segment that growth comes from," he added. The majority of Wall Street analysts have issued "buy" ratings on Nvidia, even considering the stock's record-breaking run-up over the last several years. The AI chipmaker is up 32% year-to-date. Luria's team, though, said they would continue to keep an eye on several "cross-currents" they saw potentially working against the stock. Here are some of the factors on their radar: Jump to

Rather, the recently appointed leader for the publicly traded company—which has rapidly amassed over $3.7 billion worth of Ethereum—believes it will be a positive "white swan event" that brings institutional ETH adoption to levels never seen before. Joseph Chalom told Decrypt that the firm is putting Ethereum on the radar of non-crypto companies and educating them on the potential of the network. As such, he thinks it's “inevitable” that more big players will adopt Ethereum as stablecoins and tokenization become mainstream. “When they start realizing that they can reduce their capital requirements for trading, when they think they can reduce the risk involved in trading and transacting, and moving money, I think it's going to be inevitable,” he explained. “The white swan event is: We're explaining to users what the potential is, and you're starting to see that adoption.” The comments come amid growing concern that the surging crypto treasury company trend could end in disaster, with fears intensifying at the same pace as the trend’s growing popularity as bears cite the huge amounts of tokens the biggest firms are accumulating. SharpLink, at the time of writing, holds 837,230 ETH, or approximately 0.69% of the total circulating ETH supply—raising concerns about whether they’d ever sell. “We are not sellers of Ethereum. We are accumulators of Ethereum,” Chalom told Decrypt. “And if there are moments that you need liquidity, you can raise liquidity through debt instruments. You could do stock buybacks. So our intent is not to sell our Ethereum. It's a reserve asset, not a trading asset.” This approach was pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin treasury company, Strategy, previously known as MicroStrategy. The one-time business software company has raised capital via debt instruments such as multiple rounds of convertible note offerings, and continued to stockpile BTC—now holding over $72 billion worth. Consequently, users on Myriad Markets—a prediction market developed by Decrypt’s parent company DASTAN—see a more than 94% likelihood that Strategy will not sell any Bitcoin this year. As a result, Chalom categorically ruled out the crypto treasury trend being the black swan event of this cycle—a term for a rare event that has a severe impact on the market, such as the FTX collapse. “Absolutely not, unless you mean the black swan event to drive mind share and adoption,” Chalom said. “The reason why I say it's just not even in the same league as [FTX] is this is the most transparent approach you can have.” The former BlackRock head of digital assets strategy explained that due to SharpLink being a public company, it is regulated by the SEC and required to follow Nasdaq rules. The firm puts out a weekly press release disclosing its holdings, purchase price, accumulated ETH rewards, and more. By comparison, he argues, the FTX situation came out of a lack of transparency. As Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX crumbled, it was discovered that the crypto exchange was sharing customer funds with his trading firm Alameda Research, to help shore up its losses. That meant that when a large number of FTX users sought to withdraw their funds, the exchange didn’t have the capital ready to fill those requests. Chalom argued that a public company couldn’t get away with such a scheme, due to its required transparency and adherence to regulations. Still, FTX was required to follow the law even as a private company, and Bankman-Fried was ultimately sentenced to 25 years in prison for his involvement in fraud and conspiracy at FTX. Chalom believes that SharpLink is building interest in Ethereum among major institutions, which he thinks will soon adopt the technology. Be it stablecoins, tokenizing real-world assets, or deploying programmable money, the co-CEO expects that the biggest players will be using Ethereum soon. And, he says, SharpLink is the first step in educating those players about cryptocurrency. “There's a giant amount of education here,” Chalom said. “And I think it doesn't take convincing, it takes explaining.” When compared to Bitcoin, which is often marketed as “digital gold,” selling Ethereum to traditional investors is a much more complicated process. That’s why, he said, Ethereum’s price may have lagged behind Bitcoin’s over the past year as investors flocked to Bitcoin ETFs more than Ethereum ones. That, he said, is set to change. “It was just easier to explain its role in a portfolio,” Chalom said of Bitcoin. “[With] Ethereum, you're telling them a network effect growth story, that is no different in some ways than Web1 and the internet. It's essentially the decentralized internet moment of both finance and other real-world activity.” “That just took a look a little bit longer to explain, and the adoption will take longer,” he added. “It just may have an impact that's 10, 20x on what Bitcoin has had on the financial ecosystem.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

SpaceX's approach to satellite cellular connectivity is facing criticism from rival AST SpaceMobile, which claims it can achieve the same results without flooding Earth’s orbit with “thousands” of satellites. Texas-based AST threw the subtle shade in a Tuesday post that touted its “commitment to responsible space operations,” which includes keeping the skies clear of satellite debris. The company didn’t name SpaceX, but it did allude to the home broadband-focused Starlink constellation, which currently spans over 8,000 satellites and could one day reach 30,000, if SpaceX receives regulatory approval. In contrast, AST says its own satellite system promises to be a leaner alternative. “This approach is remarkably efficient: with our large, powerful satellites, we can achieve global coverage with approximately 90 satellites — not thousands or even tens of thousands required by other systems,” the post said. "Beyond launching significantly fewer satellites overall, we are committed to minimizing our footprint in space through every aspect of design and operation," AST adds. SpaceX has been critical of AST’s upcoming next-generation BlueBird satellites, calling them out as "tennis-court-sized" spacecraft that threaten to upend orbital safety. The FCC is reviewing the company’s application to operate a satellite cellular service for phones in the US. If all goes well, AST will cross a crucial threshold and receive clearance to operate a constellation up to 248 satellites in size. But the same process also involves collecting public comments, including from competitors, forcing AST to answer and possibly defend its approach. That’s probably why AST’s post offers an overview of the company’s efforts to make its proposed satellite constellation safe and reliable. This includes ongoing agreements and collaborations with the National Science Foundation, NASA, and the International Astronautical Union to protect the Earth’s orbital environment and reduce the potential brightness of the satellites — something SpaceX has also been working on for Starlink. AST and SpaceX are competing to lead in the emerging market of satellite connectivity for smartphones. But SpaceX already has a significant head start. Its cellular Starlink system, which spans over 650 satellites, has already been delivering service through T-Mobile's T-Satellite add-on plan, including support for text messages and even satellite data for mobile apps. This week, Elon Musk's company also reached a $17 billion deal to acquire spectrum from Boost Mobile’s parent company, EchoStar, which promises to take the cellular Starlink service to the next level, making it comparable to a ground-based 4G service, according to SpaceX. Still, the company needs at least two years before it can begin utilizing the spectrum for commercial use since it’ll require smartphone vendors to update their products with chips capable of communicating over the additional radio bands. Meanwhile, AST is facing questions over whether it can launch enough satellites in time to begin offering the service through partners AT&T and Verizon by next year. The company currently only has five BlueBird satellites in orbit, when it needs between 45 and 60 to offer continuous service across the US. However, AST’s prototype second-generation BlueBird satellite, FM1, might not launch until December or January, when it was previously planned for August. Still, AST's CEO last month said that his company has "planned orbital launches every one to two months on average during 2025 and 2026. ... And we are on target to complete 40 satellites equivalent of microns by early 2026 to support full voice, data, and video space-based cellular broadband services.” My ExperienceI've been a journalist for over 15 years.

Institutions continue to double down on crypto. BlackRock’s crypto stash topped $100 billion, less than two years since Spot BTC and ETH ETFs debuted. Will the ETH ETF staking approval expand the holdings? The world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, now controls over $100 billion worth of crypto, underscoring increasing institutional demand for the asset class. According to Arkham data, the firm’s Bitcoin [BTC] holdings have grown to 740.5K coins worth about $85 billion as of press time. Source: Arkham Ethereum [ETH] is the second-largest crypto asset held by BlackRock. As of writing, the firm had 3.66 million ETH, worth about $16B, collectively bringing its core holdings to over $100B. However, BlackRock’s ETH accumulation has lost some steam towards the end of Q3, compared to BTC. For BTC, it ramped up its stash from 698K BTC to over 740K, about 6% surge in the past two months. Source: Bitcoin Treasuries In the past seven days of trading, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust has seen over 58K ETH outflows, about a 1.4% decline over the same period. The net assets dropped from over $17B to $15.9B amid the outflows and ETH price pullback. Source: SoSo Value According to analytics firm LookOnChain, BlackRock sold nearly $200M worth of ETH on the 9th of September, 2x higher than the amount of BTC ($100M) offloaded over the same period. Simply put, investors in BlackRock crypto products have shown remarkable resilience in BTC compared to ETH. Source: LookOnChain However, it remains to be seen how the potential staking approval could improve the overall demand for ETH ETFs. That said, Spot BTC ETFs remain the keyholders of BTC. As of September, this category of investors controls about 7% (1.4 million) of BTC’s total 21 million supply of coins. In contrast, corporate treasuries, led by Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), command 4.6% (1 million BTC) of the overall supply.

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement Use these Alexa commands to manage your life without lifting a finger. These voice commands make Alexa the ultimate sidekick. Alexa has evolved far beyond its origins as a simple voice assistant for setting reminders and playing music. After 11 years, it finally got a significant upgrade with the introduction of Alexa Plus. This new iteration is powered by advanced AI, making the assistant smarter, more conversational, and, for the first time, proactive. With Alexa Plus, the assistant can manage your smart devices, organize a dynamic calendar, control your Fire TV, and even follow you from one speaker to another as you move through your home. This deeper integration makes for a more seamless user experience. If you haven't used Alexa in a while, its new commands are designed to keep up with the demands of a busy life. This CNET survey found that 73% of US adults who use voice assistants still have privacy concerns with AI features, but Alexa was rated the most trusted option among them. If you own an Echo device, learning the right commands is the key to unlocking everything Alexa can do. Here's a full guide to the best ones to start with. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. Amazon recently launched Alexa Plus, a major AI-powered upgrade to its voice assistant. This new version brings significantly improved conversational abilities and smart home control. The upgrade costs $20 monthly but is free for Amazon Prime subscribers. The upgraded system, first demoed in 2023, can handle more complex requests, remember personal details and perform multiple actions through natural conversation. With these spring cleaning and organization features, Alexa Plus aims to make managing your home more intuitive than ever. Notable new commands include: Before that, Amazon had announced new hardware products while also talking up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including: By default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, "Alexa." You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually). If you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa. There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, "Stop." Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, "Alexa, play folk music at volume six," or, "Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list." Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen, the living room or anywhere for that matter. While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant. In fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have: You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. "Hey, Siri" or "Hey, Google" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant. On an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, "Open Alexa." After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana. Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example). The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted. When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com. Here are all the native Alexa commands. The Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays. This means you can tell them to show you things. You can ask your Echo show to show you things using voice commands. You can now use compatible Echo devices (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show and Amazon Tap) to control your Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks. Amazon also builds its Fire TV operating system into televisions like the Element EL4KAMZ17 series. All of the commands above work on those too, in addition to a few TV-specific commands below. Alexa commands also work with Fire TV products. You can make calls and leave voicemails to other Echo users, as well as "Drop In" to your own echo devices, either to voice or video chat with whoever's in the room (or just to monitor the space like a security camera). If you have an Android, you can send text messages with Alexa. Control purchases, shopping lists and notifications with your Echo device. To turn on notifications, open the Alexa app and select to Settings, then Notifications, then Shopping Notifications and toggle it on. Your Echo speakers will light up yellow when you have new notifications. Alexa can answer all of your music and movie-related questions. Kids can ask Alexa to play parent-approved music and stories with the Echo Dot Kids Edition. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms, such as SmartThings, Philips Hue, Wink, Insteon, Lutron, Belkin WeMo and many more. Some require you to enable skills, and some don't. Here is a selection of the commands you can use for controlling your smart home, although there are dozens more. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms and devices. Skills are third-party applications for Alexa speakers. They allow you to connect third-party software and hardware to your speaker, as well as play games and add different news sources to your Flash Briefing. Originally, they had to be enabled before you could use them, but Amazon has since made that process automatic (just ask for the Skill and it will enable when it's used). Microsoft's Cortana is available as a skill -- but rather than just being a skill, it opens the door to a completely separate digital assistant through your Alexa speakers. Once you've added the skill, enabled permissions and connected your Microsoft and Amazon accounts, just say, "Alexa, open Cortana." When you're speaking to Cortana you can check your emails, ask for the next event on your calendar or add items to your to-do list. For now, the Cortana skill is limited because it's a public preview of what the full integration will be in the future. Ring in the holiday season -- or the spooky season -- using you Echo devices. Alexa comes chock-full of Easter eggs and jokes -- the list is long. We cover the strange world of Alexa Easter eggs here, noting some of the more popular or prominent commands that prompt a snarky or humorous response. For even more, check out this Reddit thread dedicated to Alexa Easter eggs.

BlackRock, J.P. Morgan and CPP Investments are among several institutional investors that potentially missed out on billions of dollars in gains by dumping millions of shares in Google parent Alphabet Inc. just before the stock ascended to a 52-week high. The tech giant’s Class A share price climbed steadily during the second quarter, rising 29% from its 52-week low of $140.53 on April 7 to $181.23 on June 30. The shares surged further to a 52-week high of $232.37 on September 4 after a court ruled that Google will not be forced to sell its Chrome browser. Google’s nonvoting C shares traded between a low of $142.66 on April 7 and a high of $182.45 on June 10. The trading activity was reported in second quarter filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, but the sale dates and prices were not disclosed. Based on the high and low stock prices during the quarter, sellers potentially missed out on gains of at least 28% and as much as 65%, as of September 4. Investors who sold Alphabet’s nonvoting C shares (GOOG) potentially missed out on runs of 28% to 64%. Among the sellers, BlackRock sold approximately 9.4 million Alphabet Class A shares and about 3 million Class C shares during Q2. The total sale price of the A-shares ranged from $1.32 billion to $1.70 billion, while C shares sold for $428.9 million to $548.5 million.

Capital Group’s Capital Research Global Investors unit sold more than 10 million A shares during Q2 for between $1.41 billion and $1.81 billion, as well as about 8.7 million C shares for $1.24 billion to $1.59 billion. The sales reduced Capital Research’s holdings in Alphabet A shares and C shares by 19% and 24%, respectively. Had the firm held on to the A shares, they would have been worth $2.33 billion as of September 4, potentially missing out on gains of between $520 million to $920 million. Capital Research’s C shares would have been worth $2.03 billion as of the same date, with potential value of $435 million to $785 million. J.P. Morgan sold approximately 4.2 million Class A shares during Q2 for between $590.2 million and $761.2 million.

The domestic wood panel industry is gearing up for a robust revival, driven by a surge in housing handovers, large-scale capacity expansions and easing timber prices, said analysts. Shares such as Greenply Industries, Century Plyboard, Greenpanel, Greenlam Industries, Archidply Industries and Rushil Decor gained sharply in today’s trade. In the three months, these stocks have generated handsome returns between 3 and 29 per cent. While plywood remains the dominant category, Medium-Density Fibreboard (MDF) is witnessing rapid adoption, especially in commercial and OEM segments. MDF demand grew at a 22 per cent CAGR during FY21-FY25, said Yes Securities, expecting this momentum to continue as pricing stabilises and margins recover. In Q1FY26, wood panel companies reported modest operating performances. “Plywood segment exhibited mixed volume growth, but OPM was subdued y-o-y. MDF segment saw muted volume growth (except CPBI) and operating margins continued to be mixed across companies, said ICICI Securities. According to analysts, operating margins should stay healthy in the plywood segment as timber prices have stabilised. Besides, the government is taking steps to ensure BIS on furniture by February 26. While the import inventory has also died down, there is still competition for pricing from the unorganised players. This, combined with the softening of timber prices, will act as a tailwind for the plywood business, said Axis Securities.. Yes Securities, in a recent thematic report, said the sector is entering a multi-year upcycle, with top players like Century Plyboards and Greenply Industries expected to lead the charge. India’s real estate market has seen a massive presales boom over the past four years, with a significant portion of inventory now entering the handover phase. The average area of homes scheduled for delivery between 2024 and 2029 is nearly double that of the previous decade, implying higher interior spends and increased demand for furniture — a key driver for woodpanel consumption. “The MDF industry has faced oversupply challenges in recent years, creating pricing pressure and materially impacting margins. However, with most large capacity expansions already commissioned and demand growth likely to sustain, utilisation levels should improve, aiding margin recovery. Furthermore, the imposition of anti-dumping duty has curbed imports substantially, and the existing inventory of low-cost imports is nearing exhaustion. Consequently, we expect improvement in the overall scenario for MDFs hereon,” the Yes Securities’ report noted. Top listed players have invested over ₹5,000 crore in capacity expansion across plywood, MDF, laminates and particle boards. With major capex behind them and demand set to rise, analysts anticipate a strong earnings trajectory. On the cost side, timber prices, which account for up to 65 per cent of raw material costs, are showing signs of cooling after an 18-24 month rally. This should aid margin recovery across companies. With timber prices showing signs of cooling and anti-dumping duties curbing cheap imports, the woodpanel sector is set for margin expansion. Analysts highlight that PEG ratios for top players are below 1x, indicating attractive valuations relative to growth. As the housing handover cycle accelerates and furniture demand rises, investors may find compelling opportunities in select woodpanel stocks — especially those with diversified portfolios and completed capex cycles. With furniture demand rising and capacity in place, brokerages see woodpanel companies entering a margin-accretive earnings cycle. Analysts prefer diversified players like CPBI and Greenply for re-rating potential, while niche MDF player Greenpanel may see steady but limited upside.

NEW YORK, Sept. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE:NVO) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Novo securities between May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 30, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day.

Title: SEC sets Q4 deadlines for 90+ crypto ETFs – Details inside!

The regulator requested for more time to review recent filings SEC has delayed its decision on several altcoins and staking ETFs filings to October and November. Will the approvals trigger a strong market rally in Q4? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed its decision on several crypto ETFs and related staking applications. The regulator requested more time until late October or mid-November to review the requests from interested issuers. On the pending Ethereum [ETH] ETF staking list, BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, 21Shares, and Grayscale were all delayed. Source: SEC For BlackRock’s staking application, the agency extended the final deadline to the 30th of October. The world’s largest asset manager made its first filing for this provision in July. The decision on Franklin Templeton’s crypto index and ETF staking permission was pushed to the 13th of November. In addition, the agency postponed the decision on Spot Solana [SOL] and Ripple [XRP] applications by Franklin Templeton to the 14th of November. Already, the market was extremely positive about the outcome of these altcoin ETF filings. In fact, XRP Futures hit a record level amid anticipation ahead of the Q4 deadline. Despite the delay, issuers continue to submit new crypto ETF filings with the regulator. Asset manager VanEck is reportedly planning to file for a Spot Hyperliquid [HYPE] staking ETF in the U.S. and an exchange-traded offering in Europe. According to a Bloomberg ETF analyst, James Seyffart, there are over 90 crypto ETFs waiting for the SEC’s decision. This includes even memecoins. In fact, the first U.S.-based memecoin ETF, a Dogecoin [DOGE], will debut this week, setting the stage for potentially more approvals. Additionally, even chances of ETH staking approval remain high. Especially after the recent SEC’s guidance that liquid staking tokens aren’t securities, but receipts that show proof of deposits. The massive wave of crypto ETFs follows the regulatory shift and ongoing clarity that most crypto tokens aren’t securities. However, if approved, the public demand for these altcoin ETF products will determine whether they will be traded on public exchanges for an extended period of time or be delisted.

Three or four other active equity funds are in the pipeline, which may see the light of day this fiscal. Other products, including ETFs, will follow in due course,” JioBlackRock AMC chief investment officer Rishi Kohli said. The fund, built on BlackRock’s globally proven SAE platform, follows a rules-based and predominantly machine-driven process tracking 400 signals. About 95 per cent of the investment process will be technology-driven, aiming to eliminate key-person risk, reduce cognitive biases, and ensure disciplined fund management. The SAE Flexi-Cap Fund will maintain a controlled active risk of no more than 3-4 per cent, lower than industry averages, with a focus on downside risk protection and consistent returns for investors. Kohli said a 10-year simulation indicated the model could deliver 3-4 per cent outperformance over the benchmark index, similar to results achieved in other BlackRock country funds. “In an uncertain market environment, where equity markets have been tough, we believe it’s a good time to launch a product that manages risk on the lower side compared to other active funds and still aims for attractive alpha in the long run,” Kohli said. JioBlackRock, the partnership between Jio Financials and the world's largest asset managers BlackRock, received its license in May and currently manages around ₹18,000 crore in assets across eight cash and index funds. The fund house will continue to focus on digital distribution in the near term. The official, however, did not comment on AUM targets or a break-even timeline.

Title: Forbes Daily: What’s Behind Larry Ellison’s Unprecedented Wealth Surge

ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. Larry Ellison is coming for Elon Musk’s crown as the world’s richest person. The Oracle chairman became nearly $100 billion richer Wednesday—the biggest single-day gain ever—as shares of the cloud computing giant rallied. Ellison briefly became the second-ever person to cross the $400 billion mark, before falling back down to $388 billion by late afternoon. Oracle’s stock surged 36%, largely on the company’s projection that cloud infrastructure revenue, primarily to power AI, will skyrocket. There’s a key reason Ellison benefits so much from Oracle’s gain: stock buybacks, which the company has spent $142 billion on since 2011. As a result, Ellison’s stake nearly doubled to 41% in that time. Conservative activist and founder of Turning Point USA Charlie Kirk died at age 31 on Wednesday after he was shot at an event at Utah Valley University. Kirk was a prominent voice in culture wars on college campuses and hosted a popular daily radio show and podcast. Utah and federal law enforcement authorities are still searching for the shooter as of Thursday morning, after two people were detained and later released. MORE: The fatal shooting drew bipartisan condemnation from lawmakers and public figures, with President Donald Trump saying that nobody “understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Kirk,” while California Governor Gavin Newsom said the killing was “sick and reprehensible,” adding that he admired Kirk’s “passion and commitment to debate.” The buy-now, pay-later hype has made its way to Wall Street, as Swedish firm Klarna surged in its IPO on Wednesday. The company, which began trading on the New York Stock Exchange at $52, up 30% from its IPO price, is the first of three high-profile fintech firms aiming to go public this week. In a surprisingly positive development in the fight against inflation, wholesale prices fell in August after Wall Street expected an increase, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In a note, Comerica Bank’s chief economist Bill Adams said wholesalers and retailers have been “slow to pass on the costs of tariffs” to consumers—but President Donald Trump celebrated the report while reiterating calls for the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates. Melinda French Gates announced Wednesday at the Forbes Power Women’s Summit that she is backing a $100 million partnership to address women’s health, targeting long-underfunded research on conditions like cardiovascular disease, women’s mental health and autoimmune disorders. The need is clear: Just 1% of global health research beyond cancer focuses on conditions unique to women. The succession battle over the future of FOX and News Corp came to an end this week, and 94-year-old Rupert Murdoch’s wish to leave control of the trust that holds his family’s $8.1 billion combined stake in the two media giants to his son, Lachlan, will be fulfilled. Lachlan’s two siblings, Elisabeth and James Murdoch, and his oldest half-sibling, Prudence MacLeod, will be bought out—which should let them each walk away with about $1.4 billion. Jared Kushner’s brother Josh has been one of the most active investors in AI through his firm Thrive Capital, and now Jared is getting in on the action by cofounding AI startup Brain Co. The firm, which aims to help big corporations and governments use AI to improve their operations, announced Wednesday it had emerged from stealth and raised $30 million in its Series A funding round. South Korean nationals who were detained after a raid on a Hyundai plant in Georgia last week were released early on Thursday, a day later than initially planned, as South Korean officials claimed that President Donald Trump “wanted to explore whether they could stay in the U.S. to continue working and training American workers.” However, South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun turned down the offer, saying the detained individuals were “extremely shocked and exhausted.” As ICE ramps up for an agent hiring surge, the agency has acquired a slew of new armor, drones and weaponry, records show. The military-grade gear ranges from Glock handguns to an AI-powered drone for “surveillance,” as the Trump Administration has promised to carry out more mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. The U.S. job market just got a big rewrite. On Tuesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said the economy added 911,000 fewer jobs in the year ending March 2025 than previously thought—the largest downward revision on record. The timing isn’t ideal, as the agency itself has been under fire. President Donald Trump accused former commissioner Erika McEntarfer of manipulating data during the 2024 election and has said the BLS “rigged” its numbers. He replaced her with Heritage Foundation economist E.J. Antoni, a move Democrats condemned. But the explanation for the correction has to do with small businesses. Nonfarm payrolls (the proper name for the official monthly jobs number) aren’t an actual count of every worker. It’s a survey of employers. The BLS asks firms how many people are on their payrolls. The survey then gets adjusted to try to capture the parts of the labor market the survey misses. Introduced in 2003, the birth-death model uses historical patterns to estimate how many new firms are likely opening or closing each month. It works well in normal times. But not all times are normal. And for the last two years, it has looked out of step with reality. Census Bureau data show that before 2020, Americans were filing about 300,000 new business applications a month. The number was steady for years, but then the pandemic hit. Since then, filings have averaged more than 400,000 a month. Some months have been higher. People want to work from home, and more are willing to try entrepreneurship. New tools, including AI, make it easier to start. WHY IT MATTERS “The jobs report is one of the most watched economic indicators,” says Forbes senior reporter Brandon Kochkodin. “Big revisions shake confidence in the numbers and can move markets. They also provide fodder for political fights. Understanding what drives the revisions can help you make sense of the noise.” MORE Forget BLS. Here’s How To Take The Economy’s Temperature Without Using Government Data Amazon’s robotaxi unit Zoox is now offering free rides to the public in Las Vegas, as it aims to compete with the autonomous ride-hail service from Alphabet’s Waymo. It’s a big step for the company, which was acquired by Amazon in 2020: Five: The number of locations around the city that Zoox vehicles will pick up and drop off passengers $1.2 billion: The price Amazon paid to acquire Zoox The end of 2024: When Zoox started building up its fleet of robotaxis at a 220,000-square-foot factory in California As the job market continues to weaken, young people are feeling the effects the most. But to stand out in a crowded field, consider skipping LinkedIn and instead opt for the niche job boards where recruiters actually hunt. Rewrite your résumé for each role, and be sure to share your salary expectations with prospective employers up front—especially if you’re short on time. Uber will offer a few unconventional rides starting next year after its acquisition of a firm for $125 million. Which of the following is one of the types of vehicles that users will be able to ride in? A. Boat B. Seaplane C. Motorcycle D. Bus Check your answer. Thanks for reading!

U.S. stock futures are pointing higher ahead of today's release of key inflation data, which is expected to show prices ticked higher in August; Oracle (ORCL) shares are rising further in premarket trading after skyrocketing Wednesday; buy now, pay later firm Klarna (KLAR) shares are pulling back after jumping in their debut yesterday; and meme stock Opendoor Technologies (OPEN) is surging after the firm names a Shopify (SHOP) executive its new CEO. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing higher ahead of today's closely watched inflation data. Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures are up 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively, after each index registered a fresh record closing high Wednesday. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are up 0.2% after the blue-chip index declined by 0.5% yesterday. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is rising to trade above $114,000. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is little changed. Oil and gold futures both are lower. The Consumer Price Index is expected to show that the inflation rate moved higher in August when that report is released at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal project that the CPI report will show that prices in August rose by 2.9% over the past 12 months, up from 2.7% in July. That would mark the highest annual inflation rate since January. Yesterday, the Producer Price Index reading for August ticked 0.1% lower when a rise of 0.3% was expected. The CPI report will be closely watched by Federal Reserve officials, who are considering lowering interest rates at the central bank's meeting next week. Oracle (ORCL) shares are rising a further 2% in premarket trading after soaring 36% Wednesday—their best day since 1992. The stock's blistering gains on strong AI demand has analysts racing to raise their price targets—with most expecting its record run isn't over yet. Oracle also was supported by a The Wall Street Journal report that OpenAI had contracted the company for $300 billion in cloud services over the next five years. Shares of buy now, pay later firm Klarna (KLAR) are pulling back somewhat in premarket trading, a day after jumping nearly 15% in their debut on the New York Stock Exchange. Klarna shares opened trading yesterday at $52, well above their their initial public offering price of $40, and rose above $57 before closing at $45.82, giving the company a market capitalization of more than $17 billion. Klarna shares were down 2% about 90 minutes before the opening bell. Opendoor Technologies (OPEN) shares are soaring about 35% in premarket trading after the online housing platform tapped Kaz Nejatian, the chief operating officer at Shopify (SHOP), to be its new CEO. The company also said co-founders Keith Rabois and Eric Wu would be returning to the board, effective immediately, with Rabois taking on the role of chairman. Opendoor shares have surged since July as retail investors have piled into the meme stock. Opendoor shares ended June trading at $0.53 each but entered Thursday at $5.86.

Title: The Everyday Investor’s Report For Thursday, September 11

ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. Stock prices dipped slightly in trading Wednesday after Oracle reported an upbeat outlook for cloud revenue and the Producer Price Index revealed a decline in wholesale prices in August. The S&P 500 fell 0.28% after the opening bell Wednesday. The Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.43% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.53%. Technology company Oracle reported earnings after the close of trading Tuesday. The headlining takeaway was the company’s expectation of generating $144 billion in cloud infrastructure revenue in fiscal 2030, up from an expected $18 billion this fiscal year. Oracle’s cloud revenue has benefited from the AI build out. The ample projection suggests there’s still momentum in AI stocks. The Producer Price Index, known as the PPI, declined 0.1% in August after rising 0.7% in July. The Core PPI, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.3% as expected. Investors are watching pricing data closely. Higher-than-expected increases could influence when and how quickly the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates. The Fed’s next interest-rate decision will be announced on September 17. Stock futures are slightly up of the market open on Thursday. Futures tracking the S&P 500 rose 0.2%. Contracts tied to the technology-focused Nasdaq 100 rose 0.27%. And Dow Jones futures rose 0.19%. Events on the calendar for September 11 that could influence stock prices include: What’s your investing goal? Having a defined investing goal helps you make better trading decisions. Knowing the goal helps you understand the timeline and influences the level of risk you should accept. Consider two common investing goals: investing to fund a comfortable retirement and investing to pay for your kid’s college education. Both goals have a timeline and personal level of significance. For example, you may hope to retire at age 55—but you’re willing to wait until age 60 to maintain a specific lifestyle. Or perhaps you intend to save enough to fund a private university education for your kid, and you view that goal as non-negotiable. These parameters should affect how much you invest, the types of investments you buy and the decisions you make during tough market cycles. Your approach to retirement saving or college funding should differ from an approach designed to create gains as quickly as possible. Why? Because you can’t afford to lose your nest egg or your kid’s college funding. So, figure out why you’re investing and evaluate your trading impulses against the goal. Ask yourself: will this trade serve the goal? This one habit can improve your results significantly over time.

Today's top news: Solana just printed a seven-month high. And its fresh new narrative may be enough to drive it to new ATHs in 2025. SOL climbed ~4% Wednesday to nearly $225, its highest level since February, and is up about 25% over the past month. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan says the same forces that powered Bitcoin and Ethereum’s rally (ETF inflows and corporate/treasury accumulation) are now lining up for Solana, setting the stage for an “epic end-of-year run.” Here’s a glimpse at what’s happening for Solana right now: It’s a very nice setup. “For the last 18 months, the recipe for strong returns in crypto has been clear: Take one part exchange traded products (ETP) inflows, add strong corporate treasury purchases, and voilà-you get big returns… All the ingredients are there for an epic end-of-year run for Solana.” - Matt Hougan, CIO, Bitwise This is one of those trades that feels too easy to be true. But SOL has nearly the exact same setup as BTC and ETH before it. Institutional flows have been the primary force driving crypto majors price action over the past 18 months. And now it’s Solana’s turn. They’ve got ~$3B in SOL TreasuryCo’s incoming and ETFs coming Q4 (though it should be noted that BlackRock isn’t in the mix, the highest volume ETF facilitator). And a strong ecosystem, with apps like Pump Fun driving top-5 revenue numbers across all of crypto. It’s certainly not a done deal by any means. The TreasuryCo’s could end up being underwhelming. The ETFs might not catch much volume in the early months. Leading apps might sputter. But with many thinking Bitcoin will make sweeping new ATHs in Q4 2025 (I’m in this cohort), it’s not a big stretch to think SOL will also make a run. And it has real drivers.

Title: Oracle CEO Larry Ellison’s ability to secure Nvidia GPUs has made it the cloud contender it never was and allowed Ellison to briefly surpass Elon Musk as the world’s richest man

Jeremy Kahn is the AI editor at Fortune, spearheading the publication's coverage of artificial intelligence. He also co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. Good morning. It’s Jeremy here, filling in for Andrew, who is now on paternity leave for a bit. So you’ll see a rotating cast of Fortune tech journalists writing this newsletter for a few weeks. Fortune Brainstorm Tech wrapped yesterday. Here were a few highlights from the final day of the conference: Meanwhile, the tech world is talking about Oracle’s massive market gains, which have boosted Oracle founder, chairman, and chief technology officer Larry Ellison’s net worth, allowing him to surpass Elon Musk to claim the title of world’s richest man. Helping to drive Oracle’s stock was the announcement of a massive $300 billion deal with OpenAI to supply the AI company with data center capacity. (Now we know why OpenAI is telling investors it’s going to burn through $115 billion in cash by 2029.) Of course, the only reason Oracle is in this position is down to Ellison’s courting of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, which has allowed his company, previously a distinct back-of-the-pack cloud company, to secure a massive stockpile of top-of-the-line Nvidia GPUs. More on Ellison’s soaring fortunes below. Buy-now, pay-later fintech Klarna’s IPO went off, with the company’s shares gaining 15% on opening day. (Whether that “opening day pop” is a good thing is a debate for another day. It seems like the finance profs have mostly lost the argument, with bankers convincing companies that the money lost from underpricing the shares is worth its weight in marketing and investor buzz from the opening day jump.) Beatrice Nolan has more too on Sam Altman’s sit down with conservative broadcaster Tucker Carlson. While Altman said a number of interesting things—most of which he has said before—the real news was the fact that Atlman felt the need to do Carlson’s podcast in the first place. Clearly OpenAI has seen reports that the MAGA crowd is unhappy with President Donald Trump’s cozy relationship with Silicon Valley’s biggest players and is hoping to win them over. The MAGA wing of the Republican Party views AI companies with at best skepticism and at worst, downright disdain, seeing them as woke bastions of left wing coastal elitism, exemplars of Silicon Valley’s inordinate, insidious, and arbitrary power, and, in their quest to build AGI and “superintelligence,” guilty of a kind of idolatry (essentially trying to build God in a machine). You can watch Carlson press Altman on these points throughout the podcast, while Altman tries, often awkwardly, to parry the premise of Carlson’s questions, or assure Carlson that there’s really not as much ideological distance between them as Carlson seems to assume. It’s all slightly cringey (especially Carlson’s over-the-top facial expressions). But, despite the cringe factor, it is probably worth watching, if only to get a deeper sense of the reasons MAGA distrusts Silicon Valley in general and AI in particular. Ok, now here’s more tech news. —Jeremy Kahn Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Fortune Tech? Drop a line here. Oracle’s revenue projections sent the stock, and Ellison’s net worth, soaring on Wednesday. It was bad news for old friend Elon Musk, though, whose nearly year-long reign as the world’s richest man came to a brief end. (Oracle stock pulled back a bit before the close, allowing Musk to regain the title.) Oracle’s strong quarterly results added a whopping $101 billion to Ellison’s wealth at one point, boosting his fortune to $393 billion and leapfrogging above Musk’s $385 billion, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index. The staggering increase was the largest one-day increase ever recorded by the index. Oracle stock surged 36% on Wednesday—the company’s biggest one-day increase ever—after executives reported blowout bookings and gave a bullish cloud outlook. The rally adds to the 45% gain the company already notched up this year. The Wall Street Journal reported that the majority of the new revenue will come from OpenAI, which signed a staggering $300B cloud agreement with Oracle. The AI firm will tap Oracle’s computing infrastructure under the billion dollar deal, which is one of the largest cloud contracts ever signed. The commitment far exceeds OpenAI’s current revenue. Oracle’s revenue projections shocked analysts, who told CNBC they were “blown away” and “all kind of in shock.” Some, however, are urging caution, warning the unprecedented success has made the stock overvalued. —Beatrice Nolan The pair also discussed OpenAI cofounder Elon Musk, with Altman saying he now “feels differently” about the man he once saw as an “incredible hero.” Perhaps it's because of the lawsuits, or the X spats. In one tense moment, when the pair discussed OpenAI whistleblower Suchir Balaji’s death, Altman asked if Carlson was accusing him of murder after the podcast host declared the death, which authorities have ruled as a suicide, “definitely murder.” "I haven't done too many interviews where I have been accused of murder,” Altman said. —Beatrice Nolan Microsoft is cracking down on its hybrid work policy. The tech giant is mandating a minimum of three in-office days a week for employees beginning February 2026, according to a Business Insider report. The policy will first apply to Seattle-area staff, later expanding nationwide and globally. Workers have until Sept. 19 to request exceptions. Microsoft rolled out a flexible work policy after offices reopened from pandemic closures where employees were permitted to work from home up to half the time without official approval. This move follows similar steps from Big Tech rivals including Meta and Google, which already enforce similar RTO rules. The stricter approach comes as the company increases pressure on employees, reshaping performance expectations in an effort to prepare for the next phase of AI-driven growth. Staff in Microsoft’s AI division, led by DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman, will face an even stricter requirement: four days a week on site starting January 2026, with exceptions only granted at the highest levels. —Beatrice Nolan Klarna climbed 15% in its Wednesday trading debut. The Swedish-born fintech shares closed at $45.82, 15% above the $40 offer price. CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski framed the listing as proof Klarna is moving beyond buy-now, pay-later into broader banking products, even if the company’s value has dropped well below its 2021 peak. The closing price values the company at over $17 billion based on its outstanding shares, with stock options and warrants adding slightly to that figure. The company’s debut also made dozens of staffers millionaires, and its cofounders billionaires. The listing arrives amid a resurgence in the IPO market, which has been under pressure, with companies including Figma debuting with strong performances. Klarna’s debut didn’t quite make the same splash as Figma’s in July, which saw the stock more than triple from its offer price. —Beatrice Nolan —Meta and TikTok score a win against EU tech fees. But won’t receive any money back while officials reformulate the levy. —Apple’s new AI guidelines are Trump-friendly. The company marked DEI as a “controversial” topic. —Reddit removes subscriber counts from subreddits. The platform will switch to displaying weekly active visitors. —Amazon-owned Zoox launches public service in Las Vegas.

The largest ETH treasury firm BitMine Immersion Technologies (NYSE: BMNR) has continued with its aggressive Ethereum ETH $4 720 24h volatility: 4.6% Market cap: $569.90 B Vol. 24h: $37.30 B purchases, buying another $200 million worth of ETH in early Asian trading hours on Sept. 11. This latest purchase comes as ETH price shows signs of recovery, gaining 3% today to $4,440, amid broader crypto market rally. Tom Lee’s BitMine continues with its aggressive Ethereum purchases, adding another 46,255 coins, worth a massive $200million, to their ETH treasury, on September 11. The purchase follows Monday’s acquisition of 202,500 ETH, pushing BitMine’s total holdings past 2.1 million ETH, valued at more than $9.2 billion. With the latest addition, BitMine maintains its lead as the largest corporate holder of Ethereum, far ahead of Sharplink Gaming’s 837,000 ETH treasury. According to the data from Strategic ETH Reserve, BitMine’s two big ETH purchases this week nearly matched the total ETH accumulated by all treasury firms last week. The ETH treasury firms have been raising more cash ammunition, through stock and bond sales, to further build their Ethereum reserves. Last week, corporate buyers accumulated 273,300 ETH in total, with The Ether Machine leading the purchases at 150,000 ETH, followed by BitMine with 74,300 ETH. Amid its aggressive purchases, BMNR stock has also witnessed a trend reversal after a 23% correction over the past month. On the weekly chart, BMNR stock is up 5%, bouncing back from the lows of $40. Amid the broader crypto market uptick following softer US PPI data and rising Fed rate cut expectations, Ether price has surged 2.5% today on Sept. 11. The daily trading volume in Ethereum has jumped 38% to $41.5 billion, which reflects strong bullish sentiment among traders. Moreover, CoinGlass data shows that the ETH futures open interest has surged over $61.5 billion.

Title: PsiQuantum secures $1bn funding
URL: https://www.verdict.co.uk/psiquantum-series-e-round/
Time Published: 2025-09-11T10:36:46Z

PsiQuantum, a US-based quantum computing company, has secured $1bn in Series E funding to accelerate the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers. This funding round was led by affiliates of BlackRock with contributions from Temasek and Baillie Gifford. It values PsiQuantum at $7bn and introduces new investors, including entities managed by Macquarie Capital and Ribbit Capital. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more This investment aims to support the establishment of utility-scale quantum computing sites in Brisbane, Australia and Chicago and will aid in the deployment of large-scale prototype systems. It further aims to advance PsiQuantum’s quantum photonic chips and architecture. PsiQuantum’s approach is driven by its focus on error correction, which it believes necessitates around a million physical qubits to achieve commercially viable quantum computing. The company aims to address significant challenges such as manufacturability, cooling, and networking by leveraging the advantages of photonic qubits alongside semiconductor manufacturing processes. PsiQuantum co-founder and CEO Jeremy O’Brien said: “Only building the real thing—million-qubit-scale, fault-tolerant machines—will unlock the promise of quantum computing. “We defined what it takes from day one: this is a grand engineering challenge, not a science experiment. We tackled the hardest problems first—at the architectural and chip level—and are now mass-manufacturing best-in-class quantum photonic chips at a leading US semiconductor fab. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. “With this funding, we’re ready to take the next decisive steps to deliver the full potential of quantum computing.” Since its Series D funding in 2021, PsiQuantum has established a high-volume manufacturing process for its photonic chipset at GlobalFoundries’ facility in New York. A critical development is the integration of Barium Titanate (BTO) into its production line. BTO plays a crucial role in optical switches necessary for scaling optical quantum computing. The latest funding is expected to help the firm to further scale up the production of BTO towards the volumes required for utility-scale quantum computing. PsiQuantum manufactures BTO wafers in California before integrating them with those produced at GlobalFoundries. Nvidia’s venture capital arm, NVentures, is also among the new investors in PsiQuantum. The quantum company has also entered into a partnership with Nvidia, which spans several areas, including quantum algorithms, software development, and graphics processing unit (GPU)-quantum processing unit (QPU) integration. This collaboration supports advancements in PsiQuantum’s silicon photonics platform. Additionally, the firm is said to be actively working on systems that do not rely on traditional cryostats. Instead, it has developed a high-density cooling solution similar to data centre racks, capable of accommodating multiple quantum chips. Earlier in 2025, PsiQuantum completed the research phase of US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Underexplored Systems for Utility-Scale Quantum Computing (US2QC) programme. The project now moves into the validation phase under DARPA’s Quantum Benchmarking Initiative. This phase will evaluate system design, component performance, and application use cases, marking a significant step towards realising commercially viable quantum computing systems.

Title: How The 10 Richest American Hedge Fund Managers Got $20 Billion Richer In A Year
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/hanktucker/2025/09/11/how-the-10-richest-american-hedge-fund-managers-got-20-billion-richer-in-a-year/
Time Published: 2025-09-11T10:30:00Z
Full Content:
ByHank Tucker, Forbes Staff. Most hedge funds have lagged behind the AI-fueled stock market surge of the past three years, opting for lower-risk investments. But that hasn’t stopped investor money from clamoring to get access to the top firms—or investment gains and carried interest from adding billions to their billionaire owners’ pockets. The 10 richest hedge fund managers on this year’s Forbes 400 ranking of the country’s richest people are worth a combined $174 billion, up $20 billion from a year ago. Citadel’s Ken Griffin was the biggest gainer by far, with his fortune swelling by more than $7 billion to an estimated $50.4 billion, widening Griffin’s lead over the rest of the pack. The next three richest hedge fund managers in the U.S.—David Tepper of Appaloosa Management, Steve Cohen of Point72 and Israel Englander of Millennium Management—only added about $3 billion to their fortunes on average over the same span. Each of these four investors generated double-digit net returns in 2024, outperforming the 6.2% return of the HFRI 500 Fund Weighted Composite Index, which tracks the largest hedge funds that are open to new investments. That hedge fund index’s three-year average annual return through the first half of 2025 is a meager 4.6%, trounced by the S&P 500’s annualized return of 16% over that same period. Against that lackluster competition, the best of the best can charge higher fees without driving their investors away. Citadel, Millennium, Point72 and others all have implemented or expanded so-called passthrough fee arrangements in recent years that have shifted more operating costs to investors, beyond the standard 2% management fee that has long been a hedge fund staple. The top firms have staffs of several thousand employees who are expensive but have proven worthwhile. The annualized return for Citadel’s flagship Wellington fund from 1990 through 2024 is 19.5%, after fees. Millennium’s net annualized return since inception in 1989, meanwhile, is 14%, with only one down year, in 2008. Most of these top firms are largely closed to new investors, and habitually return profits to existing limited partners, in order to stay lean enough to sustain their performance. But they’ve spawned plenty of imitators, with Hedge Fund Research reporting that net inflows into hedge funds in the second quarter this year amounted to $25 billion, representing the highest quarterly net asset inflow in 11 years. Still, the gap between the upstarts and the most technologically advanced multistrategy firms is widening. Citadel, D.E. Shaw and Millennium generated $29.5 billion in net gains in 2024, according to LCH Investments, amounting to more than 10% of the net $289 billion in gains all hedge fund managers produced. The founders of these firms have long been mainstays on The Forbes 400. Citadel has become the envy of the hedge fund world, managing $68 billion in assets, but an even larger piece of Griffin’s net worth comes from his majority ownership stake in Citadel Securities, a separate market-making firm that booked $9.7 billion in net trading revenue last year. He used some of the profits to add to his collection of homes and toys, spending $45 million on fellow Forbes 400 member Julia Koch’s Park Avenue co-op this February and $18 million on rare copies of the Emancipation Proclamation and 13th Amendment signed by Abraham Lincoln. He intends to loan those documents for public display ahead of the United States’ 250th birthday festivities next year. Tepper’s personal capital makes up the majority of Appaloosa’s $17 billion in assets under management. The largest position in the fund’s stock portfolio as of the end of June was an $800 million stake in Chinese tech giant Alibaba, and Tepper made a significant investment in the second quarter into UnitedHealth Group, taking advantage of a steep decline in the company’s stock price. His portfolio also includes “Magnificent Seven” stocks Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, Microsoft and Alphabet. Point72 has rapidly grown in size since it opened to outside capital in 2018 and now manages $40 billion in its multi-strategy funds. The firm generated $5 billion in net gains in 2024, according to LCH Investments, with its main fund returning a reported 19%. Cohen has used some of his earnings to try to make his beloved New York Mets a World Series contender, buying the MLB team for $2.4 billion in 2020 and committing a 15-year, $765 million contract to poach superstar slugger Juan Soto from the crosstown Yankees last winter. Millennium manages $78 billion and is reportedly looking to sell a minority stake in its business at a valuation of $14 billion. Selling general partnership stakes to firms like Blue Owl or Petershill Partners has become common for elite private equity firms over the past decade, and several private equity giants are also publicly traded. Investors have generally shied away from owning pieces of hedge funds on the other hand, due to the more volatile nature of the business, but with some funds producing steady returns and locking up assets for longer periods of time, Millennium could be starting a trend. Dalio sold off his ownership stake in Bridgewater and resigned from its board this year, half a century after he founded the firm in 1975, though he reportedly remains invested in its funds. Bridgewater’s assets under management have declined to $92 billion, from a high of $168 billion in 2019, during a period marked by middling performance and a prolonged leadership transition. Its flagship Pure Alpha fund rebounded with an 11.3% gain in 2024, its best year since 2018, and gained another 17% in the first half of this year. Ackman’s ambitious plans to launch a closed-end fund for U.S. investors with as much as $25 billion in new assets ended in failure when he scrapped its IPO in July 2024, but his existing $20 billion portfolio has continued to perform well. Its net return was 10.2% in 2024, fueled by stocks like Alphabet, Chipotle and Brookfield. Ackman started buying Uber stock earlier this year; the company’s shares were his largest position as of the end of June, worth $2.8 billion. He is also hoping to transform real estate developer Howard Hughes Holdings into a diversified holding company emulating Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Kovner left Caxton in 2011, handing the reins to his successor Andrew Law, after founding and running the firm for 28 years. Kovner now manages his portfolio through his family office CAM Capital and has invested in several life sciences and biotech startups in recent years, including Kriya Therapeutics, which develops gene therapies to treat chronic diseases, and Palvella Therapeutics, which is focused on treating genetic skin diseases. Shaw stepped back from day-to-day management of D.E. Shaw in 2001, leaving it in the hands of a seven-person executive committee that today manages $70 billion. But Shaw remains the firm’s principal owner, according to its SEC filings. D.E. Shaw’s flagship Composite and Oculus funds gained 18% and 36% in 2024, respectively, helping the firm produce $11.1 billion in gains, more than any other hedge fund according to LCH Investments.

Title: How The 10 Richest American Hedge Fund Managers Got $20 Billion Richer In A Year

ByHank Tucker, Forbes Staff. Most hedge funds have lagged behind the AI-fueled stock market surge of the past three years, opting for lower-risk investments. But that hasn’t stopped investor money from clamoring to get access to the top firms—or investment gains and carried interest from adding billions to their billionaire owners’ pockets. The 10 richest hedge fund managers on this year’s Forbes 400 ranking of the country’s richest people are worth a combined $174 billion, up $20 billion from a year ago. Citadel’s Ken Griffin was the biggest gainer by far, with his fortune swelling by more than $7 billion to an estimated $50.4 billion, widening Griffin’s lead over the rest of the pack. The next three richest hedge fund managers in the U.S.—David Tepper of Appaloosa Management, Steve Cohen of Point72 and Israel Englander of Millennium Management—only added about $3 billion to their fortunes on average over the same span. Each of these four investors generated double-digit net returns in 2024, outperforming the 6.2% return of the HFRI 500 Fund Weighted Composite Index, which tracks the largest hedge funds that are open to new investments. That hedge fund index’s three-year average annual return through the first half of 2025 is a meager 4.6%, trounced by the S&P 500’s annualized return of 16% over that same period. Against that lackluster competition, the best of the best can charge higher fees without driving their investors away. Citadel, Millennium, Point72 and others all have implemented or expanded so-called passthrough fee arrangements in recent years that have shifted more operating costs to investors, beyond the standard 2% management fee that has long been a hedge fund staple. The top firms have staffs of several thousand employees who are expensive but have proven worthwhile. The annualized return for Citadel’s flagship Wellington fund from 1990 through 2024 is 19.5%, after fees. Millennium’s net annualized return since inception in 1989, meanwhile, is 14%, with only one down year, in 2008. Most of these top firms are largely closed to new investors, and habitually return profits to existing limited partners, in order to stay lean enough to sustain their performance. But they’ve spawned plenty of imitators, with Hedge Fund Research reporting that net inflows into hedge funds in the second quarter this year amounted to $25 billion, representing the highest quarterly net asset inflow in 11 years. Still, the gap between the upstarts and the most technologically advanced multistrategy firms is widening. Citadel, D.E. Shaw and Millennium generated $29.5 billion in net gains in 2024, according to LCH Investments, amounting to more than 10% of the net $289 billion in gains all hedge fund managers produced. The founders of these firms have long been mainstays on The Forbes 400. Citadel has become the envy of the hedge fund world, managing $68 billion in assets, but an even larger piece of Griffin’s net worth comes from his majority ownership stake in Citadel Securities, a separate market-making firm that booked $9.7 billion in net trading revenue last year. He used some of the profits to add to his collection of homes and toys, spending $45 million on fellow Forbes 400 member Julia Koch’s Park Avenue co-op this February and $18 million on rare copies of the Emancipation Proclamation and 13th Amendment signed by Abraham Lincoln. He intends to loan those documents for public display ahead of the United States’ 250th birthday festivities next year. Tepper’s personal capital makes up the majority of Appaloosa’s $17 billion in assets under management. The largest position in the fund’s stock portfolio as of the end of June was an $800 million stake in Chinese tech giant Alibaba, and Tepper made a significant investment in the second quarter into UnitedHealth Group, taking advantage of a steep decline in the company’s stock price.

Title: Ripple’s XRP the Next Amazon? — Analyst Says Long-Term Path to $100 Could Shock XRP Army

Time Published: 2025-09-11T10:20:30Z

Crypto analyst Nick Anderson is drawing parallels between XRP’s price chart and Amazon’s early consolidation. On his BullRunners show, Anderson noted that Amazon’s stock traded roughly flat for about 3,800 days (over 10 years) after 2000, before breaking out in 2010. From roughly $5 then, AMZN went on a 3,900% rally to $200 over the next 15 years. Anderson argues XRP is in a similar sideways phase now. With XRP around $3.02 (near its 2018 peak), XRP is “using its previous high as support,” just as Amazon did before its long run. If history rhymes, he speculates, XRP could eventually repeat Amazon’s surge, potentially heading toward $100–$200 in the distant future. Anderson’s observation hinges on chart patterns. He compared XRP’s multi-year base to Amazon’s pre-boom price action. Amazon’s breakout came after forming a huge cup-and-handle pattern around 2010. Likewise, Anderson sees XRP building a large consolidation now. “XRP has mirrored AMZN’s performance,” he said, noting XRP is “currently in a similar consolidation phase.” In both cases, a prior high became support: Amazon held near $5, and XRP is holding near $2.97. This means the crypto is consolidating around its 2018 all-time high, he points out, before any potential breakout. The headline prediction is ambitious. Anderson suggests XRP could eventually reach $100–$200, mirroring Amazon’s move from $5 to $200. At current prices (about $2.80), that implies a roughly 3,400–6,900% gain. XRP would have to surge by 3,433% and 6,967%” to hit $100 and $200, respectively. Such a move would take years or even decades. Anderson stresses any breakout would be gradual: he projects XRP reaching only $5–$30 in the current market cycle, with the $100+ level not seen until well into the 2030s. Other analysts echo that forecast but add caveats. For example, crypto strategist Paul Barron says a “perfect storm” of catalysts (like ETF approvals and a Ripple banking license) could drive XRP past $50 and even toward $100. He adds that even a sharp pullback after such a move might still leave XRP on a much higher base (potentially a $30–$40 floor). Still, Barron agrees that the timeline is long: a decade or more, not weeks or months. In the near term, Anderson’s targets are far more modest. He argues that in the current cycle, XRP might rally only into the single digits. Specifically, he forecasts a run to about $5 to $30 in this rally phase. Crucially, he warns that a sharp correction would likely follow this. After the current upswing, Anderson expects a major pullback “paving the way for true adoption” later. This echoes common crypto-cycle patterns, where prolonged rallies end in sell-offs before the next big move. Technical analysts observe bullish setups for that mid-cycle rally. Some point to chart patterns that could carry XRP toward $5 and beyond while Bitcoin re-tests key levels. But all agree: such gains are not a straight shot. And as Anderson repeatedly notes, any price spikes to new highs will probably be followed by volatility. In his view, the token’s next upswing will take many years, not just months, to play out. Across the board, analysts stress patience. At $3 today, XRP is still far from its aspirational targets. Anderson’s scenario assumes long-term holds: he even notes that many long-term XRP investors (for example, those in their 30s now) would be middle-aged by the time a $100 price arrives. In other words, wealth from this thesis comes slowly. As one observer put it, the most effective approach is “a long-term strategy of accumulation and patience,” holding through interim pullbacks while waiting for broader adoption. Analyst Zach Rector, a vocal XRP proponent, agrees that volatility is guaranteed. He warns big spikes could quickly reverse – “if XRP goes to 50 bucks, don’t run and tell your wife… that could be cut in half again,” he said.

Check out our Live Next Crypto to Explode Updates for September 11, 2025! Crypto is so unthinkably huge at the moment, a nearly $4 trillion industry that’s aiming for world domination. Recent headlines talk of Circle and Mastercard planning to add USDC to global payment systems, Ethereum and Bitcoin treasuries in the billions of dollars, and Google building its own blockchain. Bitcoin has an all-time growth of over 180,000,000%, Dogecoin over 43,000%, and some of the newest presale coins often pump 10x, 100x, or even 1,000x on rare occasions. Explosive potential is probably the single best description for what we’re seeing today in crypto. Quick Picks for Coins with Explosive Potential If you’re looking for the most recent insights on the next crypto to explode, stay tuned. We update this page frequently throughout the day, as we get the latest and greatest insider insights for chart sniffers and traders looking for the next coin to explode. September 11, 2025 • 15:00 UTC Some of the biggest companies in Asia are embracing crypto. First up, South Korea’s e-commerce giant Coupang is teaming up with the blockchain Tempo. This hints at the possibility of stablecoins being used for payments, saving hundreds of billions of won a year. Then, over in Japan, they’ve launched the first-ever credit card that lets you use stablecoins to pay your bills. The new Nudge Card system uses a yen-backed stablecoin, so now you can use it for repayments anywhere that takes VISA. With all the big-name adoption and market attention, it poses the question: which project will be the next crypto to explode? PepeNode ($PEPENODE) is a prime candidate, as it’s creating a mine-to-earn game where you can earn rewards without needing expensive hardware. Find out how to buy $PEPENODE and don’t miss the chance for 1388% staking rewards. September 11, 2025 • 14:07 UTC Users on CoinMarketCap are theorizing that altcoin season might be coming – Ethereum inflows topped Bitcoin inflows in August. According to them, this has often preceded altcoin pumps. And if we’re talking altcoins, then we can’t help but mention Maxi Doge ($MAXI), a fresh meme coin on presale that’s ready to take over Dogecoin’s crown as the memecoin king. Our Maxi Doge price prediction forecasts a price of $0.0024 by the end of 2025, roughly +848% from current prices. September 11, 2025 • 13:00 UTC The US Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins declared that ‘crypto’s time has come,’ during his keynote address at the OECD Roundtable on Global Financial Markets held in Paris yesterday. He reiterated that the US government’s commitment is to make the country the world’s crypto capital. To achieve this, Atkins emphasized the need to ‘provide certainty regarding the security status of crypto assets.’ With legislation such as the GENIUS Act, the US is inching closer to achieving this goal. In addition, this paves the way for the next crypto to explode, like Pepenode ($PEPENODE). The token will power its planned virtual mining ecosystem, allowing individuals to mine crypto without any equipment. With mining becoming more complex and requiring expensive specialized equipment, Pepenode can help democratize this crucial process in the world of cryptocurrencies. Learn how to get your tokens in our ‘How to Buy Pepenode’ guide. September 11, 2025 • 12:00 UTC Apple is gearing up to launch the iPhone 17. Not only is it attracting attention over its new camera and ceramic shield, but it’ll also help crypto enthusiasts avoid potential threats. By enabling an A19 chip that enables Memory Integrity Enforcement (MIE), the new mobile device will make it difficult for scammers to steal private keys and digital assets. Given that private key compromises were the largest single cause of stolen assets across the entire industry last year at 43.8%, its tech has never been more necessary for crypto lovers. Still, you can protect your assets even further by downloading Best Wallet on your iPhone. As a non-custodial wallet, it ensures only you have control over your private keys so that no third party can access your funds. And, suppose you happen to lose your recovery phrase or seed phrase, don’t worry: it also has secure cloud backup storage. It’s also multi-chain, featuring cutting-edge features like a swap function, and an upcoming crypto debit card – and that’s just the beginning. The project’s native token – $BEST – fuels these developments, as 25% of its total token supply will go toward product expansion. It also grants lower gas fees, staking rewards, governance rights, and exclusive access to presales. So, it’s no wonder that it’s anticipated to be the next crypto to explode. Read our Best Wallet review for more information. September 11, 2025 • 11:07 UTC BNB hit an all-time high of $907 yesterday, almost immediately after Binance announced a partnership with Franklin Templeton. The goal – new crypto initiatives and products. The collaboration looks to combine Binance’s global infrastructure with Franklin Templeton’s tokenization expertise to deliver a deadly combo of efficiency and accessibility. Roger Bayston, Head of Digital Assets at Franklin Templeton, said this: By working with Binance, we can deliver breakthrough products that meet the requirements of global capital markets and co-create the portfolios of the future. —Roger Bayston, Binance Blog Post This has sent BNB exploding by almost 6% in the last day, with a 64% increase in its 24h trading volume. Similarly, altcoins are ready to explode, and meme coins as well. One meme coin in particular that traders are watching is Maxi Doge ($MAXI), Dogecoin’s wilder, younger cousin that wants to dethrone the king. How, you ask? Lots of Red Bull, steroids, and sleepless nights scalping shitcoins hoping to make a fortune and get ahead. And the degen attitude is working – one whale bought $37.3K $MAXI. Here’s how to buy Maxi Doge if you plan on joining this train that’s on fire. September 11, 2025 • 10:00 UTC PumpSwap ($PUMP) is back in the spotlight, surging 41.6% this week to a $5.8B valuation – its highest since launch. After dipping to $2.4B last month, the Solana-based memecoin launchpad has rallied 133%, powered by a bold buyback strategy: 100% of daily revenue goes toward repurchasing $PUMP, offsetting over 6% of supply to date. With PumpSwap stacking $298M in TVL and ranking 2nd in spot DEX revenue, it’s clear: the degens are back, and they’re hungry. But while $PUMP’s riding high, the real sleeper play is PepeNode ($PEPENODE). With nearly $975K already raised in presale, it introduces a Mine-to-Earn model where users build virtual mining rigs, upgrade nodes, and earn rewards before the token even hits exchanges. It’s gamified staking meets DeFi, with 1414% APY, 70% burn mechanics, and referral bonuses that fuel viral growth. No hardware, no waiting, just strategy and community. If you missed the $PUMP rally, PepeNodes might be your chance at the next crypto to explode. Find out how to buy PepeNode from the presale for just $0.0010533 September 11, 2025 • 10:00 UTC New ETFs from Rex and Osprey are launching this week. They’re not your typical Bitcoin funds: they’re ETFs for popular altcoins like KRP, Dogecoin, and Bonk. It’s a big deal as the SEC has given them the green light by allowing them to pass their 75-day review window. The project’s focus on futures contracts holds them to an older law. But the SEC has kept major players like BlackRock stuck in a regulatory waiting game as they focus on the actual crypto. The move could open the floodgates for mainstream investors who want to get into crypto without buying tokens directly. And speaking of getting in on the action, the Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) project is making waves. It’s a community built to help you get an edge. They’ve created the Wepe Army, a group that shares expert insights and alpha calls, which is insider info that can give you a leg up on the market. $WEPE is even rewarding members for their social activity, creating a collective of people working to outsmart the big players. Learn how to buy the $WEPE token with our ‘How to Buy Wall Street Pepe’ guide.

Title: Google TPUs Vs Nvidia GPUs
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/11/google-tpus-vs-nvidia-gpus/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Google has begun placing its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) in data centres run by smaller cloud providers that have long relied on Nvidia's GPUs. This is more than a product rollout—it's a calculated move in the AI infrastructure chess game. The effects extend across the AI ecosystem, creating both opportunity and uncertainty for investors. While individual AI names like Google and Nvidia could see heightened volatility as the landscape shifts, those seeking exposure with less single-stock risk might prefer diversified approaches. The High Quality Portfolio, for example, has comfortably outperformed its blended benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has delivered returns exceeding 91% since inception, letting investors participate in these structural shifts across multiple quality companies instead of betting on a single winner. Separately, see – How Oracle Stock Surges 3x To $900? TPUs are Google's purpose-built AI chips designed specifically for machine-learning tasks. While Nvidia's GPUs are versatile general-purpose processors, TPUs act like specialized scalpels optimized for AI workloads. The latest Ironwood chip delivers 42.5 exaflops of compute per pod with more than 9,200 chips per unit—“more than 10x improvement” over Google's previous generation. Also, take a look at – How Does Google Stock Rise 2x? This puts Nvidia in an uncomfortable spot: Still, Nvidia enjoys a massive ecosystem and deep relationships. The key question: Can Google win meaningful share before Nvidia responds? This is not just about chips—it’s about control of the AI infrastructure stack. Google is effectively telling the market, “You don’t need Nvidia’s ecosystem anymore.” Yet in reducing dependence on Nvidia, customers may increase dependence on Google’s technology. For buyers, the trade-off is clear: would you rather be locked into Nvidia or Google? Separately, look at – Are Nvidia Investors Ignoring This Big Risk? Google’s custom TPU push is a bid to challenge Nvidia’s dominance. But this isn’t a simple one-on-one duel. With companies like Broadcom, AMD, and Marvell advancing their own chips, AI hardware is now a multi-player race. That’s good for the industry—more competition, more choice, and potentially lower costs. For investors, it signals a heating AI infrastructure market with no guaranteed single winner. Nvidia isn’t finished, but the competition is tougher than ever. While the AI arms race intensifies, you could explore the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000) to deliver strong returns. Why? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to benefit from upbeat markets while limiting losses when conditions turned, as shown in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Charlie Kirk’s murder is the latest violent act to put public-facing leaders on edge

Diane Brady is an award-winning business journalist and author who has interviewed newsmakers worldwide and often speaks about the global business landscape. As executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative, she brings together a growing community of global business leaders through conversations, content, and connections. She is also executive editorial director of Fortune Live Media and interviews newsmakers for the magazine and the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. I was in Scottsdale yesterday, recording a podcast on site at Deloitte’s Next Generation CEO Program, when news about the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk began to trickle in. We had been talking about the challenge of being a public figure in business or politics these days, the need for visionary and visible leadership, when visibility can come at a price. Many CEOs have been on high alert since UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was gunned down in midtown Manhattan last year while walking to an investor meeting. We’ve seen anger mounting on college campuses—Kirk was speaking at Utah Valley University—along with increased threats to leaders and public calls to violence. Those realities impact how I report. I’ve been more mindful of my own security since my former colleague Daniel Pearl was murdered in 2002. Gone are the days when terrorists would turn to a journalist to tell their story. Instead of protecting journalists, a press badge can make us a target. I’m more sensitive to the consequences of my reporting on others, having seen someone fired for a quote that felt mild to me but provocative to his paranoid employer. That’s more a result of experience than caution. I’ve long advised billionaires to stop giving me their kids’ names. I don’t chase down big names for trite quotes that no one needs to read, nor do I dig for details that people have a right to keep private. Conversations about policy are more likely to be off the record in this environment but I’m still clear that my customer is the reader, not the people we cover. I was once stalked by a man who felt entitled to harass me about something I’d said on early-morning TV. I dismissed him as an eccentric with too much time on his hands until he emailed one day to ask why I’d brought a baby into the office. That baby was mine, and our security team realized he’d been hanging around the lobby. It was a wakeup call about risks, which is sadly bound to be top of mind this morning for any CEO or public figure.

Ellison’s wealth increased by more than $100 billion this week spurred by optimism about the company’s business which was buttressed by Oracle’s earnings call on Tuesday, during which CEO Safra Catz predicted $18 billion in cloud infrastructure business for the fiscal year—up 77% from fiscal 2025—and up to $144 billion in cloud infrastructure revenue in fiscal 2030. Trump meets with Polish President On Wednesday, President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social, “What’s with Russia violating Poland’s airspace with drones? Here we go!”—responding to reports that Polish forces had shot down several Russian drones after they entered Poland’s airspace. Trump also held a call with Polish President Karol Nawrocki on Wednesday, according to Nawrocki’s social media updates. Justice Department appeals for Trump’s ability to fire Fed Gov The U.S. Justice Department has asked a federal appeals court for permission for President Trump to dismiss Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook after a U.S. District Judge temporarily blocked her removal.

Title: Nebius Stock: Next AWS In The Making?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/11/nebius-stock-next-aws-in-the-making/
Time Published: 2025-09-11T09:30:00Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Shares of Nebius Group stock (NASDAQ: NBIS) increased by over 45% in after-hours trading on Monday following the company’s announcement of a significant deal to supply Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) with GPU infrastructure capacity valued at $17.4 billion over a five-year span. Different from conventional hyperscalers like Amazon’s AWS or Microsoft’s Azure, which provide a wide array of general-purpose cloud services, Nebius falls into a new category referred to as “Neoclouds” – specifically targeting high-performance infrastructure tailored for AI tasks. The firm delivers computing, storage, managed services, and tools aimed at developing, fine-tuning, and executing AI models. So what implications does this deal hold for Nebius, and does it enhance the attractiveness of the stock? This agreement is transformative for Nebius. In an SEC filing, the company stated that GPU services will be implemented in several tranches, with an overall contract total of $17.4 billion through 2031. Microsoft also holds the option to acquire an extra $2 billion in services. Over the five-year period, this translates to revenues exceeding $3.5 billion annually – a significant increase compared to Nebius’s anticipated revenues of only $570 million for 2025. Microsoft has increasingly relied on third-party solutions to tackle a deficit in cloud infrastructure aimed at AI workloads. The software giant has frequently encountered shortfalls in the AI compute capacity required for both its internal AI product development and the sale of Azure-branded AI services. Additionally, Microsoft is dedicated to providing computing resources to its AI partner OpenAI, which further strains its capacity. To satisfy this demand, Nebius will supply Microsoft with dedicated capacity from a new data center located in Vineland, New Jersey, starting later this year. The company also revealed that it is assessing financing options to expedite growth, with capital expenditures for this deal supported by cash flow generated from the contract and debt secured against it. However attractive it may be, investing in a single stock comes with high risk. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio has been designed to mitigate stock-specific risk while providing upside exposure. With the demand for generative AI remaining strong, even though there are other specialized competitors in the field, Nebius distinguishes itself for several reasons. First, the company maintains a close partnership with AI chip leader Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which produces the most advanced chips and effectively sets industry standards. Nvidia acts as both a key partner and investor, having participated in a $700 million funding round last year and owning over 1 million shares of the company. This connection might afford Nebius prioritized access to Nvidia's highly coveted GPUs, such as the Blackwell super chips, in comparison to other cloud service providers. This could represent a significant edge in a GPU market constrained by supply, where demand significantly surpasses availability, especially for cutting-edge chips. Another aspect that differentiates Nebius is its vertically integrated model. The company designs its own servers internally, eliminating the need for OEMs and engaging directly with manufacturers to reduce costs, optimize performance more effectively, and swiftly incorporate the latest GPUs. This degree of control not only lessens supply chain dependencies but also accelerates deployment cycles. This is crucial for keeping pace with rapid AI lifecycles and also provides the company with an advantage in terms of performance-per-watt compared to its competitors. Is Nebius stock a wise purchase at the current price of around $95 per share? The stock trades at roughly 40 times consensus FY’25 revenue. In comparison, larger competitor CoreWeave trades at about 10 times FY’25 revenue. However, several justifiable reasons exist for the higher valuation. To begin with, Nebius' growth prospects are strong. According to consensus estimates, Nebius's sales are expected to grow by 160% next year, outpacing CoreWeave, and this figure could be notably higher when considering the MSFT deal. Furthermore, Nebius's technological advantages, such as its proprietary technology stack, may aid in setting it apart from its rivals. By managing both hardware and software, Nebius is able to fine-tune performance for specific AI workloads, giving it a long-term competitive advantage. Nebius additionally possesses a solid balance sheet. As of the end of the most recent quarter, NBIS debt stood at $1.2 billion, leading to a debt-to-equity ratio of less than 5%. The cash for NBIS (including cash equivalents) accounts for $1.7 billion of a total of $5.1 billion in assets, resulting in a Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 32.9%. This should enable Nebius to continue expanding its global presence with lower financial risk. This could lead to significant interest expenses and potentially hinder profitability in the long run, even with its rapid revenue growth. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a proven track record of consistently outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three indices – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. What accounts for this success? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with diminished risk compared to the benchmark index; there’s been less of a roller-coaster experience, as shown in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: How Much Does It Cost To Advertise on Instagram in 2025?

Hundreds of U.S.-based marketing professionals shared what their businesses pay to advertise on Instagram. Instagram advertising costs depend on several factors, including bids, ad relevancy, seasonality, and industry. On average, though, businesses pay $0.01 – $0.25 per click, $0.01 – $4.00 per 1000 impressions, and $0.03 – $0.08 per engagement. Learn more about how much it costs to advertise on Instagram — including how to lower your costs — in this guide! View Instagram Ad Services On average, Instagram advertising costs $0.01 – $0.25 per click, $0.01 – $4.00 per 1000 impressions, and $0.03 – $0.08 per engagement. Lots of factors can influence how much you pay for your Instagram ads, including your ad budget, ad type, industry, and more. Explore how much Instagram ads cost compared to other networks: How much you spend on Instagram advertising costs can fluctuate depending on the size of your business. For example, larger businesses may spend more advertisements to remain competitive. Here’s a breakdown of Instagram advertising costs by business size to give you a better idea of how much your business will spend: (1 – 10 Employees) (11 – 50 Employees) (51 – 250 Employees) (251 – 500 Employees) (501+ Employees) Several factors determine Instagram advertising costs, including the following: Yes. In fact, 76% of marketers say they are happy with the return on investment (ROI) they receive from their Instagram ad campaign. A few of the reasons why Instagram’s advertising costs are well worth the price include: While you can divide your ad spend between networks, Instagram tends to deliver the best performance when it comes to CTRs. A study by Fortune, for example, discovered that Instagram ads maintain a CTR that is 2.5 times greater than other social media networks. Of course, your CTRs will depend on your target audience, as well as your ads. Like Facebook, Instagram provides your business with advanced targeting options. You can use these targeting options, from location to interests, to achieve a higher return from your ads. Instead of targeting everyone interested in sports, for instance, you could narrow that interest to people interested in volleyball. Another reason why Instagram advertising costs are worth the price tag? The results. In a recent study, Shopify discovered that the average order value for Instagram users is $65. Even though Facebook generates a significant amount of social media sales, its average order value is $55 — $10 less than Instagram. Keep in mind, however, that Facebook ads tend to cost more than Instagram ads. A study by Forrester also found that Instagram earns impressive engagement rates compared to other networks. Instagram leads when it comes to engagement rates, offering ten times the engagement rates of Facebook. When you have people that engaged with a network, it allows for your business to benefit from advertising. If you can create ads that target the right users, you can get them to click on your ad, like your page, or buy your product. Besides generating higher order values, Instagram ads also maintain higher conversion rates than other networks. The average conversion rate for Instagram ads is 1.08%. In comparison, the average conversion rate for Pinterest ads is 0.54% and 0.77% for Twitter ads. While the cost of Instagram ads is worth it, it’s important to remember that earning great results from Instagram requires a great ad campaign. You need to develop and optimize your strategy continuously to get the kind of results you want from Instagram ads. On average, businesses allocate 11% – 20% of their total advertising budget to Instagram ads. How much you allocate towards Instagram ads will depend on your company’s unique needs and goals, along with the return you receive from your Instagram ad campaign. When it comes to advertising on social media, you want to do whatever you can to lower the cost for advertising on these platforms. Here are a few best practices that will help you lower the cost of your Instagram ads and maximize your return on them. If you’re new to Instagram advertising, it’s beneficial to use automatic bidding for your campaign. It’s an easy way for you to get a bid that is the best for your campaign. Automatic bidding is beneficial to your business if you don’t have any previous data telling you about a good CPC to set for your campaign. It will help you set the bid amount that’s right for your campaign. When you use automatic bidding, you prevent your business from overbidding to run an ad. The lack of previous data can make it difficult for you to know the best bid amount. You may think you need to bid more than you actually do. Using automatic bidding helps you set the right bid amount until you obtain data that helps you guide your campaign. It’s a great way to reduce your Instagram advertising costs. When you set up your Instagram ads, the goal is to reach people that will be interested in your products or services. To drive the best results for your campaign, use precise targeting to reach your ideal audience. Instagram allows you to target people through: When you use precise targeting, you reach more people interested in your products and services. This means your ad copy will be more relevant to them, which will allow you to get a higher ad rank and lower CPC. It will also lead to an increase in conversions, which helps offset the cost of running the campaign. Whenever you run a marketing campaign, it’s crucial that you set goals for your campaign. Setting goals will help keep you focused on what you want to achieve with your ad. There are three main goals you’ll want to focus on achieving with your Instagram ads: By setting goals, you’ll have a more cohesive campaign. You’ll know what you want to achieve, which will allow you to create more cohesive ad copy. Better ad copy leads to more engagement and more conversions. Creating more relevant landing pages is another great way to reduce your Instagram ad costs. Many companies make the mistake of directing leads to their home page after clicking on their Instagram ad. It doesn’t encourage engagement because people aren’t directed to a landing page that is relevant to the ad. When you create an Instagram ad, the creative and ad link should be cohesive. If you’re advertising your stylish boot collection, your ad link should direct people to a page filled with your boots. Directing them to your homepage isn’t relevant to the ad you created because it’s focused on your entire store instead of specifically focusing on boots! This is where landing pages help. You can direct leads to a page that is created and tailored to your ad content. Relevant landing pages result in more conversions. When people are directed straight to the product they see in the ad, they are more likely to convert. This helps you recoup the costs you pay to run your campaign. If you want to create a truly effective campaign and lower how much it costs to advertise on Instagram, you must build dedicated landing pages that encourage conversion. If you want to lower your Instagram ad price, you must test your ad. Whenever you create ad copy, it’s never going to be the best or most effective version of your ad. It’s crucial that you test to your ad to ensure that you’re putting out the best possible version. Testing your ad helps you create more relevant ad copy. Relevant ad copy means you’ll get a higher ad position, which leads to a lower CPC. It’s an easy and efficient way to lower your Instagram advertising costs.

Instagram ads are paid content that appears in newsfeeds and stories. Instagram ads are targeted towards people most likely to be interested in your products or services. People see Instagram ads based on their demographic data, as well as their interests. These ads are meant to blend in seamlessly to the point where users barely recognize them as ads. There are two indications of content being a paid advertisement. The first sign is the word “sponsored” written under the company’s name. The second sign is the call-to-action (CTA) that appears at the bottom of the picture. These typically have phrases like “shop now” or “learn more” depending upon the campaign’s goal. When you run an Instagram ad campaign, you’ll have your choice of advertising formats. There are four main types of ads: Story ads are the newest option for advertisers to reach interested users. Considering that over 500 million Instagram accounts use stories every day, it’s a great opportunity to connect with people. People take a look at business’s Instagram stories, too. In fact, 33% of the most viewed Instagram stories are from businesses. People want to hear from businesses through the stories function, so having a paid ad wouldn’t seem out of place. These Instagram stories make full use of the screen. If someone sees your Instagram story ad, they will only see that on their screen. It helps you get your audience to focus fully on your ad. Story ads are very effective for your audience. They engage with them and check out your products. Although it’s a newer feature, it has the power to drive valuable results for your business. Photo ads are the most common ads on Instagram. These are pictures that appear in your audience’s Instagram feed. Instagram photo ads appear in a square frame or portrait frame. As mentioned previously, these ads have a CTA button at the bottom of the photo and a sponsored tag. With these ads, it’s crucial that you choose the right photo. You want your photo to fit in with Instagram’s style. Having a photo that looks too stock photo-like will stand out and could deter people from interacting with your ad campaign. To have an effective campaign, you must choose a photo that balances looking like a regular Instagram post with choosing a photo that embodies your brand image. Video ads are another option for your Instagram ad campaign. These operate similar to photos, except the content contains a video. These videos can be up to 60 seconds long. Videos are great for capturing your audience’s attention. When they scroll through their feed and get to your ad, the ad will immediately start playing. It’s a great way to catch your audience’s attention and get them interested in your ad. It’s important to note, however, that the videos automatically play without sound. This is important to think about when you create your video ad because you don’t want your audience to miss important information. If you put your most important information in the first few seconds, your audience is likely to miss it. Instagram video ads are an effective way to engage your audience and get them to check out your business. Carousel ads are a great option to get your audience to interact with your ad. These ads allow you to post multiple photos or videos in one post. It’s a great way to provide your audience with many options for your products. Let’s say you’re promoting a new fashion line. Showcasing one piece wouldn’t do justice to the line. While it does represent the new line, it doesn’t show people the variety in your clothing line. By using a carousel ad, you could use multiple photos and videos to showcase your product line. It enables you to show your audience variety, which engages more people. One outfit may spark interest in your audience over another outfit. Using carousel ads is a great way to garner engagement and interest in your ads. You’ll give your audience multiple visuals to look at and get them interested in your products or services. If you’re ready to start running Instagram ads, there are three different ways to start running ads: When you access ads in the Instagram app, you can share posts you’ve already created on Instagram. You’ll go into the app and select the post you want to promote. Once you select the post, you can launch it as an ad. Once you launch your promoted post, you can start tracking how many people see your post and interact with it. Instagram ads use the same Ad Manager tool as Facebook. If you want to run ads through this program, it’s easy and efficient. When you use Ads Manager, you can set up your campaign, make alterations to your campaign, and monitor the results. It’s a great way to run your Instagram advertising campaign. If you’re short on time or need extra help with your campaign, you have the option to use Instagram partners. Instagram partners can help you run your campaign if you don’t have time or don’t know how to run a campaign. With Instagram partners, you’re working with proven experts that are vetted by Instagram.

Hayes has accumulated multiple tranches of Ethena’s ENA token over the past two days, including 578,956 tokens worth about $473,000 on Wednesday and two earlier purchases totaling roughly 672,800 ENA, or $521,000, according to data tracked by Arkham Intelligence. The total, including those from Monday, amounts to roughly $995,000 worth of Ethena tokens within a 48-hour window. Hayes’ purchases come as Ethena remains a contender in the USDH stablecoin race, with Hyperliquid validators set to decide the ticker on Sunday. Ethena’s proposal, backed by BlackRock, would use its USDtb stablecoin to collateralize USDH via BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, with 95% of revenue pledged to Hyperliquid and costs covered for shifting trading pairs from USDC. Ethena’s proposal is a “strong bid from one of crypto’s fastest-growing and most impressive ecosystems,” David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, wrote in a blog post published Wednesday. Lawant pointed to USDe’s market cap of more than $13 billion and Ethena having processed $23 billion in cumulative mints and redemptions without security incidents or downtime. Still, Hayes’ buy “reads as personal positioning, rather than putting a backing behind Ethena specifically for the USDH votes,” Kirby Ong, founder of HypurrCollective, a grassroots collective for founders, builders, traders, and power users on the Hyperliquid ecosystem, told Decrypt.“With the $USDH proposal, the deciding factors will likely come down to validator alignments with their current stakers, whether prediction market sentiment translates into actual on-chain votes,” Ong said. Paxos, backed by PayPal, is also a top contender, according to Lawant. It revised its proposal on Wednesday, expanding from an emphasis on regulatory pedigree to pledging a larger share of reserve yield to Hyperliquid’s Assistance Fund and deferring any issuer take until the product scales past $1 billion. On Wednesday evening, Paxos announced it had received an offer from Kraken to list USDH and HYPE from day one, with free USD on- and off-ramps, pending the exchange’s standard review. Meanwhile, Native Markets remains front and center. Despite being a newly formed company, Native Markets remains the top contender, with 90% odds in its favor, according to live data on Myriad Markets. Disclosure: Myriad is a prediction market developed by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN. Native Markets pitched a GENIUS-compliant USDH managed through Bridge, Stripe’s stablecoin issuer, with reserves in cash and Treasuries overseen by BlackRock off-chain and Superstate on-chain. Its plan splits yield evenly between Hyperliquid’s Assistance Fund and ecosystem growth, and promises a HyperEVM launch with seamless interoperability. Ong explained that while prediction markets “help set expectations,” validator support “determines the valid candidates,” and that “ultimately, anyone can help to decide and set the direction for USDH by staking their weight and making their votes known by delegating to the validator that best matches their vote.”Ong added: “The final outcome on Sunday may depend on which team gains the most trust and perceived long-term value for the ecosystem.” Decrypt has reached out to Hayes, Paxos, and Ethena for comment. A separate request was sent to Native Markets through an ecosystem operator (Max Feige). Other contenders include Sky, the issuer of USDS (formerly MakerDAO’s DAI), Frax Finance with a bank-partnered bid, and Agora, which has warned against Native Markets’ reliance on Stripe-owned Bridge while pledging to channel all net revenue back into Hyperliquid.

Archives Wild, scenic, and toxic: Recent degradation of an iconic Arctic watershed with permafrost thaw, Sullivan et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Science The streams of Alaska’s Brooks Range lie within a vast (~14M ha) tract of protected wilderness and have long supported both resident and anadromous fish. However, dozens of historically clear streams have recently turned orange and turbid. Thawing permafrost is thought to have exposed sulfide minerals to weathering, delivering iron and other potentially toxic metals to aquatic ecosystems. Here, we report stream water metal concentrations throughout the federally designated Wild and Scenic Salmon River watershed and compare them with United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chronic (4-d) exposure thresholds for toxicity to aquatic life. The main stem of the Salmon had elevated SO42− concentrations and elevated SO42−: Ca relative to a predisturbance baseline for most of its length, consistent with increased sulfide mineral weathering. Most of the tributaries also had elevated SO42− concentrations and elevated SO42−: Ca, especially those in the upper watershed. The Salmon River mainstem consistently exceeded EPA chronic exposure thresholds for total recoverable iron, total recoverable aluminum, and dissolved cadmium from its first major tributary to its mouth. Nine of ten major tributaries that we sampled exceeded EPA thresholds for at least one metal on at least one of three sampling dates. Our findings indicate that habitat quality for resident and anadromous fish has been severely degraded in the Salmon River watershed. Loss of important spawning habitat in the Salmon and many other streams in the region might help explain a recent crash in chum salmon returns, which local communities depend upon for commercial and subsistence harvest. Speleothem evidence for Late Miocene extreme Arctic amplification – an analogue for near-future anthropogenic climate change?, Umbo et al., Climate of the Past Our estimate of > 18 °C of Arctic warming supports the wider consensus of a warmer-than-present Miocene and provides a rare palaeo-analogue for future Arctic amplification under high-emissions scenarios. The reconstructed increase in mean surface temperature far exceeds temperatures projected in fully coupled global climate models, even under extreme-emissions scenarios. Given that climate models have consistently underestimated the extent of recent Arctic amplification, our proxy data suggest Arctic warming may exceed current projections. Long-term decline in montane insects under warming summers, Sockman, Ecology Widespread declines in the abundance of insects portend ill-fated futures for their host ecosystems, all of which require their services to function. For many such reports, human activities have directly altered the land or water of these ecosystems, raising questions about how insects in less impacted environments are faring. I quantified the abundance of flying insects during 15 seasons spanning 2004–2024 on a relatively unscathed, subalpine meadow in Colorado, where weather data have been recorded for 38 years. I discovered that insect abundance declined an average of 6.6% annually, yielding a 72.4% decline over this 20-year period. According to model selection following information theoretic analysis of 59 combinations of weather-related factors, a seasonal increase in insect abundance changed to a seasonal decline as the previous summer's temperatures increased. This resulted in a long-term decline associated with increasing summer temperatures, particularly daily lows, which have increased 0.8°C per decade. However, other factors, such as ecological succession and atmospheric elevation in nitrogen and carbon, are also plausible drivers. In a relatively pristine ecosystem, insects are declining precipitously, auguring poorly for this and other such ecosystems that depend on insects in food webs and for pollination, pest control, and nutrient cycling. Addressing methane emission feedbacks from global wetlands, Ury et al., Nature Sustainability Earth-system feedback loops that exacerbate climate warming cause concern for both climate accounting and progress towards meeting international climate agreements. Methane emissions from wetlands are on the rise owing to climate change—a large and difficult-to-abate source of greenhouse gas that may be considered indirectly anthropogenic. Here we illustrate the power of emissions reduction from any sector for slowing the progress of earth-system feedbacks.

Full Content:
A critical ocean upwelling event in the Gulf of Panama has failed for the first time in at least 40 years. This seasonal process, which brings cold, nutrient-rich water to the surface, did not occur in early 2025. The immediate cause was a dramatic and unusual reduction in the northern trade winds. Scientists from the SmithsonianÂ Tropical Research Institute directly link this failure to a disruption in the global climate system. The ecological and economic consequences are severe. The failure disrupts the entire marine food web, leading to reduced fish catches that threaten local livelihoods and increase the risk of coral bleaching due to higher water temperatures. The event is a stark warning of the vulnerability of fundamental natural systems. It demonstrates how climate change can rapidly alter stable oceanic processes that humanity has long taken for granted. The drought affecting the Panama Canal is also linked to this climate disruption. Reduced rainfall in the Gulf of Panama region, which feeds the canal's watershed, has caused water shortages, leading to shipping restrictions and global supply chain delays.

Reduced rainfall in the Gulf of Panama region, which feeds the canal's watershed, has caused water shortages, leading to shipping restrictions and global supply chain delays. A vital ocean process that has sustained Panama's Pacific coast for generations has abruptly vanished, according to a new scientific report.Â For the first time in at least four decades,Â the seasonal upwelling event that cools the Gulf of Panama and nourishes its prolific marine life failed to occur in early 2025. Scientists from the Smithsonian Tropical Research InstituteÂ (STRI) who documented the event, point to a dramatic reduction in wind patterns as the immediate cause, warning that this unprecedented failure is a direct symptom of a disrupted global climate system with profound implications for fisheries, ecosystems and coastal economies. In simple terms, upwelling is an oceanographic process where powerful, consistent winds push surface water away from the coast. This action forces cold, dense water from the deep ocean to rise up and take its place. This deep water is incredibly rich in nutrients, acting as a natural fertilizer for the marine food web. (Related: Panama canal crisis: U.S. and China vie for control as Panamanians plead for American support.) For as long as modern records exist, this process has been a clockwork feature of the Gulf of Panama. Each year, from January through April, the northern trade winds blow across the region, triggering this massive nutrient pump. The result is an explosion of microscopic plant life or phytoplankton, which forms the base of a food chain that supports everything from tiny fish to large commercial fisheries. The consistency of this cycle has been a cornerstone of both the local ecosystem and the human communities that depend on it. The cold water brought up from the depths also serves a critical secondary function: It acts as a natural air conditioner for the ocean. By keeping sea temperatures lower during the Central American dry season, which coincides with the hottest months, this upwelling has historically helped protect fragile coral reefs from the thermal stress that causes deadly bleaching. The STRI research team has meticulously monitored this cycle for forty years. Their data paints a picture of a reliable, predictable natural system â but that reliability shattered in 2025. Their instruments detected none of the usual signs; the water temperature did not drop, and the nutrient levels did not spike. The biological productivity that should have marked the season was conspicuously absent. In a study published Sept. 2 in the prestigious journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the scientists directly link this failure to a significant and unusual reduction in the strength of the trade winds. While a single anomalous year does not, by itself, prove a long-term trend, researchers argue it reveals how fragile these fundamental oceanic processes are. The concern is that what was once an immutable law of nature in this region is now shown to be vulnerable. The event in Panama is being viewed as a potential early data point confirming those predictions, showing how quickly a stable system can be pushed out of balance. Implications for biodiversity and livelihoods The immediate consequences of a lost upwelling season are severe. Without the nutrient influx, the entire marine food web is disrupted. Fewer phytoplankton means less food for small fish, which in turn means less food for larger fish, seabirds, and marine mammals. This leads to reduced fish catches, threatening the livelihoods of local fishing communities that have depended on this seasonal bounty for millennia. Furthermore, the loss of the cooling effect places immense stress on coral reefs. Coral bleaching occurs when water temperatures become too high for too long, causing corals to expel the symbiotic algae that give them color and energy. Without this cooling upwelling, the reefs of the Gulf of Panama are left exposed to the full force of the sun, increasing the risk of widespread bleaching and the collapse of the intricate ecosystems they support. The failure of the Panama upwelling is not an isolated incident but a stark warning. It underscoresÂ an urgent global need to strengthen ocean-climate observation networks, particularly in the tropics, which are often the first to feel the impacts of a changing planet. It is a clear signal that systems humanity has taken for granted are now in flux. While upwelling brings cooler, nutrient-rich water, it is a separate issue from the drought currently impacting the canal's water supply. According to Brighteon.AI's Enoch, the canal's operations depend on freshwater from rainfall in Gatun Lake, not on seawater from the Gulf. Therefore, such an upwelling would not alleviate the drought conditions causing the current low water levels. The primary hydrological challenge for the canal remains the lack of precipitation in its watershed. Read more stories like this atÂ Climate.news.

The consistency of this cycle has been a cornerstone of both the local ecosystem and the human communities that depend on it. The cold water brought up from the depths also serves a critical secondary function: It acts as a natural air conditioner for the ocean. By keeping sea temperatures lower during the Central American dry season, which coincides with the hottest months, this upwelling has historically helped protect fragile coral reefs from the thermal stress that causes deadly bleaching. The STRI research team has meticulously monitored this cycle for forty years. Their data paints a picture of a reliable, predictable natural system â but that reliability shattered in 2025. Their instruments detected none of the usual signs; the water temperature did not drop, and the nutrient levels did not spike. The biological productivity that should have marked the season was conspicuously absent. In a study published Sept. 2 in the prestigious journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the scientists directly link this failure to a significant and unusual reduction in the strength of the trade winds. While a single anomalous year does not, by itself, prove a long-term trend, researchers argue it reveals how fragile these fundamental oceanic processes are. The concern is that what was once an immutable law of nature in this region is now shown to be vulnerable. The event in Panama is being viewed as a potential early data point confirming those predictions, showing how quickly a stable system can be pushed out of balance. Implications for biodiversity and livelihoods The immediate consequences of a lost upwelling season are severe. Without the nutrient influx, the entire marine food web is disrupted. Fewer phytoplankton means less food for small fish, which in turn means less food for larger fish, seabirds, and marine mammals. This leads to reduced fish catches, threatening the livelihoods of local fishing communities that have depended on this seasonal bounty for millennia. Furthermore, the loss of the cooling effect places immense stress on coral reefs. Coral bleaching occurs when water temperatures become too high for too long, causing corals to expel the symbiotic algae that give them color and energy. Without this cooling upwelling, the reefs of the Gulf of Panama are left exposed to the full force of the sun, increasing the risk of widespread bleaching and the collapse of the intricate ecosystems they support. The failure of the Panama upwelling is not an isolated incident but a stark warning. It underscoresÂ an urgent global need to strengthen ocean-climate observation networks, particularly in the tropics, which are often the first to feel the impacts of a changing planet. It is a clear signal that systems humanity has taken for granted are now in flux. While upwelling brings cooler, nutrient-rich water, it is a separate issue from the drought currently impacting the canal's water supply. According to Brighteon.AI's Enoch, the canal's operations depend on freshwater from rainfall in Gatun Lake, not on seawater from the Gulf. Therefore, such an upwelling would not alleviate the drought conditions causing the current low water levels. The primary hydrological challenge for the canal remains the lack of precipitation in its watershed. Read more stories like this atÂ Climate.news.

Without the nutrient influx, the entire marine food web is disrupted. Fewer phytoplankton means less food for small fish, which in turn means less food for larger fish, seabirds, and marine mammals. This leads to reduced fish catches, threatening the livelihoods of local fishing communities that have depended on this seasonal bounty for millennia. Furthermore, the loss of the cooling effect places immense stress on coral reefs. Coral bleaching occurs when water temperatures become too high for too long, causing corals to expel the symbiotic algae that give them color and energy. Without this cooling upwelling, the reefs of the Gulf of Panama are left exposed to the full force of the sun, increasing the risk of widespread bleaching and the collapse of the intricate ecosystems they support. The failure of the Panama upwelling is not an isolated incident but a stark warning. It underscoresÂ an urgent global need to strengthen ocean-climate observation networks, particularly in the tropics, which are often the first to feel the impacts of a changing planet. It is a clear signal that systems humanity has taken for granted are now in flux. While upwelling brings cooler, nutrient-rich water, it is a separate issue from the drought currently impacting the canal's water supply. According to Brighteon.AI's Enoch, the canal's operations depend on freshwater from rainfall in Gatun Lake, not on seawater from the Gulf. Therefore, such an upwelling would not alleviate the drought conditions causing the current low water levels.

The cost of restoring a Victorian kiosk at the main entrance to Blackrock Park in Dublin has been put at €1.1 million by Dún Laoghaire Rathdown Council, which said the building will open as a coffee shop in the coming months. The original 2024 tender submitted by the contractor that carried out the work, Bracegrade, was for €690,000, excluding VAT, but a contingency of €150,000 was approved at the same time by the council bringing the overall project cost to some €840,000. In response to a Freedom of Information request, it said an additional €200,000 was sought and approved in January of this year to fund the demolition of an existing but disused public toilet block and construction of a new facility close to the restored tea rooms. Some additional landscaping was also to be carried out. In the end, it said, €1.1 million has been spent to date on the project, which got under way in July of last year and is said to have been completed last month. A tender process was conducted to find a tenant for the tea rooms, which are a short walk from Blackrock village and two substantial shopping centres, and a contract has been provisionally agreed with operator of the Mister Magpie outlets in Ballsbridge and Leeson St. The contracts are currently being completed and the council said the facility will open in the coming months. “We are working closely with the operator to ensure the Tearooms open to the public as soon as possible,” the council said in a statement. [ ‘I can’t believe we’re living here’: Historic Wexford cottage that was at risk of falling into decline is restoredOpens in new window ] The small building, which was a protected structure, was originally built in the 1890s when it operated as a cake and sweet shop. The wider park had been established about 20 years earlier. The kiosk has views over much of it and Dublin Bay. The intention, it is stated, was to “faithfully restore” the building. Internal council documents suggest the tender process was conducted on the cascade basis, under which some potential bidders can be excluded if they are now considered suitable for some of the specialised work involved. The council said the process was “thorough and competitive” and the work carried out included considerable replacement of the building’s fabric, the installation of new windows and landscaping of the surrounding area. A number of grants were received to support the funding of the project including from the Department of Housing, local Government and Heritage’s Historic Structures Fund. Blackrock-based councillor Martha Fanning said that “having been vacant for decades, it’s wonderful to see the refurbishment being completed”. “Restoration works are expensive but the kiosk is a key historic feature of the park which shouldn’t have been allowed get into such a poor state of disrepair.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up for push alerts to get the best breaking news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone Listen to In The News podcast daily for a deep dive on the stories that matter © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Jack O’Donoghue excited to work with Clayton McMillan as new season offers fresh start

Younger players starting out on their professional rugby career are like sponges and eager to learn. Older, or more experienced players, are perhaps more in need of a fresh voice and new ideas. It’s almost hard to credit that Jack O’Donoghue is now 31 and is now in the former category. But, while hardly in the veteran stakes just yet, the Waterford backrower endorses the clear feeling that the Munster squad have embraced Clayton McMillan’s messaging and ideas. “People have been itching to get to work with him,” says O’Donoghue. “When they announced it, I think everyone started tuning into Chiefs games, seeing how they play and getting a flavour for types of players he likes to pick. “From the preseason he set the stall out and there’s been a great mood and a great energy around the place and we’re really excited,” adds O’Donoghue, ahead of Friday’s preseason friendly at Virgin Media Park against Bath (kick-off 7pm). “His mission statement is about holding on to the ball, playing the opportunity that’s in front of you, but not necessarily overplaying. “If the kick is on or if it’s on to get the ball out wide, if that’s the right play, that’s it and you back it and you go with that.” That said, through little fault of their own, it’s a measure of the tumult at Munster that, entering O’Donoghue’s 12th season since breaking the team in 2014, McMillan is the sixth coach he’ll serve under. Munster host Bath in a preseason friendly in Musgrave Park on Friday (kick-off 7pm) and Johann van Graan has enhanced his reputation at the Rec since inheriting a squad at the foot of the Premiership three seasons ago and leading them to their first domestic title in 29 years last May. [ Clayton McMillan expects new leaders to emerge as he puts his stamp on MunsterOpens in new window ] Helpfully, Mike Prendergast, Denis Leamy and Mossy Lawlor have remained in place, but another period of stability akin to van Graan’s five years at Munster would be welcome. “Yeah, a bit of continuity, long-term, looking big picture, that’s something I presume the board, the IRFU are certainly looking at it,” says O’Donoghue. “It’s certainly above the players’ pay grade but that’s something as players you want to see.” McMillan has also brought with him a new Head of Athletic Performance Brad Mayo from New Zealand, as well as Martyn Vercoe as the new team manager, and the new voices have also implemented some modified preseason training which O’Donoghue has described as old school, notably a preseason camp in Rockwell, “back in the dorms and back to Munster Under-20 and Under-18s days”. After “a bit of a clean-up job on my ankle in the off-season” O’Donoghue bulked up in the gym and his enthusiasm for the new campaign was further whetted by the preseason. “We went boxing, hill running, swimming, different varieties of training. We’re not just out on the field constantly, but that just keeps the bit of drive there and stuff like that. “It’s not going to be like, ‘oh, let’s just come back out on the field now to run sprints’. It’s different every day. And that variety certainly was infectious throughout the group. “Some lads hated the swimming, some lads hated the hills, but I think it just kept everyone on their toes. And while some people were really good at the swimming, other people were really good at boxing, there was always one that you found yourself that you could excel on and probably step up in terms of leadership and stuff like that.” McMillan is big into Munster connecting with their people, and there was also a training camp in Ennis, with one in Kerry next week and O’Donoghue’s native Waterford also planned. As someone who has regularly stepped in as captain, O’Donoghue acknowledges there is an onus on him as well as others, to fill the void left by the retirement/departures of Peter O’Mahony, Conor Murray and Stephen Archer. Munster were playing catch-up after losing four of their first six URC matches before the November break last season, only securing a place in the play-offs and this season’s Champions Cup with a last-day win over Benetton. Mindful of this, O’Donoghue says they are looking no further than targeting their initial five-game block before the autumn series this season, namely Scarlets (away), Cardiff (home), Edinburgh (home), Leinster (away) and Connacht (home). However, while he maintains “Europe” has not been discussed, this Friday’s game is a foretaste of Munster’s opening Champions Cup game away to Bath while the ensuing round two game against Gloucester will be at Pairc Ui Chaoimh. “I only went on to purchase a few extra tickets myself and I saw the Blackrock end was sold out and only the two terraces were available. So that’s unbelievable. I think that certainly adds to the excitement that’s going to be building around this season. “And I think the launch of the jersey alone, the talk around that, going back to the ‘06 kind of bit of a twang on it, it’s really nice,” O’Donoghue adds of this season’s new jersey. “The white away jersey, there’s a lot of chat around us at the moment and that’s great, but we have to deliver on the field and that’s all that we’re kind of focusing on.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date What’s making headlines in the rugby world?

Title: Most marketers think we’ll rely on AI to produce most creative content by 2030

Advertisement September 11, 2025 | 9 min read Listen to article 4 min It’s just one finding from a new WPP report on senior marketers’ visions for advertising’s near future. We sit down with the author. What will advertising, media and our consumer lives look like in 2030? A new report asks experts. / Drmakete Lab Via Unsplash Decide for yourself how alarmed you are by a future where most ‘creative content’ (including art, music, TV shows and movies) is created by AI. But according to the 2025 edition of WPP Media’s Advertising in 2030 report, most marketers think that reality will already be with us in five years’ time. A follow-up to similar reports in 2020 and 2021, the research digs into the credence that top marketers and analysts give to certain possible near-future scenarios. The portion of respondents predicting this AI-dominated media future (now at 71%) was the greatest ‘positive’ shift in sentiment since the last edition of the report, reflecting the dizzying pace of AI-related change marketers are seeing right now. One expert interviewed for the research, attention primo Karen Nelson Field, said: “The rate of transformation in only two years since AI became accessible is astounding. Nothing will be the same across the entire advertising ecosystem in 2030.” Plenty of the study’s respondents argue that 2030 is too soon a date to predict such a major shift, or that AI is more likely to dominate advertising content than narrative entertainment, or that AI will play only a partial role. But the portion treating the scenario seriously is striking. Other formerly science-fictional scenarios viewed as likely by the study’s cohort include a 2030 where most interactions between brands and consumers are ‘bot-to-bot,’ with individuals’ personal assistants liaising directly with customer service bots. Citing efficiency, convenience and the rapidly developing sophistication of ‘agentic AI,’ 66% of respondents viewed the scenario as likely – although most (61%) don’t think we’ll yet have passed the tipping point at which most social media ‘users’ are fictitious personae. Nor do they say, on balance, that they’re expecting the efficiencies associated with automation will result in reduced working hours or wages, with 66% rejecting that scenario – despite conceding “downward pressure on wages in some sectors.” But how likely is it, really, that an industry so totally overhauled by scaled AI’s promises of efficiencies and cost-savings won’t see those efficiencies reflected in billable hours and headcounts? The report’s lead author, WPP Media’s global president of business intelligence Kate Scott-Dawkins, tells The Drum that there’s evidence in that sentiment of “a desire to be optimistic about these things in the face of so much change,” but that there may also be some reason for that optimism. “Our industry is already one of the most integrated with AI and, if you look at job numbers now in the ad industry versus 10 years ago when we first started seeing Google and Meta applying machine learning and natural language processing and all these optimization programs, we’re not dramatically worse off… So there’s some rationale for people thinking it’ll just look different. We won’t be doing the same things, but our industry has continued to grow and we’ll just be doing new things with the help of AI. We may lose some jobs and types of jobs, but I can understand why they are optimistic about the industry as a whole.” (That optimism should perhaps be tempered with the trajectory of employment figures across the industry since the AI revolution began in earnest: in toto, adland’s big five holding companies reduced their workforce by over 2% last year; WPP itself has suffered a 5% drop in headcount over the last year.) Advertisement Hovering above the AI of it all, Scott-Dawkins says there’s greater reason to be cheerful to be gleaned from the difference between this year’s report and its Covid-era predecessors. The original report set out to answer, first, a provocative question: will advertising even continue to exist in 10 years’ time? Those Covid years, she says, were a time of soul-searching and a time where the growing adoption of adblockers, all-subs-no-ads media channels like Netflix, behove the industry to ask itself existential questions. Taking stock of where the industry as a whole finds itself in 2025 shows that question has almost entirely receded from view: Netflix is now, per a headline in these pages, ‘All-in on ads’; in 2024, the global ad business saw revenues of over $1tn for the first time in history. If anything, Scott-Dawkins says, in 2025 we see an industry hungrier than ever to expand its coverage. “I’ve seen a noticeable shift in the number and types of companies that are selling advertising now, with this realization that it can be a useful revenue stream, especially in low-margin businesses like retail. And now we’re getting into all the different places where you can have screens and consumer interaction” – with growth expected not just in retail media, but transit, transport, wearables… “You can picture this world where we’re able to turn any sort of surface and glass into content. That’s an interesting counterpoint to where we were five years ago.” Other stark shifts from where we were five years ago: the metaverse, cause celebre of the industry until the AI hype cycle engulfed all the space around it, has fallen away almost entirely, taking with it predictions about growth in uses of virtual and augmented reality tech (though, Scott-Dawkins says, the experts weren’t that convinced back in 2020 either – “they’re as pessimistic now as they were then”). Scott-Dawkins goes on: “What they got wrong was the sustainability piece.” In what the report calls a “striking reversal,” predictions that the environmental impact of goods and services would be more important to us than price by 2030 swung radically. In 2020, 70% thought that was likely. Now, 74% say it’s unlikely. Acknowledging a “cultural realignment” and “greenwashing fears” on the corporate side, the report declares that “consumers and marketers both seem to be moving on.” Advertisement In the data and privacy worlds, the report finds a balance of experts predicting by 2030 the widespread use of biometric data to access and personalize services; the widespread personalization of goods and services; and the widespread accessibility of personal data by corporations and governments. But they reject as unlikely the development of single, global approaches. In tech and media, most experts rejected as unlikely a scenario where 3D printing would replace mass production. They also rejected a scenario in which “seamless micropayments” replace subscription and ad models for online publishers, and one in which most products and services would be bought as part of a subscription. They mostly agreed that the same internet service providers, platforms and social media companies would remain intact until 2030, despite ongoing antitrust actions. For publishers, they predict more change, with 63% seeing it as likely that most news consumption would come from individual creators, ‘citizen journalists’ and bots. As the next decade approaches, what’s most striking, says Scott-Dawkins, is that “people got more pessimistic across the board” – less likely, that is, to predict changes to the status quo. Will the study run again before 2030? Maybe – but maybe the AI question will by then have become even more all-pervasive. “Maybe, I don’t know, we’ll be asking AI about itself.” Catch up on the most important stories of the day, curated by our editorial team.

Title: Oracle CEO Safra Catz's net worth rises $412 million in a day as stock hits record highs

Oracle Corp.’s stock rally this week has not only lifted the software giant’s market value but also added significantly to the personal wealth of its chief executive officer, Safra Catz. According to CNBC, Catz’s net worth surged by about $412 million during the first six hours of trading on Wednesday after the company’s strong earnings report sent its shares up nearly 40%. Forbes estimates her net worth at $3.4 billion as of Wednesday afternoon, compared with $3 billion earlier in the day. The jump followed Oracle’s disclosure of $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, contracted revenue that has yet to be recognised. The figures underline the company’s accelerating growth in cloud services and its expanding role in powering artificial intelligence workloads. Larry Ellison, Oracle’s co-founder, benefited even more from the rally. His net worth soared to an estimated $386.3 billion, making him the world’s second-richest person, up from $293 billion at the start of the trading day. “Oracle has become the go-to place for AI workloads,” Catz said on the company’s earnings call, citing new cloud contracts with firms such as OpenAI, xAI, Meta, Nvidia and AMD. Catz, who has been Oracle’s sole CEO since 2019, has overseen a more than 800% rise in the company’s stock price during her tenure. She previously led Oracle’s M&A strategy, completing high-profile acquisitions including PeopleSoft and Sun Microsystems. Analysts across Wall Street were surprised by the scale of Oracle’s performance. Deutsche Bank’s Brad Zelnick said he was “in shock, in a very good way,” while John DiFucci of Guggenheim Securities said he was “blown away.” Bank of America analysts have forecast further upside in the stock on the back of Oracle’s strong revenue pipeline and AI-driven demand. Oracle's shares were already on the rise before the latest financial results. They increased by 45% this year through Tuesday’s close, four times the gain seen in the S&P 500. Its surge on Wednesday also boosted other AI stocks, including Nvidia, which rose 3.8%. In Asia, Nvidia suppliers rallied in Japan and South Korea, with Advantest Corp. up over 3% and SK Hynix Inc. increasing by 5.6%. The company's forecast underscores the need for global AI developers to step up their investments. OpenAI, an Oracle customer, predicts it will need trillions of dollars over time to invest in the infrastructure needed to develop and run its services. Major US companies have recently given investors grounds for optimism about the pace and sustainability of AI investment. Last week, Broadcom Inc. announced it had secured a major new customer in this sector. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: Rumors Of BlackRock Buying XRP Via Coinbase Makes Waves. Is An XRP ETF Filing Coming?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-xrp-buy-via-coinbase/
Time Published: 2025-09-11T03:00:05Z
Full Content:
The Ripple community is once again caught up in speculation after data showed a steep drop in Coinbase’s XRP holdings. Instead of seeing it as a sell-off, some commentators believe the decline could be linked to BlackRock quietly moving into position through Coinbase Custody. The rumors are persistent, even though BlackRock has already shot down earlier claims about a Spot XRP ETF filing. Nonetheless, this has left many to wonder if there’s more happening behind the scenes than the company is willing to admit. Recent on-chain data revealed that Coinbase’s XRP stash has decreased drastically since the second quarter of 2025. This decrease has seen the amount of coins held by Coinbase fall from 780.13 million to about 199 million, with a 57% fall in August alone. Considering the scale of this decline, the movement has stirred up different rumors. Some investors are of the notion that these are actually intended sell-offs by Coinbase, while others are of the notion that they are only strategic transfers involving institutions. Crypto analyst Crypto X AiMan addressed the situation in a video posted on the social media platform X, where he noted that Coinbase is not dumping the coin, despite claims circulating within the community. According to the analyst, the reduction is more likely linked to BlackRock, and his team had previously highlighted multiple BlackRock-XRP connections. As such, he admonished investors not to interpret the drop in Coinbase’s wallets as bearish but rather as a sign of shifting custody arrangements, possibly connected to the world’s largest asset manager. Comments about BlackRock’s interest in the digital asset are growing louder each day, but it is worth noting that the company has already denied reports of filing for a Spot XRP ETF. A company spokesperson for BlackRock recently clarified that no such product has been filed with the SEC. Nevertheless, the decrease in Coinbase’s wallets coincides with recent developments involving BlackRock’s partnership with Coinbase, which suggests that an official move relating to a Spot XRP ETF could be in the works. Given BlackRock’s embrace of other crypto ETFs, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, it is only a matter of time before the altcoin joins the lineup. Although BlackRock has not confirmed any intentions, the rumors alone have increased interest among many holders, as shown by comments on social media. As many as eight other asset managers have filed for a Spot XRP ETF with the SEC, and many investors are still anticipating that a formal filing might arrive sooner than expected. At the time of writing, the connection between Coinbase’s reduced holdings and BlackRock is speculative, but as the third-largest crypto by market cap, the idea of Spot XRP ETFs hitting the market soon should not be ruled out.

Title: Do We Need to Interview Candidates In Person Again?

Interviewing I help hiring teams improve speed & quality. Ex-Amazon, Ex-Expedia. September 11, 2025 Are we about to go full circle and return to in-person interviews for most salaried roles? COVID pushed us to remote, Zoom-based interviews. Emerging tech then allowed employers to leverage AI to prompt interviewers on questions to use to interview humans. And now those candidates are responding by using AI to ace interviews. Which has caused folks like me to push TA leaders to get out ahead of this. Especially because some employers are even encouraging candidates to use AI during the interviewing process. If everyone is using AI, how will we know what a candidate can actually do? Does it matter if they need AI to do great work, as long as it’s great work? Will the future be bot-on-bot action, with employer AI agents screening and interviewing candidate bots? I’m not sure, but what I do know is that some companies are going old school, returning to in-person interviews, mostly because they’re fearful of hiring someone who’s aced the interview only because they have help from AI. 1. Based on my conversations with heads of TA, candidate use of AI is about 80% of the pull to return to in-person interviews. With the rising risk of candidate fraud — especially AI-assisted identity fraud and cheating — companies like Google and Deloitte are starting to prioritize in-person live interviews over remote video interviews. If you’re just getting up to speed on the risks, check out some of my previous articles here: 2. Another small reason for the return to in-person interviews — maybe 15% — is related to the big shift back to in-office work. Several TA leaders I spoke with said in-person interview requests are being driven somewhat by a need for a realistic job preview and an improved opportunity to connect with and sell candidates. In-person allows the candidate to meet the team in person, see the office and learn about their commute pattern, and experience the culture. 3. The third reason — maybe explaining just 5% of the pull — is related to beliefs that 1) soft skills and motivation are even more important to predicting success in a world where most knowledge is just a quick ChatGPT prompt away and that 2) human interviewers can better evaluate those soft skills in person, sitting across from the candidate. I think most of us have mixed feelings on this. The table below outlines the pros and cons of live, in-person interviews: The good news? Companies are 100% prepared for this shift back to in-person interviews. Just kidding. Most of us are not ready. In fact, because of the uncertain economy, recruiter and recruiting coordinator layoffs, more reliance on assessment-related tech to interview, and generally slower hiring, candidate experience and interviewer capabilities have not improved in the past three years. In fact, if you talk to candidates and hiring managers in focus groups as my team does, they’ll often say it’s gotten worse. What do we need to do if you and your business leaders decide to return to in-person interviews as the norm? 1. Training: We need to ensure our hiring teams are trained, not just in behavioral interviewing, legal risks, biases, and process. They also need to be aligned on your company’s new hard and soft skill needs — AI is disrupting a lot of jobs, so a more prescriptive weighting and shared philosophy on what’s trainable and what’s not will be key to selecting the right talent. For some companies, that’ll mean a smaller weighting on hard skills and a bigger emphasis on soft skills like curiosity, empathy, learning agility, building trust, influence/gaining buy-in, problem-solving, and communication skills. For others, that’ll mean a bigger focus on the expert skills and smaller focus on the supporting skills - and unfortunately, expert skills and soft skills are harder to evaluate than the supporting skills that AI will likely take over. 2. Candidate experience: Take advantage of the in-person interview to create a better candidate experience. In-demand candidates still need to be sold, even if it’s an employer’s market. Show off that expensive real estate, go old school and set up a non-interview lunch with the team, and get an executive to jump in and wow them with insights into your company’s compelling future. Some of us might need to rebuild the muscles around creating a great candidate experience for interviewed candidates, which includes excellent preinterview instructions on what to expect, a nice “we’re expecting you” greeting with reception/security, on-time, prepared interviewers, and excellent communication and expectation setting on next steps. This focus on CX might even bring us back to hiring recruiting coordinators. 3. Scheduling: Place advance holds on busy interviewer and hiring manager calendars for in-office interviews and same-day hiring decisions. We need speed to get quality, so don’t let in-person interviews cause you to miss out on top talent. 4. Identity verification: Ensure you have a mechanism to ensure that the person you screened over Zoom is the same person who shows up for your in-person interviews. Identity fraud — where someone uses AI or another interviewer to complete and pass the pre–onsite interview screen and assessments — is a bigger problem than it used to be. Talk to your HR and security team about the rigor needed to verify identity. 5. Talent advising: Train your recruiters to move from transactional process owners to true Talent Advisors. The business needs us in TA to level up the role we play in interviewing and selection given the renewed prioritization on quality of hire. Check out these free resources I’ve pulled together on how to be a Talent Advisor. And if you’re going to LinkedIn Talent Connect in San Diego in October, sign up for one of my sessions on quality of hire and reducing candidate fraud. 6. Leverage AI: Use generative AI to help your hiring teams translate job description language and your company-wide values/behaviors into hiring criteria, interview focus areas, interview questions, and good answer rubrics. But don’t just trust generic AI content on interviewing — your company may have a very different hiring approach than the median content AI has been trained on. Be sure to review what AI generates and correct anything that’s not in line with the business VP’s goals around what she wants her org makeup to look like in two to three years. Too often, TA has seen the middle-funnel work of interviewing and selection as something the business designs and leads independently. In fact, I’d argue most recruiting teams play a very small role between screened-candidate presentation and the post-interview decision action items (offer or decline). That needs to change. The risks associated with AI, the cost of bad hires, and the significant time investment around hiring requires us to lead more around the middle of the funnel. This starts with leading a conversation with the business around the pros and cons of remote interviews, asynchronous assessments, AI, and in-person interviews. Are you seeing a shift in your org to in-person interviews? Just for key roles, just for salaried corporate roles, just for executive hiring? I’ll post this article on my personal LinkedIn feed, and I’d love it if you’d share your plans and the why for your approach to interviewing in 2025 and beyond.

Title: Remaining CAPEX Obligation

Time Published: 2025-09-10T23:48:10Z

Read By Rather than further update the last post, we’ll start anew. In our preparation for this week’s Oracle earnings, we wrote: Absolute bestest most glorious company ever in entire universe of all time prepare awesome-sauce victory lap. With tomorrow’s earnings announcement the database vampire will permit us to bask in their greatness and invite us to contemplate why other companies even exist. Things are always so fabulous that the Oxford English Dictionary is considering replacing the word “superlative” with “Oracle”. Despite a mediocre quarter, Oracle stock price took that awesome-sauce victory lap (and then some). Oracle missed revenue and earnings expectations, reported slower growth than each of the much larger Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft, free cash flow went further negative, and CAPEX shrank to $8.5 billion from the previous quarter’s $9.2 billion. But it was a “bombastically scripted earnings call” for the ages. Oracle stock was up 36% today, maybe an all-time one day increase in valuation record. Kudos to Oracle for giving the market what it wanted to hear and to Larry for becoming the world’s richest man (doubtlessly a long coveted title). The stock rocketed based on Oracle announcing a $317 billion increase in their Remaining Performance Obligation (RPO), which is a non-GAAP metric of booked but not yet delivered revenue (SEC reported Deferred Revenue, which is the stricter portion of RPO, was $12.1 billion, up 29% from the previous quarter). My argument remains that Oracle is hyping future cloud revenue (that may or may not materialize), but neglecting the costs required to deliver and book that revenue. The iron law of cloud computing is no infrastructure, no revenue. And Oracle is a relative financial pipsqueak whose capital allocation abilities are already stressed. This post offers guidance for people furiously updating their Excel models that detail every parameter of Oracle’s next half-decade. A day after the earnings call focused on that $317 billion increase in RPO, we learned Open AI was responsible for $300 billion of that increase (how much that actually translates into SEC reported Deferred Revenue is a question for next quarter). Oracle stock is now a one-way bet on whether Open AI can raise hundreds of billions in new capital. Stargate “has struggled to get out of the gate” and Open AI is passing the hat for single digit billions instead of the desired trillions. Open AI’s projected losses are growing. Oracle tried to paint the RPO explosion as broad based, citing xAI, Meta, NVIDIA and AMD as new customers. xAi has no revenue, is itself struggling to raise money, and not many customers are going to be dumb enough to take a business dependency on Elon for AI. Meta is in the midst of a $600 billion AI mulligan (maybe – neither Zuck nor the CFO are sure actually how much they plan to spend). But Meta likely promised every well-compensated recent hire their own GPU clusters, and Oracle is a source. NVIDIA and AMD are merely recycling revenue from Oracle (but the SEC, like Congress, is on recess). And why don’t they talk about their biggest current customer? (ByteDance). If you are adding the new RPO numbers to your Oracle models, you also have to add the infrastructure costs, aka the Remaining CAPEX Obligation. Again, no infrastructure, no revenue. Let’s return to the AWS history, as it is a great proxy, but step through it in more detail than the last post. We have ten years of data that lets us directly compare annual CAPEX to revenue. We see AWS-specific CAPEX as a percentage of annual AWS revenue dropping from 60%, bottoming at 27% in 2023, and ramping back above 50% as the AI frenzy hits (they’re above 70% for the first half of 2025). Now lets look at same numbers for Oracle: You quickly notice Oracle is far less efficient than AWS, with CAPEX/revenue ratios in the triple digits ranging between 100% and 208% (the FY26 numbers are Oracle’s revenue and CAPEX guidance for the current fiscal year). This is consistent with Oracle being a noob when it comes to large scale data centers, as we have chronicled. But it also shows the absurdity of Oracle’s claims to be “asset pretty light” – they are vastly less efficient than AWS despite bragging about not owning data centers (“I know some of our competitors like to own buildings”). Despite giving up margin, Oracle is not even remotely seeing any advantage from not owning data centers (I guess it could always be worse). Type your email… Subscribe Now, as you update your five-year model for Oracle, you have to decide what CAPEX numbers go with that nearly geometric sequence of revenue increases. Some things to keep in mind as you pick parameters: So let’s throw out some numbers for the required CAPEX spend as a percentage of revenue (Oracle’s average over the last three years is 170%, which would be a level of CAPEX that exceeds all the new-found RPO). Pick your preferred numbers and enter them into your model: The last step for your updated model is to figure out where the money to pay for RCO is coming from. We detailed Oracle’s financial constraints in the previous post. Free cash flow is already negative. Oracle carries a fair amount of debt (though that debt/equity ratio looks better today!). And they allocate a lot of capital to Larry through both dividends and buybacks. What does Oracle’s capital allocation look like for the next five years that is consistent with your model?

The decisions postponed BlackRock's Ethereum staking proposal alongside Franklin Templeton's spot XRP and Solana ETF applications. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed decisions on three crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Sept. 10. The decisions postponed BlackRock’s Ethereum staking proposal alongside Franklin Templeton’s spot XRP and Solana ETF applications. The delays come as the SEC develops a generic listing framework that could streamline future crypto ETF approvals. The postponements position these applications for potential approval during an anticipated October batch decision window, aligning with previous predictions. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted in April that crypto ETFs would likely get a batch of approvals in October, when some of the over 90 filings reach their final deadlines. The SEC has been working with US exchanges on a standardized listing framework for token-based ETFs that would eliminate individual rule-change requests for qualifying assets. The initiative would allow ETF sponsors to bypass the customary Form 19b-4 process when underlying tokens meet predetermined criteria. Under the proposed framework, sponsors would submit registration statements on Form S-1, observe standard 75-day review periods, and list products once the waiting periods have ended. Market capitalization, on-exchange trading volume, and daily liquidity represent key metrics under discussion for qualification thresholds. The current rule-change pathway requires each spot crypto ETF to secure a Commission order before listing, a process designed for novel or complex products.

Eric Balchunas said on Sept. 9 that the “memecoin ETF era [is] about to kick off” with a Dogecoin ETF slated for launch on Sept. 11 under the 40 Act structure. Balchunas said this could potentially become “the first-ever US ETF to hold something that has no utility on purpose,” considering Dogecoin was originally created as a tribute to the Doge meme. A successful Dogecoin ETF launch could catalyze broader approval momentum for pending applications. Seyffart previously shared that there are 92 crypto ETF applications divided across various assets, including Solana, XRP, Litecoin, and staking versions of existing products awaiting SEC decisions. The comprehensive filing list reveals applications from major issuers, including VanEck, Grayscale, Canary, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton, covering assets ranging from established cryptocurrencies to emerging tokens.

September 10, 2025 19:06 ET | Source: TradeInvestNow.com TradeInvestNow.com New York, NY, Sept. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The team at Tradeinvestnow.com invites you to join Professor Joel Litman and Whitney Tilson at the "Breakout 2025" livestream event on Wednesday, September 17 at 8 p.m. ET, where these two financial experts will collaborate to discuss a stock market anomaly they've identified and demonstrate the Altimetry Doubles Scanner, a tool designed to help investors analyze stocks for potential growth opportunities. Joel Litman's Breakout 2025 event - Get all the details here Joel Litman's Breakout 2025 Event Overview The Breakout 2025 event will focus on a stock market anomaly identified by Joel Litman through a comprehensive study of over 3,000 stocks since 1994. This anomaly has appeared in companies across various sectors, including technology, retail, and energy, and is linked to significant price movements observed in recent market trends. The livestream will provide detailed information on how this anomaly functions and its relevance to the upcoming earnings season, which may influence stock price dynamics. Attendees will gain free access to the Altimetry Doubles Scanner, a tool developed by Litman to analyze over 5,000 stock tickers and assess their market potential based on his proprietary methodology. The event will also include a special report, Two Stocks to Plug into the Doubles Scanner Right Now, which examines two widely held stocks and their market outlooks. A guest speaker, a 50-year Wall Street veteran who has worked with figures like George Soros and Steve Cohen, will share additional insights on navigating current market conditions. The event aims to provide retail investors with analytical tools and perspectives typically reserved for institutional clients, fostering informed decision-making in a complex market environment. Breakout Profits: The Research Behind the Anomaly Joel Litman’s anomaly is based on a historical study analyzing stocks across multiple decades and industries. The research identified a recurring pattern in companies such as Nvidia, Lululemon, Southern Copper, Celsius, Hub Group, and Domino’s Pizza, as well as all seven of the “Magnificent Seven” stocks—Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla—prior to significant price movements. The study suggests that this anomaly is relevant to current market conditions, particularly as the earnings season approaches. The Altimetry Doubles Scanner utilizes this research to enable users to input stock tickers and receive immediate feedback on their market potential. The tool is designed to be accessible to investors of all experience levels, simplifying complex financial analysis and providing data-driven insights. Meet the Experts Joel Litman: Forensic Accounting Specialist Professor Joel Litman has nearly three decades of experience in financial analysis, having worked with firms such as Deloitte, Credit Suisse, and PricewaterhouseCoopers. Concerned by discrepancies in corporate financial reporting, he developed a proprietary valuation system to assess the true financial health of companies. His work includes predicting the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 COVID market crash, as well as identifying companies at risk of significant declines. Litman provides research to over half of the world’s 300 largest money managers. He has lectured at Harvard, MIT, Wharton, and the Pentagon, and advised the FBI and U.S. Marine Corps War College. His focus is on transparency in financial reporting to equip investors with accurate data for decision-making. Whitney Tilson: Experienced Investor Whitney Tilson, known as “The Prophet” by CNBC, managed a hedge fund that grew from $1 million to over $200 million in assets over two decades. He has predicted the dot-com crash, the 2008 housing crisis, and the 2020 COVID market rebound, with appearances on 60 Minutes, CNBC, and Bloomberg. His 2015 60 Minutes investigation into Lumber Liquidators highlighted issues in corporate practices and impacted its market performance. A long-time follower of Warren Buffett, Tilson has attended 26 consecutive Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meetings and co-authored a book on Charlie Munger. His approach emphasizes identifying market opportunities and understanding broader economic trends. Breakout 2025 Event Details and Participation The Breakout 2025 event will be held on September 17, 2025, at 8 p.m. Eastern Time via livestream. To participate, individuals can reserve their spot by submitting their email address, which provides access to event updates, the Altimetry Doubles Scanner, and the special report. Attendees are encouraged to: The event is free to attend! Significance of the Breakout 2025 Event The Breakout 2025 event offers retail investors access to advanced financial analysis typically available only to institutional clients. By combining Litman’s forensic accounting expertise with Tilson’s market experience, the event provides a comprehensive framework for understanding stock market dynamics. The Altimetry Doubles Scanner empowers investors to analyze stocks independently, while the guest speaker’s insights add depth to the discussion. With the earnings season approaching, the event is timed to help investors prepare for potential market shifts. About Altimetry Research Altimetry Research is a boutique financial research and publishing firm providing individual investors with unique, unbiased investment recommendations and analytics. Primarily, they are guided by the knowledge that U.S. accounting guidelines – which American public companies are forced to follow – obscure the true results of a company's profitability, misleading investors. Instead of using traditional Wall Street analyses, they deconstruct them and reassemble them using their own Uniform Adjusted Financial Reporting Standards (UAFRS) – or Uniform Accounting, for short. This process shows them the true picture of a company's potential. Then they combine Uniform Accounting with additional, deep forensic analysis to consistently find mispriced companies poised for massive growth, which they detail for their subscribers.

Title: Klarna surges 14.6% in NYSE debut as Buy Now Pay Later giant goes public
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/09/10/klarna-surges-14-6-nyse-debut-buy-now-pay-later-giant-goes-public/
Time Published: 2025-09-10T22:36:35Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 18:36 EDT / SEPTEMBER 10 2025 by Duncan Riley Shares in Klarna Group PLC closed up 14.6% in regular trading today after the Swedish fintech company made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange. In its initial public offering, Klarna offered around 34.3 million shares at $40 each, raising about $1.4 billion. The shares opened at $52 each before surging to a high of $57, closing the day at $45.82. Founded in 2005, Klarna offers a “buy now, pay later” service that allows consumers to make online purchases and pay for them in installments, often with no interest over a short period, such as with its “Pay in 4” model. Klarna acts as an intermediary, paying the merchant upfront and then managing consumer payments, effectively removing risk for both parties and simplifying the checkout process. In addition to BNPL offerings, Klarna provides a suite of payment processing services for e-commerce merchants, handling customer payments, managing store claims and disputes. Since obtaining a banking license in Sweden in 2017, the company has also offered broader fintech offerings, including issuing physical and digital cards, providing savings accounts and offering subscription based services. In its IPO filing in March, Klarna said that more than 675,000 merchants have adopted its service to date and that those companies use Klarna to process payments for 93 million customers. The platform’s gross merchandise value, the combined dollar value of the transactions it processes, reached $105 billion last year. Klarna’s revenue rose 24% year-over-year, to $2.81 billion in 2024, and the company generated $21 million in net income. As reported by Bloomberg, the company’s closing price gives Klarna a market value of more than $17 billion, based on outstanding shares, a not unreasonable figure but notably down from a valuation of $45.6 billion the company reached on paper in a $639 million round in June 2021 during the COVID-19 online shopping boom. A subsequent private funding round of $800 million in 2022 saw Klarna’s valuation drop to $6.7 billion. Coming into its IPO, Klarna had raised $4.19 billion over 20 rounds, according to data from Tracxn. Investors in the company included Sequoia Capital Operations, Silver Lake Management, Adit Ventures, WestCap Management, Founders Fund Management, SoftBank Vision Fund LP, Dragoneer Investing Group, Technology Crossover Ventures LP, Macy’s Inc., BlackRock Inc., Visa Inc. and Ant Group Co. Ltd. Klarna’s successful IPO follows a recent run of strong tech-related IPOs, including Figma Inc. in July and Firefly Aerospace Inc. in August. The positive results have also seen more companies line up to go public after a near drought in IPOs over the COVID period amid market uncertainty. Earlier this week, Netskope Inc. and StubHub Inc. disclosed that they had filed for IPOs, while Infleqtion Inc. and CoinShares International Ltd. are opting to go public via mergers with special-purpose acquisition companies.

The SEC extended its deadline for addressing a rule change request by the Nasdaq exchange for staking in the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) to October 30, a 45-day postponement from its original schedule. It also pushed back its decision on 19b-4 rule change filings by Cboe that would allow the listing of the Franklin Templeton Solana ETF and Franklin Templeton XRP ETF to November 14, a 60-day deferral. The latest filings follow a slew of SEC delays in recent weeks on proposals for altcoin funds. On Tuesday, the regulator put off ruling on Nasdaq’s bid to list the Grayscale Hedera Trust to November 12, also 60 days. Last month, the SEC also held up resolving a request to add staking to the the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF, which tracks the price of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value. At that time, it also moved back its decision on an application by Donald Trump's media and technology company by 45 days to Oct. 8 for a Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF that would track the two largest cryptocurrencies by market value. And it announced identical delays for applications filed for spot XRP funds by Grayscale, CoinShares, Canary Capital, Bitwise, and 21Shares, a spot Dogecoin ETF from Grayscale, and a spot Litecoin product from CoinShares. The dates for potential approvals of those funds vary. Those announcements followed delayed decisions on Solana ETFs from Bitwise, 21Shares, and VanEck, and a Dogecoin fund from 21Shares. Before August ended, the SEC was weighing 90 crypto ETF applications, which spanned a range of assets. Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas told Decrypt that the latest delays were consistent with the regulator's recent approach, likely timing approvals of proposed altcoin ETFs and Ethereum staking after likely green-lighting proposals filed in July by Cboe and NYSE. Those exchanges asked the SEC to approve amendments that could significantly shorten the approval process for future crypto exchange-traded funds, automatically listing certain products without requiring case-by-case filings. In separate filings, the exchanges requested changes to their listing standards that would allow certain crypto ETFs to be listed without enduring the SEC's rigorous evaluation, a process that requires exchanges to submit proposed rule changes. Under current guidelines, reviews of proposed changes to funds could take 240 days. "They've been punting and punting [...] and we expect them to keep putting everything off until the generic listing standards are done," Balchunas said. "That is what we think will happen, probably in early October. After that, we expect a flood of ETFs probably in a couple months." He added: "We expect ETH staking to be part of it. This SEC showed every sign of being interested in working with the issuers and solving problems." Bloomberg analysts have predicted a more than 95% probability of Solana and XRP ETFs receiving approval this year. Balchunas described the odds on staking as "pretty high," as well. "We think they'll allow that, too," he said.

Title: 20-year-old fintech Klarna finally went public. Here's who's getting rich.

Two decades after its founding, Klarna has gone public, and its investors are finally seeing a windfall. The Swedish "buy now, pay later" company listed on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. Its stock popped 30% on its debut, jumping above its $40-per-share IPO price to $52 a share. That IPO price gave Klarna a $15.1 billion valuation and netted Klarna $1.37 billion. Per Pitchbook, Klarna had raised $3.85 billion in its history before the public listing. Klarna's IPO has been a long time coming. Founded in 2005, the consumer payments company first hinted at an IPO in 2019, telling Bloomberg it could go public in the next one to two years. Klarna had reportedly planned to go public earlier this year, but delayed its IPO efforts after Trump's Liberation Day tariffs roiled the markets. It's the first major IPO of the fall and is expected to be one of many companies to take the public market plunge before the end of the year. Gemini Space Station, a crypto exchange backed by the billionaire Winklevoss twins, is expected to go public later this week, and 25-year-old ticket marketplace StubHub launched its IPO roadshow Monday. Klarna's IPO price represents a major markdown from its peak valuation, however. The company raised $639 million in 2021 at a $45.6 billion valuation, but slashed its valuation a stunning 85% to $6.7 billion the next year as the fintech sector stumbled on rising interest rates and worsening investor sentiment. Klarna chairperson and former Sequoia Capital Michael Moritz criticized the company's other investors at the time. "The shift in Klarna's valuation is entirely due to investors suddenly voting in the opposite manner to the way they voted for the past few years. The irony is that Klarna's business, its position in various markets, and its popularity with consumers and merchants are all stronger than at any time since Sequoia first invested in 2010," Moritz said in a press release about the round. "Eventually, after investors emerge from their bunkers, the stocks of Klarna and other first-rate companies will receive the attention they deserve." Klarna debuts on the US market facing a number of headwinds, including regulatory risks and widening losses as the company sets aside more capital to cover potential losses if its customers don't pay back their loans. It's been making changes to its operations, too. Klarna will require many of its previously remote employees to return to the office three days a week beginning at the end of September, in part due to Klarna losing talent to firms that prioritize in-person working, Business Insider reported last week. Klarna is also redirecting multiple employees to customer support positions after previously restructuring the business to prioritize AI chatbots handling its customer service. Klarna declined to comment for this story. We used Klarna's share price at Wednesday's market close, $45.82, to determine the value of its major shareholders' stakes after the listing. We're including the 15 shareholders with the largest stakes after Klarna's IPO. Venture firm IVP, Ant Group, and Harvest Growth Capital, other investors in Klarna listed in its IPO filing, were among the top 15 shareholders prior to Klarna's IPO, but sold enough shares in the listing to fall in the rankings. Our calculations included any extra shares that shareholders offered to meet higher investor demand. Now that Klarna is public, here's what those top 15 shareholders' stakes are worth. Venture capital giant Sequoia Capital is the biggest benefactor of Klarna's IPO. The San Francisco-based firm Sequoia owned 78.8 million shares, or about 20.1% of the company, after its IPO. Sequoia first invested in Klarna in 2010, leading the company's $9 million fundraise and contributing additional capital over numerous rounds in the following years. Former Sequoia partner Michael Moritz joined Klarna's board of directors at the firm's 2010 investment and became the chairperson of the board in 2020. When Moritz stepped down from his investing position in 2023, Sequoia partner Matthew Morris joined Klarna's board to represent the firm. The following year, Morris, with Sequoia's backing, reportedly attempted to remove Moritz from the board altogether. After facing pushback from Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Morris withdrew the attempt and stepped down from the board. Sequoia partner Andrew Reed took his place. Moritz remains Klarna's chairperson today. "It's amazing what an iron-willed CEO like [Sebastian Siemiatkowski], an enduring value prop, a team of true believers, and 20 years of steady (ish?) compounding can create," Reed posted on X Wednesday morning. Sequoia bought an additional 7.33 million shares in Klarna between July 2022 and March 2023 for $135 million, according to Klarna's IPO filing. Sequoia sold 2.14 million shares in Klarna's IPO, which at its $40-per-share IPO price netted the firm $85.6 million. At a $45.82 closing share price, Sequoia's remaining stake is worth about $3.5 billion. Klarna cofounder Victor Jacobsson owned about 30 million shares of Klarna, or 8% of the company after its IPO. Jacobsson founded Klarna in 2005 alongside Sebastian Siemiatkowski and Niklas Adalberth. He served as the company's CFO until 2012, when he left. Jacobsson and Siemiatkowski, Klarna's CEO and the only cofounder who remains an executive at the company, have reportedly clashed in private for years over key governance decisions at Klarna, like how and when the company should go public. Jacobsson has amassed a large stake in Klarna over the years, including by buying up shares in secondary markets through various holding companies, the Financial Times previously reported. Between July 2022 and March 2023, Jacobsson bought nearly 4 million shares of Klarna for a total of $73 million across four different holding companies, per Klarna's IPO filing. Jacobsson sold about 1.3 million shares in Klarna's IPO, which at a $40-per-share IPO price would've netted him about $52.1 million. At a $45.82 share price, Jacobsson's remaining stake is worth about $1.38 billion. Heartland A/S, the investment holding company owned by Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, owned about 37.1 million shares of Klarna, or about 7.8% of the company after its IPO. Heartland first invested in Klarna in 2017 via Brightfolk A/S, another of Holch Povlsen's holding companies. That investment included shares bought from existing Klarna investors such as private equity firm General Atlantic and cofounder Niklas Adalberth. Heartland CEO Lise Kaae sits on Klara's board of directors. The firm sold about 7.4 million shares in Klarna's IPO, or about 20% of its stake. At a $40-per-share IPO price, that sale brought in about $297 million. At a $45.82 share price, Heartland's remaining stake is worth about $1.36 billion. Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Klarna's CEO and cofounder, owned 25.6 million shares of Klarna, or about 6.8% after its IPO. Siemiatkowski began building Klarna alongside his cofounders at age 23, while he was getting his master's degree at the Stockholm School of Economics. The company, initially named Kreditor and rebranded to Klarna in 2010, sought to allow customers to pay for their purchases after delivery. Siemiatkowski was estimated to be a billionaire in early 2022, with his net worth peaking at roughly $3.2 billion after Klarna raised a funding round the previous year at a $45.6 billion valuation. The company's fundraise in July 2022, however, valued Klarna at $6.7 billion, knocking Siemiatkowski off the billionaire pedestal. Klarna paid $16.5 million to nonprofits founded by Siemiatkowski's wife, including through donations and partnerships, over the last five years, BI reported last week. Siemiatkowski purchased an additional 3.06 million shares of Klarna for $56 million between July 2022 and March 2023. He's the only major shareholder on this list who didn't sell any of his shares in Klarna's IPO. At a $45.82 price, his stake is now worth about $1.17 billion. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia owned about 19.3 million shares of Klarna, or about 4.6% of the company after its IPO. CBA, the largest bank in Australia by total assets, first invested $100 million in Klarna in 2019. It's also backed Anthropic, announcing an investment in the AI startup giant in March. CBA invested an additional $200 million in Klarna in 2020, bringing its stake to 5.5%. As part of its investments in Klarna, CBA received 50-50 ownership rights with Klarna to Klarna's Australian and New Zealand business. CBA bought an additional 1.8 million shares in Klarna between July 2022 and March 2023, according to Klarna's IPO filing, for an aggregate price of $32 million. CBA sold about 1.9 million shares in Klarna's IPO, which at the $40-per-share IPO price would've brought in $77.4 million. At a $45.82 share price, its remaining stake is worth about $798 million. Private equity firm Silver Lake owned 17 million shares of Klarna, or about 3.8% of the company after its IPO. The Silicon Valley-based firm's other tech bets include fintech darling Stripe, business-management software company Airtable, and weight-care app Noom. Silver Lake led Klarna's $650 million fundraise in 2020, which valued the company at $10.6 billion. The firm sold about 2.6 million shares in Klarna's IPO, netting it $102 million at a $40 IPO share price. At $45.82 a share, Silver Lake's remaining stake is worth about $663 million. Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC Private Limited owned about 6.3 million shares of Klarna, or about 1.4% after its IPO. The fund manages Singapore's foreign reserves in more than 40 countries. It's also invested in Anthropic, contributing to its September $13 billion Series F fundraise at an $183 billion valuation. GIC invested in Klarna's $650 million round in 2020 at a $10.6 billion valuation. The fund sold about 1.2 million shares in Klarna's IPO, netting it $46.9 million at a $40 IPO share price. At a $45.82 share price, GIC's remaining stake is worth about $236 million. San Francisco-based investment firm HMI Capital owned about 5.6 million shares in Klarna, or about 1.2% of the company after its IPO. HMI Capital manages about $3.22 billion in assets, primarily making investments in public companies including Roblox, Flutter Entertainment, and SailPoint. The firm first invested in Klarna in 2019, contributing to its $460 million fundraise. HMI Capital put more money into the company in its 2020, 2021, and 2022 raises. "From the outset, we believed that their vision of buy-now-pay-later offers a cheaper, friendlier alternative to credit cards. Klarna has proven that by welcoming over 110 million active consumers to its platform," said Justin Nyweide, founding partner and CIO of HMI Capital, in a statement to BI. "We particularly want to congratulate CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Chairperson Michael Moritz and CFO Niclas Neglén for successfully bringing Klarna to market in a turbulent time. We are proud to partner with them and can't wait for Klarna to tackle the immense growth opportunity in front of them." HMI Capital sold 1.1 million shares in Klarna's IPO, which at a $40-per-share IPO price would've brought in $44.5 million. At a $45.82 share price, its remaining stake is worth about $204 million. BlackRock owned nearly 6 million shares of Klarna, or about 1.1% of the company after its IPO. BlackRock has invested hundreds of billions of dollars in Big Tech giants including Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. It's also backed AI data processing startup Databricks, which announced a $1 billion fundraise this week at a $100 billion valuation. The firm first invested in Klarna in 2019, contributing to its $460 million fundraise, and putting more capital into the company in its 2020 and 2021 raises. BlackRock sold about 1.7 million shares in Klarna's IPO. At a $40 IPO share price, that sale would've netted the firm $68.5 million. At a $45.82 share price, BlackRock's remaining stake is worth about $194 million. UBS O'Connor owned about 4.5 million shares in Klarna, or about .9% of the company after its IPO. UBS O'Connor is an alternative investment unit within UBS Asset Management. Per Klarna's IPO filing, its Klarna investment is held in the Nineteen77 funds that UBS manages. It's not clear when UBS O'Connor first invested in Klarna. The fund did participate in Klarna's $800 million Series H fundraise in 2022, per UBS. In May, UBS said it would sell its O'Connor unit, which had roughly $11 billion under management at the time, to Cantor Fitzgerald. That acquisition hasn't yet closed. UBS and Cantor Fitzgerald declined to confirm whether O'Connor's stake in Klarna will be assumed by Cantor Fitzgerald when the deal closes. UBS O'Connor sold about 1.3 million shares in Klarna's IPO, which, at a $40-per-share price, would have brought in about $52.3 million. At a $45.82 share price, its remaining stake is worth about $148 million. Sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Company owned about 5.4 million shares of Klarna, or about .8% of the company after its IPO. Mubadala invests in companies in the United Arab Emirates and abroad on behalf of the government of Abu Dhabi. It's backed a number of top private companies, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Databricks, and healthcare IPO hopeful Zelis Healthcare. Mubadala invested in Klarna in 2022 as part of the company's $800 million fundraise. Mubadala sold 2.3 million shares in Klarna's IPO, representing about 43% of its holdings. At a $40-per-share IPO price, that sale would net the firm about $93.8 million. At a $45.82 share price, its remaining stake is worth $141 million. Skandia owned about 4.1 million shares of Klarna, or about .8% of the company after its IPO. The Swedish insurance and financial services company first invested in Klarna in 2015, when it bought a roughly 1% stake. Skandia sold about 1.2 million shares in Klarna's IPO, representing nearly 30% of its stake in the company. At a $40-per-share IPO price, that sale netted Skandia about $47.7 million. At Klarna's $45.82 closing share price, Skandia's remaining stake is worth about $135 million. Niklas Adalberth, Klarna's third cofounder, owned about 2.9 million shares of Klarna, or about .7% of the company after its IPO. That's the sum of shares held by Adalberth himself and by Sunnersta Invest AB, Adalberth's private investment company. Adalberth used to own about 8% of Klarna. But after Adalberth stepped down as Klarna's deputy CEO and left the company in 2015, he sold all but .75% of his stake to fund his philanthropy and impact investing. Adalberth told BI in 2021 that he left Klarna after reevaluating his priorities, including his feelings toward wealth and consumption. Adalberth sold about 273,000 shares in Klarna's IPO, netting him about $11.7 million at a $40 share price. At $45.82 a share, Adalberth's remaining stake is worth $121 million. London-based venture firm Atomico owned about 3.6 million shares of Klarna, or nearly .7% of the company after its IPO. Started in 2006 by Skype cofounder Niklas Zennström, Atomico has backed some VC heavy-hitters, including fintech giant Stripe and physical therapy company Hinge Health, which went public earlier this year. Atomico first invested in Klarna in 2012, buying shares from an existing investor in a secondary sale worth $14 million. "Over 13 years of partnership with Sebastian and his team, we've seen economic downturns, market turbulence, and inflationary pressures, yet Klarna's business model has always proven remarkably resilient," Zennström said in a statement to BI. "That ability to scale faster while running leaner is unparalleled, and it's a model more companies and founders across Europe will seek to emulate." Atomico sold just over a million shares of Klarna in its IPO. At a $40-per-share IPO price, that sale netted Atomico $41.5 million. At a $45.82 share price, Atomico's remaining stake is worth about $118 million. SEB, short for Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, is a Stockholm-based bank. SEB owned about 2.4 million shares of Klarna, or roughly .6% of the company after its IPO. SEB began working with Klarna in 2012, when Klarna partnered with SEB on its Klarna Checkout platform for merchants. (Klarna sold Klarna Checkout in 2024.) SEB's pension funds also contributed tens of millions of dollars to Norrsken VC, Adalberth's impact fund, in 2020 and 2021. SEB told BI that its stake in Klarna, as listed in the company's IPO filing, is "kept in custody on behalf of clients." The bank declined to comment further. SEB sold about 23,000 shares in Klarna's IPO, which at the $40-per-share IPO price would net the firm about $937,000. At a $45.82 closing share price, SEB's remaining share is worth about $110 million. Jump to

Title: SOL Strategies CEO discusses Solana treasury companies’ role in driving institutional blockchain adoption

Leah Wald emphasized that treasury companies must operate respectfully to maintain industry credibility while benefiting from expanding product availability. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. SOL Strategies CEO Leah Wald outlined how Solana-focused digital asset treasury companies can drive institutional adoption and exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows. In an interview with CryptoSlate, Wald noted that multiple Solana treasury companies create a “rising tide” effect similar to Bitcoin miners benefiting alongside Bitcoin ETF inflows. She noted the parallel between Bitcoin ecosystem dynamics, where miners receive inflows alongside spot and futures ETFs, suggesting similar potential for Solana-focused companies. Wald explained: “You’ve always seen that in the past where miners get inflows, like Bitcoin miners. ETF gets inflows alongside Bitcoin spot and Bitcoin futures ETFs get inflows.” She described the phenomenon as retail investors choosing different products based on enthusiasm, while institutions prefer ETFs for tax advantages and custody structures. Wald acknowledged widespread market expectations for a spot or staked spot Solana ETF under a 33 Act wrapper, viewing this development as part of a broader rising tide of product offerings. She emphasized that treasury companies must operate respectfully to maintain industry credibility while benefiting from expanding product availability. Bloomberg ETF analysts expect an approval in October, when most of the spot Solana ETF filings will meet their final deadline with the SEC. Addressing concerns about digital asset treasury (DAT) company valuations, Wald acknowledged that many firms that added Bitcoin now trade at discounts to multiple of Bitcoin NAV (mNAV), including Bitcoin miners. A Sept. 2 report by Grayscale highlighted a decreasing mNAV for DAT companies, suggesting a cooling of interest from investors. However, she expressed confidence that SOL Strategies’ dual approach as both a technology company and treasury accumulator provides competitive advantages during market downturns. Wald stated: “It does not scare us. I think it positions us in a position of strength because we’re the only ones running a real business and it’s a business that continues to accumulate and compound.” She noted that discount trading environments place pressure on management teams to execute validator business models effectively rather than relying solely on asset appreciation.

Stay connected via SOL Strategies differentiates itself by calling the company “DAT plus plus,” emphasizing technology development alongside treasury accumulation. Wald described the firm as a technology company first, with treasury accumulation as a secondary function, contrasting with purely speculative treasury models. SOL Strategies added SOL to its treasury and started trading on Nasdaq on Sept. 9 under the ticker STKE. Despite being the second-largest decentralized ecosystem, with over $12 billion in total value locked, Solana still represents a small fraction of the tokenization landscape. Institutions deployed nearly $500 million using Solana’s infrastructure, representing 3.1% of this market. In comparison, Ethereum has a 52% dominance over tokenization efforts. Wald sees institutional treasury companies as catalysts for closing this gap through education and validation efforts. She explained: “I do think that any ETF, like any well-respected issuer or well-respected company, anyone that puts boots on the ground on education is only going to help Solana, the network, grow and succeed.” She emphasized validation and adoption benefits from proper educational initiatives about Solana’s technical advantages. Wald stressed the significant institutional interest, including BlackRock’s plans to launch a yield fund on Solana alongside existing tokenized products from Apollo and Franklin Templeton. She listed these developments as evidence of growing institutional recognition of Solana’s capabilities for tokenization and digital asset infrastructure. Wald concluded by positioning treasury companies as educational ambassadors for Solana’s institutional adoption journey: “It’s on all of us out there to educate why we think that it’s better, cheaper, faster, quicker, all those different merits to get there.

Title: The AI Trade Picks Up Steam After Oracle's 'Truly Historic' Quarter

The artificial intelligence trade got a shot of adrenaline on Wednesday after results from database software and cloud provider Oracle suggested the AI spending bonanza has ample room to run. Oracle (ORCL) on Tuesday reported its backlog swelled to $455 billion, a 359% year-over-year increase, after it signed four multibillion-dollar cloud deals in the first quarter of its 2026 fiscal year. Executives said the backlog is expected to surpass half a trillion as Oracle inks more big deals in the coming months. Oracle also forecast cloud revenue would grow from an estimated $18 billion this fiscal year to $144 billion in 2030, about $50 billion more than Wall Street had forecast. Oracle said most of that revenue forecast was already reflected in its backlog, giving some investors greater confidence in the numbers. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that Oracle had signed a five-year contract worth $300 billion with ChatGPT creator OpenAI. Oracle’s projections completely overshadowed lackluster first-quarter results, and sent its shares soaring as much as 43% on Wednesday. The rising tide of robust AI spending was lifting plenty of boats on Wednesday. Shares of AI chip giants Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) were recently up more than 4% and 9%, respectively, while chip design company Arm Holdings (ARM) surged more than 8%. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) was up about 2%. Data center infrastructure provider Vertiv Holdings (VRT) jumped about 9%, while power generators Vistra (VST) and Constellation Energy (CEG) advanced 8% and 6%, respectively. Oracle’s major cloud competitors were the only drag on the AI trade on Wednesday. Amazon (AMZN) declined more than 3%, while Meta Platforms (META) dropped nearly 2%. Alphabet (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT) ticked higher. Wall Street’s ebullience over the results was first visible on Oracle’s earnings call Tuesday night. “Even I’m sort of blown away by what this looks like going forward,” said Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci at the top of the question and answer portion of the call. “I tell my team, ‘Pay attention to this’—even those that are not working on Oracle—‘because this is a career event happening right now,” DiFucci added. “There's no better evidence of a seismic shift happening in computing than these results that you just put up,” said Deutsche Bank analyst Brad Zelnick. Others called the quarter “momentous” and the backlog growth “truly historic.” AI investments have been driven by what many have characterized as insatiable demand for training and inference, and Oracle’s results appeared to support that assessment. On Oracle’s earnings call, co-founder and chair Larry Ellison said an unnamed company had requested all of Oracle’s available inferencing capacity. “I’d never gotten a call like that,” Ellison said. Big Tech’s investment in capacity to meet that demand is expected to remain robust in the coming years, supported by healthy cash flows at the biggest cloud providers and supportive tax incentives. Cloud providers like Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon have been key drivers of the AI infrastructure trade in recent years. Hyperscalers are expected to spend a cumulative $368 billion on infrastructure this year, with much of that earmarked for data centers and the chips and servers that fill them, according to Goldman Sachs. Oracle on Tuesday forecast capital expenditures of $35 billion in the 12 months through May 2026, about $10 billion more than the figure executives gave as a minimum last quarter. Tax incentives written into the recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act should also support AI infrastructure investment. Morgan Stanley expects the bill’s immediate capital investment depreciation provisions to boost Big Tech’s free cash flows by nearly $50 billion this year. The firm expects a sizable portion of those tax savings to be spent on AI infrastructure.

Title: Restore Trust In Congress Act—Missteps And Mistakes
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewleahey/2025/09/10/restore-trust-in-congress-act-missteps-and-mistakes/
Time Published: 2025-09-10T19:46:24Z
Full Content:
ByAndrew Leahey, Contributor. Every few years, Congress remembers that it probably shouldn’t be allowed to play the stock market like a fantasy football league with insider information on plays. And, every time, opponents recoil in horror—not at the ethics violation, but at the idea that members may have to pay taxes if they are forced to sell their holdings. Now comes a bipartisan bill that, at least on paper, seeks to resolve this dilemma by banning individual stock ownership for members of Congress. At the same time, by way of a sweetener, lawmakers propose giving members a tax deferralon any gains from those sales. It is pitched as a compromise, but in reality, it’s a policy Frankenstein: half ethics reform, half boutique tax shelter, all bad for good government. The Restore Trust in Congress Act does what it says on the label. It prohibits members of Congress, their spouses, and their dependent children from owning or trading individual stocks, commodities, futures, or even derivative assets and options. In short, if it was passed as proposed, it would mean no more betting on Tesla or buying call options on defense contractors while simultaneously hammering out the next Pentagon budget. The bill requires current lawmakers to divest within 180 days, and gives new members 90 days from their swearing-in. It carves out the usual safe harbors—more abstract holdings like mutual funds, Treasury bonds, and index funds. Municipal bonds are still fair game, as well. The bill classifies itself as a federal conflict-of-interest statute, which would make divesting members eligible for preferred tax treatment under Section 1043 of the Internal Revenue Code. The provision is designed to allow government officials to defer capital gain taxes when they sell assets in compliance with ethics rules—provided they reinvest the proceeds in diversified investments like mutual funds. So instead of a clean ethics rule, we get an ethics rule plus a sweetheart deferral. Congress isn’t just instructing its members to clean up their portfolios before they swear-in—it’s offering them a spoonful of tax break to help the ethical medicine go down. The logic is simple on its face: if you want members of Congress to divest from conflicted asset holdings, you have to make it painless—if not enjoyable. In tax terms, apparently, there is nothing more painful than realizing the capital gains on long-held stock. The bill tries to remove that obstacle by offering a tax deferral through a certificate of divestiture, which is already available to certain executive branch officials. Supporters argue that this just levels the playing field—a curious defense. If the problem is public officials profiting from decisions they make in office, then the solution shouldn’t be contingent on making that transition tax-neutral. The financial inconvenience of paying capital gains taxes owed on investments isn’t some kind of constitutional crisis created by demanding a more ethical legislature, it’s a feature of a tax code that applies to everyone else. And since when do we need to incentivize ethics? Lawmakers are public servants, not reluctant volunteers conscripted into duty. If avoiding conflicts of interest is so burdensome, perhaps we’ve misunderstood what it means to serve in public office. If not, why haven’t we extended the same logic to judges or prosecutors? “Your Honor, we would very much like you to recuse yourself in this case—but please allow us to sweeten the deal for you.” This isn’t about fairness, it’s just about comfort. When we start redesigning ethics laws around comfort of the regulated class, we have lost the plot. And that’s when things start to get messy. For instance, it is worth noting that by extending tax deferral through the divestiture certificate process, we have created a perverse incentive where one might run for office just to claim the benefit. Section 1043 of the tax code was designed for executive branch officials entering roles where holding certain assets could create conflicts. Think, for instance, a cabinet member offloading ExxonMobil stock prior to taking over regulating oil markets. The trigger, however, is specific: the divestiture must be mandatory, and ethics related. This bill goes out of its way to unlock the tax break generally for members. This converts pursuit of public office into a viable tax strategy. Imagine a wealthy private equity partner with a $10 million unrealized gain in Meta. What’s cheaper, paying the IRS now or launching a well-funded congressional campaign in a friendly district? Suddenly, the Restore Trust in Congress Act looks more like the Monetize Your Portfolio via Congress Act. We already have enough folks running for office to boost their brand, sell a book, or land a television deal—do we really want to add “defer my capital gains” to the list of socially acceptable motives? Even if no one actually runs for Congress just for a tax break—and let’s be real, someone will—the existence of that incentive speaks volumes. The bill conflates ethics with tax relief and reinforces the idea that lawmakers need a sweet treat to behave ethically. It reduces public trust to a line item on a balance sheet that can be offset by a credit elsewhere. The fundamental question is whether we should be negotiating with members of Congress about the price of not using their office to line their own pockets. Do we really believe stock trading is inherently a conflict of interest? If so, ban it. If not, then stop pretending ethics reform is the goal and just admit this is eyewash. Public services isn’t supposed to be risk-free or profit-maximizing. It is supposed to be a privilege that comes with equal parts restraint. That isn’t punitive; it’s the whole point.

It's a drama that kicked off last week and has now reached a fevered pitch as some of the biggest crypto companies around compete for the highly sought-after USDH ticker—culminating in an on-chain vote by Hyperliquid stakeholders on Sunday. Major companies like Paxos, Sky, and Frax Finance have thrown their hats in the ring alongside Ethena, with backing from a BlackRock executive. And yet, it appears a new and relatively unknown team in Native Markets is the current frontrunner. Hyperliquid is a decentralized exchange, specializing in perpetual futures trading, that lives on its own dedicated layer-1 network by the same. At the time of writing, there’s roughly $5.84 billion in stablecoins on the network—the fifth largest total of all blockchains, per DefiLlama—with USDC accounting for 94.9% of the network’s stablecoins. Over the past 24 hours, it has been responsible for a whopping $1.076 billion in trading volume and has cemented itself as a crucial component in the on-chain economy. With its own stablecoin, Hyperliquid intends to circumvent the biggest players in the space, such as Circle’s USDC and Tether’s USDT, and secure for itself the lucrative yields these stablecoins generate. While no “special privileges” will be granted to the token, per the Hyperliquid Foundation, crypto heavyweights are now vying for the chance to control the USDH ticker. The Foundation has said the eventual stablecoin must be “Hyperliquid-first” and “Hyperliquid-aligned,” with many proposals creating frameworks that feed revenue back into the ecosystem in some way. Whoever eventually launches the USDH stablecoin would likely benefit immensely from the growing Hyperliquid community embracing the token as the stablecoin of the network. Hyperliquid validators, those responsible for securing the network, should state their voting intention by early Sunday, giving time for users to stake to a validator that matches their vote, before the winner of the USDH competition is formally decided that same day. Here are the issuers in contention to launch Hyperliquid’s USDH stablecoin: Founded specifically to “build the best stablecoin” for Hyperliquid, according to its Substack, Native Markets started work “months ago” and informed Hyperliquid Labs of its plans, inquiring about the USDH ticker. It proposes to create a stablecoin that will be GENIUS Act-compliant, referring to the landmark stablecoin legislation in the U.S. that President Donald Trump recently signed into law. It plans for Bridge—a platform acquired by payments giant Stripe in 2024—to manage its reserves. Native Markets says it will contribute half of the yield generated from those reserves towards USDH growth partnerships and the other half to the Assistance Fund, a protocol-driven buy back fund. “We are prepared to launch a community-aligned stablecoin within days,” Native Markets wrote on Substack on Monday. Already, a top Hyperliquid validator called CMI has stepped forward and shown support for the proposal. At the moment, market sentiment is placing Native Markets as the overwhelming favorite to win the bidding for the USDH ticker, though several leading figures in the crypto industry have come forward to suggest the organization has received an unfair advantage. Hyperliquid currently loses >$200m a year to firms who treat it as an afterthought at best. I'm co-founding Native Markets to reclaim this value leakage for the ecosystem and to kickstart Hyperliquid's next chapter. pic.twitter.com/oU6RYXE4E9 — max.hl (@fiege_max) September 8, 2025 Ethena notably entered the race on Tuesday, with backing from the biggest asset manager in the world, BlackRock. Ethena is the issuer of the third-largest stablecoin by market cap, USDE, per CoinGecko, behind only industry giants Tether and Circle. The proposal suggests that Ethena’s USDtb, which is the seventh-largest stablecoin, would back USDH, giving it indirect collateralization from BlackRock’s BUIDL fund—a tokenized money market fund. BlackRock’s head of digital assets, Robert Mitchnick, also provided a statement claiming the token would be “uniquely positioned to offer institutional-grade cash management.” On top of this, Ethena says 95% of revenue generated by its USDH reserves will be given to the Assistance Fund or used to purchase HYPE, the native token of the Hyperliquid network. It also suggests that Ethena would cover all transaction costs associated with making USDH the premier stablecoin for Hyperliquid—for example, the costs involved in denominating trading pairs on Hyperliquid in USDH instead of USDC. Established stablecoin company Paxos—issuer of PAX Gold, Global Dollar, and more—is also very much in the mix. Paxos’ proposal not only claims its token would be GENIUS-compliant but also adhere to global regulations, including Europe’s MiCA. It also proposes fiat onramps via SWIFT, ACH, and wire transfers, as well as plans to enable real-world payments for USDH. Plus, it would look to support Hyperliquid’s token on Paxos’ brokerage platform, which is used by PayPal, Venmo, and more. Finally, 95% of interest, not revenue, from the reserves backing USDH will be used to purchase HYPE and redistribute it to applications and validators. We've spent the last three days listening to the @HyperliquidX community, absorbed every concern and doubled down. V2 of our proposal is simple: @Paxos unlocks Hyperliquid at global scale 🌏 — bhau (@bhau___) September 10, 2025 Ethereum DeFi giant Sky, formerly known as MakerDAO, entered the USDH race on Monday. Sky is the issuer of the fourth-largest stablecoin by market cap, USDS, formerly known as DAI—which remains the largest decentralized stablecoin on the market. Sky’s proposal differs from the pack, suggesting USDH be natively multichain (that is, available on various blockchain networks simultaneously), powered by LayerZero, and flexes its security track record and risk management. Sky also says it will deploy part of its balance sheet into Hyperliquid, start buying HYPE with its profits, and grant a 4.85% return on USDH to the Hyperliquid community. USDH powered by Sky. • 4.85% rewards on all USDH on Hyperliquid• 2.2B USDC in instant redemption liquidity• $8B+ Sky balance sheet ready to deploy• Backed by Sky’s 7-year track record Read the proposal by @RuneKek ↓ https://t.co/WYkbHG9Bbc — Sky (@SkyEcosystem) September 8, 2025 Agora, issuers of AUSD, the 29th largest stablecoin by market cap, have directly called out Native Market’s reliance on Stripe, pointing to “clear conflicts” as Stripe builds out its own Tempo layer-1 network—suggesting that Stripe would rather push users onto Tempo than Hyperliquid. Agora proposes to take full control of the stablecoin issuance itself, boasting VanEck as its asset manager. It says it will share 100% of net revenue with the Assistance Fund or buy back HYPE, and like the rest, promises to be GENIUS-compliant. “We strongly urge caution against the utilization of Stripe (Bridge) as an issuer,” Nick van Eck, co-founder of Agora, wrote. “Running an institutional-grade, liquid stablecoin, at global scale is hard. We strongly urge the community to choose experienced partners that are set up for the long-term success of this initiative.” Proposal: Agora stablecoin infrastructure to power USDH with a coalition of best-in-class providers. IntroductionIf Hyperliquid relinquishes their canonical stablecoin to Stripe, a vertically integrated issuer with clear conflicts, what are we all even doing? Summary-… — Nick van Eck (@Nick_van_Eck) September 7, 2025 A mysterious proposal by Frax Finance suggests a “Frax-led alliance with a federally regulated U.S. bank issuer” to issue USDH. However, due to the short window and the legal implications, the proposal is unable to disclose the issuer’s name. That said, the proposal says that USDH will be backed one-for-one with U.S. treasuries via tokenized funds, will be GENIUS-compliant, and with the entire treasury yield returned to Hyperliquid in some way. There are many more proposals in the USDH hunt from lesser-known entities. One, for example, suggests that the USDH ticker should be burned to foster a true free-market environment. Another, very obviously a joke, is written by someone pretending to be the Hyperliquid co-founder and CEO, Jeff Yan, intentionally misspelling words in the Boden meme style and stating that “chart make zig-zag.” The other, more serious proposals include one from OpenEden, which will cycle 100% of its fees into buying HYPE and distributing it to network validators. To many, USDH mania has been the most exciting that on-chain governance has been in a long time. It all builds up to Sunday’s main event when Hyperliquid validators make their final votes.

But on Wednesday, the company successfully landed on the New York Stock Exchange, having raised $1.4 billion, largely for its existing investors, rather than itself. The fintech giant sold shares at $40, above its announced range of $35 to $37, and came out of the gate with a $15 billion valuation. Shares popped, opening at $52, though quickly settling down to around $46 mid-day. Of the 34.3 million shares Klarna sold, only 5 million were sold by the company, it said. The rest were sold by existing investors like the company’s largest shareholder Sequoia Capital. Entities controlled by Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, Silver Lake, BlackRock, and many others sold as well. Despite cashing out some shares, all of them are holding onto the majority of their stakes. Figma’s IPO did a similar thing. Yet, often these existing investors don’t want to sell at the IPO price, a VC told TechCrunch. They kick in shares to help the company meet IPO demand. Floating more shares helps the company obtain a more accurate, and perhaps higher, valuation out of the gate because it helps the IPO attract the biggest institutional investors who wouldn’t bother with an IPO for a small allocation. In Klarna’s case co-founder CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski did not sell any shares. His stake was worth $1.02 billion at the IPO selling price of $40 and he controls about 7.5% of the company. Victor Jacobsson, the co-founder who left the company in 2012, did sell but was, and still is, a slightly larger shareholder. He cashed out of 1.1 million shares and still retains over 8% of the company. Co-founder Niklas Adalberth still owns just under 3 million shares, Klarna disclosed. Sequoia is by far the biggest investor in Klarna, controlling nearly 23% of the company. Famed VC Michael Moritz wrote Klarna’s first check on Sequoia’s behalf in 2010, and stayed on as Klarna’s chairperson even after he left Sequoia in 2023. Some drama ensued when Sequoia added another member to Klarna’s board. But it eventually sorted itself out when Sequoia’s Andrew Reed joined its board in 2024.“This moment feels surreal,” Siemiatkowski shared in published remarks. “When we started Klarna back in 2005, it was just a wild idea — me, Niklas, and Victor, fumbling around, trying to make shopping and payments smoother for people. We got rejected left and right, laughed at more times than I can count. But we kept going.”He continued, “Going public in New York is huge. It’s not just a milestone; it’s a statement. It’s proof that a bunch of stubborn dreamers from Stockholm can take on the world — and win.” Interestingly, though, $1.4 billion is not the record for the biggest IPO of 2025. That’s still held by CoreWeave, which raised $1.5 billion in June. Correction: This story originally misidentified the nationality of Anders Holch Povlsen. That information has been updated.

Title: Arkham Unveils Crypto Rich List — The Titans Behind $1.6 Trillion
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/arkham-top-100-richest-entities-crypto/
Time Published: 2025-09-10T19:00:33Z
Full Content:
Arkham Intelligence has published a ranked list of the 100 richest crypto entities, aggregating on-chain holdings across known address clusters and valuing them in US dollars. According to Arkham, the combined assets of the top 100 exceed “over $1.6 trillion,” underscoring the scale of capital concentrated in a relatively small set of exchanges, custodians, protocols, corporates and notable individuals. The research note was shared via X on September 9, 2025, with valuations explicitly “correct as of 2nd September 2025.” Arkham emphasizes that it ranks entities, not single wallets. In its words, “An entity represents a collection of crypto addresses confirmed to be controlled by the same individual or institution,” a grouping it argues “offers a far more accurate picture of the true net worth of these crypto whales.” Each roster entry links to the corresponding Arkham Intel page where underlying addresses and asset mixes can be examined. The top tier is dominated by centralized exchanges and large institutional platforms. Binance leads with $209.19 billion, followed by Coinbase at $155.81 billion. The third slot is Arkham’s Satoshi Nakamoto entity at $125.07 billion, reflecting the well-known early-mined BTC cluster Arkham tracks. BlackRock ranks fourth with $100.77 billion, then Lido at $69.86 billion and MicroStrategy at $53.21 billion. Fidelity Custody appears seventh at $47.46 billion, ahead of Grayscale at $34.10 billion, while Korean exchange Upbit holds $32.80 billion and DeFi protocol Aave rounds out the top ten with $31.57 billion. Beyond the top ten, the list illustrates how varied the largest balance-holders have become. Major trading venues and market infrastructure providers such as OKX, Kraken, Bitfinex, and Bybit sit alongside L2s and DeFi treasuries including Arbitrum, Uniswap, Spark, Curve and Maker’s Sky. Government-linked clusters appear as well—the “US Government” sits at rank #20 with $23.42 billion and the “UK Government” at $6.99 billion—reflecting seized or controlled assets identified on-chain. There are also long-tail categories like wrapped assets (e.g., WBTC), staking and restaking protocols (Lido, EigenLayer, Ether.fi), and even high-profile memecoin or launchpad ecosystems such as “Official Trump Meme” and “pump.fun,” each with multibillion-dollar tallies. Notably, Arkham’s framing makes clear this is a live market snapshot rather than a static “rich list.” The methodology multiplies the assets held across an entity’s tagged addresses by market prices on the specified date—September 2, 2025—so rankings can and will shift with price, inflows/outflows, and new address attributions. Arkham also spotlights the scale at the top of the distribution, summarizing on X that “the top 100 entities on Arkham hold a total of over $1.6 trillion in assets,” a figure that contextualizes the influence such entities may exert on liquidity and market structure.

Title: The Protocol: SwissBorg’s SOL Earn Wallet Exploited for $41.5M

This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Welcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. I’m Margaux Nijkerk, a reporter at CoinDesk. In this issue: SWISSBORG’S SOL EARN WALLET EXPLOITED: Crypto exchange SwissBorg said about 192,600 SOL ($41.5 million) was stolen from an external wallet used exclusively for its SOL Earn strategy. The exploit stemmed from a partner's compromised application programming interface (API), a mechanism that allows software systems to communicate with one another, affecting a single counterparty, the exchange said in a post on X. It was not a hack of the SwissBorg platform. The loss affected fewer than 1% of users and represented about 2% of SwissBorg’s total assets, the firm said. All other funds and strategies remain secure, and user balances within the SwissBorg app are unaffected. SOL Earn redemptions are paused while recovery efforts proceed. SwissBorg says it will cover any shortfall, ensuring no user losses. The company is working with white-hat hackers, security firms and law enforcement to recover the funds. A full incident report will follow once investigations conclude. This exploit arrives amid a sharp rise in crypto thefts, with over $2.17 billion already stolen in 2025. — Shaurya Malwa Read more. LEDGER CTO WARNS OF PNM ATTACK: Charles Guillemet, the chief technology officer at hardware wallet maker Ledger, warned on X that a large-scale supply chain attack was underway after a reputable developer’s Node Package Manager (NPM) account was compromised. According to Guillemet, the malicious code — already pushed into packages with over 1 billion downloads — is designed to silently swap crypto wallet addresses in transactions. That means unsuspecting users could send funds directly to the attacker without realizing it. Guillemet did not name the developer whose account he said was compromised. The incident underscores how deeply interconnected open-source software is and why security lapses in developer tools can ripple into the crypto economy almost instantly. A day later, Guillemet shared that almost zero crypto users had been affected by the hack. “NPM is a tool commonly used in software development using JavaScript, which makes integrating packages easy for developers,” said Guillemet in a message to CoinDesk. When an attacker compromises a developer’s account, they can slip malicious code into widely used packages. “The malicious code attempts to drain users by swapping addresses used in transaction or general on-chain activity and replacing them with the hacker’s address,” Guillemet added. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. BACKPACK EU GOES LIVE FOLLOWING FTX EU ACQUISITION: Backpack Exchange, a global cryptocurrency trading platform, said its European division, Backpack EU, is officially live. Operating out of Cyprus and licensed under the European Union’s MiFID II framework, the exchange is positioning itself as one of the first fully regulated venues in Europe to offer crypto derivatives, starting with perpetual futures. “As far as I'm aware, it's just going to be us and Kraken” in Europe offering perpetual futures, Armani Ferrante, the CEO of Backpack, said in an interview with CoinDesk. The debut follows Backpack’s acquisition of FTX EU earlier this year. In January, the FTX bankruptcy estate said the sale of FTX EU to Backpack was not authorized. Since then, the issue has been resolved and in April the exchange began distributing funds to former FTX EU customers, fulfilling their pledge to compensate users affected by the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire. Backpack EU will provide users access to over 40 trading pairs with up to 10x leverage, the team said in a statement. The platform says it aims to give both retail and institutional traders a compliant gateway to advanced crypto trading products. The rollout also highlights Backpack’s broader strategy of rebuilding trust in digital assets following a string of exchange failures. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. POLYGON POS CHAIN EXPERIENCES FINALITY LAG: Polygon’s proof-of-stake chain is live, but transactions are taking longer than usual to lock in, with finality running 10–15 minutes behind schedule. Finality is the assurance that a transaction or piece of data is irreversible once confirmed and added to a block in the blockchain. The foundation said in an X post that a fix has been identified and is being rolled out to validators and service providers. The slowdown was tied to issues on some Bor/Erigon nodes and RPC providers, according to Polygon’s status page. Node restarts resolved the problem for many validators, while others had to rewind to the last finalized block before resyncing, a status page shared. The disruption comes weeks after Polygon’s Heimdall v2 upgrade promised 5-second finality through a modernized consensus stack. – Shaurya Malwa Read more.

September 10, 2025 13:55 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, Sept. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO). Such investors are advised to contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980, (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. The class action concerns whether Novo Nordisk and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices. You have until September 30, 2025 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class if you purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. [Click here for information about joining the class action] On July 29, 2025, Novo Nordisk significantly lowered its sales outlook for 2025. The Company attributed the reduction to “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” On this news, Novo Nordisk’s American Depositary Receipt (“ADR”) price fell $15.06 per ADR, or 21.83%, to close at $53.94 per ADR on July 29, 2025.

Title: Larry Ellison's Rise: How He Snagged the Title of World's Richest Person From Elon Musk

Oracle's transformation into an AI infrastructure powerhouse has catapulted Larry Ellison ahead of Musk to take the title of the world's richest person. The 81-year-old database pioneer's net worth surged by more than $100 billion following the company's earnings report Tuesday, according to calculations published Wednesday by Bloomberg, which called the move "the biggest one-day increase ever recorded" by its Billionaire's Index. Ellison owns about 1.16 billion shares, or about 41% of the company. As of Tuesday's close, those shares were worth around $280 billion. If Oracle's stock price holds near current levels, Ellison's stake in Oracle would propel his net worth to $393 billion, surpassing Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, whose net worth is $385 billion. The staggering wealth increase came after Oracle announced what CEO Safra Catz called an "excellent" quarter, signing four multi-billion-dollar contracts and booking $455 billion in future cloud infrastructure revenue. Oracle's market capitalization spiked to about $950 billion in intraday trading on Wednesday, up more than $270 billion in a single day. Ellison's gains topped Musk's record for single-day rise in net worth—$63 billion in December 2024, according to Bloomberg. Oracle reported quarterly revenue of $14.9 billion, up 12% year-over-year, with cloud infrastructure revenue jumping 55% to $3.3 billion. The company's forward-looking metrics were even more headline-making: Oracle's remaining performance obligations (RPO)—essentially contracts for future revenue—grew to $455 billion in value, an increase of 359% year-over-year. "Clearly, it was an excellent quarter, and demand for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure continues to build," CEO Catz told investors during Tuesday's earnings call. "I expect we will sign additional multi-billion-dollar customers and that RPO will likely grow to exceed $500 billion." The company expects cloud infrastructure revenue to reach $18 billion this fiscal year. Oracle's has transformed itself from a traditional database provider into a critical player providing the infrastructure for AI companies in a desperate race for computing power. "Oracle has become the go-to place for AI workloads," Catz told investors, saying the company had signed contracts with OpenAI; xAI, Elon Musk's AI company; Meta Platforms, Inc. (META); Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD); and others. While Ellison's fortune has grown with Oracle's AI boom, Musk's grip on the world's richest title has been loosening throughout 2025. The Tesla CEO began the year with a net worth of $420 billion, which has since fallen to about $385 billion as Tesla shares have declined by about 14% year-to-date. Tesla has struggled with increasing competition in the electric vehicle market and a softening in demand in key markets worldwide. Musk's wealth, tied primarily to his Tesla stake, has fluctuated wildly with the automaker's volatile stock price. Though it's worth noting that Tesla recently floated a new compensation package for Elon Musk, aimed at retaining him, and it's potentially worth $1 trillion. Ellison's record-breaking surge is part of the story of how AI infrastructure has become the new gold rush in tech, with Oracle positioning itself as the critical picks-and-shovels provider for companies racing to build their AI systems. His $100+ billion single-day gain—driven by Oracle's $455 billion in future cloud contracts—shows that the real money in AI may not be in building chatbots or autonomous vehicles, but in providing the computing backbone these technologies require.

Title: Top Asset Managers Drop Support for Left-Wing Corporate Activism

His work has been published in The Epoch Times, The Federalist, The Daily Signal and The American Conservative. Previously, he worked more than a decade on Wall Street. A decade-long effort to leverage asset managers to impose net-zero and social justice policies on corporations has gone into reverse with reports from this year’s corporate voting season that the most influential fund managers are no longer voting for these policies. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with more than $11 trillion in assets under management, reported that it voted against 98% of the environmental and social shareholder proposals in 2025, up from 96% against in 2024. Vanguard, the world’s second-largest fund manager with more than $10 trillion in assets, did not vote in favor of a single environmental or social proposal. State Street Investment Management, the third largest with more than $5 trillion under management, has not yet released its 2025 proxy voting report. These three fund managers, often called the “Big Three,” together represent about 25% of the votes cast at annual meetings of S&P 500 companies, a 2022 report by Harvard law professor Lucian A. Bebchuk and Boston University law professor Scott Hirst states. The vast majority of U.S. corporate shares are owned by institutional investors such as asset managers, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, banks, and insurance companies. These institutions owned 78% of the companies in the Russell 3000 index and 80% of the companies in the S&P 500 index, according to a 2017 study by Pensions & Investments. When individuals buy into investment funds, the fund typically owns the companies’ shares and the voting rights that come with them. And many fund managers have in turn voted for environmental and social agendas, according to an analysis by Lindsey Stewart, an investment analyst at Morningstar Inc. In 2020, the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative was formed and grew to 330 members, which until recently included the Big Three, pledging to leverage their influence as shareholders to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. As a sign of changing times, however, Vanguard quit the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative in 2022, and BlackRock exited this past January, prompting the club to halt operations soon thereafter. Proxy voting has moved in a similar direction. “The Big Three have indeed effectively ended their support for [environmental, social, and governance] proposals in just a few short years,” Tim Schwarzenberger, portfolio manager for Inspire Investing, told The Daily Signal. “The legal landscape and public perception have shifted quickly, and these major players are now catching up, which is a major victory for common sense,” he said. “Most Americans and shareholders do not want corporations engaged in politics.” In addition, red state attorneys general have recently threatened legal action for alleged violations of antitrust laws, and state treasurers have threatened boycotts of left-wing fund managers. Pressure has also come from conservative shareholders, and this, combined with a Trump administration that opposes climate and social-justice agendas, has taken a toll on corporate activism. “Vanguard and BlackRock have skated where the puck has gone, and should be commended for it,” David Bahnsen, chief investment officer of the Bahnsen Group, said of this year’s proxy votes. “Investors want investment strategies connected to return on their capital—they do not want the intrusion of a poorly-defined social agenda. “That 2019-2022 experiment has ended, and the verdict was clear,” he told The Daily Signal. Some asset managers also faced charges that political goals diverted them from their fiduciary duties to maximize investor returns. Whether or not this was the case, current rhetoric indicates a focus on shareholder value this voting season. In its 2025 proxy voting report, BlackRock stated that many of the environmental and social proposals it rejected “were overreaching, lacked economic merit, or sought outcomes that were unlikely to promote long-term financial value.” Vanguard likewise stated that it rejected proposals that “did not address financially material risks to shareholders.” Conservatives lauded this approach but say they remain vigilant. “Vanguard’s apparent return to sanity and their fiduciary duty to their clients is welcome news,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Daily Signal. “While there are many other ways that asset managers wield influence over corporations, support for extremist, left-wing activist shareholder proposals has been one of the most noxious.” Vanguard’s report referenced the “voluntary withdrawal of proposals by proponents, often following reported engagement with the company.” Conservatives say that in many cases, corporate management settles with activists prior to the vote, in return for having the proposal dropped. Advocates for corporate activism say it is prudent risk management and that companies that pursue climate and social goals will be more profitable. Critics counter that those issues should be left to voters. “Issues of climate policy and social justice should be addressed primarily at the election ballot box, not through corporate activism that is at odds with the values of many Americans,” Schwarzenberger said. “And in truth, most [Environmental, Social, and Governance] risks are already captured in stock prices, so symbolic shareholder votes add little value.” The Daily Signal reached out to BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street for comment. BlackRock provided background information on its proxy voting. Vanguard and State Street did not respond. We publish a variety of perspectives.

Title: Gemini's Raised IPO Range Indicates Strong Demand for New Crypto Stocks

The crypto exchange founded by twin brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss looks poised to be the next hot crypto IPO. Gemini Space Station on Wednesday raised the range at which it expects its initial public offering to $24 to $26; it still plans to offer some 16.7 million shares, indicating a market capitalization over $3 billion at the high end. The boosted price suggests strong demand from investors for the shares and follows a string of successful public debuts that includes industry peers like stablecoin operator Circle (CRCL) and institution-focused digital assets platform Bullish (BLSH). The original range was estimated at $17 to $19 per share. Gemini Space Station is expected to list on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker symbol "GEMI." Earlier this week, Gemini secured a $50 million private investment from another exchange operator, Nasdaq (NDAQ), a regulatory filling shows. Nasdaq agreed to pay a per share price equal to the IPO for Class A stock, less underwriting costs and commissions. The Winklevoss twins, famous for their role in the social media network once called Facebook, now known as Meta (META), are also earmarking a set of shares for retail investors. The company expects as much as 30% of Class A shares will be offered to individual investors via brokerages including Robinhood (HOOD) and SoFi (SOFI). Gemini operates one of the better-known crypto exchanges in the U.S. and also has a credit card business. While its trading volume is a fraction of the much larger Coinbase Global (COIN), the company said tokenization and card payments represent "immense untapped potential" for its future growth.

Title: If the AI Industry Fails, It Could Take the Rest of Us Down With It

Time Published: 2025-09-10T15:12:33Z
Full Content:
Don't let AI critics tell you it's good for nothing: the amount of money being spent on AI infrastructure is so enormous that it’s literally propping up the US economy. The drawback, of course, is that if the AI industry fails, it could drag the rest of the economy down with it. In 2024, the S&P 500 grew by an incredible 24 percent — what the investment firm Charles Schwab understatedly called a "very good year." Since 2023, nearly half the growth was clustered in just a handful of tech stocks known as the "magnificent seven": Meta, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla, and Apple. And as the Atlantic recently noted, the companies most heavily involved in the AI boom have yet to see that success manifest in anywhere except the stock market. Though Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Tesla are expected to have spent some $560 billion on AI development by the beginning of next year, their collective revenue from AI comes in at a paltry $35 billion. In the first half of 2025, the Atlantic notes, business spending on AI added more to GDP growth in the United States than all consumer spending combined. This revenue gap is the key crisis facing the tech industry — and the broader economy — in their quest to build an AI future. Thanks to roundly horrible performance in actual workplace environments, revenue remains illusive for the vast majority of AI deployments. Still, managers across industries are being pressured to show financial gains from the tech, even when the software isn’t delivering. That’s causing companies to do some creative accounting with their staff, laying off workers or slowing down hiring to inflate AI’s numbers. As the Atlantic highlights, this is leading to the very real possibility of a rupture forming in the broader economy, where companies induce rounds of layoffs to satisfy executives, without anything to show for it in the bottom line. In other words, we’re barreling toward a future where unemployment could rise while productivity takes a nosedive — dramatically slowing the economy as a result. That scenario isn’t exactly unprecedented. The computer boom of the 1980s took a similar turn, when early email software prompted executives to lay off secretaries and typists, resulting in specialized white collar workers actually spending more time sending emails than on their typical roles. "Email was one of those technologies that made us feel more productive but actually did the opposite," computer scientist Cal Newport told the Atlantic. "I worry we may be headed down the same path with AI." There’s just one crucial difference: email isn’t propping up half the stock market.

Title: Novo Nordisk Cuts Around 9,000 Jobs as Weight-Loss Drugmaker Faces Growing Competition
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/novo-nordisk-slashes-jobs-as-diabetes-and-weight-loss-competition-increases-11807065
Time Published: 2025-09-10T15:06:50Z
Full Content:
Novo Nordisk (NVO) is making big job cuts as the weight-loss drugmaker faces growing competition. The pharmaceutical firm said it is slashing about 9,000 positions or 11.5% of its workforce. 5,000 of the cuts will be made in its home country of Denmark. The company said the layoffs are part of a “transformation” designed to simplify Novo Nordisk’s organization, speed up decision-making, and shift resources to help grow its diabetes and obesity business medicines. CEO Mike Doustdar said, “our markets are evolving, particularly in obesity, as it has become more competitive and consumer-driven.” He added the company “must evolve as well,” which means instilling “an increased performance-based culture, deploying our resources ever more effectively, and prioritizing investment where it will have the most impact—behind our leading therapy areas.” Novo Nordisk said it expects the headcount drop will result in annualized savings of about 8 billion Danish Krone ($1.25 billion) by the end of 2026. However, it also anticipates the cuts will result in a restructuring cost of 8 billion Danish Krone this year, and is now projecting operating profit will grow 4% to 10%, down from a forecast of 10% to 16% previously. U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk were up about 2% in recent trading. They've lost about a third of their value this year, as rivals such as Eli Lilly (LLY) have expanded their market share in diabetes and weight-loss treatments.

Title: JPMorgan Chase’s Profit Engine That Remains Undervalued
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/10/jpmorgan-chases-profit-engine-that-remains-undervalued/

ByDavid Trainer, Contributor. Markets surged to fresh record highs recently on the back of July’s consumer inflation reading. The data increased expectations for a rate cut at the Federal Reserve’s September meeting. Trade sentiment also improved after President Trump extended the U.S.–China tariff truce for an additional 90 days. While the tone in markets this week has been broadly optimistic, valuations remain elevated. The S&P 500 trades at valuation levels not seen since the dot-com crash. Identifying stocks that combine strong fundamentals with cheap valuations should remain a priority for diligent investors. My firm’s AI Agent is designed to screen for such opportunities by leveraging proven-superior data to produce more precise, transparent, and reliable signals. The outperformance of the “Very Attractive Stocks Index”, which holds the stocks in the Bloomberg 1000 Index that get a Very Attractive Rating, is proof of the alpha the AI Agent produces in the market. My Long Idea this week highlights a company with industry leading-profitability, revenue growth across all business segments, record profits, and a cheap stock price. I originally made JPMorgan Chase (JPM: $293/share) a Long Idea in May 2020 and most recently reiterated my position on the stock in November 2024. JPMorgan Chase recently beat both top- and bottom-line estimates in 2Q25, and now that the company has filed its latest 10-Q, I find that the stock still presents Very Attractive risk/reward. JPMorgan Chase reported strong results across its business in 2Q25. The company’s firmwide average loans and deposits were up 5% and 6% year-over-year (YoY), respectively. More specifically, JPMorgan Chase reported quality growth across all three business segments, including: These results continue a trend of long-term fundamental strength for the largest bank in the United States. JPMorgan Chase’s revenue composition reflects a strategically balanced model, with total net revenue split nearly evenly between net interest income (NII) and noninterest revenue (NIR). This diversification mitigates earnings volatility tied to interest rate fluctuations and reinforces the firm’s resilience across market cycles. Notably, JPMorgan Chase has demonstrated consistent growth in both revenue streams over the past decade. The company grew NII from $43.6 billion in 2014 to $93.2 billion in the TTM ended 2Q25, which represents compound annual growth of 7%. JPMorgan Chase grew its NIR from $50.6 billion to $82.4 billion over the same time, or 5% compounded annually. See Figure 1. Figure 1: JPMorgan Chase’s NII and NIR: 2014 – TTM JPMorgan Chase leverages its diversified business model to continually grow its top- and bottom-line. JPMorgan Chase has grown revenue and net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) by 10% and 11% compounded annually since 2014. See Figure 2. In each of the past three fiscal years, and the TTM ended 2Q25, the company’s NOPAT reached record highs. The company improved its NOPAT margin from 21% in 2014 to 23% in the TTM while invested capital turns rose from 0.4 to 0.7 over the same time. Rising NOPAT margins and invested capital turns drive the company’s return on invested capital (ROIC) from 8% in 2014 to 16% in the TTM ended 2Q25. Additionally, the company’s Core Earnings, a superior and cleaner earnings measure, grew 10% compounded annually from $22.2 billion in 2014 to $60.6 billion in the TTM. Figure 2: JPMorgan Chase’s Revenue and NOPAT Since 2014 JPMorgan Chase has not only grown revenue and profits to record levels, but it has done so while maintaining industry leading margins and ROIC. As I mentioned earlier in the report, the company has improved both its operational efficiency (NOPAT margin) and its balance sheet efficiency (invested capital turns) over the last decade. Per Figure 3, JPMorgan Chase has the highest NOPAT margin and ROIC among peers which include, Goldman Sachs (GS), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America (BAC), and Wells Fargo (WFC). Figure 3: JPMorgan Chase’s Profitability Vs. Peers: TTM Due to its superior capitalization, JPMorgan Chase maintains a stronger financial position than its peers, too. At the end of 2Q25, JPMorgan Chase’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio (CET1), the equity portion of its Tier 1 Capital, was 15.1%, which is up from 12.4% at the of 2019 and 10.2% in 2014. Importantly, JPMorgan Chase’s CET1 ratio is well above the 4.5% minimum required by the Federal Reserve. Additionally, the company’s Tier 1 Capital ratio, which measures a bank’s core equity capital to its total risk-weighted assets is 16.1% through the 2Q25, which is up from 14.1% in 2019 and 11.6% in 2014. Once again, JPMorgan Chase’s Tier 1 Capital ratio is well above the 6.0% minimum required by the Federal Reserve. JPMorgan Chase’s Tier 1 Capital and CET 1 ratios have been trending higher for over a decade. See Figure 4. Figure 4: Tier 1 Capital and Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratios: 2010 – 2Q25 Per Figure 5, JPMorgan Chase’s CET1 ratio ranks above big bank peers mentioned earlier in the report. The company’s Tier 1 Capital ratio is higher than all listed peers except Morgan Stanley (MS). Figure 5: JPMorgan Chase’s Capital Ratios Vs. Peers – 2Q25 JPMorgan Chase has paid $87.7 billion (11% of market cap) in dividends since 2019 and increased its quarterly dividend from $0.80/share in 2Q19 to $1.40/share in 2Q25. The company’s current dividend, when annualized, provides a 1.9% yield. JPMorgan Chase also returns capital to shareholders through share repurchases. Since 2019, JPMorgan Chase repurchased $95.9 billion (12% of market cap) shares. During the first six months of 2025, the company repurchased $15.1 billion shares. In July 2025, JPMorgan Chase’s Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program of $50 billion. Should the company repurchase shares at the TTM pace, it would repurchase $25.7 billion of shares over the next 12 months, which is 3.2% of the company’s current market cap. When combined, the dividend and share repurchase yield could reach 5.1%. Investors should take comfort in knowing JPMorgan Chase will be able to afford to pay its dividends and repurchase shares due to its large free cash flow (FCF) generation. From 2019 through 1H25, JPMorgan Chase generated $201.2 billion in FCF, which equals 25% of the company’s enterprise value. Figure 6: JPMorgan Chase’s Cumulative Free Cash Flow: 2019 – 1H25 JPMorgan Chase’s $201.2 billion in FCF since 2019 is more than enough to cover its $183.6 billion in combined dividend payments ($87.7 billion) and share repurchases ($95.9 billion). JPMorgan Chase’s repurchases have also meaningfully reduced its shares outstanding from 3.1 billion in 2019 to 2.7 billion in 2Q25. See Figure 7. I like companies that choose to return capital to shareholders instead of spending it on costly acquisitions or executive bonuses that rarely drive shareholder value creation. Companies that sport strong enough cash flows to consistently lower their shares outstanding offer excellent value. Figure 7: JPMorgan Chase’s Shares Outstanding: 2019 – 2Q25 Expectations for a rate cut in September are on the rise, in part due to the latest CPI data and comments from Fed officials. Fed governor Bowman aims for three interest rate cuts in the remainder of 2025. An interest rate cut would put pressure on all banks’, JPMorgan Chase included, net interest margin (NIM) and in turn their NII. In its 2Q25 10-Q, JPMorgan Chase disclosed its earnings-at-risk sensitivity depending on different movement in rates. In this analysis, JPMorgan Chase determined that a 100-basis point interest rate decline results in a $2 billion decrease in earnings. Similarly, a 200-basis point interest rate decline results in a nearly $5 billion decrease in earnings. The good news? This exposure to lower rates is down from the company’s sensitivity in December 2024, which coincides with rising expectations for a rate cut. JPMorgan Chase maintains the best capital ratios in the industry and is best positioned to grow noninterest revenue throughout all cycles. Additionally, any pressure on profits is already more than priced into JPMorgan Chase’s current stock price, as I’ll show below. At its current price of $293/share, JPMorgan Chase has a price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio of 1.0. This ratio means the market expects the company’s profits to never grow from TTM ended 2Q25 levels. For reference, JPMorgan Chase has grown NOPAT 11% compounded annually over the last five, ten, and 26 (longest period in my model) years. Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to quantify the cash flow expectations for different stock price scenarios for JPM. In the first scenario, I quantify the expectations baked into the current price. If I assume: the stock would be worth $293/share today – equal to the current stock price. In this scenario, JPMorgan Chase’s NOPAT would grow just 2% compounded annually from 2025 – 2034, which is well below the company’s historical NOPAT growth rates. If I instead assume: the stock would be worth $377/share today – a 29% upside to the current price. In this scenario, JPMorgan Chase’s NOPAT would grow 5% compounded annually through fiscal 2034, which would still be below the company’s NOPAT compound annual growth rates over the past 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year periods. Should NOPAT grow closer to historical rates, the upside would be even larger. Figure 8 compares JPMorgan Chase’s historical NOPAT to the NOPAT implied in each of the above scenarios.

Per Figure 3, JPMorgan Chase has the highest NOPAT margin and ROIC among peers which include, Goldman Sachs (GS), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America (BAC), and Wells Fargo (WFC). Figure 3: JPMorgan Chase’s Profitability Vs. Peers: TTM Due to its superior capitalization, JPMorgan Chase maintains a stronger financial position than its peers, too. At the end of 2Q25, JPMorgan Chase’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio (CET1), the equity portion of its Tier 1 Capital, was 15.1%, which is up from 12.4% at the of 2019 and 10.2% in 2014. Importantly, JPMorgan Chase’s CET1 ratio is well above the 4.5% minimum required by the Federal Reserve. Additionally, the company’s Tier 1 Capital ratio, which measures a bank’s core equity capital to its total risk-weighted assets is 16.1% through the 2Q25, which is up from 14.1% in 2019 and 11.6% in 2014. Once again, JPMorgan Chase’s Tier 1 Capital ratio is well above the 6.0% minimum required by the Federal Reserve. JPMorgan Chase’s Tier 1 Capital and CET 1 ratios have been trending higher for over a decade. See Figure 4. Figure 4: Tier 1 Capital and Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratios: 2010 – 2Q25 Per Figure 5, JPMorgan Chase’s CET1 ratio ranks above big bank peers mentioned earlier in the report. The company’s Tier 1 Capital ratio is higher than all listed peers except Morgan Stanley (MS). Figure 5: JPMorgan Chase’s Capital Ratios Vs. Peers – 2Q25 JPMorgan Chase has paid $87.7 billion (11% of market cap) in dividends since 2019 and increased its quarterly dividend from $0.80/share in 2Q19 to $1.40/share in 2Q25. The company’s current dividend, when annualized, provides a 1.9% yield. JPMorgan Chase also returns capital to shareholders through share repurchases. Since 2019, JPMorgan Chase repurchased $95.9 billion (12% of market cap) shares. During the first six months of 2025, the company repurchased $15.1 billion shares. In July 2025, JPMorgan Chase’s Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program of $50 billion. Should the company repurchase shares at the TTM pace, it would repurchase $25.7 billion of shares over the next 12 months, which is 3.2% of the company’s current market cap. When combined, the dividend and share repurchase yield could reach 5.1%. Investors should take comfort in knowing JPMorgan Chase will be able to afford to pay its dividends and repurchase shares due to its large free cash flow (FCF) generation. From 2019 through 1H25, JPMorgan Chase generated $201.2 billion in FCF, which equals 25% of the company’s enterprise value. Figure 6: JPMorgan Chase’s Cumulative Free Cash Flow: 2019 – 1H25 JPMorgan Chase’s $201.2 billion in FCF since 2019 is more than enough to cover its $183.6 billion in combined dividend payments ($87.7 billion) and share repurchases ($95.9 billion). JPMorgan Chase’s repurchases have also meaningfully reduced its shares outstanding from 3.1 billion in 2019 to 2.7 billion in 2Q25. See Figure 7. I like companies that choose to return capital to shareholders instead of spending it on costly acquisitions or executive bonuses that rarely drive shareholder value creation. Companies that sport strong enough cash flows to consistently lower their shares outstanding offer excellent value. Figure 7: JPMorgan Chase’s Shares Outstanding: 2019 – 2Q25 Expectations for a rate cut in September are on the rise, in part due to the latest CPI data and comments from Fed officials. Fed governor Bowman aims for three interest rate cuts in the remainder of 2025. An interest rate cut would put pressure on all banks’, JPMorgan Chase included, net interest margin (NIM) and in turn their NII. In its 2Q25 10-Q, JPMorgan Chase disclosed its earnings-at-risk sensitivity depending on different movement in rates. In this analysis, JPMorgan Chase determined that a 100-basis point interest rate decline results in a $2 billion decrease in earnings. Similarly, a 200-basis point interest rate decline results in a nearly $5 billion decrease in earnings. The good news? This exposure to lower rates is down from the company’s sensitivity in December 2024, which coincides with rising expectations for a rate cut. JPMorgan Chase maintains the best capital ratios in the industry and is best positioned to grow noninterest revenue throughout all cycles. Additionally, any pressure on profits is already more than priced into JPMorgan Chase’s current stock price, as I’ll show below. At its current price of $293/share, JPMorgan Chase has a price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio of 1.0. This ratio means the market expects the company’s profits to never grow from TTM ended 2Q25 levels. For reference, JPMorgan Chase has grown NOPAT 11% compounded annually over the last five, ten, and 26 (longest period in my model) years. Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to quantify the cash flow expectations for different stock price scenarios for JPM. In the first scenario, I quantify the expectations baked into the current price. If I assume: the stock would be worth $293/share today – equal to the current stock price. In this scenario, JPMorgan Chase’s NOPAT would grow just 2% compounded annually from 2025 – 2034, which is well below the company’s historical NOPAT growth rates. If I instead assume: the stock would be worth $377/share today – a 29% upside to the current price. In this scenario, JPMorgan Chase’s NOPAT would grow 5% compounded annually through fiscal 2034, which would still be below the company’s NOPAT compound annual growth rates over the past 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year periods. Should NOPAT grow closer to historical rates, the upside would be even larger. Figure 8 compares JPMorgan Chase’s historical NOPAT to the NOPAT implied in each of the above scenarios.

Title: Klarna employees roast its return-to-office plan with emojis as IPO hits the market

Klarna may be celebrating its IPO and $15 billion valuation, but employees seem focused on another matter: return-to-office plans. Klarna informed employees last week that it's set to roll out a return-to-office policy later this month, citing the need to retain top talent that might otherwise leave for companies prioritizing in-person work, as Business Insider exclusively reported. Staff have reacted to the announcement with a wide range of emoji responses, according to a Slack post shared in a channel with roughly 3,000 workers and seen by Business Insider. Comments on the post were disabled, so employees expressed their reactions solely through emojis, which appear to signal strong disapproval of the plans. The responses were varied and, at times, humorous: 341 employees reacted with a sad face emoji, 167 used an emoji reading "no," 149 chose a sweat-faced sad emoji. Additional responses included 41 "this sucks" emojis, and 43 using an emoji based on the viral "Hide the Pain Harold" meme. A small proportion appeared to signal approval of the plans, including 19 thumbs-up emojis and 14 rocket ship emojis. Other popular reactions included 131 sad cat emojis, 90 facepalm emojis, 86 crying emojis, and 73 clown face emojis. Some employees went for more whimsical options: 62 selected the "Homer Simpson backing into a bush" emoji, and 17 used a child going down a slide saying "bye" emoji. Klarna declined to comment. Other tech companies, including Amazon, Dell, and Meta, have implemented RTO policies in recent years. The Swedish fintech said on Tuesday that it set its IPO price at $40 a share as it begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. Samuel Kerr, head of equity capital markets at Mergermarket, said the IPO's pricing is a "tremendous" result for Klarna and its shareholders. He said that all eyes would be on Klarna once trading begins, given the early volatility around recent IPOs. Investors, he said, will closely scrutinize the company's financials, particularly in light of recent losses. Klarna has seen double-digit growth in its users and gross merchandise value, but achieving profitability continues to be a challenge. Losses for the quarter ended June 30 surged to $52 million, up from $7 million a year earlier, even as revenue climbed to $823 million from $682 million. "That scrutiny and Klarna's answers on its evolution and growth could be the determiner of IPO success, as it's hard to draw too much of a parallel between broader fintech listings," Kerr said. In an F-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, Klarna disclosed that it has partnered with and paid over $16 million to climate impact nonprofits founded by the wife of its CEO over the past five years.Have a tip?

Title: Apple's new ultra-thin iPhone has some people excited, but Wall Street doesn't seem convinced

Time Published: 2025-09-10T13:41:05Z
Full Content:
Hiya! Got a ton of boring meetings on the docket today? A former Google and Stripe executive has some tips for keeping people engaged. (Hint: Do some prep work.) In today's big story, it was the biggest day of the year for Apple. We break down all the major product announcements and make the case for why the iPhone Air is actually pretty cool. What's on deck: Markets: The stock market is turning into a ticking time bomb, and the growing mountain of rough economic data is the trigger. Tech: It's back to the office for Microsoft workers. And the AI team isn't getting a pass. Business: A first-hand account of buying an apartment in NYC as a Gen Zer. (Yes, it's possible!) But first, Air Apple. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. It's an iPhone, just make it thinner. The star of Apple's big, annual product reveal was the iPhone Air, a slimmed-down version of the popular smartphone. At a whopping 5.6 millimeters — that's less than a quarter-inch for metric system haters — Apple said the iPhone Air is thin enough to fit on a fingertip. The iPhone Air's smaller size comes with a few sacrifices. Its camera, internal chip, and battery are all a bit of a step down from its bigger siblings. And at $999, it's more than a base model iPhone, making it no bargain. However, Apple says it's making the most of its size, calling it "the most power-efficient iPhone we've ever made" and touting its durability. It might not be the groundbreaking announcement you were hoping for, but iPhone launches rarely are these days. A slightly improved camera here. A moderately better chip there. That's part of the reason why iPhone users hold onto their phones for a lot longer than Apple would like. Apple's big AI push last year was meant to encourage users to finally upgrade their phones, but Apple Intelligence mostly fell flat. So, if you can't attract them with the software, pitch them on the hardware! And the iPhone Air, if nothing else, is pretty impressive to look at. It also appears to have at least one convert. BI's Katie Notopoulos is very excited about the iPhone Air. She explained why the slimmed-down iPhone is exactly what she's been looking for. Still, arguably the toughest and most important critic wasn't impressed. Apple's stock finished the day down almost 1.5%. It wasn't just about the iPhone Air. BI's Sarah Jackson broke down all the big product announcements from Apple. Here are some of the highlights: The other iPhones: The iPhone 17 Pro's camera is comparable to eight professional lenses. It'll cost you at least $1,099, which is $100 more than the iPhone 16 Pro's starting price, but it has more storage (256 GB instead of 128 GB). If you're really trying to ball out, the iPhone 17 Pro Max starts at $1,199. Meanwhile, the entry-level iPhone 17 price of $799 is the same as last year. AirPods Pro 3: The big news here is a heart rate sensor for the gym bros/gals. That could serve as a bridge into more health-related products from Apple. There's also a Live Translation feature powered by Apple Intelligence. The new buds start at $249. Apple Watch: The biggest upgrades are battery life, a scratch-resistant screen, and a better display. The Ultra 3 ($799) can last up to 42 hours on a full charge, while the Series 11 ($399) and SE 3 ($249) will last 24 and 18 hours, respectively. 1. The labor market is a lot cooler than we thought — and not in a good way. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 911,000 fewer non-farm jobs were added from April 2024 to March 2025 than previously reported. Most major industry sectors, including leisure and hospitality, saw large downward revisions. 2. How long can stock investors keep ignoring bad economic data? The latest revision to the labor market (see above) wasn't good, and inflation is still a concern. Yet the stock market is already fully valued, and major indexes are sitting at record highs. Once investors flip their stance on the economic data, watch out, BI's Joe Ciolli writes. 3. Citi poaches a longtime IBM executive to pursue its AI ambitions. Shobhit Varshney, the firm's new head of AI, will report to Citi's chief operating officer and work closely with its chief technology officer, according to a memo sent to staff and seen by BI. About 175,000 employees already have access to Citi's AI tools. 1. One of Big Tech's last RTO holdouts is calling workers back to the office. Microsoft employees will be required to go in three days a week, according to an internal email sent to staff and seen by BI. The mandate will happen in three phases, starting at the end of February 2026. And if you're one of Microsoft's AI stars, the RTO guidelines are even stricter. 2. One step closer to mind control? The Pentagon just partnered with Phantom Neuro, a startup that wants to let users control prosthetic limbs with muscle memory. The startup received roughly $300,000 from the DOD's emerging tech group and raised $19 million Series A in April. 3. Verily is restructuring in anticipation of new investors. In a recent town hall meeting, CEO Stephen Gillett told staff that Verily is transforming to a C-corp business structure as it seeks a fresh round of investment. Employees were also told their stock was being revalued, dropping around 80% compared to their 2024 value, according to internal documents viewed by BI. 1. It's giving homeowner. BI reporter and "geriatric Gen Zer" Juliana Kaplan recently bought an apartment in New York City at 28 years old. With a little bit of smart saving and luck, here's how she did it. 2. Whoop's CEO believes in work-life harmony, not work-life balance. The difference is flexibility, the fitness-tech CEO explained in the latest installment of BI's Power Hours. He shared his daily routine, from early morning workouts to cold plunges and meditation. 3. Four-day RTO vs. eight weeks of severance. That's the balance some NBCUniversal employees are weighing in the wake of a return-to-office order set to begin January 5. Unusually, the offer isn't based on employee tenure — everyone gets eight weeks regardless of how long they've been there. Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom’s stock surged 13% over the past week, following strong earnings, optimistic guidance, and a significant new order for $10 billion in custom AI chips. The key question for investors now is whether the stock is a buy at its current price of $360. We believe there is not much to fear in AVGO stock, given its overall very strong operating performance and financial condition. Therefore, despite its very high valuation, the stock appears attractive. Here is our multi-factor assessment. Separately, also look at our take on potential 2x upside for AVGO stock. Still, no matter how attractive, investing in a single stock carries high risk. Trefis High Quality Portfolio is designed to reduce stock-specific risk while giving upside exposure. Let's get into details of each of the assessed factors, but before that, a quick background: With $1.6 Tril in market cap, Broadcom provides semiconductor devices and software solutions, including set-top box system-on-chips, cable, DSL, and passive optical networking products across semiconductor and infrastructure software segments. This table highlights how AVGO is valued vs the broader market. For more details, see: AVGO Valuation Ratios This table highlights how AVGO is growing vs the broader market. For more details see: AVGO Revenue Comparison This table highlights how AVGO’s profitability compares with the broader market. For more details, see: AVGO Operating Income Comparison AVGO saw an impact slightly better than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We assess this based on both (a) how much the stock fell and (b) how quickly it recovered. But the risk is not limited to major market crashes. Stocks fall even when markets are good—think events like earnings, business updates, or outlook changes. Read AVGO Dip Buyer Analyses to see how the stock has recovered from sharp dips in the past. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 - S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index—less of a roller-coaster ride—as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Rigetti Computing: How RGTI Stock Falls To $2?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/10/rigetti-computing-how-rgti-stock-falls-to-2/
Time Published: 2025-09-10T13:25:00Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Rigetti Computing's stock has soared 2,000% over the past year. Why? It’s been a perfect storm of catalysts. There’s been intense hype around quantum computing and significant capital flowing into the space, which energized investor sentiment. Add the massive AI boom, and many market participants began grouping quantum names like Rigetti into that broader narrative. With only a handful of publicly traded quantum companies, RGTI became a scarce—and therefore hot—stock to own. On top of that, large institutional investors started building positions, lending further credibility. The result was powerful momentum, with retail investors piling in for fear of missing out and pushing the price even higher. Here’s the catch: quantum may be the future, but widespread commercial adoption is still years away. Today’s use cases are limited, with most work concentrated on simulating chemistry and physics. Look at RGTI's fundamentals: We agree, quantum stocks hinge on future growth—and we’ve already explored the upside potential. But have you weighed the downside risks? We cover them below. That said, if you want upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – Oracle Stock To $900. Markets don’t trend in one direction forever—as we’ve seen recently—and quantum computing remains years from broad commercialization. There are several risks that could derail Rigetti’s growth narrative. When sentiment sours, speculative stocks don’t just dip—they get hammered. This isn’t theoretical. In 2022, high inflation spurred rate hikes, and the market fell roughly 25% from its peak. Do you know how much RGTI sank? It was a whopping 96% decline from $9 to $0.40. What could trigger the next collapse? What’s the realistic downside for RGTI from around $16? If history rhymes, it’s under $2. Are you ready for that? The 2022 slide wiped out 96% of RGTI’s value. Even a “moderate” 75–80% correction implies $3–4. Given the speculative setup and weak fundamentals, a return to sub-$2 isn’t just possible—it has precedent. This analysis isn’t bearish for its own sake; it’s about recognizing risk. The probability may be uncertain, but the magnitude is high, and anyone holding RGTI should be prepared for potentially severe drawdowns. For investors seeking growth exposure without the extreme swings of speculative single names, consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000 indices) to deliver strong returns. Why? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks adapts to strong markets while limiting downside when conditions deteriorate, as shown in the RV Portfolio performance metrics. Remember: in speculative growth stocks, the same momentum that fuels spectacular gains can drive equally spectacular losses. The question isn’t whether RGTI will be volatile—it’s whether you can withstand what the downside might look like.

Title: Consumer Gasoline Costs Lowest In 20 Years: EIA
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2025/09/10/consumer-gasoline-costs-lowest-in-20-years-eia/
Time Published: 2025-09-10T13:19:21Z
Full Content:
ByDavid Blackmon, Senior Contributor. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports in its September Short Term Energy Outlook that this year’s cost of gasoline for U.S. drivers is the lowest since at least 2005 as a share of disposable income. That bit of good news for consumers and the Trump White House is but one of a wealth of interesting data points contained in this latest EIA report. As is pretty much always the case, this year’s drop in the price for gas at the pump has trended in step with a similar downturn in crude oil prices. After reaching a January high of almost $79 per barrel, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) index price has dropped by over 20% to its current level of roughly $63/bbl. Wholesale gas prices have shown a similar drop from an early February peak of about $2.38 per gallon, falling to $1.99/gallon as of this writing. Diesel fuel prices have followed a similar path since January. That’s another bit of positive news for consumer prices since basically all food, clothing and other consumer goods are transported from factories to market via ships, planes, trucks, and trains which run on some variant of Diesel fuel. More good consumer news comes in the EIA’s projection that further reductions in energy prices remain ahead in the months to come. “We expect the Brent crude oil price will decline significantly in the coming months, falling from $68 per barrel (b) in August to $59/b on average in the fourth quarter of 2025 (4Q25) and around $50/b in early 2026,” EIA analysts say, predicting another 25% drop in crude prices from current levels. That magnitude of additional price reductions would be supportive of President Donald Trump’s recent statement that he expects gas prices to fall into the $2/gallon range in the coming months. While the current national average retail price for regular gasoline is $3.19 according to AAA, that is inflated by much higher prices in high tax states like California, Oregon, and Illinois. Gas prices are closer to $2.70 in low price states like Texas, Louisiana, and Alabama. While low oil prices are never good news for oil-focused drilling companies, EIA says there is good news on the horizon for upstream companies looking to produce more natural gas. “We expect the Henry Hub natural gas spot price will rise from an average of $2.91 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in August to $3.70/MMBtu in 4Q25 and $4.30/MMBtu next year,” EIA analysts say, a rosy price projection that has been pretty rare across the last 16 years. Natural gas prices in the U.S. have for the most part been range-bound between $2/MMBtu and $4/MMBtu since 2009. The lone fairly long-term exception to that paradigm came in the post-COVD world in 2022-early 2023, when chronic supply chain and work force issues caused a temporary supply shortage. Otherwise, the sheer magnitude of America’s natural gas resource has enabled drillers to quickly overwhelm temporary spikes in prices by activating a number of additional drillings and driving prices back down with higher production volumes. With just 110-120 active rigs currently targeting natural gas formations, it is a safe bet that upstream companies would quickly create a similar supply response should domestic gas prices run back up past the $4/MMBtu level as EIA projects. Anticipating this enduring reality, EIA analysts say they “expect drilling activity in the United States to be more centered in natural gas-intensive producing regions in 2026.” These and other data points contained in this EIA report are consistent with the Trump White House’s goal of cutting energy costs to consumers as a major element in reducing the rate of inflation. At the same time, however, the daily news is becoming increasingly cluttered with reports of layoffs taking place in the oil and gas industry and major service companies which deliver another leg of Trump’s agenda: That of American Energy Dominance. As I pointed out here shortly after last November’s elections, it was never likely that this second Trump presidency would become a replay of the “drill, baby, drill” boom that took place during his first term in office from 2017-2021. The maturity in the development of the big U.S. shale plays, combined with strategies by the bigger corporate drillers to focus more capital resources on increased dividends and stock buyback programs would eliminate that possibility. Good news for U.S. gasoline consumers almost always means bad news for oil and gas producers. What this latest EIA Outlook illustrates as much as anything else is that inherent tension in these two major facets of the Trump energy agenda remains alive and well.

Title: S&P 500 To Crash 40%?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/10/sp-500-to-crash-40/
Time Published: 2025-09-10T13:15:33Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Inflation numbers are scheduled for release on Thursday, September 11, 2025. We are concerned. Why? Back in 2022, surging prices forced the Federal Reserve into aggressive rate-hiking mode, sending the S&P 500 tumbling 25%. High flyers like Amazon lost more than 50%. Correct, $100 turning into $50 in Amazon stock. This recent history reminds us just how brutally inflation spikes can demolish market confidence. The scary part? Current market conditions mirror some of the warning signs we saw before that 2022 crash, only this time the underlying economic pressures might be even more baked in. The point is, if inflation continues its upward trend, similar to what we’ve seen in recent months, it will likely prevent Jerome Powell’s Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates. When that reality hits, equity markets – especially the S&P 500 – could get hammered. And if the "sticky inflation" narrative really takes root? We could see some truly violent market reactions. Persistent, sticky inflation is what scares us. Clearly, the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and the Fed view persistent, “sticky” inflation as a massive threat – and rightly so. The concern is rooted in historical precedent; look at the period from 1972 to 1974, when similar inflationary pressures contributed to an almost 50% drop in the S&P 500. In the current environment, AI, job cuts, and unemployment are top of every investor’s mind – add high inflation pressures – not 3-4%, but 7% or more, like we saw in 2022, and the Fed has no choice but to fight inflation hard with rapid and large increases. The Federal Reserve faces an additional complication not present in previous cycles: the sheer size of government debt means aggressive rate hikes could trigger a sovereign debt crisis alongside inflation concerns. This puts Powell in an impossible position – fight inflation aggressively and risk financial system stability, or remain accommodative and lose credibility on the Fed’s inflation mandate. The current inflationary environment stems from three forces – tariffs, immigration, and taxes – that have created an uncomfortable environment for the S&P 500: When you combine these three factors, it becomes more likely than not that prices will rise, creating persistent inflationary pressure. For context on how severe market downturns can become, our dashboard – How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash – captures how key stocks fared during and after the last seven market crashes, providing insight into potential recession scenarios. In such environments, positioning your portfolio is key – market timing is tricky – the High Quality (HQ) portfolio has outperformed its benchmark – a combination of S&P 500, midcap, and Russell, with >91% cumulative return since inception, and many investors choose to add downside protection to HQ. The point is simple – performance with preservation – as evident in HQ performance metrics. The fundamental reason inflation hurts equity valuations is straightforward. The value of growth assets, especially equities, is derived primarily from future cash flows that are expected to grow significantly over time. For example, cash flows for companies like Microsoft or Amazon are projected to grow by two to three times, or even more, in the next three to five years. However, if inflation remains high and the Fed maintains or even raises interest rates to combat it, those future cash flows will be discounted at a higher rate, making them worth less in today’s terms. High rates mean a dollar tomorrow is worth even less. What else? Higher interest rates attract capital away from growth-oriented and riskier assets, redirecting it toward safer investments that offer a steady yield – that 5% yield on your savings account starts looking pretty good when the markets drop 10% in a week – right? For the S&P 500, this means money flows out of stocks and into bonds, creating downward pressure on valuations. There’s more! You’ve got these automated trading systems that are programmed to react to bad news. If inflation data comes out hotter than expected, they’ll all start selling at the same time, which can trigger a flash crash. Then, there are a lot of people who just recently started investing and haven't been through a real bear market. They might get spooked and panic-sell right when things are at their worst. Finally, because many people have been using borrowed money to invest in everything from stocks to crypto, we could see a ton of forced liquidations. This could create a domino effect, sending prices tumbling across the board. See – S&P 500 Index To Crash 8%? – for the index’s performance post-Fed’s disappointments in the recent past. Many economists continue to view inflation as a significant risk to S&P 500 valuations. The risks are mounting, and the S&P 500 is vulnerable. If the inflation remains “sticky,” fundamentals won’t matter much to the investors. In fact, fundamentals take a back seat when investors get spooked by the outlook, and even great stocks can take a beating. To reduce stock-specific risk while getting exposure to upside, you could explore the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large, mid, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics. The S&P 500 is currently at a critical juncture. If Thursday’s inflation data confirms that price pressures are persistent, the market could face significant headwinds. The combination of policy-driven inflationary forces creates a perfect storm that could derail the bull market we have grown accustomed to.

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Oracle's stock surged significantly, driven by an extremely bullish long-term forecast for its cloud infrastructure, particularly in AI, despite missing recent quarterly earnings.The company projects massive cloud revenue growth, from $18 billion in FY2026 to $144 billion by FY2030, securing major AI contracts and leveraging its database advantage for AI inference.However, risks include substantial capital expenditure, fierce competition, and the potential for reduced AI investment if businesses don't see sufficient economic returns or during an economic downturn. Oracle shares have soared 94% since the beginning of 2025 – with a more than half of that gain coming in pre-market trading today. That huge gain took place after the Austin-based tech company announced results for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2026 that fell short of expectations. What sent Oracle stock soaring another 49 percentage points was the company’s outlook for the future of its cloud infrastructure business, according to CNBC. Will Oracle stock keep rising? The answer depends on whether Oracle can begin to beat investor expectations and raise guidance in future quarters. I think there is more upside to the stock for two reasons: However, over the longer-term, Oracle stock may plunge if companies stop investing so heavily in artificial intelligence. That could happen unless more of them reap economic benefits – such as faster revenue growth and considerable boosts in productivity. Oracle expects rapid growth in its cloud infrastructure business. "We expect Oracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue to grow 77% to $18 billion this fiscal year — and then increase to $32 billion, $73 billion, $114 billion, and $144 billion over the subsequent four years," CEO Safra Catz in a statement. Oracle’s results for the quarter fell flat while the company’s growth forecast generated an outpouring of enthusiasm. Here are the key numbers: The question for investors is whether Oracle’s bullish growth forecasts suggest a continued rise in its stock. Here’s the bull case: Oracle’s latest earnings report suggests growth in demand and much higher revenue driven by companies seeking to benefit from AI. Oracle’s backlog is likely to grow even more. "We signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers in Q1," Catz said in a statement. Oracle expects to contract with several additional multibillion-dollar customers and for its RPO to exceed half a trillion dollars, Catz added. "We have signed significant cloud contracts with the who’s who of AI, including OpenAI, xAI, Meta, and many others," Catz said in investor call featured by Yahoo! Finance. Oracle is targeting two related AI markets – services for training large language models and for inference – generating content from a trained AI model. “Millions of customers are using those AI models to run businesses and governments,” Oracle co-founder and chairman Larry Ellison said in the investor conference call featured by the Wall Street Journal. “AI inference will be used to run robotic factories, robotic cars, robotic greenhouses, biomolecular simulations for drug designs,” he added. Oracle’s unique advantage for AI inference is its databases that store private business data. The company’s “new AI database will make it easy for those businesses to query or ask questions of their private data, all of which adds to the bill for Oracle’s AI inference services,” Ellison said, according to the Journal. Oracle is also investing in AI agents – which help people to achieve specific goals such as selecting, booking, and paying for flights and hotels for a journey, as I described in my book Brain Rush. “The new [applications] that we’re building, they’re nothing other than a bunch of AI agents that we generate that are linked together with workflow,” he added. Oracle enjoys another advantage over cloud services rivals. “I know some of our competitors, they like to own buildings,” Oracle CEO Safra Katz said, according to CNBC. “That’s not really our specialty. Our specialty is the unique technology, the unique networking, the storage — just the whole way we put these systems together,” she added. However, this potential comes with significant risks. The stock’s premium valuation reflects high market expectations – if the market shifts money out of big tech companies or Oracle fails to beat and raise every quarter, its stock could fall. Moreover, the high capital expenditure required to fund its expansion could reduce cash flow and highlights the financial risks involved in its ambitious plans. In addition, Oracle faces significant competition from AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. While the urge to spend more on AI is currently powerful, if the economy goes into a recession, companies who buy cloud services may need to cut costs quickly to preserve cash. And since AI has yet to generate enough of a payoff to justify the investment, as I wrote in an August Forbes post, such spending could be curtailed if the economy contracts. Last September, generative AI was looking to me like a big dud. While people were using ChatGPT to help them draft emails and reports, there was no killer app – akin to what the iTunes store did for the iPod or the electronic spreadsheet did for personal computers, I wrote in the Boston Globe. Last month, MIT reinforced this point with hard numbers. "Despite $30B-$40B in enterprise investment into generative AI, this report uncovers a surprising result in that 95% of organizations are getting zero return," according to a study – based on 150 interviews with professionals, a survey of 350 employees, and an analysis of 300 public AI deployments – from MIT’s NANDA Institute featured by SeekingAlpha. The main problem appears to be integrating AI into the enterprise. "Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable profit and loss impact," noted the MIT NANDA Institute report. If companies find ways to make AI pay over the next four years, Oracle’s cloud services rapid growth could continue. Analysts are enthusiastic about Oracle’s prospects: One note of caution came from D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria. While Lauria said Oracle’s projected cloud revenue figure was “absolutely staggering,” according to CNBC, he added the business is coming from Microsoft and Google who are “offloading their capacity to other data center providers. These are not organic customers to Oracle,” he added. While Wall Street is optimistic, 35 analysts who cover the stock set a price target of $263.93 – meaning Oracle is more than 21% over-valued. I see the stock continuing to rise at least until the company’s next earnings report.

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Oracle's stock soared after a report of a cloud contract with OpenAI and an optimistic forecast for its AI-driven cloud infrastructure.The company projects aggressive eight-fold growth in cloud revenue by FY30, leveraging its unique database and networking advantages for AI training and inference services.Key risks include high market expectations, intense competition, significant capital expenditure, and the potential for AI spending to slow. Oracle shares have soared 99% since the beginning of 2025 – with more than half of that gain coming in pre-market trading on Wednesday. Why did this happen? After all, the Austin-based tech company announced results for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2026 that fell short of expectations. What sent Oracle stock soaring another 54 percentage points was the company’s outlook for the future of its cloud infrastructure business, according to CNBC. The future didn’t take long: The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday afternoon that Oracle and Open AI agreed to “one of the largest cloud contracts ever signed," worth a reported $300 billion over five years. Will Oracle stock keep rising? The answer depends on whether the tech giant can beat investor expectations and raise guidance in future quarters. I think there is more upside to the stock for two reasons: However, over the longer-term, Oracle stock may plunge if companies stop investing so heavily in artificial intelligence.

ByRachel Wells, Contributor. You’ve seen the headlines. The U.S. labor market isn’t as optimistic as we would like to believe. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ revised data points to a significant reduction in the number of jobs available from last year to March 2025. The economy is almost a million jobs weaker than we thought. And to add to this, August’s Jobs Report points to an increasingly weakening job market, with the unemployment rate at 4.3%--the highest level since 2021--and just 22,000 jobs added to the market in August, in sharp contrast to economists’ expectations of more than 70,000 job gains in the U.S, reports CNN. The primary industries being hit with employment reductions and fewer jobs being added to the market, are: (Data taken from the BLS employment situation summary.) Can the U.S. job market get any worse? There are several factors that are likely responsible for the current state of the labor market in the United States. These factors include the federal employment upheaval under the current administration, beginning in January when federal workers were prohibited to work remotely, resulting in a wave of employees leaving their jobs as expected in a bid from DODGE to shrink the federal workforce, and consequently government spend. Another likely reason is the shutdown and reduction of workforces in various federal departments, again linked to DODGE. Third, this year we’ve seen the tariff war impacting industries, especially manufacturing and wholesale trade, within the United States. AI is another significant factor here, resulting in fewer jobs being added to the labor market as a whole. One million less jobs than predicted aligns perfectly with the layoffs trend we've been seeing over the past few years, specifically since the AI boom. This year, in February, we saw an unprecedented surge in tech layoffs not seen since the pandemic, and since then tech layoffs have exceeded the rate of layoffs since the pandemic. Big name companies like Microsoft, Intel, Glassdoor, Indeed, and others have been laying off workers by the hundreds and thousands. Marc Benioff, Salesforce CEO, said that AI is already achieving 50% of the work at the CRM company, and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy anticipates a future where AI will be more significantly integrated across the company’s operations and there will be fewer Amazon employees within the next few years. All these factors explain why the U.S. labor market is much weaker than originally forecasted. With a weak U.S. jobs market, it’s only natural that professionals like you are filled with anxiety. This is giving rise to the trend of job-hugging, which is the opposite of job-hopping that occurred during the Great Resignation of 2022. “Job-hugging” is when you hold on to your job and are very reluctant to hand in your notice for fear that you may never step into regular employment again. You don’t like your job, you probably hate it, and you don’t give it 100%, but you're staying in it just to survive. Is that what you really want for your future? Is this how you expect to live the rest of your career, at the mercy of inflation, tariffs, rising record levels of unemployment, fewer jobs being available, and fierce job market competition? Is that how you intend to spend the next 10, 15, 20 or 25 years of your career? Surely, there must be more to work than job-hugging or being at the mercy of the economy. The good news is you don’t have to be. Here are some simple steps you can take today to regain control over your life, your finances and your career, and design a job and career that makes you fulfilled, happy, and financially free. Upskill in the skills of the future, by learning the certifications that teach in-demand high-income skills, like AI, critical thinking, data analysis, project management, etc. Make a career pivot and shift to industries or roles that are recession-proof and pay well, such as cybersecurity, for example. Establish your digital presence and build your online personal brand. Offer your skills on freelance platforms, such as Toptal, Upwork, or Contra, so that you have a secondary stream of income to fall back on. And you can build an entire business from this, if it takes off and is going very well. Create a portfolio career where you have several income streams, including passive income. Look for remote jobs that are work-from-anywhere. Seek companies based in Europe, Asia, or other parts of the world, that have flexible hiring policies, and allow for async working from anywhere in the world. Strengthen your LinkedIn presence by optimising your profile, strategically adding to your network, and engaging thoughtfully on posts on LinkedIn, providing quality insight and thought leadership. Post regularly on LinkedIn, at least two to three times a week. Refresh your resume at least once a year, so you never forget what you've achieved and accomplished, and your resume is always fresh and prepared in the event that you need it sooner than expected. Build a financial cushion of emergency savings and money for business investment. So you can launch a side hustle. Leverage your brain capital for consulting and contract retainer work. Stay abreast of trends in your industry and in the job market, using podcasts, newsletters, industry publications, and attending industry networking events and masterminds. Join membership associations within your industry for networking and job opportunities. Focus on roles that require strategy, leadership, and decision-making, as opposed to entry-level or repetitive skills that AI can easily replicate. What’s next for you now? Time to dust off your resume and optimize it for the jobs and skills of the future. Learn how to Write A Resume That Gets You Hired After A Layoff, then after reading that article, learn what you can do in the first month after being laid off here. Then, check out some free certifications you can undertake to upskill yourself at no cost in this article.

Title: Watch These Oracle Price Levels as Stock Surges 30% on Boosted Sales Outlook

Oracle (ORCL) shares soared Wednesday morning after the computing giant raised its outlook for cloud infrastructure sales and said it added several large new customers amid booming AI demand. The company, which has struck deals with big tech customers including Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT), said it now sees cloud infrastructure sales jumping 77% to $18 billion this fiscal year, above its June forecast of 70% growth. CEO Safra Catz told investors that the company expects to sign-up several additional multi-billion-dollar customers in coming months to push its booked cloud orders over half a billion dollars. Leading into the company’s earnings release, Oracle shares had gained 45% so far in 2025, handily outpacing the S&P 500’s return over the same period, boosted by robust demand for its cloud infrastructure services and AI database integration tools. The stock was up 32% at $318 in recent premarket trading. Below, we take a closer look at Oracle’s weekly chart and use technical analysis to identify critical price levels that investors will likely be watching. After setting their all-time high in late July, Oracle shares consolidated in a flag pattern ahead of the company’s quarterly results, laying the groundwork for a continuation of the longer-term uptrend. Indeed, the stock looks set to gap to a fresh record high on Wednesday. It’s worth noting that the shares have already registered their highest volume this week since mid July, suggesting that some larger market participants rebalanced portfolios leading into the report. Let’s turn to Oracle’s chart to identify a potential upside target if the shares see an extended post-earnings rally and also point out a few support levels worth monitoring. Investors can project an upside target by using the measured move technique, also known by chart watchers as the measuring principle. When applying the analysis to Oracle’s chart, we calculate the stock’s strong uptrend that preceded the flag in points and add that amount to the pattern’s top trendline. For instance, we add $142 to $242, which projects a target of $384, implying an upside of nearly 60% from Tuesday’s closing price. Future attempts to fill the earnings-driven gap could see the price initially retest the $261 level. This area would likely attract buying interest near the prior record high and top of the flag pattern, which may turn into a critical support region on the chart. Finally, a close below this level opens the door for a more-significant drop to around $198. Investors may look to accumulate Oracle shares at this location near last year’s prominent December swing high, which also closely aligns with a brief pause during the stock’s June rally.

Stock futures are mixed after major indexes hit new highs on Tuesday amid expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates soon; Oracle (ORCL) shares are surging after the company lifted it sales forecast on strong AI demand; a report on producer prices comes as investors keep a close eye on inflation data ahead of the Fed’s meeting next week; a federal judge has temporarily blocked President Trump’s efforts to fire Fed Gov. Lisa Cook; and Novo Nordisk (NVO) announces layoffs amid slower growth in the weight loss drug market. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures were mixed after major stock indexes hit new highs on Tuesday. Investors today are watching inflation data as stocks have risen in anticipation of an interest rate cut by the Fed next week. Futures tied to the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq were slightly higher this morning, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell slightly. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) was trading at around $112,400 recently, up from its overnight lows. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, ticked higher to 4.09% but remains near its lowest level since April. Gold futures were slightly higher, trading near a record high, while oil futures added about 1%. Shares of Oracle (ORCL) surged more than 30% in premarket trading after the cloud computing giant said it added several large new clients and boosted its outlook for cloud infrastructure sales on booming AI demand. Oracle said it sees cloud infrastructure sales jumping 77% to $18 billion this fiscal year as AI demand grows, up from a June forecast of more than 70%. Oracle posted adjusted earnings per share of $1.47 in the fiscal first quarter on revenue that rose 12% year-over-year to $14.9 billion, both below analysts' estimates as compiled by Visible Alpha. Oracle said its growing backlog from new contracts contributed to its more robust outlook. Today’s 8:30 a.m. ET release of the Producer Price Index (PPI) is expected to show inflation at the wholesale level moderated in August. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires estimate that the PPI will show wholesale prices rose 0.3% in August, down from 0.9% the month before. The wholesale inflation numbers come ahead of tomorrow’s closely watched Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, the last major piece of inflation data ahead of the Fed’s meeting next week. The central bank has held its key rate steady this year amid concerns about the impact that tariffs are having on inflation, though Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled recently that rate cuts may be warranted. A federal judge has blocked President Donald Trump’s efforts to remove Fed Gov. Lisa Cook. The injunction means Cook can stay in her role as her lawsuit challenging the dismissal moves forward. Trump, who has lambasted the Fed for not cutting interest rates, is attempting to remove the Fed governor on allegations of mortgage fraud that occurred before her appointment to the Fed's board. The judge ruled that the Federal Reserve Act limited the president’s authority to fire board members for actions that occurred before their terms, according to media reports. Cook has denied wrongdoing. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to eventually rule on Cook’s lawsuit challenging the dismissal. Wegovy maker Novo Nordisk (NVO) said it plans to lay off 9,000 employees, making up more than 11% of its workforce, as the Danish drugmaker faces a slowdown in growth in the weight loss treatment market. Novo Nordisk said the layoffs will create a one-time cost of 8 billion Danish kroner ($1.26 billion). As a result, the company said it now expects full-year operating profit growth of between 4% and 10%, down from the 10% to 16% profit growth it projected in August. The move comes after Novo Nordisk brought in a new CEO in August. U.S.-traded shares of Novo Nordisk were up about 1% in recent premarket trading.

Title: Apple’s ultrathin iPhone impresses fans but not investors

Jeremy Kahn is the AI editor at Fortune, spearheading the publication's coverage of artificial intelligence. He also co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. Good morning. Hello. It’s Jeremy here. First up, I want to wish Andrew, who normally writes this newsletter, a big congratulations on the birth of his new baby boy, who made his world debut yesterday! Andrew had to leave Fortune Brainstorm Tech early to greet his new arrival, but let’s catch him and you up on a few things he missed. Here were some highlights from yesterday: And don’t forget that you can watch the livestream of the conference’s final day here.Apple’s big “awe-dropping” hardware show yesterday ended up being more like a “meh dropping” (doesn’t quite have the same ring to it), at least as far as the company’s investors were concerned. The stock drifted lower in after-hours trading.While the new iPhone Air is impressively svelte and got phone aficionados talking, many of the other announcements—updated Apple watches, new AirPods—were more niche and unlikely to alter perceptions that the company has lost some of its former mojo. Fortune’s Dave Smith has a breakdown of the announcements below.Today, the tech world is eagerly awaiting another sort of debut—fintech Klarna’s IPO on the NYSE. The Swedish buy-now-pay-later financing firm is expected to price its shares at $40, valuing the company at about $15 billion. That will earn a nice 6x return for venture capital firm Sequoia, which invested about $500 million in Klarna starting back in 2010, according to a story in The Information. But it’s a lot less than the $46 billion valuation the company achieved in a Softbank-led round in 2021 (a round that Sequoia pointedly did not participate in.) We’ll see how much the stock pops today on opening. Beatrice Nolan has more on Klarna in the news section below.Before we go, be sure to check out Leo Schwarz’s great profile piece on Ramp, the fast-growing fintech that is automating how corporate finance departments work.And also worth a read is Sharon Goldman’s feature on Cohere, the Canadian AI company that many considered an also-ran in the AI race but which is making a bid for renewed relevancy with a big hire from Meta, a new CFO, and a $7 billion valuation.Onwards…—Jeremy Kahn Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Fortune Tech? Drop a line here. Apple’s “Awe Dropping” event has wrapped—and the focus of Tuesday’s show was mobile devices: the iPhone, the Watch, and AirPods. In total, Apple unveiled eight new products, including a brand-new member of the iPhone family, the iPhone Air. Highlights include the AirPods Pro 3 with improved ANC, live translation, and built-in heart-rate tracking. Three new Watches, the Series 11 with blood pressure monitoring and better durability, the SE 3 with an always-on display and faster charging, and the rugged Ultra 3 with satellite connectivity and a record 42-hour battery. On the phone side, Apple introduced the iPhone 17 with a ProMotion display, upgraded cameras, and the new iPhone Air as a fresh model in the lineup. The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max bring lighter builds, ceramic shield backs, major camera upgrades, and the longest iPhone battery life ever. Here’s the full rundown of everything the tech giant announced at its annual event. The launches come as Apple leans on hardware innovation to buy time for its delayed AI strategy, with Wall Street watching closely to see if these devices can spark stronger upgrade cycles. — Dave Smith Klarna's long-awaited initial public offering (IPO) is finally here. The buy-now-pay-later financing firm is expected to price its shares at $40 per share, valuing the company at about $15 billion, significantly lower than the $45 billion valuation it achieved in 2021. Despite the lower valuation, major investor Sequoia is set to gain nearly $3 billion from its $500 million investment in the company over the last 15 years, per The Information. The fintech, which was once Europe’s most valuable VC-backed company, has been planning the listing for years but economic and political headwinds, including sweeping U.S. tariffs have delayed its market debut several times. Investors are hopeful the company could set a trend for high-growth fintech listings after a period of slowdown in both tech IPOs and M&A activity. Losses in the first half of the fiscal year and an internal AI pullback could cast a shadow over Klarna’s IPO. Investors will be watching closely to see if the company can pull off a strong market debut. — Beatrice Nolan As Congress considers new rules that restrict the sale of AI chips to China, Nvidia has a new strategy to protect the billion-dollar market. The Senate and the House are weighing rules that would require U.S. companies to prioritize domestic access to the technology before it can be sold abroad. To tackle this and protect the potentially $50 billion market, the chipmaker has painted the limits as left-wing paranoia pushed by a group of AI doomers, according to a report from The New York Times. Nvidia’s aggressive push has rattled Republicans backing the restrictions and pulled Washington into what is primarily a Silicon Valley-based clash between “accelerationists,” who want to supercharge AI growth, and “doomers,” who raise concerns about the technology’s risks. David Sacks, the White House AI czar, has reiterated Nvidia’s attacks, labeling the regulation advocates a “doomer cult.” On his All-In podcast, Sacks even suggested they should be “Loomered,” suggesting far-right activist Laura Loomer should campaign to get them dismissed. The Senate is expected to vote on the amendment, which could reshape the U.S.–China tech relations, as early as Tuesday. — Beatrice Nolan OpenAI’s largest investor is working with rival AI lab, Anthropic. Microsoft is set to use Anthropic’s tech for AI features in Office 365 after executives found Claude Sonnet 4 outperformed OpenAI’s GPT-5 in some tasks, according to a report from The Information. Microsoft has said the $30-per-month Copilot add-on already has over 100 million users, and analysts estimate it could be a $1 billion annual business. Microsoft will access Anthropic’s models through Amazon Web Services, and the move will blend Anthropic and OpenAI’s technology in the apps. It’s the latest sign that Microsoft is taking steps to lessen its reliance on its closer partner in the AI space. This isn’t Microsoft’s first pivot away from OpenAI: earlier this year, the company announced that its GitHub Copilot codewriting tools would use Anthropic’s models to power advanced “agent” features, rather than relying solely on OpenAI. The move comes amid months of negotiations between OpenAI and the tech giant over the ChatGPT maker’s plan to restructure its for-profit division in preparation for a potential public offering. — Beatrice Nolan PwC U.K. cuts entry-level hiring amid AI uncertainty. The firm's U.K. chief admitted that graduate hiring is “under pressure.” U.S. tech companies accused of enabling China’s digital police state. An AP investigation found that Amazon, IBM, and Dell helped build China’s surveillance state. Robinhood says its latest product will fix social media trading. The trading giant has a new app feature called “Robinhood Social” where users can follow prominent traders. Oracle soars on ambitious cloud growth forecasts. Oracle’s shares surged after projecting $144 billion in cloud infrastructure revenue by 2030. Meta’s new AI team is stirring up new tensions with old staff.

Title: A Record 500 American Billionaires Are Too Poor To Make The Forbes 400

ByMartina Di Licosa, Contributor. Few things could make the average billionaire feel poor—The Forbes 400 list is one of them. There are now a record 900 billionaires in the U.S., meaning a record 500 people have amassed a ten-figure fortune but are still simply not rich enough to make the top 400 in 2025. It’s a tough list to crack, and getting tougher. Back in 1982, there were fewer than two dozen billionaires on the original Forbes 400, which required a minimum net worth of just $100 million to make the cut. Four decades later, it now takes $3.8 billion to make the ranking, up $500 million from just a year ago. More than 90% of last year’s list held onto their spot this year. Still, 19 billionaires worth $3.7 billion came up just short of stealing a place on the ranking. That includes design software firm Figma’s cofounder Dylan Field and athleisure brand Alo Yoga’s cofounders Danny Harris and Marco DeGeorge, as well as Dario Amodei and five other cofounders of AI juggernaut Anthropic (a seventh cofounder of the company, Christopher Olah, is also worth $3.7 billion but is Canadian). Another 11 billionaires missed the cut by just $200 million, with a $3.6 billion fortune. Those rich enough to make Forbes’ billionaires list but not rich enough to make The Forbes 400 also include some of the world’s most famous people. Embattled WWE boss Vince McMahon is $400 million too poor. Oprah Winfrey would need another $700 million to make the grade. Taylor Swift, who has added an additional $500 million to her fortune since Forbes first named her a billionaire in 2023 on the back of her global Eras Tour, is still $2.2 billion short. Several recent additions to the billionaires list missed this year’s Forbes 400 as well, including South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone (net worth: $1.2 billion apiece) and Chipotle founder Steve Ells, who has fallen from the billionaire ranks amid the fast-casual Mexican restaurant chain’s slumping stock price. There’s always next year for these billionaires. Just ask Robinhood cofounder Vlad Tenev, Dutch Bros coffee cofounder Travis Boersma, and the 12 other billionaires who made The Forbes 400 for the first time in 2025. The brains behind South Park got rich one offensive episode at a time. Now in its 27th season, the hit show has won four Emmys, and its creators ranked #1 on Forbes’ most recent list of the highest-paid TV showrunners. Parker and Stone became billionaires in July after they signed a $1.5 billion streaming deal to bring South Park to Paramount+ globally. The first active NBA player to become a billionaire, his athletic talent has earned him more than $500 million in pretax salary over the course of his two-decade career with the Cleveland Cavaliers, Miami Heat, and his current team, the Los Angeles Lakers. Then there’s his off-court earnings, upwards of $900 million pretax, from business ventures like production company SpringHill and endorsement deals with brands including Nike and Beats by Dre. Swift holds the record for the most albums to sell one million copies in a single week in the modern era, with seven of her albums, including 1989 (Taylor's Version) and The Tortured Poets Department, reaching that milestone in seven days. She toured her way into the billionaire ranks, joining the list in 2023 while traveling the globe on her Eras Tour, which generated more than $2 billion of revenue and ranks as the highest-grossing concert tour of all time. Her family made her famous, but most of Kardashian’s wealth comes from shapewear brand Skims, which she founded in 2019 and is expanding internationally with stores in London and Dubai. In 2022, she cofounded private equity firm SKKY Partners, which has invested in companies like UK-based luxury skincare brand 111SKIN and premium, truffle-based sauce and condiments purveyor TRUFF. Field cofounded web-based design company Figma in 2012 after dropping out of Brown University. In 2022, he agreed to sell his startup to Adobe for $20 billion, but the deal was killed by regulators. Figma went public in July 2025, and its stock more than tripled on its first trading day. It’s lost nearly 40% of its value since, with the company reporting slower sales growth and worse-than-expected earnings for the second quarter of 2025, as well as third-quarter guidance that disappointed analysts and investors. Londsdale got his start working for billionaire investor Peter Thiel's hedge fund. He is now the managing partner of $6 billion (assets) venture capital firm 8VC. He cofounded data mining firm Palantir in 2003; it now has a market capitalization of $370 billion. Lonsdale was also an early investor in Palmer Luckey's Anduril. Scale AI’s cofounder and former CEO briefly became the world’s youngest self-made billionaire in 2022, at age 25, after private investors valued his data labeling company at $7.3 billion. Then private markets plunged and knocked Wang from the billionaire ranks. He regained his title in 2024, when Scale raised $1 billion at a $13.8 billion valuation, and has held onto it ever since. In June, Wang’s fortune soared by $1.2 billion, to $3.2 billion, after Meta paid more than $14 billion for 49% of Scale, and Wang left Scale to become the social media giant’s new chief AI officer. As CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, Lutnick rebuilt the trading and investment management firm after 658 employees died in the 9/11 attacks. Now he’s serving in the Trump administration as Secretary of Commerce, focusing on tariffs, and has turned the company's management over to a trio of co-CEOs. Luckey got rich creating Oculus VR and, more recently, selling weapons. His defense startup Anduril boomed with the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. “We want to be the company that when the DoD needs something, we're the first people they think of,” he told Forbes at the time. Now he’s building crypto bank Erebor, which is awaiting regulatory approval. The Blackstone executive’s Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment (HBSE) owns stakes in the NBA’s Philadelphia 76ers, the NHL’s New Jersey Devils, and the Premier League’s Crystal Palace. Blitzer also has stakes in the Cleveland Guardians baseball team, and he co-owns MLS squad Real Salt Lake. Harris and Degeorge began selling clothing together right out of high school. Today, their athleisure brand Alo Yoga is bringing in an estimated $2 billion in revenue and has been seen on influencers like Kendall Jenner and Georgina Rodríguez. In August, Harris told Vogue Business that the brand will be launching a line of leather purses priced in the thousands in an effort to break into the luxury market. Formerly the vice president of research at OpenAI, Amodei is now the CEO of AI firm Anthropic, which built chatbot Claude. He cofounded the company in 2021 with six other former OpenAI employees, including his sister Daniela Amodei. Anthropic raised $13 billion at a $183 billion valuation in early September.

Title: Oracle Stock To $900: Its Simple Math

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Oracle’s meteoric rise continues to defy expectations. With a 36% surge following its latest earnings and a cumulative 3x gain since early 2023, the enterprise software giant is rewriting the playbook for cloud transformation. But here’s the million-dollar question: Can Oracle realistically triple again from current levels to reach $900 per share? The numbers suggest it's not just possible—it might be inevitable. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – JNJ Stock To $250? Oracle just dropped a bombshell that caught even the most bullish analysts off guard. The company’s remaining performance obligations (RPO) exploded 359% year-over-year to $455 billion from the previous quarter's $138 billion figure. What does this actually mean? Think of RPO as Oracle’s locked-in revenue pipeline—contracts already signed and sealed, just waiting to be delivered. This isn't wishful thinking or ambitious projections; it's money already committed by customers. Oracle didn’t just report numbers—they laid out a clear trajectory for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue that reads like a growth investor's dream: Here’s what makes them credible: most of this revenue is already baked into the reported RPO. Oracle isn't gambling on future demand—they're simply executing on contracts already in hand. Why is everyone suddenly throwing money at Oracle’s cloud? The AI revolution requires massive computational infrastructure, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) has positioned itself as a premier destination for AI workloads. As companies race to implement AI solutions, they need reliable, scalable cloud platforms—something that Oracle provides. The timing couldn’t be better. While competitors face capacity constraints and pricing pressures, Oracle is expanding aggressively and capturing market share in the highest-growth segments. Let’s break down the path to a $900 stock price with simple, conservative assumptions: Assuming Oracle maintains its operational leverage and margins improve modestly with cloud scale: From today’s levels, that represents a roughly 3x upside. Is a 40x P/E reasonable for 2030? For a company growing cloud revenue at a projected 34% average annual rate with locked-in contracts extending years into the future, a 40x multiple seems conservative, especially in a market that regularly assigns higher multiples to companies with less predictable growth. Note that tech stocks like Microsoft and Amazon currently trade at 35-40 times trailing earnings. Look at Oracle’s Valuation Ratios for more details. No investment thesis is complete without acknowledging potential headwinds. Oracle faces several challenges that could derail this optimistic scenario. Competition intensifies as cloud becomes table stakes. Amazon’s AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud aren’t sitting idle. They have deeper pockets and broader ecosystems. Oracle’s advantage in AI infrastructure could erode if competitors aggressively price or innovate their way back into contention. Economic headwinds could pressure enterprise spending, and companies might delay cloud migrations or renegotiate contracts. While Oracle’s RPO provides some insulation, large enterprise deals can still be postponed or downsized during tough times. Execution risk on this massive scale-up. Growing from $59 billion to $200 billion in annual revenue requires flawless execution across hiring, infrastructure buildout, and customer delivery. Any stumbles could shake confidence in these ambitious projections. Multiple compressions could be more severe than expected. As Oracle matures further, the market might assign lower multiples than our 40x assumption, particularly if interest rates remain elevated. Our separate analysis focusing on the downside risk for Oracle offers more details. Oracle’s latest results represent more than just a good quarter—they signal a fundamental shift in the company’s trajectory and market position. With $455 billion in locked-in future revenue and a clear path to $200 billion in annual sales by 2030, the case for $900 per share is surprisingly straightforward. That said, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single, or just a handful of stocks. Consider the Trefis High-Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. So is this a slam dunk? Not quite. Execution risks are real, competition is fierce, and market conditions can change rapidly. But for investors willing to bet on Oracle’s ability to capitalize on the AI-driven cloud boom, the risk-reward equation looks compelling. The 30% after-hours pop might actually be the conservative reaction. When a company provides this level of revenue visibility with this kind of growth trajectory, a 3x move over the next four to five years starts looking less like speculation and more like inevitability. The question isn’t whether Oracle can reach $900—it's whether investors have the patience to ride the journey.

Title: Novo Nordisk to streamline operations and reinvest for growth

September 10, 2025 01:00 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 10 September 2025 – Novo Nordisk today announced a company-wide transformation to simplify its organisation, improve the speed of decision-making, and reallocate resources towards the company’s growth opportunities in diabetes and obesity. As part of the transformation, Novo Nordisk intends to reduce the global workforce by approximately 9,000 of the 78,400 positions in the company, with around 5,000 reductions expected in Denmark. The transformation reflects the Company’s commitment to meet rising global demand while also competing in a more dynamic and consumer-driven obesity market, as evidenced by the recent slowdown in growth. Over the past years, Novo Nordisk’s rapid scaling has increased organisational complexity and costs. The transformation aims at addressing that complexity, so Novo Nordisk can invest more behind its science, commercial capabilities and manufacturing ramp-up – aiming to reach the millions of people who remain untreated. Mike Doustdar, Novo Nordisk president and CEO, said: “As the global leader in obesity and diabetes, Novo Nordisk delivers life-changing products for patients worldwide. But our markets are evolving, particularly in obesity, as it has become more competitive and consumer-driven. Our company must evolve as well. This means instilling an increased performance-based culture, deploying our resources ever more effectively, and prioritising investment where it will have the most impact – behind our leading therapy areas.” Investment priorities, timing and further initiatives The workforce reduction is expected across the Company, including staff areas and headquarters functions, and is expected to deliver total annualised savings of around DKK 8 billion by the end of 2026. The savings will be redirected to growth opportunities in diabetes and obesity, including commercial execution initiatives and R&D programmes. The implementation will begin immediately, and the Company expects to communicate with affected employees over the next few months, pending negotiations as per local legal labour market requirements. Further, additional initiatives are to be implemented to enhance organisational focus, performance culture and speed of decision-making as well as cost efficiencies. Novo Nordisk President and CEO Mike Doustdar added: “It is always difficult to see talented and valued colleagues go, but we are convinced that this is the right thing to do for the long-term success of Novo Nordisk. We need a shift in our mindset and approach so we can be faster and more agile. Our transformation plan is designed to deliver this. By realigning our resources now, we will be able to prioritise investments to drive sustainable growth and future innovation for the millions of patients with chronic diseases globally, particularly in diabetes and obesity.” One-off financial implications The company-wide transformation comes with an expected DKK 8 billion in net one-off restructuring costs, including impairment charges. Restructuring costs of around DKK 9 billion will be incurred in the third quarter of 2025, countered by savings of around DKK 1 billion in the fourth quarter. Consequently, Novo Nordisk expects an estimated one-off negative impact of around 6 percentage points on full-year operating profit growth at CER in 2025 compared to the operating profit outlook issued 6 August. This change in expectations for 2025 only factors in the one-off restructuring costs described above. The forward-looking statements section on page 26 in the Financial report for the first six months of 2025 (Company Announcement No 20/2025) also apply to this company announcement. Novo Nordisk’s disclosure of the financial results for the first nine months of 2025 and financial outlook for 2025 will be published on 5 November. Novo Nordisk is a leading global healthcare company founded in 1923 and headquartered in Denmark. Our purpose is to drive change to defeat serious chronic diseases built upon our heritage in diabetes. We do so by pioneering scientific breakthroughs, expanding access to our medicines and working to prevent and ultimately cure disease. Novo Nordisk employs about 78,400 people in 80 countries and markets its products in around 170 countries. Novo Nordisk's B shares are listed on Nasdaq Copenhagen (Novo-B). Its ADRs are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NVO). For more information, visit novonordisk.com, Facebook, Instagram, X, LinkedIn and YouTube.

(Negative) Gold – Glinting & Blazing and approaching $4000 US Federal Reserve Policy Outlook, Central Bank Accumulation, Geopolitical Tensions, ETF and Institutional Flows remains the key drivers behind the rally. US inflation hasn’t been fully caged with FED independence remaining under pressure and geopolitics also adding sparks. This may not last forever, but the near-term tide and current is in favor of gold. Gold is turning out to be the main course, serving hot, in one’s portfolio. New highs are in the face of a fresh political crisis in France, Japan and the US sanctions against Russia. Rate cuts bets have intensified after a weaker-than-expected US jobs report last Friday. Generally risk and refuge (Stocks & Gold) do not rally together but this cycle seems diƯerent with lingering inflation, US federal reserve rate cuts and tariƯ driven backdrops. Gold rallying is not a speculative froth but a diversification game by the Central Banks from dollar monopoly to gold. Traders might view it as a hot money chase, but the Central Banks preservation leads to built up in the gold vault and pulling it oƯ the market, creating a scarcity premium. Just an arithmetic of 1% movement from treasuries into bullion could lead to a gold rise beyond $4000 an ounce, or even more. Headwinds Bullish moves may be challenging on growing skepticism over the impact of the Supreme Court verdict (October 14th) on Trump’s plea on the tariƯ matter. US inflation data for August is due this week with an expected upside due to tariƯs, which may have a bearing on the US Fed rate cut decisions. Markets are on a close watch. Levels On any eventuality of a gold correction, immediate support is seen at $3616 and $3578. Up to 16th Sept’25 the gold volatility could witness rally beyond $3700 for a $3781 target which acts as a stoploss for the shorts targeting $3422. In the short-term gold seems to be overbought, but the broader trend is still positive. Weaker numbers of the US inflation data this week could boost gold further.

For investors, this IPO is a high-risk, high-reward bet, suitable only for those with a long-term horizon who believe in the company’s ability to scale sustainably as online penetration deepens. Our stance would be to ‘apply with caution,’ given the growth potential but stretched valuations.” Urban Company IPO subscribed 5% within minutes of opening.

A major downward revision to Nonfarm Payrolls showed 911,000 fewer jobs added between March 2024 and March 2025 than previously reported. Coupled with last week’s weak labor data, markets are now pricing in three rate cuts this year, including one at next week’s Fed meeting. Inflation figures due later this week could further shape rate expectations. Meanwhile, gold’s rally is also being supported by safe-haven demand amid geopolitical risks, US tariff concerns, and strong central bank buying. The metal is up 39% year-to-date. On Tuesday, the 10Y benchmark (6.33 GS 2035) opened 1 bps lower at 6.46% vs 6.47% tracking the fall in US Treasury yields as the sharply lower US non-farm payrolls data induced traders to fully factor in a 25bps rate cut by the Federal Reserve on Sep 17 policy. However, the fall was short lived, and yields surged to end at 6.49% as market participants booked profits amid lack of fresh triggers. Market participants now await India’s CPI inflation data due to be released on Sep 12, Friday for further directions. The cut-offs for SDL auction amounting ~$1.69 Bn (INR 149 Bn) was in line with the expectations. The latest system liquidity stands in surplus of ~$26.8 Bn (~INR 2360 Bn). >>> INR local credit: Yields were steady across the curve, with the 10Y point closing at 7.19%.

The deceleration in growth is due to a slowdown in government capex (fiscal consolidation and execution limits in key sectors) and due to heightened caution in the private sector (muted near-term demand, tariffs, etc.). While high growth (20%+) seen post COVID-19 is unlikely anytime soon, we believe ~10-11% growth in capex is very much achievable and sustainable given the continuing policy focus (central govt capex is up sharply YTD), very strong power-related capex (which should continue for the next several years), solid balance sheets, strong cash flows, and healthy capex intentions of corporates. A 10% growth environment offers pockets of opportunity for healthy earnings growth – we prefer industrial names with stronger tailwinds and optionality (CG Power), strong and diversified end markets (Cummins India), and the possibility of an uptick in margins (Thermax). We initiate coverage of ABB India at Neutral, and of Siemens and BHEL at UW. Our order of preference in industrials is L&T, CG Power, Cummins India and Thermax. Stick to growth and visibility: Prefer L&T, CG Power, Cummins and Thermax – L&T remains our top pick with its attractive valuation (24x core FY27E P/E) with high RoCEs (30%+) and EPS growth (18%+). In this report, we initiate coverage of: 1) CG Power at OW (strong growth, supported by expanding transformer capacity and optionality from OSAT), 2) Cummins India at OW (demand visibility, strong margin performance), 3) Thermax at OW (margin tailwinds as low margin projects end). We also initiate coverage of ABB India and Praj at Neutral, and Siemens and BHEL at UW.

While the price action shows that the stock has been flat in the past few sessions, the breakout remains valid, and we expect it to soon see another leg of uptrend.

September 09, 2025 17:43 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Sept. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against Rocket Lab on February 27, 2025 with a Class Period from November 12, 2024 to February 25, 2025. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of Rocket Lab have breached their fiduciary duties to the company. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily Growth with Amazon overseas, reducing over-assortments, reviving the Saks flagship's holiday light show, and digging into the data to differentiate from competitors are on the agenda. Senior Editor, Retail Saks Global’s $2.7 billion takeover of the Neiman Marcus Group hasn’t been easy and has kept many vendors on edge. But in a media briefing Tuesday morning at Bergdorf Goodman, Marc Metrick, chief executive officer, along with Emily Essner, president and chief commercial officer, and Tracy Margolies, president of Bergdorf Goodman, outlined progress, as they see it, in the integration, as well as opportunities for the future. Combining the Saks and Neiman’s merchandising and marketing teams into a single organization, from a human capital perspective, is “wholly done,” Metrick said. “They’ve largely been integrated, though there’s always work to do.” He said there’s about a 50-50 split with half the team coming from Neiman’s and half from Saks.

We have 700 million visits to our website and record every move that customers make. We understand more and more about this luxury consumer.” You May Also Like Inventory sharing between Saks and Neiman’s will be another competitive advantage, he said. “It’s going to start with online fulfillment, and then it’s going to move into the stores. So you’re looking at every customer that walks into a Saks or Neiman’s store, any size they want, any color they want, any designer they want, anything they want that we have, you’ll have access to.” On store closures, “There’s probably an opportunity to rationalize our fleet,” though it wouldn’t be based on the integration of Saks and Neiman’s, Metrick said. “What you’ll see over the next couple of years is an ordinary course type of closings — nothing on a large scale.” In a past interview, Metrick projected fewer than 10 closings. Already, Saks in Palm Beach closed, and Neiman’s in Dallas has an uncertain future, but remains open at least through the holiday season. Saks Global bought Neiman’s in December. Metrick suggested Saks Global stores have been seriously over-assorted. “I want us to return back to our roots of being that fashion arbiter, that authenticator. Customers have simply too much choice,” he said. “We figured out through hyper-personalization, the exact assortment of product [shoppers] would be interested in when they go onto saks.com. Everyone’s home page at saks.com is personalized. The bottom line is, we have to do more with less.” Saks Global is reducing its vendor matrix by 25 percent with some vendors leaving voluntarily while others are being dropped. Earlier this year, Saks Fifth Avenue launched a storefront on Amazon Luxury Stores, following Amazon’s investment in Saks’ purchase of Neiman’s. It’s a move aimed at boosting the revenues of Saks and some vendor partners, though it poses some risk to hurting the luxury image of Saks and the participating vendors. On the other hand, “There’s an international opportunity with Amazon,” Metrick said. “We’re not thinking about it for 2025 but more as we get into next year and the year after. Amazon is built ready for luxury, globally. There might be opportunities in specific regions and countries,” which could be enticing to brands. Metric acknowledged that much of the conversation surrounding Saks Global has been about late or non-payments to vendors. “I appreciate that and I’m aware it’s caused a lot of pressure and has resulted in noise,” Metrick said. Certain vendors continue to complain about overdue payments, but the CEO said: “We are largely in line with our payments with our brand partners. We need to move on from that part of the conversation and move towards saying, ‘Good news. We’re going to have $600 million in synergies, so now we can pay you.” The expected $600 million in annual savings will come through layoffs, consolidation of functions, and increased buying power over suppliers. Bergdorf Goodman maintains its own buying team, separate from the centralized Saks/Neiman’s organization. “They want to get paid, but that’s not going to excite them,” Metrick added, referring to vendors. “What’s going to excite them is [Saks Global] adding 50 percent of volume over the next five years, through knowing the customer, giving you more space, being more efficient with your inventory, better sell-throughs, and making it more special through events and activations.” While not disclosing any new financial results, Metrick suggested Saks Global is on sounder financial footing, noting the company recently closed on $600 million in financing through a bond exchange with existing holders. “There is north of $2 billion in bonds out there,” Metrick said. With more money available, the Saks Fifth Avenue flagship holiday light show, which was canceled last year to the disappointment of the hundreds of thousands who crowd the streets to see the show each year, is being revived this year and will happen in November, Essner announced. Essner said new Saks Fifth Avenue shop on Amazon was launched “with the hypothesis there’s still an untapped luxury consumer we can access and serve on Amazon. We’ve really found that’s true. The vast majority are new customers, not [those] shopping Saks previously. We are selling true luxury. We’re selling very high price point handbags and dresses in a way that surprised us. And it’s early days. There’s a lot more to build here, but we feel very good with some of the early signals.” About 50 vendors launched with Saks on Amazon. The market has been curious on how Saks Global evolves Saks and Neiman’s and to the degree they differentiate. “We’re being very intentional about this,” Essner said. Saks Fifth Avenue is “really for the fashion enthusiast who is seeking originality, who views Saks Fifth Avenue as their partner in discovery. Neiman Marcus is really for a sophisticate who doesn’t settle.” In terms of items sold, there’s an over 60 percent overlap; the percentage is even higher in terms of brands. Also on Tuesday, Saks Global unveiled its latest Luxury Pulse Survey, which from July 17-21 queried 995 U.S. luxury consumers over age 18. Among the most optimistic of the findings, 56 percent of luxury consumers said they planned to spend the same or more on luxury in August, September and October, compared with the previous three months, representing a 9 percentage-point increase compared with the April survey and nearly flat compared to the same time last year. But that also means that 44 percent of luxury consumers plan to spend less. Whether that all translates into better business for Saks Global this fall depends on how much more, or less, shoppers spend. Saks surveys luxury consumers on a quarterly basis. Based on the July read, Saks does anticipate more spending through October, which Essner attributed to “a desire to treat themselves, which is something we hadn’t seen for a while, as well as feeling better about the overall economy, and their need to update their wardrobes. Some of that might be seasonal. Some of that might be the reality of the fashion coming up, but overall, those were very positive signs.” The survey also found that 32 percent of luxury consumers feel optimistic about the economy, up 4 percentage points compared with the April survey, but 13 percentage points lower than the same time last year. Fifty-nine percent of luxury consumers feel good about their personal finances, 8 percentage points above the April survey, but a 9 point decline from the same time last year. Asked about rising prices, Essner said luxury consumers “are very concerned about value.” That value can be inherent in the craftsmanship and in the design of the product, she said. “The luxury consumer is not necessarily concerned about price.” With tariffs impacting prices, Essner said: “Some brand partners are being thoughtful about their assortments. They’re being thoughtful about pricing, looking potentially in some places to introduce more entry price points as appropriate. In general, what we’re hearing from a tariff perspective is midsingle-digit price increases. That’s very much in line with the increases consumers have seen over the last few years and not going to necessarily stand out.” When querying luxury shoppers in July, Essner said tariffs were not hitting in a big way. “It was a little bit too soon to tell in terms of how, especially the luxury consumer, is going to react, because, frankly, the impact of tariffs isn’t something that they have seen. The bigger concern, the macroeconomic noise generated from all of the tariff discussion.” Looking ahead, Essner noted that recently the saks.com homepage became “a fully personalized experience. We will be taking that capability to neimanmarcus.com and bergdorfgoodman.com.” She also said over 60 percent of the luxury brands Saks Global carries are working on exclusives for the fall season. At Bergdorf Goodman, “We have over 120 events for this fall,” said Margolies. She also said Bergdorf’s, as part of improving its store experience, launched new shops for Tom Ford ready-to-wear and Dior beauty, and will launch a new Schiaparelli shop in the fourth quarter.

A project of Common Dreams Phoebe Trotter:ptrotter@fwwatch.org Report pulls punches on pesticide regulation as Congressional Republicans further controversial Cancer Gag legislation This afternoon the White House’s “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) Commission released its strategy report outlining the Trump administration’s priorities for policies to overhaul the food system and address chronic disease. In keeping with White House promises to monied industrial agriculture lobbyists, the report does not endorse increased regulation for toxic pesticides. Fully 71% of Democrats and 66% of Republicans support increasing restrictions on the use of pesticides in agriculture. The report comes as Congressional Republicans further controversial Cancer Gag legislation to shield pesticide manufacturers from health-related lawsuits. The Cancer Gag Act, expected to be reintroduced as the “Agricultural Labeling Uniformity Act,” is reportedly a House Farm Bill priority; House Republicans included related language in a July appropriations vote to prevent EPA from improving pesticide warning labels. Meanwhile, the report makes only passing mention of PFAS – lab-made “forever chemicals” that have been linked to a large range of health problems including various cancers, altered hormone levels, decreased birth weights, digestive inflammation and reduced vaccine response. The Trump administration has been aggressively rolling back previously-established protections for PFAS in drinking water through Lee Zeldin and the Environmental Protection Agency. In response to the release of the report, Food & Water Watch Senior Food Policy Analyst Rebecca Wolf issued the following statement: Food & Water Watch research catalogues pesticide giant Bayer’s multimillion dollar push for Cancer Gag legislation, introduced across the country, failing in nine states and passing in two (the bill is still pending in North Carolina). The push comes as Bayer has spent over $11 billion settling more than 100,000 cancer lawsuits related to its Roundup pesticide, whose key ingredient glyphosate the World Health Organization defines as a probable carcinogen. Food & Water Watch mobilizes regular people to build political power to move bold and uncompromised solutions to the most pressing food, water, and climate problems of our time. We work to protect people's health, communities, and democracy from the growing destructive power of the most powerful economic interests. Citing US President Donald Trump's anti-climate executive actions, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin on Friday unveiled a proposal to end a program that requires power plants, refineries, landfills, and more to report their emissions. While Zeldin claimed that "the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality," experts and climate advocates emphasized the importance of the data collection, which began in 2010. "Looking forward to the contortions of people whose paychecks are dependent on denying that any of this is the case," said one observer. Belying persistent efforts by Israel and its defenders to deny the staggering number of Palestinians killed during the 23-month Gaza genocide, the general who led the Israel Defense Forces during most of the war acknowledged this week that around 220,000 Palestinians have been killed or wounded. Former Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi—who stepped down in March after leading the IDF since January 2023—told residents of Ein Habor in southern Israel earlier this week that "over 10%" of Gaza's population of approximately 2.2 million "were killed or injured" since October 2023. "If our communities are needlessly split by these new lines, we would no longer see our strong values reflected in the priorities of our congressional representatives," said plaintiff Terrence Wise. Missouri voters sued on Friday after GOP state legislators sent a new congressional map, rigged for Republicans at the request of US President Donald Trump, to Gov. Mike Kehoe's desk. Republicans' pending map for the 2026 midterm elections targets the 5th Congressional District, currently represented by Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver. Voters from the district, including Missouri Workers Center leader Terrence Wise, launched the legal challenge, represented by the Campaign Legal Center along with the state and national ACLU.

Title: The Best And Worst Of Times: AI vs. SaaS for $1 Trillion Market

ByBarry Libert, Contributor. Every day there are LinkedIn posts, as well as Forbes, NYT, and WSJ articles about the massive capital reallocation by customers and investors to AI from SaaS, foretelling the end of SaaS. Maybe this is right or maybe it is oversold. Who knows? Regardless, if you are a software customer, institutional investor, or even consumer, this tidal wave of migration – from SaaS to AI - is reshaping our world. The question is: What does this mean to you if you are a SaaS leader or investor? In short, this article will answer that question, as well as how to allocate your time and money to be a winner in this emerging market battle for time and money. In 2025, AI spending will approach $650B. You read that number correctly. And if that number doesn’t blow your mind – try this one. AI spending is growing at a mind-bending rate of more than 75% per year. Amazing - right? How about SaaS spending? Our tried-and-true business and investment darling over the past two decades is growing at a little over 18% per year (not too shabby). Stated differently, $300B will be invested this year in SaaS, which is half of the AI spend rate. Given these statistics, it’s clear that a war is emerging for a technological edge, as well as customer and investor dollars. Now that everyone knows what is at stake, the battle lines are being drawn. To understand this battle ground for dollars better, let’s start with the brutal facts that should keep SaaS investors and leaders up at night: What does this mean to you? From my perspective, there are a few emerging trends, about which I have written before, starting with the AI rallying cry - To Be or Not to Be All-In-AI is The Only Question. The AI winners understand this and are attacking traditional SaaS companies on three primary fronts: The brutal question: Is driving 30 MPH the same as driving 100 MPH (think of MPH as analogous to yearly growth rates - 30% CAGR versus 100%). The answer is - definitely not. And for many reasons: different growth rates are dependent on different boards, leaders, products, technologies, cultures, and GTM motions. All of these factors taken together create a dilemma for even the best SaaS leaders and investors. Witness Salesforce’s recent share price performance -- their stock is off nearly 30% – due to a lack of AI preparedness, products, and skills. Given this reality, here are three factors that you need to seriously consider at your next team off-site and board meeting. In short, ask yourself, do you have the right: Workday, Atlassian, Box, HubSpot and Monday, to name just a few SaaS leaders, are now responding - embedding AI everywhere in everything they do. Though they have NOT YET seen a real boost in revenues from their AI spending, they are making hard decisions. To ensure your success, follow these 7 steps: As the CEO of Palantir, Alex Karp says: “The world will be divided between AI haves and have-nots. At Palantir, we plan to power the winners.” The market agrees: Palantir is one of today’s most valuable companies trading at atmospheric heights (>50X revenues). Whether or not you agree with their valuation is not the point. Just see their positioning, product offerings and growth rates and know that we are living a new reality. The Bottom Line: A war is being waged between AI and SaaS for investor and customer dollars. SaaS leaders and investors can still win, but they need to be All-in-AI. There is no time to wait. It’s a high-stakes battle for the future of software customer spending. That is the simple reality of it all. It is up to you as a SaaS leader and investor. Allocate your capital wisely or risk being left behind while also generating sub par financial returns for your people and investors.

Title: Morgan Stanley flags 3 cybersecurity stocks poised to rally as threats increase and IT spending jumps
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/stocks-to-buy-now-top-cybersecurity-stock-picks-zs-crwd-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-09T16:40:53Z

Morgan Stanley says a few cybersecurity firms are primed for further upside as companies pump money into streamlined security platforms. The share prices of Palo Alto Networks, CrowdStrike, and Zscaler should all get a boost in the coming 12 months, the bank's software equity research team said in a note earlier this month. The three companies are best-positioned for a mega wave of "platformization" for cybersecurity products, with firms looking to integrate and simplify their cyber-defense structures. All three of the stocks offer solutions across multiple parts of the security chain, like devices, cloud, applications, and networks. "We expect platformization to continue as security needs grow against tight budgets, environments get more complex, a problem that only gets worse with AI," analyst Meta A. Marshall, the lead author of the note, wrote. Morgan Stanley expects the $270 billion cybersecurity market to grow by about 12% a year over the next few years. The bank also cited its CIO survey data showing that firms intend to spend 50% more on cybersecurity products than general software products in the years ahead as a reason to be bullish. On Morgan Stanley's list of 15 software stocks to watch, two key drivers of forward returns are revenue growth (for long-term returns) and free-cash flow margins (for short-term performance), the bank said. Among those on the list, the median projected revenue growth is 11.8% and the median projected free cash flow margin is 26.6%. Palo Alto Networks has projected revenue growth of 13.6% for next year and 38.3% projected free cash flow margins, part of the reason that Morgan Stanley has an "Overweight" rating on the stock. As of September 2, the stock has 9% implied upside to its price target, the bank said, and 36% upside in its bull case scenario. "In our view, Palo Alto Networks should be one of the few leading platform vendors in security longer-term, especially as the platformization strategy continues to gain momentum and more security vendors consolidate," the bank said of the firm. For shares of CrowdStrike, which MS gives an "Equal Weight" rating, the bank sees 9% upside as a base case and 30% upside in its bull case. Its projected revenue growth is 21.5% and its projected free cash flow margin is 31%. Finally, Zscaler, which the bank recently upgraded to an "Overweight" rating, should climb 16% to the bank's price target, it said. Its bull-case scenario is a 44% gain. Its revenue is projected to grow by 18.3% and its projected free cash flow margin is 27.3%. "We think ZS could cement itself as the next true platform (along with PANW and CRWD)," the bank said.

Morgan Stanley says a few cybersecurity firms are primed for further upside as companies pump money into streamlined security platforms. The share prices of Palo Alto Networks, CrowdStrike, and Zscaler should all get a boost in the coming 12 months, the bank's software equity research team said in a note earlier this month. The three companies are best-positioned for a mega wave of "platformization" for cybersecurity products, with firms looking to integrate and simplify their cyber-defense structures. All three of the stocks offer solutions across multiple parts of the security chain, like devices, cloud, applications, and networks. "We expect platformization to continue as security needs grow against tight budgets, environments get more complex, a problem that only gets worse with AI," analyst Meta A. Marshall, the lead author of the note, wrote. Morgan Stanley expects the $270 billion cybersecurity market to grow by about 12% a year over the next few years. The bank also cited its CIO survey data showing that firms intend to spend 50% more on cybersecurity products than general software products in the years ahead as a reason to be bullish. On Morgan Stanley's list of 15 software stocks to watch, two key drivers of forward returns are revenue growth (for long-term returns) and free-cash flow margins (for short-term performance), the bank said. Among those on the list, the median projected revenue growth is 11.8% and the median projected free cash flow margin is 26.6%. Palo Alto Networks has projected revenue growth of 13.6% for next year and 38.3% projected free cash flow margins, part of the reason that Morgan Stanley has an "Overweight" rating on the stock. As of September 2, the stock has 9% implied upside to its price target, the bank said, and 36% upside in its bull case scenario. "In our view, Palo Alto Networks should be one of the few leading platform vendors in security longer-term, especially as the platformization strategy continues to gain momentum and more security vendors consolidate," the bank said of the firm. For shares of CrowdStrike, which MS gives an "Equal Weight" rating, the bank sees 9% upside as a base case and 30% upside in its bull case. Its projected revenue growth is 21.5% and its projected free cash flow margin is 31%. Finally, Zscaler, which the bank recently upgraded to an "Overweight" rating, should climb 16% to the bank's price target, it said. Its bull-case scenario is a 44% gain. Its revenue is projected to grow by 18.3% and its projected free cash flow margin is 27.3%. "We think ZS could cement itself as the next true platform (along with PANW and CRWD)," the bank said.

Nebius Group shares jumped Tuesday after the Amsterdam-based AI infrastructure provider said it has inked an agreement with Microsoft worth up to $19.4 billion over five years. Under the deal, Nebius (NBIS) will deliver computing resources to Microsoft (MSFT) later this year using a data center in New Jersey, helping the Azure owner address a demand shortage for cloud infrastructure that can process increasing AI workloads. CEO Arkady Volozh said it’s the first time Nebius had signed a long-term contract with a large tech company, and added that there are likely more to come. Nebius stock was up 37% at $88 in recent trading after hitting an all-time high near $98 in the opening minutes of the session. The stock has more than tripled since the start of 2025, boosted in part by news AI favorite Nvidia (NVDA) had taken a stake in the company. Below we analyze the technicals on the Nebius chart and identify major price levels worth watching out for after the stock’s big move today. After climbing to their highest level in more than three years last month, Nebius shares had consolidated in a pennant, a chart pattern that signals a bullish continuation upon a breakout to the upside. That move higher took place on Tuesday, setting the stage for potential follow-through buying. Interestingly, prior to today’s surge, the relative strength index bottomed around its neutral reading, the same level that coincided with the end of a dip in early July. Let’s use technical analysis to forecast a potential bullish price target to monitor and also point out major support levels worth watching during potential retracements. Investors can forecast a bullish price target by using the measured move technique, a study that analyzes chart patterns to project future price movements. When applying the analysis to the Nebius chart, we measure the percentage change of the steep uptrend from May to August that preceded the pennant and add it to the pattern’s top trendline value, assuming a similar continuation move may play out in the months ahead. For example, we apply a 145% increase to $72, which projects a target of $176.40—implying that the stock could more than double from Monday’s closing price. During retracements, investors should initially watch the $87 level. The stock could be snapped up at this level by investors looking for entry points on a retest of the prominent November 2021 peak, which also marks the stock’s prior all-time high. A close below this level could see the shares fall to support near $76. This area may provide support around the top of the pennant, which also corresponds with a period of trading activity on the chart between September and October 2021. Finally, a more-significant drop in Nebius shares could bring lower support at $54 into play. Investors may seek buying opportunities at this location near the February 2022 countertrend peak and a range of sideways price action on the chart that preceded a notable stock gap last month.

Against the backdrop of grassland ecological degradation, grassland transfer has become a crucial pathway for optimizing livestock resource allocation and promoting sustainable pastoral development. Based on survey data from 383 herder households in the farming–pastoral ecotone of Inner Mongolia, China, this study applies Heckman models, mediation models, and moderation models to examine the impact of digital technology on herders’ grassland leasing-in decisions and the underlying mechanisms. The results indicate that digital technology significantly increases both the probability and the scale of grassland leasing-in among herders. Moreover, digital technology indirectly promotes grassland leasing-in by enhancing scale efficiency. Notably, strong social networks weaken the facilitating role of digital technology in grassland transfer, whereas weak social networks strengthen it. The impact of digital technology on grassland leasing-in is especially pronounced under environmental regulations with weak incentives but strong constraints. Finally, compared with ordinary herders, digital technology has a significantly positive effect on grassland leasing-in only for new-type operators. In addition, the impact of digital technology is more pronounced among groups with higher levels of education.

Grasslands are among the most widely distributed vegetation types worldwide [1], covering about 40% of the global land area (excluding Antarctica and Greenland) and supporting the livelihoods of nearly one billion people [2]. They perform critical ecological functions, including soil and water conservation, water source retention, and biodiversity protection. Grasslands also act as ecological barriers closely connected to socioeconomic development and regional ecological security [3,4]. They perform critical ecological functions, including soil and water conservation, water source retention, and biodiversity protection. China boasts abundant grassland resources, with its prairie area accounting for approximately 12% of the global total, ranking first in the world [5]. According to data from the Third National Land Survey, grassland area is second only to forest land, making it the second largest land use type in China, covering about 27.56% of the national territory. Consequently, they constitute the largest terrestrial ecosystem in the country [6,7]. However, weak management systems and increasing human disturbances have created severe ecological challenges [8], including shrinking grassland area, declining quality, reduced grazing capacity, and further degradation such as desertification and salinization [9]. Statistics show that nearly 90% of China’s usable natural grasslands have degraded, expanding at a rate of two million hectares annually [10]. Facing these impacts, grassland remains the fundamental resource for herders’ livelihoods. Grassland transfer is a key mechanism for optimizing resource allocation in animal husbandry [11]. Since the reform era, the household contract responsibility system has led to resource misallocation across labor, grassland, livestock, and productive assets [12]. To address resource scarcity and improve production efficiency, the grassland transfer system emerged [13], currently referring mainly to the transfer of grassland management or usage rights [11]. Therefore, in this study, “grassland leasing-in” refers to the practice whereby a herder leases-in grassland from another right holder—via formal contractual arrangements or informal agreements—to acquire grassland management rights. Compared with farming households, herders face more severe resource imbalances, making grassland transfer a vital means to balance resources, break the cycle of degradation and poverty, and promote sustainable development in grassland-based animal husbandry [12]. Herders’ grassland transfer behaviors typically take three forms: non-participation, leasing-in, and leasing-out. In theory, herders engage in land transactions to improve welfare [14]. Leasing-in occurs when herders rent additional grassland to achieve scale economies and higher profits [15], while leasing-out often reflects unstable livestock income and the attraction of stable subsidies, rent, or off-farm employment [12,16]. Non-participation may result from constraints such as limited capital [17–20], ecological concerns [21,22], subsidy policies [23], high transaction costs [24], perceived risks [25], or incomplete markets [19]. A notable emerging constraint is the digital divide, which limits herders’ access to digital tools and platforms that could facilitate transactions. Digital technologies can address these barriers by reducing transaction costs, improving information flow, and enabling off-farm employment [26]. This aligns with broader research on agricultural land transfer, which highlights four mechanisms: reducing transaction costs through digital platforms, enhancing social capital via virtual networks, mitigating information asymmetry, and facilitating labor reallocation to non-agricultural sectors [27,28]. Together, these mechanisms are reshaping traditional patterns of pastoral resource allocation. Despite this progress, several research gaps remain. First, little attention has been paid to the relationship between digital technology and grassland leasing-in, as most studies focus on farmland transfer. Second, existing analyses emphasize information acquisition, while the efficiency-enhancing role of digital technology remains unexplored. Third, because grassland ecosystems are fragile, grassland transfer is strongly influenced by policy, suggesting that the effect of digital technology may vary across institutional contexts. Fourth, differences in resource endowments among production entities lead to divergent transfer behaviors, but few studies examine how digital technology affects these differences. To address these gaps, this study focuses on four key questions: What impact does digital technology have on grassland leasing-in? What role does scale efficiency play in this relationship? Does the effect depend on social networks? Does the impact of digital technology vary with external environments and herders’ characteristics? Exploring these questions is crucial for advancing digital rural construction and transforming animal husbandry development models. According to Schultz’s theory, the introduction of modern production factors is essential for transforming traditional agriculture [29]. As a new production factor, digital technology provides abundant data for pastoral production, streamlines information acquisition [30], enables rapid dissemination and integration of agricultural and pastoral information [31], and supports herders’ grassland leasing-in decisions by improving information availability. This reduces information asymmetry [32,33], lowers information costs, and thereby facilitates grassland transfer. More importantly, digital technology leverages data as a new production factor to exert its enabling function [34]. In animal husbandry, it represents an innovation in production methods, shifting the dominant mode of production from reliance on manual labor to intelligent machinery. Traditionally, livestock rearing requires extensive manual intervention, which constrains the scale of operations. Theoretically, enabling fewer people to manage larger herds could overcome the main bottleneck to higher output and profitability [35]. Digital technology addresses this constraint by replacing routine, repetitive, and some non-routine tasks, generating a substitution effect [36]. This shift from mechanization to intelligent systems reduces labor intensity and expands the management scope and capacity of each laborer. For example, real-time livestock tracking reduces the time spent locating animals, while remote herd monitoring minimizes unnecessary labor inputs. As a result, with equal or even reduced labor input, herders can manage larger herds, overcome scale bottlenecks, reduce management costs, and enhance scale efficiency. Improved scale efficiency further lowers unit production costs and substantially increases expected returns from expansion. Based on the rational-economic agent assumption, herders are therefore more likely to lease in grassland to expand production and pursue higher returns. However, adopting digital technology also involves risks—such as data tampering, cyberattacks, and unauthorized access—that may undermine operational integrity and reduce expected gains without sufficient safeguards. As Yazdinejad et al. [37] note, smart farming and precision agriculture systems face increasing security threats, requiring robust countermeasures such as encryption, intrusion detection, and secure communication protocols. Furthermore, while enhancing scale efficiency, digital technology also mitigates livestock disease and management risks, strengthening herders’ confidence in leasing-in and managing grassland. Ultimately, it improves managerial capacity and cost advantages, potentially increasing future demand for additional grassland to exploit scale economies. Based on this theoretical analysis, the following hypotheses are proposed: H1:‌ Digital technology positively facilitates herders’ grassland leasing-in behavior. H2:‌ Digital technology indirectly promotes herders’ grassland leasing-in behavior by enhancing scale efficiency. Social relationships include both strong ties and weak ties. Strong ties usually exist between individuals with frequent interaction and close relationships, often yielding repetitive or redundant information. By contrast, weak ties connect individuals with diverse socio-economic characteristics, such as different experiences, knowledge, and backgrounds, and are generally superior in providing novel, effective, and non-redundant information [38]. A key function of social networks in grassland transfer is information acquisition. Herders obtain policy information and grassland-related details from their social networks. As a non-market pathway, social networks disseminate policy information and help herders understand other stakeholders’ perspectives. The larger the social network, the more diverse the information herders can access [39]. In information-scarce pastoral areas, choosing transaction partners based on personal relationships is the primary way to mitigate risks [40]. The main advantage of strong social networks is their emotional support, which constrains both parties, reduces contract breaches and land degradation, lowers moral hazard and transaction costs, and has historically supported grassland transfer processes [41]. However, with the development of digital technology, the role of strong social networks may be declining. Digital technology reduces information asymmetry, enabling impersonal transactions, and also provides formal contract safeguards, reducing dependence on relational contracts. Unlike strong ties, weak-tie networks connect groups with different education levels, incomes, and ages, giving them a comparative advantage in accessing non-redundant information. When informal reciprocity cannot meet herders’ demand for grassland resources and expansion, they must seek additional lease information, and the “information bridge” function of weak ties becomes critical [42]. However, transactions in weak-tie networks often require institutional safeguards [43]. Without digital tools, herders with sparse social ties lack institutional support, hindering independent transfers. Conversely, effective use of digital tools can fill these institutional gaps by providing information exchange and formal safeguards, even for sparsely connected herders or transactions between strangers, thereby promoting grassland leasing-in through weak-tie networks. Thus, different social networks may moderate the effect of digital technology on grassland leasing-in in distinct ways. Based on this theoretical analysis, we propose: H3:‌ Strong social networks weaken, whereas weak social networks strengthen, the positive effect of digital technology on grassland leasing-in. The adoption and diffusion of technology are widely recognized as being shaped by individuals’ educational attainment [44]. Theoretically, herders with higher education generally have stronger abilities in acquiring and processing information, which enables them to better use digital platforms—for example, for online leasing, price comparison, and contract signing. Empirical research supports this view: farmers with higher education show greater willingness to adopt smart agricultural technologies [45]. These cognitive advantages allow them to use digital tools more effectively in practice. By contrast, herders with lower education often face barriers to adopting and applying digital technologies. The higher cognitive costs of understanding tools, operating platforms, or evaluating risks may cause reluctance or mistrust, thereby reducing the utility of these technologies. Consequently, higher education is likely to enhance the positive impact of digital technology on grassland transfer decisions. At the same time, leasing behaviors are also shaped by other individual characteristics and external policy environments [46–49]. In recent years, China’s livestock production system has shifted from traditional household contracting to new-type operators—such as large-scale households, family ranches, cooperatives, and livestock enterprises—which has accelerated grassland transfer [50]. This is mainly because, first, unlike ordinary herders, new-type operators earn most of their income from livestock production, prioritize long-term development, and typically require large-scale land transfers to meet specialized production needs [51,52]. By contrast, ordinary herders increasingly diversify their livelihoods and engage in pluriactivity [53,54]. According to comparative advantage theory, they reduce labor input in livestock production, focus less on long-term benefits, and prefer to increase non-pastoral income, thereby reducing their likelihood of leasing-in grassland [55,56]. Second, as market-oriented organizations [57], new-type operators have stronger risk-bearing capacity than ordinary herders, who are constrained by subsistence and risk aversion, thereby increasing the probability of leasing-in. Third, higher intensification among new-type operators their adoption of digital technologies, further increasing the probability of leasing-in [58]. Fourth, contiguous operations among new-type operators optimize production efficiency, further increasing incentives for leasing-in. Moreover, intensified economic activities place substantial pressure on grassland ecosystems [59]. In response, China implemented the Grassland Ecological Compensation Awards (GECA) policy to protect grassland ecology. As the world’s largest ecological compensation program in coverage and beneficiaries, GECA reshapes herders’ expected returns from grasslands and alters their land management strategies [60]. Under grassland degradation, GECA focuses on livestock reduction and grazing bans through incentive and restrictive instruments: restrictive policies impose economic or reputational penalties on non-compliant herders to increase violation costs, while incentive policies provide subsidies to offset losses and externalities from destocking, thereby stabilizing economic expectations. As a result, herders’ leasing-in behavior shows heterogeneity under different environmental regulations. Specifically, when subsidies fail to cover the opportunity costs of destocking, herders cannot rely on compensation alone, making leasing-in a rational choice for profit. At the same time, strict penalties for overstocking raise the marginal costs of non-compliance, compelling herders to acquire grassland legally to avoid penalties. Thus, we propose the following hypothesis H4:‌ The impact of digital technology on grassland leasing-in is heterogeneous. This study develops a conceptual framework examining digital technology’s impact on grassland transfer (Fig 1). Source: Prepared by the authors based on the study’s conceptual design.

The study sites lie in the agro-pastoral ecotone of the southern Greater Khingan Mountains and include Keshiketeng, Bairin Right, Bairin Left, Ongniud, and Ar Horqin Banners. Minors were excluded from the survey population. Before data collection, all participants were informed of the research purpose and provided written consent, confirming voluntary participation. The project was approved by the School Research Ethics Panel of the corresponding institution (approval code: NNDKY2024004). A stratified random sampling design was adopted at the sumu (township) level, covering 31 sampled sumu. Within each stratum, interviewers randomly selected household identifiers from updated administrative rosters of registered herder households provided by local authorities. One adult decision-maker from each household was interviewed face-to-face. The target sample was proportionally allocated across strata according to the number of registered herder households, ensuring representativeness across banners and sumu. After fieldwork, records were screened using a pre-specified protocol. Following rigorous quality checks, 29 questionnaires were excluded due to critical errors, substantial missing values, or extreme outliers that could not be corrected. These excluded cases were distributed across different townships and did not cluster in any specific category of herders, minimizing the risk of systematic bias. The remaining 383 valid questionnaires produced an effective response rate of 93%. Two primary sources of potential bias are recognized. First, non-response and temporary unavailability during peak husbandry activities may bias the sample toward time-constrained households. This was mitigated by scheduling visits outside peak hours when possible and conducting in-person callbacks. In the empirical analysis, household and operational controls as well as township fixed effects were also included. Second, differences in comprehension, especially among older or less educated respondents, may cause measurement errors. To minimize such errors, trained interviewers explained questionnaire items in detail. Econometric analyses using Heckman and IV-Heckman specifications, along with robustness checks, confirmed that the main results remained robust. This region was selected for two reasons. First, the third national land survey shows that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has about 81.56 million hectares of grassland, accounting for 20.56% of China’s total and 46% of the region’s landmass. Of this, natural pasture covers 71.88 million hectares, artificial pasture 1.91 million hectares, and other types 9.49 million hectares. The grassland ecosystem is highly diverse, with eight major categories, 21 subcategories, and 476 types, forming a rich repository of natural resources. Surveying this area thus provides comprehensive and representative herder samples. Second, as a key agro-pastoral transition zone, it is one of China’s most ecologically vulnerable and poverty-concentrated areas [61,62], making it particularly relevant for studying grassland transfer. The distribution of the survey area is shown in Fig 2. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.g002 Grassland leasing-in is a two-stage decision process: first, deciding whether to lease-in grassland, and second, determining the transfer area. Sample selection bias may arise because some herders who wish to lease-in may abstain due to individual constraints. Consequently, only samples that exhibit leasing-in behavior provide observable area data. To address this issue, the Heckman model is employed. Stage 1: Transfer Participation Decision A probit regression models herders’ binary transfer decision using fitted values and residuals of digital technology variables alongside exogenous covariates: where denotes the grassland leasing-in decision (1 = yes; 0 = no), represents digital technology variables, is a vector of control variables, denotes the intercept, and are parameter estimates, and is the stochastic error term. Stage 2: Transfer Area Determination An OLS regression estimates the transfer area using fitted values and residuals of digital technology-related variables with exogenous predictors: where indicates the grassland leasing-in area, and are as previously defined, is the intercept, and are parameters, denotes the error term. In the Heckman model, technology promotion is used as the identifying variable. It affects herders’ decisions to lease-in grassland but does not directly influence the scale of leasing. The rationale is that agricultural technology extension is a key policy instrument for knowledge dissemination [63]. When organized by local governments, such campaigns change herders’ perceptions [64], and improved cognition is expected to generate more rational behavioral responses [65]. Existing studies also show that cognitive levels significantly influence farmers’ willingness to engage in land transfer [66]. However, without sufficient capital and labor, exposure to technology promotion alone cannot increase the feasible scale of leased grassland. Thus, technical publicity satisfies the relevance conditions for influencing participation in leasing without directly affecting the leased-in area. Nevertheless, the above estimations may still suffer from endogeneity issues arising from omitted variables, measurement errors, or reverse causality. To address this concern, the present study employs the IV-Heckman model to overcome potential sample endogeneity. Following prior research [67], we use the “digital technology adoption rate within the same sumu (township)” as an instrumental variable for individual adoption. The rationale is twofold: first, the township-level adoption rate is highly correlated with individual adoption, as herders within the same township face similar livestock production environments and share common infrastructure. Second, conditional on control variables, township-level averages do not directly determine an individual household’s leasing scale or decision, which depend on household-specific resources and preferences. Hence, this variable satisfies both the relevance and exogeneity requirements for a valid instrument. Theoretical analysis suggests that digital technology may indirectly affect grassland leasing-in decisions through the mediating channel of scale efficiency. To test this mechanism empirically, we apply the causal mediation framework developed by Baron and Kenny [68] and extended by Wen [69]. Given the binary nature of the dependent variable, we use the nonparametric bootstrap procedure for mediation testing proposed by Preacher [70], which accommodates dichotomous outcomes without distributional assumptions. where denote the mediator variable (scale efficiency), denotes the grassland leasing-in decision, represents digital technology variables, and is a vector of control variable. To empirically assess the moderating role of social networks, the baseline model is augmented with interaction terms between digital technology and strong or weak social networks. The formal specification is as follows: Here, denote strong and weak social networks of herder household. Following previous studies [27], grassland transfer decisions are measured using two indicators: (i) a binary variable for leasing-in participation, and (ii) a continuous variable for the acquired grassland area. Digital technology is the primary explanatory variable. Despite improvements in network infrastructure in agro-pastoral regions, a secondary digital divide has emerged. This divide reflects competence gaps in using digital devices, retrieving information, and engaging in online marketing, and has become a major constraint limiting herders’ access to digital benefits [71]. To quantify digital technology use in livestock production, we employ a binary indicator based on herders’ self-reported adoption of digital technologies (e.g., video monitoring, traceability systems, positioning devices, drones, or smart feeding systems). Households that adopt at least one technology are coded as 1, and non-adopters as 0. Scale efficiency is the mediating variable. It is derived from Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) using DEAP 2.1 software, based on an input-oriented model with variable returns to scale (VRS). Inputs include pastureland (operated grassland area), labor (hired and family labor valued in monetary terms), and capital expenditures (forage, breeding services, fuel, fixed-asset depreciation, and other inputs), consistent with previous studies [72]. The output variable is the total pastoral production value. The moderating variables are strong and weak social networks. Strong ties mainly derive from kinship, close friends, and familiar neighbors, and their maintenance requires substantial gift-giving and ritual obligations [39]. Accordingly, “interpersonal expenditure” is used as the proxy for strong social network [73]. Weak ties lack strong emotional bonds, and “communication expenditure” effectively captures households’ access to broader information [74]. Consistent with prior studies, communication expenditure serves as the proxy for weak social network [75]. The model controls for pastoral household characteristics, operational attributes, and geographic heterogeneity. Individual characteristics encompass household head’s age, health status, education, and political status; household traits include dependency ratio, non-pastoral employment, per capita livestock income, and livestock income share; operational features control for per capita grassland area, per capita livestock scale, barn-feeding duration, and unit production cost. In addition, township-level dummy variables are included to capture regional fixed effects. Table 1 reports descriptive statistics for the key variables. Overall, about 16% of pastoral households participated in grassland transfer, with an average transferred area of 218 mu. In addition, 39% of households adopted digital technologies in production. For individual characteristics, household heads had an average age of 49 years, generally reported good health, and attained an education level equivalent to junior high school, with only a small proportion serving as village cadres. For household characteristics, families showed relatively low dependency ratios and a clear trend toward non-pastoral livelihoods. Per capita livestock income averaged 55,200 yuan, with livestock husbandry remaining the primary income source. From an operational perspective, households managed an average per capita grassland area of 310 mu and held 96 sheep-equivalent units per capita. Barn-feeding was the predominant rearing method and was associated with higher unit production costs. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t001 Table 2 reports the baseline results on the impact of digital technology on grassland leasing-in. In Columns (1) and (2), the coefficients of digital technology are positive and statistically significant at the 10% and 5% levels, respectively. The average marginal effect in Column (1) is 0.0619, implying that households using digital technology are 6% more likely to participate in grassland leasing-in than non-users. Column (2) further shows that adopters lease in about 509 more mu of grassland. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t002 Columns (3) and (4) address endogeneity from reverse causality and sample selection. Results indicate that the coefficients of digital technologies remain positive and significant. The Wald test is significant at the 1% level, and the first-stage F-statistic is 31.97, confirming instrument validity. This confirms that digital technology promotes grassland leasing-in even after controlling for endogeneity. Hence, Hypothesis 1 is validated: digital technologies significantly increases both the likelihood of grassland leasing-in and the transferred area. Among personal characteristics, age negatively affects the transferred area. Older households tend to prioritize livelihood stability, and acquiring larger areas involves greater uncertainties and risks. Reduced labor capacity with age also leads households to retain contracted grasslands for subsistence instead of expanding through transfers. Political status exerts a positive effect, since village cadre household heads have greater access and capacity to acquire grassland. Regarding household characteristics, a higher livestock income share reduces the transferred area. One possible explanation is that more specialized pastoral households typically practice stall-feeding for longer durations, thereby reducing their demand for transferred grassland area. For operational characteristics, per capita grassland area positively affects transfer-in, whereas confinement feeding duration and unit production costs exert negative effects. Longer confinement reduces grazing demand, while higher costs economically constrain households and limit expansion. To further address potential sample selection bias, the propensity score matching (PSM) method was employed. As reported in Table 3, the PSM results show that households adopting digital technologies lease in about 123 more units of grassland. These findings confirm the robustness of the baseline estimates. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t003 To further validate the reliability of the PSM estimates, a balance test was conducted, and the outcomes are reported in Table 4. As shown in Table 4, most standardized biases were substantially reduced after matching, with all falling below the 20% threshold [76]. Furthermore, post-matching t-tests for all covariates were insignificant, confirming that the assumptions of common support and balance were satisfied. These results further confirm the robustness of the estimates. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t004 Following prior methodology [77], this study uses grassland rent as an alternative measure of grassland leasing-in and applies a Tobit regression model for robustness testing. The results reported in Table 5 indicate that the coefficients of digital technology remain significantly positive under this specification, thereby reinforcing the robustness of the baseline findings. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t005 A broader range of digital technology tools adopted by herders indicates a higher level of digital technology adoption. Accordingly, this study replaces the primary explanatory variable with the number of digital technology tool types as an alternative measure and re-estimates the baseline model. The results in Table 6 show that, under this specification, the diversity of digital technology tools has a significantly positive effect on both grassland leasing-in participation and transferred area, thereby reinforcing the robustness of the previous results. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t006 Since a lower proportion of livestock income in total household income indicates reduced reliance on pastoral activities—which may lead to more discretionary grassland leasing decisions [27]—this study conducts a robustness test by excluding households with livestock income shares below 20%. The models and control variables remain unchanged for re-estimation. The results show that, even after sample exclusion, digital technology continues to exert significantly positive effects on both grassland leasing-in participation and transferred area, thereby confirming the robustness of the regression outcomes (Table 7). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t007 Table 8 presents the results of the mediation analysis for scale efficiency. The estimates indicate that digital technologies significantly improve scale efficiency at the 1% level, with adoption increasing scale efficiency by approximately 0.07 units relative to non-adopters. Scale efficiency also exerts a significantly positive impact on grassland leasing-in decisions at the 1% level, suggesting that improvements in efficiency substantially increase the likelihood of leasing-in. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t008 The mediation test shows that the confidence interval of the indirect effect excludes zero, whereas that of the direct effect includes zero, confirming a statistically significant indirect effect but an insignificant direct effect. These results confirm that digital technologies influence herders’ leasing-in decisions indirectly through scale efficiency, with the mediation effect accounting for 26.21% of the total effect. The proposed pathway “Digital Technology → Scale Efficiency → Grassland Leasing-In” is empirically supported. Mechanistically, digital tools substitute for traditional herding methods, thereby reducing management costs and enhancing scale efficiency. Higher scale efficiency allows herders to achieve greater output per unit of input, which in turn incentivizes grassland leasing-in. Overall, these findings provide robust empirical evidence supporting Hypothesis 2. Prior to empirical estimation, the variables of strong and weak social networks were mean-centered to mitigate multicollinearity [78]. Table 9 reports the estimation results for the moderating effects of social networks. The results show that strong social networks have a significantly positive coefficient at the 5% level, whereas their interaction with digital technologies is significantly negative at the same level. This implies that although traditional strong ties enhance the probability of leasing-in, their facilitating role diminishes once herders adopt digital technologies. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t009 By contrast, weak social networks display insignificant direct effects, yet their interaction with digital technologies is significantly positive at the 5% level. This suggests that although weak ties alone do not foster leasing-in decisions, digital technologies unlock their latent value for adopters. The mechanism operates through two complementary channels: digital technologies enhance herders’ management capacity, while weak social networks supply critical information on leasing opportunities. This technological–informational complementarity generates synergistic effects that substantially facilitate leasing-in decisions. Overall, these findings provide robust empirical support for Hypothesis 3. We further examine whether the impact of digital technologies on grassland leasing-in differs across varying intensities of environmental regulation. To address sample size constraints, households were split into two subsamples—above-mean and below-mean groups—so as to ensure statistical robustness. Following the implementation outcomes of the grassland ecological subsidy and reward policy, herders with grazing ban enforcement intensity above the mean were classified as the “strong-restriction” group, whereas those below the mean comprised the “weak-restriction” group. Likewise, herders with grazing ban incentives above the mean were labeled as the “strong-incentive” group, while those below the mean were categorized as the “weak-incentive” group. To estimate the probability of leasing-in participation, a Probit regression model was employed, given its suitability for binary dependent variables. As shown in Table 10, digital technologies exert a significantly positive effect on grassland leasing-in within the weak-incentive group. Specifically, column (2) shows that a one-unit increase in digital technology adoption raises the probability of leasing-in participation by 9.50%. In contrast, the effect is statistically insignificant for the strong-incentive group. Likewise, in the strong-restriction group, digital technology adoption exerts a significantly positive effect: column (8) indicates that each additional unit of adoption increases the probability of leasing-in by 9.52%. By contrast, the effect remains insignificant for the weak-restriction group. Taken together, these findings underscore that the effect of digital technologies on leasing-in is conditional on the regulatory context. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t010 This heterogeneity can be interpreted as follows. Under weak incentives—where subsidies fail to offset economic losses from grazing bans—digital technologies allow herders to expand production by leasing additional grasslands, thereby compensating for subsidy shortfalls. Under strong restrictions, where grassland scarcity is exacerbated, digital technologies assist herders in acquiring legal grazing rights through leasing, thereby enabling compliance while optimizing resource allocation. We further distinguish between two categories of production entities: new-type operators and ordinary herders. Respondents were classified as new-type operators if they were professional large-scale households, family ranch managers, or members of specialized herders’ cooperatives, while all others were categorized as ordinary herders. Since this study focuses on individual households and data on leading enterprises and agricultural service organizations are scarce, the definition of new-type operators is confined to the three groups mentioned above. Based on the Probit model, results reported in Table 11 indicate that the coefficient of digital technology adoption for new-type operators is positive and statistically significant at the 5% level. The marginal effect estimates further suggest that a one-unit increase in digital adoption raises the probability of grassland leasing-in by 11%. By contrast, the effect for ordinary herders remains statistically insignificant. These findings highlight the heterogeneous impact of digital technology adoption across different types of production entities. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t011 Since herders with different educational backgrounds vary in their ability to absorb new knowledge, technologies, and ideas, their production decisions may also differ accordingly. Based on the sample characteristics, households with more than nine years of education (above junior high school) were classified as the high-education group, while those with nine years or less (junior high school and below) were defined as the low-education group. The regression results are presented in Table 12. For the high-education group, digital technology adoption exerts a significant positive effect on grassland leasing-in. The marginal effect estimates suggest that a one-unit increase in adoption raises the probability of leasing-in by 11.76%. By contrast, the effect for the low-education group is statistically insignificant. These findings highlight the benefits of digital technology adoption are greater among more educated herders and provide empirical support for Hypothesis 4 (Table 12). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t012 This study provides a systematic examination of the multiple pathways through which digital technologies influence herders’ decisions to lease in grassland. The empirical analysis demonstrates that such technologies not only exert a direct positive effect on the likelihood and scale of grassland leasing but also generate indirect benefits through the mediating role of scale efficiency. By enabling herders to overcome constraints on operational expansion and to optimize the allocation of production factors, digital adoption helps break through traditional bottlenecks. The analytical framework also incorporates multidimensional contextual factors—such as social networks, environmental regulations, the type of production entity and educational level—to reveal the multifaceted nature of digital transformation in pastoral regions. Further evidence suggests that the interaction between digital technologies and social networks is not uniform. In settings characterized by strong social networks, the traditional advantages of these networks tend to weaken in the digital era; conversely, in weaker networks, digital tools can unlock considerable latent value. This finding expands the research perspective on the interplay between social capital and technology adoption, implying that digitalization may reshape the structure of social capital in pastoral communities. The heterogeneous effects associated with environmental regulation further reveal that the influence of digital technologies is more pronounced in contexts where incentives are limited yet regulatory constraints are strong, highlighting the critical role of institutional environments in shaping technological impacts. Moreover, the benefits of digital adoption are found to be concentrated primarily among new types of production entities. This indicates that the digital divide in pastoral areas is rooted less in access to technology per se than in disparities in organizational capacity and specialization—an imbalance that, to some extent, runs counter to the inclusive development goals of current policy. The contributions of this study are twofold. Theoretically, it develops and empirically validates a “digital technology–scale efficiency–grassland leasing” pathway model, elucidating the moderating roles of social networks and institutional environments, and thereby enriching the research framework linking digital technologies with land transfer processes. Practically, the findings offer targeted guidance for formulating differentiated policies for digital pastoralism: on one hand, technology promotion strategies should be tailored to match varying social network structures and institutional conditions; on the other, policy should focus on narrowing the organizational gap that drives the digital divide, ensuring equitable benefits across diverse production entities through targeted training programs and institutional safeguards. International experiences provide additional context for interpreting these results. Studies on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau indicate that digital technologies have been highly effective in grassland monitoring [79], yet their broader development remains dependent on policy frameworks and public investment due to uneven infrastructure provision [80]. In New Zealand, such technologies have created new opportunities to enhance both the sustainability and productivity of grasslands and pastures [81]. In African pastoral areas, the introduction of mobile communication and other digital tools has markedly improved herders’ access to information on forage availability, water resources, and weather conditions [82]—an advantage particularly significant in weakly connected social networks, where it can expand the range of potential transactions. Similarly, research on the European ruminant industry has shown that the adoption of digital technologies is strongly correlated with herd size; compared with small-scale herders, those managing larger herds are more inclined to integrate advanced technologies into their operations [83]. Collectively, these cases reinforce the central conclusion of this study: while digital technologies hold substantial promise for improving grassland resource management, their effectiveness is shaped by social networks, policy support, and the type of production entity. Limitations remain. The cross-sectional dataset cannot capture dynamic impacts, and leasing-out behavior—often closely linked to leasing-in—is not examined. Future research should use panel data and an integrated framework covering both leasing-in and leasing-out to generate more comprehensive policy insights. Using micro-level survey data, this study empirically investigates the impact of digital technologies on herders’ grassland leasing-in behavior. The analysis produces four key insights. First, adopting digital technologies optimizes the allocation of grassland resources and significantly increases both the probability of herders participating in transfer-in and the scale of transferred areas. Second, digital technologies indirectly enhance the probability of transfer-in by improving scale efficiency, highlighting their role in factor allocation. Third, strong social networks tend to weaken, whereas weak social networks moderately amplify, the positive influence of digital technologies on transfer-in. This pattern identifies social capital structure as a critical determinant of digital dividends. Fourth, the impact of digital technology on grassland leasing-in varies with the intensity of environmental regulation and the type of production entity. Specifically, digital adoption has a significant effect on leasing-in under weak-incentive and strong-restriction environments. Moreover, compared with ordinary herders, its positive effect is stronger for those with higher educational attainment and for new-type operators. Taken together, these findings suggest that digital technologies function not as universal enablers but as context-dependent catalysts, with their benefits concentrated where institutional conditions and organizational capacity are most aligned. Based on the above analysis, this study proposes the following policy recommendations: First, promoting inclusive digital technology initiatives is essential. Beyond general advocacy, local governments and industry associations should provide last-mile connectivity subsidies to households in remote pastoral areas, ensuring stable internet access across villages and seasonal camps. This effort can be complemented by distributing “starter digital kits”—such as GPS ear tags, collars, and grass-yield sensors—to low-income herders. At the community level, shared digital service centers with computers, internet access, and trained facilitators should function as hubs for troubleshooting and equipment maintenance. For herders with lower levels of education, governments and local livestock departments should provide regular “one-to-one” or “peer-to-peer” digital literacy training. These programs should emphasize practical skills—such as mobile application use, operation of grassland leasing platforms, online price comparison, and digital contract signing—to help herders overcome barriers to digital adoption. Second, weak social networks can be leveraged as informational bridges by developing officially endorsed digital platforms for grassland transfer. These platforms should include standardized listing templates, searchable land-availability maps, and secure e-contract modules. To boost weak social networks, these platforms should incorporate open bidding functions and transparent transaction records accessible to all registered users. Trust among unfamiliar users can be strengthened through third-party credit scoring based on transaction history and performance insurance mechanisms that automatically compensate counterparties in case of breach. Third, the targeted cultivation of digitally enabled new-type operators—such as cooperatives and family ranches—should be prioritized. This requires tailored digital solutions (e.g., automated feed dispensers) together with capacity-building grants linked to measurable adoption outcomes. Subsidized technical advisory visits can support new-type operators in optimizing their operations, while peer-learning networks should diffuse best practices to smaller, traditional herders, thereby lowering technological barriers through spillover effects. Finally, strengthening the synergy between environmental regulations and digital technologies is essential. In practice, satellite-based grassland monitoring should be combined with real-time alerts to notify herders of grazing limits or degradation risks, enabling compliance before penalties occur. Local authorities should implement compliance-linked incentives, such as reduced land rental fees or direct payments for maintaining stocking rates within carrying capacity thresholds. To ensure fairness, these incentives should be delivered through the same digital platforms used for land transactions, with clear eligibility criteria and transparent, auditable disbursement processes. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.s001 (XLSX)

Polyamines (PAs), including spermidine, spermine and their precursor, putrescine, are ubiquitous molecules that are vital for a variety of physiological processes. Recently, PAs gained research attention because of their roles in promoting longevity and preventing age-related diseases. Circulating and tissue levels of PAs appear to decline with age, while higher intake of PAs in humans is correlated with better health during aging. Many foods, including plants and offal (organ meats), are good sources of dietary PAs, but are consumed much less in regions with prevailing Western diets. Elevating the circulating levels of PAs through dietary supplementation with PA-rich plant extracts or foods, on the other hand, has proven to be challenging, most likely due to their low bioavailability. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of nutritional supplements derived from bovine glandular tissues and/or plant material in elevating blood and tissue levels of spermidine, spermine and putrescine in adult rats. We detected appreciable amounts of PAs in the following materials: 1) spermidine-rich supplement (SRS), containing wheat germ, 2) a cytosolic fraction extract of bovine thymus gland (Thymus Cytosolic Fraction – TCF) and 3) a nuclear fraction extract of bovine thymus gland (Thymus Nuclear Fraction – TNF). We showed that all three PA-containing supplements also contain liposomes, with TNF displaying the largest amounts of liposomal PAs, as well as RNAs, among the tested supplements. We demonstrated that oral administration of SRS, TCF and TNF induce rapid changes in blood PA concentrations. Finally, we showed that TNF supplement is superior to SRS and TCF in elevating the levels of spermidine in the blood, liver and heart following a 28-day supplementation period. Considering the importance of PAs in prevention of age-related disease, supplementation with TNF could be a plausible approach towards the maintenance of proper cellular PA homeostasis during aging.

Polyamines (PAs), namely spermidine and spermine, including their precursor putrescine, are naturally occurring, positively charged alkylamines that are present in every living cell and are essential for a wide range of cellular physiological processes and functions [1]. PAs are abundant across all kingdoms of life and have attracted the attention of researchers because of their many diverse functional roles in cardio- and neuroprotection, neuromodulation, lifespan extension, and prevention of age-related diseases [1–12]. Multiple lines of research evidence suggest that higher dietary intakes of PAs are associated with lower mortality rates and reduced incidence of diseases in humans [11–17]. In addition, recent studies demonstrated an important relationship between blood PA concentrations, the ratios of individual PAs, and healthy life span [17–19]. PAs have essential and diverse cellular functions, which include structural stabilization of RNA and DNA [20–22], DNA condensation [23], RNA processing [24,25], regulation of gene expression [25,26], protein synthesis and posttranslational modification [27], reducing oxidative stress [28], promoting cell growth and cell cycle progression [29], and possible regulation of autophagy, mitophagy, apoptosis and inflammation [30–34], among others [7,35–39]. Essentially, PAs are vital for cell survival, and their depletion would severely compromise cellular growth and function [40]. As organisms age, however, PA levels in tissues decline, contributing to the disruption of many molecular pathways associated with age-related diseases [41–44]. The pools of PAs in the body are maintained through three distinct routes: 1) endogenous synthesis, 2) production of PAs by the microorganisms residing in the intestinal tract, and 3) dietary intake – the most important and also modifiable source of PAs [10]. Among the dietary sources of PAs are diverse foods of plant and animal origins, many of which are found abundantly in Mediterranean diets that are thought to promote longevity and prevent age-related diseases [14,39,41,45,46]. Among the plant sources, wheat germ is one of the richest in PAs, especially spermidine [47]. High concentrations of PAs are also found in foods of animal origin, such as edible offal (organ meats), including intestine, thymus and liver [14,45,48,49]. Of note, consumption of offal and other foods that are common in Mediterranean diets (i.e., fermented foods, vegetables, fruit), is much lower in the countries with predominant Western diets, which may have an impact on overall population longevity and health during aging [50,51]. PAs that come from either the diet or gut microflora are absorbed intact in the gut lumen, but their concentrations drop from millimolar to low micromolar ranges rapidly after ingestion through poorly understood mechanisms, making PAs “high supply and low utilization” compounds [52,53]. Even though specialized carriers have been proposed to mediate PA transport across intestinal enterocytes, their affinity for PAs may differ based on their location at the apical versus basal membranes of enterocytes, while PAs that are absorbed are quickly distributed across tissues with high proliferative demands, including the cells of the gastrointestinal tract itself.[54–56] In addition, PAs that reach rat tissues 6 hours following exogenous PA administration mediate a 30−300 fold increase in the activity of spermidine/spermine N-1-acetyltransferase (SSAT), an enzyme involved in the conversion of higher PAs back to putrescine, thereby limiting their availability.[57] Consistent with this, supplementation with high doses of spermidine, whether in the form of a supplement or in the context of spermidine-rich foods, does not increase its levels in plasma or in saliva [58–60]. Multiple studies in humans and in rodents demonstrated that supplementation with foods rich in PAs, even for as long as 1 year in humans, does not increase blood spermidine levels, while spermine levels can gradually increase [11,53,61]. These studies confirm that the bioavailability of food-derived spermidine is very low. Indeed, concentrations of PAs in the blood depend on the maintenance of PA homeostasis, which is a tightly controlled and highly dynamic process [17,56,62]. Putrescine is a substrate for the synthesis of spermidine, which can be further converted to spermine, while a series of acetylation and oxidation reactions mediate the conversion of the higher PAs back to their precursors (Fig 1) [63]. A set of enzymes and antizymes, whose activity and/or expression are regulated by the abundance of their substrates, putrescine or higher PAs, as well as by many environmental factors, including injuries or pathologic conditions, mediates rapid bi-directional interconversion of each of the PAs into a different type and their import, export, metabolism and catabolism, and controls the changes in PA ratios. Yet, blood PA levels, and PA ratios specifically, can serve as biomarkers of human health status [64–66]. Spermidine is synthesized from putrescine by spermidine synthase (SRM), and spermine is produced from spermidine by spermine synthase (SMS). Direct conversion of spermine to spermidine is mediated by spermine oxidase (SMO). Additional pathways converting spermine to spermidine, and spermidine to putrescine, require sequential actions of spermine/spermidine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) and N1-acetylpolyamine oxidase (APAO) enzymes.

Spermidine supplementation, on the other hand, was shown to exert a neuroprotective effect in the context of TBI, such that the recovery from TBI is enhanced in rodents receiving spermidine prior to and post-injury [69]. Coincidentally, we recently demonstrated a neuroprotective effect of a nutritional supplement containing a nuclear fraction of bovine thymus gland (Thymus – Nuclear Fraction, TNF) by showing that supplementation of rats with TNF prior to and post TBI accelerated their functional recovery [70]. Given that thymus is a glandular organ that could potentially be a good dietary source of PAs [45,48,49], we hypothesized that TNF supplement may deliver bioavailable PAs, which would partially explain the observed neuroprotective role of TNF supplementation. In the current study we investigated whether TNF supplement contains PAs and could change their circulating levels when administered orally. We compared a whole food supplement containing defatted wheat germ, termed spermidine-rich supplement (SRS), with bovine thymus extracts – TNF, thymus cytosolic fraction (TCF) and thymus desiccated (freeze dried) material (TD), as well as nuclear fractions of bovine liver and heart (LNF and HNF), with respect to their PA content and effectiveness in increasing blood and tissue PA levels. We show that SRS contains the highest amount of spermidine among the tested supplements, yet TNF is a supplement that predominantly delivers the liposomal, bioavailable form of spermidine and is capable of elevating its levels in the blood, liver and heart following 28 days of oral supplementation in rats. Together, these results represent the first demonstration that a nutritional supplement containing a nuclear fraction of bovine thymus is a source of bioavailable forms of PAs and can increase the levels of spermidine in the blood and in tissues. All nutritional supplements evaluated in this study were obtained from Standard Process Inc. (Palmyra, WI, USA) and are commercially available as nutritional supplements. Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared from frozen raw bovine glands and dried on-site using Standard Process Inc. proprietary processes. Briefly, the cytoplasmic cellular material was extracted following incubation of the raw homogenized thymus tissue in water, while the nuclear material was isolated using salts following the removal of the cytoplasmic material. No extraction procedures were applied towards the desiccated, freeze-dried thymus material. All test products are in powder form and are suitable for consumption by animals and humans. The following supplements were used: 1) Spermidine-Rich supplement (SRS) containing plant- and bovine tissue-derived materials (a proprietary blend containing bovine liver, organic beet [root], nutritional yeast, defatted wheat germ, rice bran, organic sweet potato, organic carrot, and bovine adrenal gland), 2) bovine thymus cytosolic fraction extract (TCF), 3) bovine thymus nuclear fraction extract (TNF), 4) desiccated bovine thymus (TD), 5) bovine liver nuclear fraction extract (LNF) and 6) bovine heart nuclear fraction extract (HNF). Measurements of individual PA concentrations in nutritional supplements were conducted by Eurofins Scientific (Luxembourg) using high-performance liquid chromatography method EN ISO 19343, essentially as described in Duflos et al. (2019) [71]. Two lots of materials were tested for each supplement. Cryo-TEM was performed at Creative Biostructure, LLC (Shirley, New York, USA). Solutions were prepared from supplement powders at a concentration of 100 mg/mL, centrifuged, and the supernatant was used in grid preparation. A 5 µl solution aliquot was placed on a thin copper grid that had been glow discharged. For preparation of the grid, the samples were loaded into the freezing chamber at low temperature (0–5°C) under humidity control (100%). After blotting for 3 seconds (s) with filter paper, the specimen was rapidly frozen with cryogen – liquid ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen. The prepared grid was mounted for imaging using a 200 kV FEI Tecnai F20 electron microscope. DLS analysis was conducted at Creative Biostructure, LLC (Shirley, New York, USA). Ten mg of each supplement powder were resuspended in 0.1 mL of water. After centrifugation, the supernatant was used in particle size analysis following the Zetasizer Nano Series manufacturer’s standard protocol (Malvern Panalytical, London, United Kingdom). NTA analysis was performed at Creative Biostructure, LLC (Shirley, New York, USA). The NanoSight NS300 instrument (Malvern Panalytical, London, United Kingdom) was calibrated using 100 nm beads and primed with filtered 1X PBS since the nanoparticles are isolated in PBS. The stock dilutions of nanoparticles were prepared in 1X PBS and samples were injected into the instrument using a 1 cc syringe. Individual particles were visualized in real-time and NTA was performed at 25 °C using a 488 nm laser. Data were collected from 11 positions. HPLC analysis was performed at Creative Biostructure, LLC (Shirley, New York, USA) essentially as described in Tamim et al (2002) [72]. Briefly, HPLC method consisted of a perchloric acid extraction step, derivatization step using dansyl chloride, separation step using elution gradient of methanol and water, and fluorescence-based detection. HPLC results were calculated using a calibration curve created using the same methodology as used for sample analysis. One gram of each supplement powder was resuspended in 10 mL of water and centrifuged to remove the insoluble precipitate. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 150,000 g for 2 hrs to collect the liposomal nanoparticles. After centrifugation, the liposomal nanoparticles were resuspended in 10 mL water and thoroughly mixed with 0.5% triton X-100, and the liposomes were destroyed by slight shock. The suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 g at 4°C for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. Amounts of loaded spermidine, spermine and putrescine were determined by HPLC. Encapsulation efficiency was determined using the following formula: S1 Table shows the detailed procedures used for characterization of PA encapsulation. The detection limit of the HPLC assay used was 5 ppm; 1 ppm = 1 µg/mL. RNA analysis was performed at Creative Biostructure, LLC (Shirley, New York, USA) following the Quant-iT™ RNA Assay Kit’s standard manual (Thermo Fisher Scientific, High Point, NC, USA). RNA standards were prepared by adding 10 µL of each of the E. coli rRNA standard in diluted RNA buffer to separate wells in triplicate and mixing. Ten µL of each unknown RNA sample were added to separate wells and mixed well. Two hundred µL of the working solution (diluted Quant-iT™ RNA reagent) were loaded onto each microplate well and fluorescence was measured using a microplate reader (excitation/emission maxima were 644/673 nm) and RNA amounts were determined using the E. coli rRNA-based standard curve. The encapsulation efficiency for RNA followed the same method described in the section above. DNA quantification was performed at Creative Biostructure, LLC (Shirley, New York, USA) using AlphaLISA Host Cell Residual DNA Detection Kit (Revvity, Waltham, MA, USA). DNA Detection Buffer (1X) was made by adding 10 mL of 10X buffer stock solution and 2 mL of UltraPure BSA to 88 mL of pure water. MIX solutions (2.5X) were prepared by adding 50 µL of 5 mg/mL Anti DNA Acceptor beads and 50 µL of 500 nM Biotinylated Anti DNA to 9.9 mL of 1X DNA Detection Buffer. Streptavidin (SA) Donor beads solution (2X; 20 µg/mL) was prepared by adding 50 µL of 5 mg/mL SA-Donor beads to 12.45 mL of 1X DNA Detection Buffer. For DNA amount quantification, 5 µL of each sample was incubated with 20 µL of 2.5X MIX solution for 1 hour at 23°C, followed by adding 25 µL of 2X SA- Donor beads solution and incubation for 30 min at 23°C. Plates were read using SpectraMax® M5e Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Wokingham, United Kingdom) at 615nm. The encapsulation efficiency for DNA followed the same method described above. All animal studies were conducted at PsychoGenics, Inc. (Paramus, New Jersey, USA); all housing and testing of the rats were conducted in accordance with the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care and the approval of PsychoGenics Inc., Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in AAALAC-accredited facilities. A total of eighteen male Sprague-Dawley rats, 9 weeks old, fitted with jugular vein catheters (JVCs), weighing 200–250 g at arrival (Envigo, Indianapolis, IN, USA), and 18 male SpragueDawley rats, 9 weeks old, without JVCs, weighing 200–250 g at arrival (Envigo, Indianapolis, IN, USA), were used for the acute and chronic supplementation studies, respectively. Animal catheterization was performed at Envigo (Indianapolis, IN, USA) prior to their arrival. Animals were assigned unique identification numbers (tail marks), were housed in pairs in ventilated cages and were examined, handled, weighed and acclimated for 7 days prior to the initiation of the study to assure adequate health and suitability. 12/12 light/dark cycles, 20–23°C room temperature and a relative humidity of approximately 50% were maintained during the study. Body weights (BWs) were measured 2 times per week throughout the study. Chow (Lab diet 5001, LabDiets, St. Louis, MO, USA) and water were provided ad libitum. Testing was conducted during the light cycle, and rats in the same cage received the same treatment. Rats with JVCs were balanced by BW and assigned to one of the 3 treatment groups, with each group consisting of 6 rats. Animals housed in the same cage all received the same treatment. Tested nutritional supplements (raw material powders containing active ingredients) were administered orally (oral gavage, PO) at a dose volume of 10 ml/kg as follows: SRS – 645 mg/kg body weight (BW), TCF – 1276 mg/BW and TNF – 1411 mg/BW. These doses delivered approximately 0.12–0.2 mg/kg BW of spermidine and 0.05–0.13 mg/kg BW of spermine and were calculated based on the varying amounts of PAs and excipients present in each supplement. Blood (300 µl) was collected from JVC at the following timepoints: 0 min (blood drawing prior to dosing, baseline), 30 min, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours and 6 hours after dose administration.[73,74] Blood was collected into lithium heparin coated tubes and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored at – 80°C. Rats were decapitated using guillotine at the end of the study. Rats were balanced by BW and assigned to one of the 3 treatment groups, with each group consisting of 6 rats. Animals in the same cage all received the same treatment. Nutritional supplements were administered orally, 2 times per day, at a dose volume of 5 ml/kg and a dose of 175 mg/kg BW (350 mg/kg BW per day) for 28 days. Considering an average human weight of 65 kg and a conversion factor of 6.2 between rat and human, the human equivalent dose would be approximately 3.4 grams per day [75]. The approximate daily amounts of spermidine delivered by this dose for each supplement were as follows: SRS – 0.072 mg/kg BW, TCF – 0.034 mg/kg BW, and TNF – 0.050 mg/kg BW. This daily dose given to rats is equivalent to human doses of 0.76, 0.36 and 0.53 mg of spermidine for SRS, TCF and TNF, respectively. For baseline blood collection, blood (300 µl) was collected from tail vein into lithium heparin coated tubes and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at – 80°C. Animals were not administered tested supplements on the day of terminal tissue collection (Day 29). On Day 29, Rats were decapitated using guilootine, and trunk blood was collected into lithium heparin coated tubes and flash frozen on dry ice. Brains, hearts and livers were weighed, and flash frozen on dry ice. All tissue samples were stored at −80°C. Quantitative analysis of a total of 198 blood/tissue samples for the amounts of putrescine, spermidine and spermine was performed by Creative Proteomics (Shirley, NY, USA) using an AB SCIEX API 4000 mass spectrometry instrument (Danaher Corporation, Washington, D.C., USA) connected to Waters Acquity ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) instrument (Waters Corp, Milford, MA, USA). Fifty µL of each blood sample were mixed with 200 µL of ice-cold methanol (with 0.5% formic acid) in a 2 mL tube and vortexed for 3 min. After 10 min of ultrasound-assisted extraction at 4°C, the mixture was centrifuged at 17,000 g at 4°C for 15 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane filter. The sample was further diluted in pure water (with 0.5% formic acid) and 10 µL of the sample were injected into the UPLC-MS/MS for analysis. All tissue samples (brain, liver and heart) were lyophilized before weighing. Briefly, 50 mg of each sample and 3 steel beads were placed into a 2.0 mL tube and 1 mL water (with 0.5% formic acid) was added to each tube. The samples were homogenized by a bead beater for 10 min. After 10 min ultrasound-assisted extraction at 4°C, the mixture was centrifuged at 17,000 g and 4°C for 15 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane filter. Each sample was further diluted in pure water (with 0.5% formic acid) and 10 µL of the sample was injected into the UPLC-MS/MS for analysis. Putrescine, spermidine and spermine standards were dissolved in pure water (with 0.5% formic acid) to achieve 1 mg/mL stocking solutions. The standards were diluted in pure water (with 0.5% formic acid) to get gradient concentrations from 1 ng/mL to 200 ng/mL. Ten μL of each sample were used for the UPLC-MS/MS. Chromatographic condition: Waters Acquity UPLC HSS T3 column (2.1 × 150 mm 1.8 µm) coupled with a VanGuard precolumn (2.1 × 5 mm 1.8 µm). LC parameters: Mobile Phase A – pure water (with 0.5% formic acid); Mobile Phase B – acetonitrile (with 0.1% formic acid). The column temperature was held at 40°C. The sample chamber temperature was held at 10°C. Flow rate was 0.25 mL/min. The elution gradients are shown in S2 Table. Mass Spectrometry parameters: MS condition – ESI positive mode; Ion source temperature – 450°C; IS – 4500 V; CAD – 10 psi; CUR – 40 psi; GS1–45 psi; GS2–45 psi; Q1 and Q3 parameters for measured PAs are shown in S3 Table. Acute changes in blood PA levels in Study 1 were analyzed using Repeated Measures ANOVA and Bonferroni/Dunn post-hoc test. Paired Student’s t-test was used to compare changes in blood PA levels from Day 0 to day 29, following 28 days of supplementation in Study 2. Changes in tissue PA levels were compared using Bonferroni/Dunn post-hoc analysis. Significant changes with p values < 0.05 are marked by an asterisk (*). Graphical data analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9 software (La Jolla, CA, USA, RRID: SCR_002798). To begin investigating whether nutritional supplements that are composed of materials derived from plants/animal tissues contain PAs we evaluated SRS, TCF, TNF, LNF, HNF materials, and the freeze-dried, desiccated thymus material (TD), for concentrations of putrescine, spermidine, spermine, histamine and cadaverine. We found that the SRS, which consists of both plant- and bovine tissue-derived materials, contained the highest levels of spermidine among the tested supplements (206.73 mg/kg) (Fig 2). The cytosolic and the nuclear fractions of bovine thymus, TCF and TNF, contained lower amounts of spermidine compared to SRS (97.14 mg/kg and 143.86 mg/kg, respectively), while TNF had the highest levels of putrescine among all the tested supplements (Fig 2). Desiccated thymus material, on the other hand, was not rich in either putrescine, spermidine or spermine. Neither LNF nor HNF contained appreciable amounts of the most abundant PAs – spermidine and spermine. These data show that a supplement containing wheat germ, which is rich in spermidine, as well as cytosolic and nuclear fractions of bovine thymus, can potentially be good sources of spermidine, spermine and putrescine. Putrescine, spermine, spermidine, histamine and cadaverine were measured in SRS, TCF, TNF, TD, LNF and HNF supplements using HPLC [71]. Data are shown as Mean ± S.E.M.; two distinct lots of materials were analyzed. Putrescine, spermine, spermidine, histamine and cadaverine were measured in SRS, TCF, TNF, TD, LNF and HNF supplements using HPLC [71]. Data are shown as Mean ± S.E.M.; two distinct lots of materials were analyzed. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.g002 A study by Acosta-Andrade et al. (2017) has shown that PAs can induce aggregation of lipid vesicles, such as liposomes [76]. Liposomal delivery of nutrient compounds, as well as drugs, is considered more efficient compared to the delivery of unencapsulated materials because liposomes are stable, lipids-based nanoparticles that are resistant to breakdown through digestion or oxidation, and hence can improve the bioavailability of their cargo [77]. To test whether nutritional supplements containing PAs also contain liposomes we performed Cryo-TEM analysis of the SRS, TCF, TNF and the desiccated thymus material, TD. Supplements that did not contain appreciable levels of PAs were excluded from further study. We detected liposomes in solutions of SRS, TCF and TNF supplements (Fig 3A–C), while TD was devoid of liposomal structures (Fig 3D). (A-D) Representative images of SRS, TCF, TNF and TD supplements, show the presence of liposomal particles in the SRS, TCF and TNF (A-C; red arrows), but not in TD (D).

Scale bars in (A-D): 500 nm. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.g003 DLS analysis showed that the average size of liposomes present in TNF was larger compared to SRS and TCF supplements (Table 1; S1 Fig A–C). NTA analysis further revealed that SRS contains the highest numbers of liposomal particles compared to TCF and TNF supplements (Table 2). Together, these data demonstrate that the tested supplements composed of plant- and bovine tissue-derived materials contain liposomal particles, which are known to protect the encapsulated molecules from premature breakdown, thus increasing their bioavailability. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.t001 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.t002 The presence of liposomal particles in the SRS, TCF and TNF nutritional supplements led us to investigate whether PAs in these supplements were encapsulated within the liposomes. Each of the supplements was examined in 3 distinct ways (see Materials and Methods): 1) putrescine, spermidine and spermine were measured in perchloric acid solutions of supplement powders using HPLC (assessing total free PA content), 2) total putrescine, spermidine and spermine were measured in solutions following the destruction of the liposomes (assessing total PA content), and 3) putrescine, spermidine and spermine were measured in destructed liposomes specifically (assessing encapsulated PA content). We found that among the tested supplements, TNF contained the highest total amounts of PAs, measured following the destruction of the liposomes (Total PA content; Table 3). The encapsulation efficiency of PAs was difficult to assess, most likely due to the known vulnerability of liposomes to destruction during the ultracentrifugation process, resulting in losses of certain types of entrapped molecular cargo [79,80]. Relatively low abundance of liposomes in the solutions of each supplement (Table 2; Fig 3) and the limitations of the HPLC assay used (detection limit of 5 µg/mL) could have also contributed to low recovery of the encapsulated PAs. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.t003 Partly owing to their positive charge, most PAs within the cells are bound to RNA and exist in PA-RNA complexes [24,38]. We therefore examined whether liposomal particles found in the SRS, TCF and TNF supplements contain RNA. We found that RNA was present in all the tested supplements and that RNA in the TNF supplement was predominantly contained within the liposomal particles, evidenced by the highest encapsulation efficiency detected for TNF (91%) (Table 4). Negligible amount of DNA was detected in TCF, and none in the SRS and TNF supplements (S4 Table). These results show that RNA molecules can be potentially delivered by the SRS, TCF and TNF supplements, with most of the RNA contained in the TNF supplement being encapsulated within the liposomal particles. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.t004 Rapid cyclic interconversion and catabolism of PAs are intricately regulated processes that partly rely on the tissue abundance of each of the PAs and ultimately determine their levels in the blood [63]. To begin investigating whether PAs present in the SRS, TCF and TNF supplements are bioavailable and can impact circulating PA levels, we measured blood PA concentrations at baseline and 5 timepoints within a 6-hour period following supplement administration to rats by oral gavage. Each supplement was administered at a dose that delivered approximately 0.12–0.2 mg/kg BW of spermidine and 0.05–0.13 mg/kg BW of spermine. As expected, we observed rapid changes in the concentrations of PAs in response to the oral delivery of each of the three tested supplements, with these changes being highly similar between the groups (Fig4). First, blood levels of putrescine were moderately decreased 1 hour after the gavage procedure, followed by a gradual increase in blood putrescine levels with each of the three supplements (Fig 4A, B; p < 0.0001); a significant effect of time variable was observed at 6 hours after supplement administration compared to baseline (Baseline vs 6 hours: p < 0.0001). On the contrary, blood levels of spermidine gradually and significantly decreased during the 6 hours after the oral gavage procedure (Fig 4C, D; p < 0.0001), with significant effect of time variable observed at 1–6 hours following supplement administration (Baseline vs 1 hour: p = 0.0006; Baseline vs 2 hours: p < 0.0001; Baseline vs 4 hours: p < 0.0001; Baseline vs 6 hours: p < 0.0001). Blood levels of spermine, on the other hand, steadily increased following supplement administration (Fig 4E, F; p < 0.0001), with significant effect of time variable observed at 2–6 hours after supplement administration (Baseline vs 2 hours: p < 0.0001; Baseline vs 4 hours: p = 0.021; Baseline vs 6 hours: p < 0.0001). These results show that oral administration of either SRS, TCF or TNF leads to rapid increases in blood concentrations of putrescine and spermine, and a decrease in spermidine. Rats received one oral dose of either SRS, TCF or TNF (see Materials and Methods) and blood concentrations of PAs were measured using UPLC-MS/MS at following time intervals: Baseline, 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hrs, 4 hrs and 6 hrs (see Materials and Methods). N = 6 animals per group. PA concentrations are shown in (A, C, E) and concentration changes compared to baseline in (B, D, F). Data are shown as Mean ± S.E.M.; * - significant effect of Time variable by Repeated Measures ANOVA and Bonferroni/Dunn post-hoc test, p < 0.05. Rats received one oral dose of either SRS, TCF or TNF (see Materials and Methods) and blood concentrations of PAs were measured using UPLC-MS/MS at following time intervals: Baseline, 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hrs, 4 hrs and 6 hrs (see Materials and Methods). N = 6 animals per group. PA concentrations are shown in (A, C, E) and concentration changes compared to baseline in (B, D, F). Data are shown as Mean ± S.E.M.; * - significant effect of Time variable by Repeated Measures ANOVA and Bonferroni/Dunn post-hoc test, p < 0.05. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.g004 Having established that the SRS and bovine thymus gland-derived cytosolic and nuclear extracts contain liposomal particles and can deliver liposomal PAs, we hypothesized that prolonged supplementation with the SRS, TCF or TNF would have a distinct effect on PA homeostasis in the blood and in tissues compared to the observed rapid changes in blood PA levels shortly after supplement administration. Sustained delivery of liposomal PAs could potentially affect the enzymes and antizymes involved in PA metabolism and catabolism at the transcriptional and translational levels. We therefore assessed blood and tissue PA concentrations in rats supplemented with the SRS, TCF and TNF for 28 days. Each supplement was administered orally at the same dose of 175 mg/kg BW twice per day. We found that the blood levels of putrescine were reduced by over 15% following sustained supplementation with SRS and TCF, and by over 30% with TNF administration compared to baseline levels (Fig 5A, B; Tables 5–6). On the contrary, blood levels of spermidine increased following sustained SRS and TNF supplementation, with TNF administration resulting in the largest blood spermidine increase of over 22% (Fig 5C, D; Tables 5–6). Finally, blood levels of spermine were modestly reduced only with SRS supplementation (Fig 5E, F; Tables 5–6), tended to increase with TNF treatment, and remained largely unchanged in TCF-supplemented animals compared to baseline. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.t005 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.t006 (A, C, E) Blood concentrations of putrescine were significantly reduced in SRS-, TCF- and TNF-supplemented animals (A), spermidine levels significantly increased following supplementation with SRS and TNF (C) and spermine levels did not change significantly between the groups (E) on Day 29 compared to baseline (Day 0). Data are shown as minimum/maximum box plots, N = 6 animals per group. (B, D, F) Changes in blood putrescine (B), spermidine (D) and spermine (F) from baseline are shown as individual values and the mean; * - p < 0.05 by Paired Student’s t-test (please, see Table 5). (A, C, E) Blood concentrations of putrescine were significantly reduced in SRS-, TCF- and TNF-supplemented animals (A), spermidine levels significantly increased following supplementation with SRS and TNF (C) and spermine levels did not change significantly between the groups (E) on Day 29 compared to baseline (Day 0).

We found that the levels of all three PAs in brain tissues were not significantly different between the SRS-, TCF- and TNF-supplemented animals (Fig 6A–C; Table 7). However, the levels of spermidine and spermine in the heart and liver tissues differed between the supplementation groups. Specifically, TNF-supplemented animals displayed increased levels of spermidine in the heart compared to TCF-supplemented group (Fig 6E; effect of Treatment variable: p = 0.0461 by Bonferroni/Dunn post-hoc test; Table 7). In the liver, spermidine levels were significantly higher in TNF-supplemented animals compared to SRS-supplemented animals (Fig 6H; effect of Treatment variable: p = 0.0043 by Bonferroni-Dunn post-hoc analysis; Table 7), accompanied by the increased levels of spermine (Fig 6I; effect of Treatment variable: p = 0.0232 by Bonferroni/Dunn post-hoc test; Table 7). Liver putrescine levels remained unchanged between the groups (Fig 6G; Table 7). Importantly, no significant changes in spermine/spermidine ratios, which are known to decrease in diseased states, were observed in the blood or tissues of TNF-supplemented animals, while blood spermine/spermidine ratio decreased with SRS supplementation (S2 Fig) [18,81]. Thus, among the three tested supplements, TNF is most potent at raising the blood and tissue levels of spermidine and spermine without affecting the spermine/spermidine ratios. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.t007 Concentrations of putrescine, spermidine and spermine were measured in tissues of supplemented animals at the end of the 28-day supplementation period. (A-C) In brain tissues, no differences in PA levels were observed between the supplementation groups. (D-F) In heart tissues, TNF supplementation resulted in increased spermidine levels compared to TCF-supplemented animals.

Considering that endogenous PA synthesis may gradually diminish with age, along with the increasing PA catabolism, reduction in PA production by the gut bacteria and compromised intestinal absorption during aging, nutritional supplementation with PA-containing products and increased dietary intake of PA-rich foods are plausible approaches towards ensuring adequate availability of PAs in older adults [1,9,14,16,82,83]. However, elevating the circulating levels of PAs in the blood, which are thought to reflect their tissue levels as well, through dietary supplementation appears to be challenging [5,53,58,60,82]. In this study, we describe a novel finding that the cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of bovine thymus gland, TCF and TNF, as well as a nutritional supplement containing wheat germ, SRS, can all serve as the sources of dietary PAs, with TNF being most potent at elevating blood and tissue levels of spermidine. Among the materials tested in this study, TNF elicited the largest increase in blood spermidine levels (22%) after 28 days of supplementation. This effect of TNF is not likely to be mediated strictly by the total amounts of PAs it contains, but to their liposomal encapsulation in this particular type of thymus gland extract. Indeed, we found that the concentration of total spermidine is the highest in the SRS material, which contains wheat germ (approximately 207 mg/kg) – nearly double the amounts detected in TCF and TNF (approximately 86 mg/kg and 75 mg/kg, respectively). This finding is consistent with the reports that wheat germ is a good dietary source of PAs [47]. Between the bovine thymus gland-derived supplements, however, TNF contains the lowest amount of spermine, but the highest amount of PA precursor – putrescine (approximately 152 mg/kg). Surprisingly, the nuclear fraction extracts of two other bovine organs we tested, liver and heart, do not contain appreciable amounts of putrescine, spermidine or spermine, suggesting that PA content in these extracts may be low due to distinct cellular compositions of liver and heart tissues compared to thymus, or due to losses during the nuclear material extraction procedure. Nevertheless, this study is the first to report on the presence of PAs in nutritional supplements composed of natural ingredients, including bovine glandular tissue extract and wheat germ, and the effects of these supplements on PA homeostasis in vivo. Nutritional supplementation with PAs is typically approached using plant extracts, including bacterial fermentation products (i.e., wheat germ extract; natto), or synthetic PA forms [1,53,58,59]. Liposomal forms of spermidine are also available as supplements and can potentially increase its bioavailability, but to our knowledge, their effectiveness in supporting blood or tissue PA levels has yet to be reported. In this study, we show that SRS, TCF and TNF contain lipid nanoparticles that fit the characteristics of liposomes – bilayer vesicles composed of lipids and phospholipids, which can spontaneously form in aqueous solutions and primarily encapsulate hydrophilic molecules present in such solutions (i.e., positively charged polyamines) [84]. Interestingly, the concentration of lipid nanoparticles in the SRS (5.15x108 particles/mL) is nearly double their concentration in the TNF supplement (2.53x108 particles/mL), while nanoparticle average size is the largest in TNF among the tested supplements – 285 nm compared to 151 nm in TCF and 207 nm in the SRS. The size distribution of the observed nanoparticles (151–258 nm in diameter), combined with their presence in the extracts of the intracellular cytoplasmic and nuclear materials, excludes the possibility of them being either exosomes, which only reach approximately 100 nm is diameter, or other types of extracellular, secreted microvesicles [85,86]. The PDI values, which serve as measures of liposome quality during their production, were below 0.7 for all three tested supplements, indicating that liposomal particles contained in these materials are relatively uniform with respect to their sizes [87]. Unlike the artificial liposomes designed for the improvement of drug or vitamin/nutrient formulations and delivery, which are typically produced using defined ratios of phospholipids isolated from soy, eggs, milk, bacteria or synthetic phospholipids [84,88–91], self-assembly of liposomes found in the SRS, TCF and TNF is likely to be induced during the extraction process from the lipids that naturally exist within the plant and animal tissue intracellular materials. Hence, we observed that the desiccated (freeze dried) thymus material, which was not subjected to the extraction process, does not contain liposomal particles. While the sizes of liposomes observed in the SRS, TCF and TNF supplements (> 151 nm) suggest that they are likely to enter cells via endocytosis [87], and micropinocytosis specifically, further studies are needed to determine the precise lipid compositions of these particles, their content and physiological properties. Because PAs can promote aggregation and fusion of liposomes, and often exist within the molecular complexes containing RNA, it is not surprising that these lipid particles are found in PA-rich extracts of plant and thymus gland materials used in this study, and also contain RNA in addition to PAs [24,76,92]. Yet, the amounts of PAs and RNA encapsulated in the liposomes vary greatly between the supplements we examined. We show that the concentrations of liposomal PAs, and spermidine in particular, are severalfold higher in the TNF supplement compared to the SRS and TCF materials, and that over 90% of the RNA detected in TNF material is encapsulated within the liposomes. Therefore, it is likely that the delivery of larger amounts of liposomal, as opposed to free PAs, underlies the capacity of TNF supplement to elevate blood and tissue levels of spermidine following a 28-day supplementation period compared to the SRS and TCF. The presence of RNAs within the tested supplements, on the other hand, confirms that lipid nanoparticle-RNA formulations are quite stable [93–95], and that a range of bioactive molecules, including PA-RNA complexes, are encapsulated in the liposomes derived from the animal and plant material extracts. Contrary to appreciable levels of RNA, we detected a small amount of DNA in the TCF, and none in the SRS and TNF supplements, possibly due to DNA degradation and losses in aqueous solutions during plant and animal material extraction processes, especially if salts were present (i.e., salt-dependent proprietary extraction method of nuclear material) [96,97]. We confirmed that larger amounts of RNA compared to DNA are found across multiple nuclear fraction extracts of bovine tissues prepared using the same methodology as TNF. Thus, the technology utilized in the extraction of plant and animal tissue materials, and the types of lipids and soluble molecules present in various types of biological matrices, can determine the probability of liposomal particle assembly and the molecular cargo of the liposomes produced, including the final molecular composition of the product [98]. This study highlights the unique properties of nutritional supplements composed of plant and animal tissue-derived materials and their capacity to deliver a range of bioactive molecules within naturally occurring matrices, including liposomal particles. The bioavailability of PAs contained in the SRS, TCF and TNF is first evidenced by our finding that one dose of each supplement exerts pronounced and immediate effects on blood PA levels. Within 6 hours following supplement administration at doses that in humans would be equivalent to 1.29–2.12 mg of spermidine, we observed gradual and significant increases in blood putrescine and spermine levels (approximately 30%), while spermidine levels gradually declined by approximately 40%. Lack of significant differences in the directions and kinetics of blood PA concentration changes among the three supplementation groups could be explained by comparable concentrations of free, non-liposomal spermine and spermidine in tested supplements that could drive the rapid changes in blood PA levels. The observed increase in blood spermine levels in SRS-, TCF- and TNF-supplemented animals is consistent with previous studies that reported its changes in the blood in response to PA-rich extracts or foods [58,82,99,100]. In addition, preferential association of spermine with cellular membranes or nucleic acids in vivo may contribute to the lower affinity of SSAT enzyme, which regulates cellular PA content, for spermine compared to its acetylated form, N1-acetylspermine, possibly leading to the temporary increase in spermine we observed in this part of the study [101]. An increase in blood putrescine levels, on the other hand, has been demonstrated to occur temporarily in response to spermidine administration in rats, peaking at 6 hours, and to be mediated by PA-dependent induction of SSAT and subsequent conversion of N1-acetylspermidine to putrescine by polyamine oxidase (PAO) [102]. This mechanism could partly explain the temporary depletion of spermidine and concomitant increase in putrescine during the 6-hour period following supplement administration. The increases in blood spermidine levels after 28 days of supplementation with TNF and SRS at doses delivering relatively low total amounts of spermidine, equivalent to approximately 0.53 mg and 0.76 mg per day in humans, respectively, further support the bioavailability of PAs present in these materials. This finding adds to the current understanding of dietary PA metabolism, which is based on studies that reported increases in blood or tissue spermidine levels only with substantially higher spermidine doses or longer supplementation periods [5,53,58,59,100,102]. The observed reduction in blood putrescine levels across the supplementation groups could be explained by possible inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) enzyme by exogenous PAs through Antizyme 1-mediated degradation, leading to attenuated putrescine synthesis [103]. S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC), an enzyme catalyzing the production of decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcAdoMet), which serves a rate limiting role in the synthesis of spermidine and spermine [104,105], and ODC can both be inhibited by spermine and spermidine as part of the mechanism regulating intracellular PA homeostasis, leading to reduced endogenous synthesis of spermine/spermidine and a reduction in putrescine, respectively [106]. SSAT, a key enzyme responsible for the conversion of spermine to spermidine, and spermidine to putrescine, is activated/induced by spermine and spermidine themselves, and may prevent the rise in blood levels of spermine [101,102]. At the same time, the activities of PAO, which can use spermine, N1-acetylspermine and N1-acetylspermidine as substrates, but not spermidine, and spermine oxidase (SMO), can potentially contribute to the elevation in blood levels of spermidine, and not spermine, we observed following 28 days of supplementation with TNF [102,107,108].. The concentrations of PAs in the blood and tissues are linked, such that the variation in health status and diets across individuals contributes to varying blood PA levels observed in human and animal studies, with and without dietary supplementation regimens [5,82]. For example, inflammatory conditions and cancer, among other pathologies, can both lead to dysregulation of PA homeostasis, reflected by either diminished or elevated blood and tissue levels of individual PAs [18,82,109]. Variability in dietary intakes of PA-containing foods can further contribute to inter-personal differences in circulating PA levels [14]. Consistent with this, we detected variability in baseline blood PA levels among the animal groups undergoing 28-day supplementation regimens. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that TNF supplement is superior to the SRS and TCF in increasing blood spermidine concentration compared to baseline values, and in elevating the levels of spermidine in the heart and liver tissues. Consistent with the reports of poor brain penetrance of circulating PAs, we did not detect differences in brain PA levels among the supplementation groups [110,111]. Similarly, we did not detect significant changes in spermine/spermidine ratios, which can reflect diseased states [18,19,81], in the blood and tissues of TNF-supplemented animals – TNF elicited a moderate increase in blood spermine levels concurrently with spermidine, and a significant increase in liver spermine levels compared to the SRS group. On the contrary, an increase in blood spermidine levels with SRS supplementation was not accompanied by an increase in blood spermine levels, leading to a reduction in blood spermine/spermidine ratio in this group. Even though it remains to be determined whether liposomal particles present in each of the tested supplements are transported intact across the intestinal enterocytes or taken up within the Pyer’s patches, as opposed to releasing their content in the intestine [112], TNF, and to a lesser extent SRS, are potent at delivering bioavailable forms of PAs that, even at relatively low doses, increase blood spermidine levels in 28 days. Considering that elevating the circulating levels of PAs through supplementation has been a challenge, oral delivery of these bioactive molecules within the matrices inherent to animal organs that are naturally rich in PAs, such as the extract of the thymus gland described in this study, appears to be an advantage. Adequate dietary supply of PAs is important for ameliorating inflammatory conditions, including systemic chronic inflammation prevalent among aging individuals and leading to decline in health and age-related diseases [28,113–115]. From improving gut barrier integrity and obesity indices, to direct inhibition of inflammatory diseases and proinflammatory status, dietary PA supplementation was shown to be effective in animal models and in humans [60,115,116]. Likewise, we previously demonstrated that in the context of CNS injury, the neuroprotective role of TNF supplement is accompanied by substantial changes in the expression of genes implicated in the regulation of inflammation, autophagy and tissue repair – the processes that are highly relevant to the maintenance of good health during aging [70]. Considering the proposed general decline in PA status among aging individuals, low intake of organ meats in Western diet, and current difficulties in increasing circulating levels of spermidine through dietary means, nutritional supplementation with TNF could be a plausible approach towards delivering bioavailable forms of PAs and supporting health during aging. The effectiveness of TNF in modulating the circulating levels of PAs in humans remains to be evaluated. In this study, we demonstrated that a nutritional supplement containing a nuclear fraction extract of bovine thymus gland (thymus nuclear fraction, TNF) is effective in elevating blood and tissue levels of spermidine within a 28-day treatment period. Since PA-rich diet plays a vital role in preventing age-related diseases and promoting longevity, maintenance of the adequate dietary supply of PAs during aging is of great importance. To date, dietary supplementation with PA-rich products and foods, even if prolonged, has proven to be ineffective in increasing blood and tissue levels of spermine and spermidine. This study demonstrates that spermidine contained in TNF supplement is encapsulated in naturally occurring liposomal particles, which may underly the effectiveness of TNF in increasing spermidine levels in the blood and in tissues. Moreover, we show that acute versus chronic oral administration of polyamines exert distinct effects on the metabolism of putrescine, spermidine and spermine in the blood. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.s001 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.s002 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.s003 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.s004 (DOCX) The dimensions of liposomes and their polydispersity indices (PDI) are shown for the SRS (A), TCF (B) and TNF (C). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331813.s005 (TIF) (A) Blood spermine/spermidine ratio was significantly reduced in SRS-supplemented animals compared to baseline, while no differences in spermine/spermidine ratios among the supplementation groups were detected in tissues: brain (B), heart (C) and liver (D).

Title: Will Apple’s new iPhones cost more? Here’s what to expect from today’s unveiling

By MICHAEL LIEDTKE, AP Technology Writer CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) — Apple on Tuesday rolled out its next generation of iPhones that includes a new ultra-thin model and a slight price hike for one of its high-end models, while the company feels the squeeze of a global trade war. The iPhone 17 line-up includes a new slimmed-down model that will adopt the “Air” name that Apple already uses for its sleekest iPads and Mac computers. In what has become an annual rite for Apple, all four new iPhone 17 models will feature better cameras and longer-lasting batteries than last year’s line-up. The iPhone 17 will all boast at least 256 gigabytes of storage, doubling the minimum amount from the last generation. “We are raising the bar again,” Apple CEO Tim Cook boasted in front of a crowd gathered in an auditorium named after the company’s late co-founder, Steve Jobs, located on its campus in Cupertino, California. The new iPhones are the first to be released since President Donald Trump returned to the White House and unleashed a barrage of tariffs, in what his administration says is an attempt to bring overseas manufacturing back to the U.S. — a crusade that has thrust Cook into the hot seat. All the iPhone 17 models are still expected to be made in Apple’s manufacturing hubs in China and India, exposing them to some of Trump’s tariffs. Analysts believe the additional fees on iPhones coming into the U.S. increase the pressure on Apple to raise prices to help protect its profit margins on its most marquee product. Without giving a specific reason, Apple will charge $1,100 for the iPhone 17 Pro, an increase of $100, or 10%, from previous versions of that model. The iPhone Air will start at $1,000 — the price of last year’s iPhone 16 Pro. Apple is sticking with the same starting price for the basic iPhone 17 at $800 and the iPhone 17 Pro Max at $1,200. All four models will be in stores Sept. 19. Apple’s shares fell nearly 2% in Tuesday’s late afternoon trading. In a move aimed at the selfie culture, the iPhone 17 models will feature a front camera with more megapixels for crisper photos. The front camera will also have an option called “Center Stage” that will take advantage of a wider view of field and a new sensor that will enable users to take landscape photos without having to rotate the iPhone. Although most of the upgrades to the iPhone 17 are similar to the incremental improvements of recent years, Apple appears to have done enough to “bring a sense of newness to the iPhone, which has remained the same for too long,” said PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore. While the iPhone 16 released last year fared reasonably well, the models didn’t sell quite as well as analysts had anticipated because Apple failed to deliver all of the artificial intelligence features it had promised, including a smarter and more versatile Siri assistant. The Siri improvements have been pushed back until next year. The global trade war has compounded Apple’s challenges. Both Trump and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have repeatedly insisted that iPhones be made in the U.S. instead of overseas. It’s an unrealistic demand that analysts say would take years to pull off and would result in a doubling, or even a tripling, of the iPhone’s current average price of about $1,000. Cook tried to placate Trump by initially pledging that Apple would invest $500 billion i n the U.S. over the next four years, and then upped the ante last month by adding another $100 billion to the commitment. He also gifted Trump a statue featuring a 24-karat gold base. That kind of diplomacy has helped insulate Apple from Trump’s most severe tariffs. However, with the iPhones being brought into the U.S. still facing duties of about 25%, some analysts speculated the company would raise prices to help preserve the its heft profit margins. But for the most part, Apple — and even rivals such as Google — is sticking with the same price tags it’s slapped on its newest iPhones over recent years. Although Apple’s stock price is still down by 4% so far this year, the shares have been bouncing back in recent months amid signs it won’t be as hard hit by the tariffs as once feared, and a highly anticipated court ruling cleared the way for the company to continue receiving $20 billion annually to lock in Google’s search engine as the default option on iPhones.

Title: Microsoft continues layoffs with 42 more roles cut for the fifth month in a row — with an $80B reason behind it

The company is investing $80 billion in AI, but it faces criticism amid ongoing job eliminations in a shift towards automation. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. It’s a new month, and unfortunately, that means even more layoffs at Microsoft. This time, it’s not thousands of employees, but just over 40 roles in Redmond (via Seattle Times). Even so, it marks the fifth consecutive month of job cuts in 2025, bringing the total to more than 15,000 employees since Microsoft announced its $80 billion AI investment commitment. The question now is whether these smaller September layoffs signal a slowdown, or if Microsoft plans to continue trimming staff month after month to make way for its AI-powered future. Microsoft at least appears to be following a trend regarding its layoffs. The latest round in Redmond targeted engineering, product management, and legal roles at its headquarters. The cuts are far smaller than earlier rounds — 6,000 jobs in May and 9,000 in July — but they still form part of Microsoft’s broader restructuring plan. This steady drip of layoffs suggests a deliberate effort to keep pressure on costs, even if the numbers are smaller. It raises an uncomfortable question: has Microsoft normalized monthly layoffs as part of its new way of operating? In 2025, Microsoft announced that $80 billion investment into AI — a $25 billion increase from the previous year. The money is going into data centers, custom chipsets, cloud expansion, and further development of tools like Copilot. Satya Nadella described this as the “enigma of success,” pointing to record profits but also the pressure to reduce costs. That tension is at the heart of recent criticism. The investment commitment came before the bulk of layoffs, creating frustration as Microsoft pushed ahead with massive spending while cutting thousands of jobs. At the same time, the company has been urging employees to rely more heavily on AI tools in their workflows. Microsoft also laid out 40 job roles at risk of being eliminated by AI. The layoffs also followed news that Microsoft had secured $6 billion in government savings over three years, adding to the perception that the cuts are less about financial necessity and more about long-term priorities. The bigger picture is clear: Microsoft is shifting resources to secure dominance in AI, not responding to immediate financial struggles. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Layoffs at Microsoft seem to be part of a bigger transformation, and it’s not all about saving money. Roles have been cut across key parts of the company, including Xbox, LinkedIn, engineering, legal, product management, research, support, and sales. At the same time, Microsoft is still hiring — but the focus has shifted. The company is bringing in talent for AI, machine learning, cloud infrastructure, and Copilot development. Satya Nadella has even said that a portion of Microsoft’s code is now written by AI, and I’ve noticed a new role floating around online: “professional vibe code cleaners” (via LinkedIn). I’d like to think anyone using AI to write code at Microsoft can actually code themselves, or at least I hope so. To balance this shift, Microsoft is also investing in reskilling. Its $4 billion “Elevate” program aims to help millions of people prepare for jobs in the AI era, reflecting a longer-term vision of how the workforce will evolve. Any round of layoffs, especially at Microsoft’s scale, creates anxiety and uncertainty. A culture of fear and job insecurity can quickly take hold. On top of that, employees face the added pressure of learning new AI tools just as those same tools are replacing traditional roles — something that understandably leaves a sour taste. This isn’t unique to Microsoft. Amazon, Meta, Google, and others are making similar AI-driven cuts. Workflows across the industry are shifting as companies double down on automation and AI-powered systems. The September layoffs are not an isolated event, but part of a broader transformation. Microsoft, and the tech sector as a whole, is clearly prioritizing AI, even if that means reshaping work in ways that feel deeply unsettling for many employees.

Title: Lululemon Stock: Buy The Dip Or Wait It Out?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/09/lululemon-stock-buy-the-dip-or-wait-it-out/
Time Published: 2025-09-09T10:00:00Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Lululemon stock (NASDAQ: LULU) has emerged as one of the more divisive names in the market for 2025. A mix of guidance reductions, tariff challenges, and decreasing product momentum has resulted in a 56% decline in shares year-to-date, while the S&P 500 has risen by 10%. This discrepancy raises an important question: has the market reacted excessively, or are the threats to growth and profitability more fundamental? Valuation introduces another dimension to this discussion. Once regarded as a high-growth premium brand, Lululemon is now trading at just 14 times trailing earnings, presenting a discount compared to its historical average and the market's 24 times multiple. Financially, the company continues to yield strong margins, returns on capital, and free cash flow. With a market cap of $20 billion and $1.4 billion in trailing free cash flow, the stock offers a cash flow yield of nearly 7%. When compared to competitors like Nike, this positioning seems appealing — although whether the multiple will adjust upward relies on management's capability to stimulate U.S. demand while managing rising costs. For investors who prefer lower volatility compared to individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio offers an alternative, having surpassed the S&P 500 and produced returns of over 91% since its launch. Additionally, check out Broadcom: AVGO Stock’s Path To $600 Lululemon exceeded earnings expectations with an EPS of $3.10 compared to estimates of $2.87, though revenue slightly missed at $2.53B against projections of $2.54B. The main issue, however, was the reduction in guidance. The company lowered its full-year revenue forecast to $10.85B–$11.0B (down from $11.15B–$11.3B) and EPS to $12.77–$12.97 (down from $14.58–$14.78). This adjustment, rather than the quarterly performance itself, caused the most recent selloff in the stock. Lululemon’s U.S. same-store sales in Q2 FY 2025 decreased by 4%, indicating ongoing weakness in its core domestic market. Conversely, same-store sales increased by 17% in China and by 12% across other international markets. Lululemon is contending with various challenges beyond its guidance. The elimination of the U.S. de minimis exemption will result in roughly $240 million in additional import duties, leading to an overall operating cost impact estimated at around $320 million by 2026. Management has also recognized brand fatigue, with CEO Calvin McDonald mentioning that the assortment has grown “too predictable.” To address this issue, the company intends to refresh its offerings, increasing the proportion of new styles from 23% to 35% by next spring. Lululemon concluded the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash, which represents 15.4% of total assets, against $1.7 billion in lease liabilities, its primary form of debt. This results in a conservative debt-to-equity ratio of merely 8.3%. With no traditional debt on the balance sheet and substantial liquidity, the company is well-equipped to withstand short-term disruptions without compromising its growth ambitions. There’s no denying it: Lululemon has a track record of significant declines during market corrections. It decreased by 46% in the downturn of 2022 (compared to the S&P’s 25%), fell 47% during the early 2020 Covid shock (versus 34%), and faced a severe drop of 92% in the 2008 crash (in contrast to 57%). Investors must recognize that with LULU, strong fundamentals do not always provide protection against sharp changes in sentiment. View LULU Dip Buyer Analyses to discover how the stock has bounced back from significant dips in the past. Lululemon’s fundamentals — solid margins, global growth, and a clean balance sheet — remain robust, while the stock’s valuation has adjusted to attractive levels. The business continues to be premium, but the price is no longer reflective of that. Investing in a single stock carries inherent risks. Alternatively, you might consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its benchmark consisting of all-cap stocks (a mix of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to yield significant returns for investors. What accounts for that? The quarterly rebalanced structure of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has provided an adaptable means to capitalize on favorable market conditions while minimizing losses during downturns, as illustrated in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: I've used the Dreame U20 for months and it still surprises me how well this affordable cordless vacuum cleans pet hair

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. If you're after a budget vacuum that's capable of handling messes – especially pet-made ones – the U20 is one to consider. Even without industry-leading suction, it cleans hard floors well and is extremely maneuverable. Moreover, its classy color scheme makes it look more premium than it costs. The lack of a display to gauge battery life is my only gripe but, again, it's hard to fault at the U20's affordable price point. Great value for money Good suction for hair and fur Lightweight & easy to maneuvre Useful attachments, including a wall mount Headlight on cleaning head is a nice touch No LCD display Average battery life Small dustbin Longer recharging time Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you're buying the best. Find out more about how we test. Hailing from parent company, Xiaomi, Dreame is fast becoming a popular sub-brand with an extensive product lineup. Ranging from wet-dry vacuums, air purifiers, robot vacuums (including a robot lawnmower), cordless stick vacuums and hair dryers, Dreame has it all, and across different budgets, too. While its high-end robovacs are items to dream about (pun intended), as you can see in our Dreame X50 Ultra review, I’m in love with a much cheaper product that helps me clean up after my pets. The affordable Dreame U20 has become my lifesaver, combining Dyson-like tech with the signature Dreame style. It’s a versatile and lightweight cordless vacuum that delivers great performance for an exceptionally low cost, as it’s very frequently discounted. Its color scheme belies its budget price point – available in a gorgeous gold and beige colourway, the Dreame U20 looks far more premium than its $249.99 / £250 / AU$399.99 price point suggests. What I found even more impressive is its suction. For the price, its 120AW power isn’t bad at all, which isn’t too far off the Shark Cordless Detect Pro’s 123AW of suction, and yet it was more than enough to clean my pup’s fur off my sofa and carpets well. Needless to say, it handles hard floors very easily, making it a candidate for being one of the best cordless vacuum cleaners. It comes with the standard attachments, including a multi-surface brush head with LED blue lights to illuminate dark areas, a mini motorized brush for cleaning upholstery, a crevice tool and a removable battery that's rated for up to 60 minutes. Realistically, though, you'll get no more 37-40 minutes when using the two motorized attachments on the lowest suction, but that's fine for smaller homes – I can easily vacuum my living area, two bedrooms and two bathrooms within that time. However, if you mostly have carpets, I found it can take longer to get it clean as you may need to go back and forth a few times, thus consuming more battery. The only battery indicator on the U20 is a tiny light on the end cap, which is hard to see while in use, and it blinks when it’s running low. There’s also no quick charging here, and the vacuum can take up to 3.5 hours to fully recharge. The only other downside to this otherwise great buy is that the dustbin capacity is only 0.5L, meaning you might need to empty it frequently if you have a large home with pets. If you don't need any more bells and whistles, the Dreame U20 is easy to recommend as a top-notch budget cordless vacuum cleaner. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The Dreame U20 can be picked up in the US at Target for a list price of $249.99. It’s also available on Instacart, with supplies stocked at Costco and other smaller retailers. It is currently not available on Dreame's US store. In the UK, the list price is £250, and you can pick it up from Amazon UK or Curry's, but again, the vacuum is currently unavailable at the brand's UK store. For customers living in Australia, Amazon AU lists it for AU$399.99, but it's typically discounted to AU$199.99. Even in Australia, the U20 isn't available on the Dreame website. The Dreame website lists 27 countries where its devices are available, including the U20. If you're having trouble finding the product, check their website to see if it's available where you live. Even at full price, the Dreame U20 represents superb value for money, particularly if you can find it at a discounted price. Admittedly it's a very basic model, so if you want a touch more suction, Dreame has other mid-range models, with the Dreame R20 review scoring very well for balancing price and performance. Type: Cordless stick vacuum Bagless: Yes Weight: 7.27 lbs / 3.3kg Bin size: 0.5 liters / 500ml Max runtime: 60 mins Charge time: 3.5 hours Tools: Multi-surface brush head, motorized mini brush head, wide combination crevice tool and extension rod Power: 120AW I’m new to the world of vacuum testing, with just one other for sister site Tom’s Guide under my belt. Needless to say, the Dreame U20 has been quite the dream, especially when it came to design. For me, the gold and beige colorway was a winner, a stray away from the typical grey or black of other competitors. It lends the affordable vacuum a classy look. Other than that, the Dreame U20 has a stock-standard design which allows it to become a handheld unit quickly for cleaning cars, sofas, mattresses and, hey, even dog beds. To pair with the handheld unit, there’s a motorized mini brush in the box that would be handy for said dog bed and the sofa. It could even be used on carpeted stairs. It has a trigger, like most Dyson models, but you don’t need to keep this pressed at all times to run the machine – you just need to click it on and off. There’s just one other control button on the motor’s end cap to change suction modes and that should be easy to reach for most users with the thumb when holding the U20. The main floor-cleaning attachment is called the Multi-Surface Brush, which features LED blue lights that help illuminate the floor in front of the brush head but don’t highlight miniscule dust particles like Dyson’s Fluffy tool does. And that’s OK because it still helps you see in dark areas – for example, I was able to see scattered kitty litter in an unlit bathroom. The other attachment in the box is a combination crevice tool, but a wall-mount kit also ships with the vacuum in case you want to stow it away in a convenient place without compromising floor space. Weighing 3.3kg / 7.27lbs, the Dreame U20 isn't exactly lightweight (in comparison, the Shark Cordless Detect Pro weighs 2.7kg / 5.9lbs), but it's still very easy to push around. It measures 16cm x 30cm x 68cm with the extension rod attached. The 120AW motor is capable of running at three different speed modes, indicated by three lights on the end cap of the motor. You can switch between the speed settings (low, medium and high) by tapping the button directly below the lights and switching it on by using the trigger. For most cleans, I found I tended to flick between medium and high, especially when cleaning carpets. According to Dreame, the U20 motor has a multi-layer filtration system that captures up to 99.9% of fine dust and particles. Its HEPA filter also keeps debris out of the air and inside the bin while vacuuming, which is pretty standard for any cordless vacuum cleaner these days. For its price point, the 0.5L bin is quite standard, but it'll likely fill up fast if you have, say, a two-bedroom or larger home with pets, meaning you'll need to make more trips to empty it. The bin has a handy sticker on the front (which I did refer back to many times) that indicates how to insert or remove it to empty, and its as simple as pushing the button on the base and twisting the canister clockwise. After detaching, all you have to do is unscrew the filter from the container to remove the debris – finer dust or crumbs fall out easily, but you may need to get your fingers inside to remove clumps of hair from the bin. The detachable battery pack could be handy for some users as you can clip it into the wall-mount attachment and begin charging it while you’re emptying the vacuum for example. However, if you’re a renter who can't drill holes into your wall – like me – you can leave the battery attached to the U20 and keep the vacuum propped up against a wall or in a cupboard for topping up. It lacks an LCD screen to show suction modes or time remaining before the next charge. Instead, the battery life is displayed by a small vertical light on the pack itself, which flashes when it needs charging. It's unfortunate that it faces forward, so it’s not visible to the user, and neither is it a very noticeable light – and this is my biggest complaint with the Dreame U20 as there were a few instances where the machine shut down mid-clean during my testing. The U20’s multi-surface brush head is quite similar to many floor-cleaning attachments from other brands, but it features blue LED lights on the front that illuminate two small triangular sections of the floor immediately in front of the brush head. While it looks similar to Dyson’s green dust-illuminating light on the Fluffy Optic, this blue light doesn’t highlight invisible dust on the floor, but I found it’s bright and vivid enough to help walk around in a dark room without bumping into things. Case in point: it perfectly showed scattered kitty litter in an unlit bathroom that was, at the time, pitch dark. The brush also has V-shaped bristles with comb-like teeth – in my experience, this not only prevents tangles effectively, but can pick up human hair and pet fur from low-pile carpets just as well. This brush head is quite flexible, rotating 90º around chair legs and furniture. It’s also not as large as you’d find on other (more expensive) vacuum cleaners and I found it can get into corners, which is particularly helpful in my pet hair-filled home. My favorite attachment, however, is the motorized mini brush, which clips in just under the bin for handheld use. It’s just right for sucking up fur from my couch and cushions – it’s both maneuvrable and anti-tangle. If it wasn’t for the missing display to check battery life, I’d say that Dreame would deserve top marks for the U20’s design. I've spent a few months with the Dreame U20 (as of publishing this review) and I still can’t get over how impressive its maneuverability is. The 90º rotating main brush head makes it very easy to clean around chair legs and furniture and I had no trouble handling the 3.3kg / 7.2lbs vacuum. That said, if you are using the extension tube to clean ceiling corners, the U20 could begin to feel heavy for some users quickly. The controls are well placed, which are as simple as pushing the end cap button to select the speed and hitting the trigger underneath. And as I’ve mentioned previously, there’s no need to keep the latter depressed continuously for power like a Dyson. Speaking of power: sure, we could ask for higher suction than its 120AW, but given its price point, it’s hard to argue with what it has. If you do need better performance, you could consider the Dreame R20 (if it’s available where you live), but I found the U20 does an admirable job nonetheless. It can struggle on some carpets as you will need to go over a particular spot multiple times to get a deeper clean, and I've found myself needing to push with full shoulder force on occasion. Throughout my testing, the Dreame U20 impressed in more ways than one. I performed TechRadar’s standard tests for vacuum cleaners, sprinkling a smattering of oats and tea from a bag on both my hardwood and carpeted floors. As an extra measure, I also made sure the floors had extra pet debris – i.e. kitty litter and fur – which were my two motivations for purchasing the U20 in the first place. During the hardwood mess test, the U20 performed remarkably well on the lowest speed setting in picking up most of the oats. I needed to boost the speed to the second (or medium) setting to do another pass to pick up every last speck of oats, though, but that left the hard floor entirely clean. As for the tea, the U20 did a better job, sucking it all up in one go on the low setting, so it handles lighter and smaller dirt better than larger debris. It was the same for pet hair on hardwood – all strands got sucked up in one pass on the low setting. The vacuum struggled a touch with kitty litter, leaving a few specks behind on hard floors in a single pass, but it was cleaned up in the second go. I wasn’t expecting as impressive a performance on carpets, but the U20 did better than I had anticipated on a low-pile carpet in my tests, quickly removing the oats and tea dust from a bag in one pass on the low suction setting. It will, however, struggle with medium and high-pile carpets, particularly if the dust and debris is deep-seated, although loose dirt will come away if you give the area a few gos with the U20. In terms of pet hair on carpet, the U20 did indeed struggle at the lowest setting, leaving more than a few strands behind after the first pass. The U20 performed the best with pet hair on the same low-pile carpet at maximum suction, and didn't require several passes to get the job done. The kitty litter yielded a similar result to the hardwood floor test, but I needed to boost suction again to pick up every last piece. While it can tackle low-pile carpets with ease, pet hair embedded in medium- or high-pile carpets will remain even after several passes – you can expect about 80% off the fur to be sucked up from these kinds of flooring. As a pet mum, it was important to me to own a vacuum cleaner with a tangle-free brush, as I’ve often painstakingly cleaned out wads of hair from cleaning attachments of older machines. I was thrilled to find that the U20's V-shaped bristles were especially impressive at leaving no evidence of entanglements. That's made ongoing maintenance of the vacuum easier. This sentiment also rang true for the mini motor brush when cleaning my couch and cushions. It does, however, require several passes when using the handheld motor and mini brush to clean up pet hair due to its smaller footprint, but it still worked a treat. The U20 collects a nice volume of hair in its 0.5L bin, and I have particularly enjoyed how easy it is to empty the bin with a twist of the base. If you are a pet owner with a shedding furry friend, then I would recommend the U20 for a quick, daily tidy-up, but you might want to consider other pet-focused vacuum cleaners, like the Shark Stratos Pet Pro (IZ400), as they usually have a larger-capacity bin and boast more suction power. Despite its relatively lower suction and smaller bin, the U20 performs very well, given its budget price – it's very easy to recommend for quick clean-ups. According to Dreame, the U20 has a battery life of up to 60 minutes on a full charge, and takes around 3.5 hours to top up from practically empty. Take that number with a pinch of salt, as it indicates runtime when using non-motorized tools, which in this case is the combination crevice attachment only. With a motorized head like the main floor cleaner and the mini brush, I found that it lasts a maximum of 37 minutes on its lowest setting – and there’s no dynamic suction here to drain the battery faster. At TechRadar, we've tested over a hundred vacuum cleaners over the last decade, and we've found that the average battery life for a budget cordless vacuum is around 40 minutes, which puts the U20 on par with others, including the Dyson V8 . Higher the suction, the faster the battery will drain, of course and, in testing, I got about 17 minutes of runtime on a full charge when set to maximum. That’s not bad, considering some premium models like the Dyson V15 Detect can give you lesser runtime on Boost mode (about 8 minutes on a dirty mid-pile carpet), although it automatically adjusts suction power to suit the amount of dirt it detects. So while the U20 has average battery runtime, I’d recommend it for smaller homes or something for the shed, perhaps. Attribute Notes Rating Value Often on sale, the U20 is an excellent budget option with great performance. 5/5 Design The color combination makes it look premium, and its attachments are useful. It would have been good if there was a better way to gauge battery life. 4/5 Performance Great for everyday, quick cleaning, even of pet hair, on hard floors and low-pile carpets, but it may struggle on particularly dirty mid- and high-pile carpets. 4.5/5 Battery Rated for up to 60 minutes, but expect about 35 minutes in real-world use on low power. 4/5 You need something to quickly clean up after your pet The U20 handled masses of pet hair quite well, thanks to its V-shaped multi-surface brush head. You want something easy to maneuver It might be heavier than the likes of the Shark Cordless Detect Pro (which weighs around 2.7kg / 5.9lbs), but its swivelling main brush head makes it very easy to move around, particularly on hard floors. You live in a large home With average battery life for its price point, the U20 is better suited for smaller areas or homes that don't require extensive vacuuming.

Title: Why Can’t Oracle Afford Data Centers?

Read By Tl;dr – Oracle remains the x-axis of AI/cloud computing (but their revenue forecasts are geometric) Update: Oracle reported earnings yesterday, missing on both revenue and profit expectations and reporting slower growth than the much larger Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft. Free cash flow dropped deeper into the red. Oracle’s CAPEX spend dropped from $9.2 billion to $8.5 billion. But they announced they have signed contracts for nearly geometric increases in cloud revenue over the next five years, going from $10.3 billion in the last fiscal year (FY25) to $144 billion in FY30. The stock is up insanely as a result. The discussion of the CAPEX required to realize these revenue forecasts was minimal. Oracle guided to $35 billion in CAPEX for FY26 and threw around some words about how they’re “asset pretty light”. Oracle’s belief in magic beans abides. But no infrastructure, no revenue remains an iron law of the cloud world. Oracle still needs to come up with a lot of capital for CAPEX, amidst other demands for capital (dividends, buybacks to raise Larry’s stake, servicing debt). Oracle’s future is tied to Open AI. The vast majority of the forecasted revenue would come from Open AI. It isn’t clear how Open AI will find hundreds of billions to pay for infrastructure and all their other ambitions. The other customers referenced are neither big nor reliable revenue. xAI has no revenue, no prospects for real revenue, and is already turning to debt funding (plus borrowing from SpaceX). Meta has no business plan to pay for their ($600 billion and counting!) AI mulligan, but likely promised some very expensive employees they’d have GPUs to play with. NVIDIA and AMD paying Oracle for infrastructure is simply revenue recycling. Oracle still has to come up with the cash to play this game. They’re promised the revenue. Now they need to show us the CAPEX to realize that revenue. Update 2: WSJ confirms the vast majority of Oracle’s promised future revenue ($300 billion) would come from Open AI. Oracle stock is now a one-way bet on Open AI’s ability to raise hundreds of billions in more capital. Update 3: I just went ahead and wrote another post about Remaining CAPEX Obligation. Absolute bestest most glorious company ever in entire universe of all time prepare awesome-sauce victory lap. With tomorrow’s earnings announcement the database vampire will permit us to bask in their greatness and invite us to contemplate why other companies even exist. Things are always so fabulous that the Oxford English Dictionary is considering replacing the word “superlative” with “Oracle”. Beyond bombastically scripted earnings calls, deploying CAPEX effectively and efficiently at scale takes place in a cold, hard reality. We’ve been chronicling Oracle’s difficulties building data centers at bonsai scale, never mind at hyperscale: Oracle (company slogan: “that’s not just a rack, it’s an entire region!”) has slowly increased its CAPEX spend, but at a pace that falls further and further behind the hyperCAPEX companies. Oracle’s first decent-sized data center, the oft-touted yet somehow still under construction project in Abilene, is well on its way to becoming the picture accompanying the dictionary definition of “construction site”. Partly it earns that status because it has taken so long, but also because that data center has so many mouths to feed (Blue Owl, Primary Digital Infrastructure, Lancium, Crusoe, Oracle, and Open AI are all laying claim to those construction photos). Oracle’s primary contribution seems to consist of yelling at the contractors. Oracle is “all-in” on their data center plans, and has expended enormous energy to get themselves referred to as a “hyperscaler”. But are they really in the hyperscaler club? Let’s see how Oracle stacks up with actual hyperscalers. This is a high-stakes financial game requiring gargantuan resources and a broad array of competencies. When it comes to the metrics, Oracle always seems to play the role of the x-axis (a joke I never tire of and Oracle never manages to break away from that gravitational pull). Let’s look at some proxies for financial prowess: Oracle is the revenue runt of their aspirational litter. By a lot. Oracle’s cloud infrastructure business is the runt, except for Meta who don’t have a cloud business. (One of the great mysteries of the universe is where Meta sees the return coming from its rapidly escalating infrastructure investment promises — $600 billion and counting!. Unlike our other contestants, they have no cloud services business and a checkered history serving developers. As with Elon, taking a dependency on Meta is high risk. Maybe Meta alone has glimpsed some new zero-to-one geyser of revenue that will pay for all those data centers? Regardless, and reluctantly returning to today’s topic at hand, Meta still has vastly more cash to play this game than Oracle). Three-for-three on runt status. Oracle does show leadership on one metric: the debt to equity ratio. They’re already carrying a much bigger debt load than their desired peer group, while also the company that could most use some credit. For free cash flow (cash flow minus CAPEX), Oracle is yet still again the runt. Oracle’s competitors are both spending much more on CAPEX and still have significant, positive free cash flow. And when we look at the most recent quarter, Oracle’s free cash flow went negative (-$394 million) as they ramped their CAPEX spend to (merely) $9 billion in the quarter. Now let’s look at CAPEX spending, that ultimate separator of clouds and clowns. Emphatically runty. Oracle is already more stressed with their (modest) CAPEX spend relative to revenue. Cumulative CAPEX spending gives us a sense of how much infrastructure a company has deployed. Amazon, AWS, Google, Meta and Microsoft all spent more on CAPEX in the last year than Oracle has in the last decade, and all but Meta spent more last year on CAPEX than Oracle has in its entire fifty year existence. All of which is to say Oracle is both way behind in deployed infrastructure and playing with the smallest stack of chips in this game. Which brings me (at long last!) to my point: Oracle has hyped big revenue growth forecasts for the next couple years. In particular, they tout a deal with Open AI to bring in as much as $30 billion in incremental revenue by FY28 (we’ll ignore the question of why Microsoft decided it didn’t want this business and discarded it to Oracle). If you’re excited about the revenue opportunity in front of Oracle, you also have to grapple with the costs of the infrastructure necessary to deliver that revenue. No infrastructure, no revenue. No CAPEX, no infrastructure. So where does the money for data center CAPEX come from and what are the implications for Oracle’s free cash flow, debt load and/or margins? They need to step up from their current (modest) levels of spending which are already stressing the company’s financials. It is pretty clear Oracle is not very efficient in its CAPEX spend. They’ve been publicly demonstrating they are early on the learning curve, struggling to forecast CAPEX spending a quarter out, much less years out. They’re also in a big hurry, and there is a YOLO infrastructure cost premium. Some hardware is scarce (GPUs, gas turbines). Costs and wait times for both interconnection and hardware delivery have widened, while the hyperCAPEX companies are both bigger buyers and got in the queues earlier. End-to-end, Oracle lacks a manufacturing machine that turns dollars into data centers efficiently and effectively at scale. Over the last three years, Oracle has spent between $1 and $2 of CAPEX per dollar of cloud infrastructure revenue. AWS CAPEX historically has been between 25 to 60% of revenue (and is ramping back up as they deploy AI infrastructure). We could also model CAPEX spend based on the incremental revenue it drives (new capacity allows new revenue), which makes that $30 billion revenue dream even more expensive (and remember those GPUs are short-lived, especially if you’re chasing the pre-training market). It looks like Oracle is going to lean more on OPM (Other People’s Money or perhaps Oracle Pleads for Money) for its CAPEX spending. The data center build team was hit in the recent Oracle layoffs. The Abilene data center is already a layer cake of financial participants. Stargate was briefly the OPM salvation, but it has “struggled to get out of the gate”. Open AI finds itself doing party rounds for both cash and electricity, raising billions of dollars instead of trillions, and scavenging for megawatts rather than gigawatts. Maybe those notoriously charitable financial actors will accept lower returns just to partner with notoriously charitable Oracle? Going the OPM route negatively impacts Oracle margins, architectural control, and time-to-market. How do Oracle’s hyperscaler hopes and dreams get bankrolled?

Title: Thinking more broadly: Bonds beyond vanilla
URL: https://www.mutualfundobserver.com/2025/09/thinking-more-broadly-bonds-beyond-vanilla/
Time Published: 2025-09-08T23:09:18Z
Full Content:
Traditionally, the job description for a core bond manager was numbing: (1) show up for work, (2) buy a bunch of Treasury bonds and some investment grade intermediate corporates, (3) celebrate the trading coup that allowed you to buy the same bond as everyone else but for a quarter basis point less – woohoo!, (4) go home and enjoy a fiber-rich dinner and small glass of red wine. In reality, managers added negligible value. Over 10 years (through August 2025), the core bond fund trailing 75% of its peers returned 1.7% annually, the iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF (a proxy for “the market”) returned 1.8% annually, and a fund leading 75% of its peers returned 2.2%. Net difference between cellar and penthouse: 0.5% per year. (Source: MFOPremium calculations, Lipper Global Datafeed data.) And that’s pretty typical for other trailing periods. As a result, relative returns were highly dependent on efficiency: very large funds with very low expense ratios, able to place bids on very large lots of very efficiently priced bonds, had a nearly unbeatable structural advantage. 10-year performance difference between the top quartile and the bottom quartile Core bond: 0.5% annually (per MFO Premium) Core stock: 1.6% annually (per Morningstar) In a world where US Treasury bonds are the world’s safest investment and among its most reliably profitable, it was an unbeatable recipe. We might be leaving that world behind, which suggests we might need to consider possibilities where diversification and manager judgment might add substantial value. That implies the possibility of considering an ongoing stake in credit rather than just investment grade, in international rather than just U.S., in special situations rather than just vanilla auctions, and in shorter durations. For intelligent investors—regardless of whether financial analysis is a daily habit or a distant interest—it’s becoming increasingly difficult to ignore the mounting alarm bells surrounding the United States’ fiscal outlook. In mid-2025, the national debt stands at over $37 trillion, a sum now greater than the entire American economy. This staggering figure reflects years of budget deficits and a political climate where policy decisions often appear driven more by ideology, self-interest and brinkmanship than any rational economic strategy. Even major investors, once reliant on U.S. Treasury bonds for security, are beginning to question how much longer the world’s largest borrower can sustainably fund its needs without consequence (Drew Desilver, “Key facts about the US national debt,” Pew Research, 8/12/2025). (Sources: Historical Debt Outstanding, US Treasury; Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, 9/2025) These fiscal realities are not happening in isolation. As the U.S. government takes on more debt, with rising costs just to pay interest, confidence in federal bonds has begun to erode. Recent episodes of political gridlock over spending caps and the debt limit have highlighted just how reactive and unpredictable U.S. fiscal policy has become. The practical effect is a new era of vulnerability for traditional income portfolios anchored almost solely on U.S. Treasuries and investment-grade corporates. Investors are seeing the value of home-country assets increasingly shaped by fiscal risk and short-term fixes rather than predictable economic fundamentals. In contrast, a growing number of foreign markets not only boast more attractive valuations but also signal ripening opportunities as non-U.S. economies chart their own paths out of stagnation. Diversification, therefore, isn’t simply about chasing higher yields or speculating abroad—it’s emerging as a necessary hedge against the potential excesses of U.S.-centric fiscal and market dynamics. One measure of that changed dynamic is Research Affiliates’ estimates of the risks and returns, given a series of uniform economic assumptions, of dozens of asset classes. The following table gives the 10 highest Sharpe assets plus the US bond aggregate. Categories in black are fixed income (seven of 11), and blue are equity. (Source: Research Affiliates, Asset Allocation Interactive, 9/2025) By contrast, the three asset classes with negative expected 10-year Sharpe ratios are US Large-Cap stocks (-0.03), Developed Markets Large Growth stocks (-0.06), and US Large Growth stocks (-0.12). Bottom line: investors need to consider looking for core exposure, not just 5% nibbles, in areas beyond the common. The bad news is that many of the most intriguing income investments are not easily accessible to most investors: closed-end interval funds such as RBC Blue Ray Destra International Event-Driven Credit (CEDIX) or Carlyle Tactical Private Credit (TAKNX), often have high minimums and limited brokerage access. Others, such as SEI Opportunistic Income (SIIT) Fund and GMO Emerging Country Debt, are institutional. Those structural quirks – the ability to use leverage and to lock large investments in place by denying investors the chance to redeem at will – give those managers exceptional advantages. That said, there are intriguing options available to regular investors. We searched the MFO Premium database for funds that met six criteria: And, finally, they had to be purchasable. Sixteen funds survived the cut. The funds are sorted by Sharpe ratio. How to read that chart: The first three columns are easy. Name, Lipper fund category, and average yearly return over the past four years. Down capture is the percentage of the US bond market’s downside that the fund captured. A negative down capture means the fund tended to rise when the US bond market fell. The R-squared (R2) measures the degree of correlation between the fund and the US bond market: 100 means that the fund marches in lockstep with the bond market; 0 means the fund is completely independent of it. Finally, visual represents of three performance metrics: a maximum drawdown rating (how far the fund fell relative to its peers), downside deviation rating (called “bad deviation,” it’s a measure of how much a fund routinely falls relative to its peers) and Ulcer rating (our favorite: a measure of how far a fund falls and how long it takes to recover; deep fall + long recovery = massive investor ulcers). In each case, a blue cell signals top 20% performance. MFO does not make “sell now!” or “buy now!” calls, much less predictions about “the 10 funds you absolutely must own!” Those calls are easy to make, impossible to make reliably. Our argument is simpler: we are in the midst of a fiscal mess, which is likely to get messier and messier. It would be prudent, before any panic sets in, to examine the question: are there ways to reduce my exposure to emerging risks and still earn a decent return? The funds above have made money over the past five years; the US bond market has not. Those funds uniformly aim to provide high current income with admirably low exposure to the traditional income markets. And it reminds us, again, of the consistent independence and excellence of the CrossingBridge folks who are responsible for the two highest-rated funds on the list (CrossingBridge Low Duration and RiverPark Strategic Income).

Laugh at vertical dramas’ alpha werewolf pregnant billionaire storytelling all you want, but don’t let the giggling distract you. Vertical dramas are massive. For young filmmakers they offer a low-barrier entry point. For entrepreneurial producers, they’re a chance to become mini-mini moguls. In 2024 alone, over 36,000 new series launched. Already a $7 billion business in China, the market is projected to top $10 billion globally (outside China) by 2027. Last month, Cineverse — the folks who brought you “Terrifier” — and Lloyd Braun’s Banyan Ventures announced MicroCo, a new microseries studio and platform.

The ambition isn’t to be another ReelShort or DramaBox. It wants to be the Amazon Prime of vertical drama, producing originals and curating the best from thousands of existing titles. I spoke with Cineverse president and Chief Strategy Officer Erick Opeka about MicroCo’s ambitions and why he sees vertical dramas as the next inflection point. Full disclosure: I’m excited to see what happens with vertical dramas and I’m a little bit conflicted about that. This is filmmaking at its most disposable. For this format that’s a feature, not a bug. It’s storytelling that leans into the dopamine with cliffhangers every two minutes; logic and nuance are roadkill. China can’t create a $7 billion business without America taking notice, but we might be slower to respond if we weren’t living through a moment otherwise defined by layoffs, consolidation, and other forms of retreat (Neuehouse, RIP). Growth feels good. Like it or not, this is a ground floor — but not for long. My interview with Erick has been edited for brevity and clarity. In Development: When did vertical video first cross your desk? Erick Opeka: A couple of years ago. In another incarnation we were owned by a Chinese company, so we’ve always been keeping an eye on trends. It was starting to pop up around the same time TikTok started to take hold. I saw it start to be something we were interested in maybe about 18 months ago. What do you see as the potential for this? If you look at the evolution in China, it’s not just targeted toward women looking for romance. About 550 million people in China viewed vertical microdramas as of the summer of this year. It’s gotten so big that it’s stealing mindshare from the more legacy streaming services. It’s resonating with their daily use patterns and cadence and mobile-first society. The pattern we’re already seeing in the US — the very soapy stuff taking hold, becoming a billion-dollar business in the US, and the top apps beating out Netflix and Hulu and Disney in the app store in revenue generated — tells me over the next five years, you’re going to see that happen here. What’s compelling is there’s no ecosystem around this in the US today, even though it’s already a billion-dollar business. I hear anecdotal things, but there’s no PR channels, no IMDB for this stuff. And these things are like mayflies, right? They premiere, they get mined of their value in two to three weeks, and then they’re into the ether and it’s on to the next one. It kind of hearkens back to the early days of cinema and the nickelodeon, and there was no star system yet. You had the Biograph Girl. It parallels a lot of what you would see in the early development of a new medium. Our goal is to build out the Roku or Amazon Prime of the space for the US. The other opportunity is there’s a lot that are clearly not professionally produced storytelling. It’s not so much the production value, but how do you maximize the storytelling? Putting together a team like Susan, Lloyd, and Jana, they understand big, brash storytelling. We’re not coming in with any kind of hubris that we’re going to reinvent the format. The format works. It’s about going back to the basics and doing a better job with western-style storytelling for US audiences. How would you distribute this? You have to have your own app to be a credible player. We’re a tech company. I have the engineering team and staff. We operate hundreds of apps in the ecosystem, so this is not something that is unfamiliar to us. The other piece is what I’ve seen as TikTok evolved into a multi-platform media company. They have connected TV apps, they have smart TV apps. It’s growing quite fast. I didn’t think vertical video on a big TV was going to work, and it’s kind of working to some degree. It’s just weird. Maybe people want to use their phone to text and goof around, and these stories are light engagement. The other thing is if we serve as the Hulu or Amazon or whatever analogy you want to make, there is no catalog value to most of these things. [We’d be] aggregating them, providing the fan layer, providing the information so people can find them. We’d also be working with major media companies, mobile providers, and others to provide our app or create a custom version of the content. We’d also produce, much like Prime, a nice layer of premium things. A lot of people see the team we’re putting together and think this is somehow going to be some ludicrous overspending. It’s quite the opposite. It’s like a puzzle we’re all trying to solve: How do you do what is already being done, without spending much more, and just do it better than it’s being done? There’s no need to put A-list talent in a $250,000-produced micro drama. This audience isn’t going to resonate with that, anyway. I think microdramas are going to serve a two-way approach. One is IP that will graduate into bigger phenomenon, and bigger IP will make the format stay top of mind — rather than going to the movies two or three times a year for most Americans. But it’s got to graduate from Harlequin romance-style stuff. Don’t get me wrong, we’re going to play that up. If you saw the names of some of the shows we’re contemplating — we’re like, how do we one-up everybody at this game of just getting ridiculous with it? We’re going to have fun with it. Are you looking to produce, or is this going to be acquisitions of independents? What’s the plan there? It’s going to be a mix. We’re starting to see some companies and producers that are getting really good at this. Most are kind of outside the system [or] recent film school grads from top programs that have been trying to break in. They’ve gotten good at scaling and figuring out how to do it. Very entrepreneurial. Some of the top producers in the space have very little to no Hollywood background. These are all indies. Right? I interviewed one of the vertical filmmakers, Yun Xie. She was fascinating. She made a feature that won Slamdance. Really? Yeah. And she was awesome. She’s a powerhouse. I was so impressed by her energy. So many directors come off as brash. That’s not her, but she’s very clearly focused. You hit the nail on the head, right? If you look back to the ‘90s indie film world vibe of just how excited people were and they were excited to get up every day and try to figure out how to get their movie and just crack the space. There was a palpable excitement around it. I feel that same kind of energy. I agree. People feel like, not only do I have a shot to get things made and do things and move forward with something that’s fun, compelling and new, but there’s real money to be made. I mean, you got to make a lot more of them to make money, but the money that’s being spent in this space is not immaterial anymore. What kinds of budgets are you looking at? The numbers have been all over the board and a lot of it reflects the indie film world. Cheaper it is, the more sweat equity and favors are being called — they’re doing these for below six figures. The price point is settling anywhere between $150,000 and $400,000. There’s people who are starting to become known and those cost a little more. And just because it’s a white-hot space, there’s not a ton of experienced producers. Demand is outstripping the supply, driving up prices a little bit right now. How many do you think you’ll produce or release in a year? We’re still working on that number. We’re going for a little higher quality as opposed to quantity. I don’t think we’re going to be at the cadence of the top players that drop one microdrama a day. But maybe one a week. Maybe two a week, toward the back half of our first year. How are you going to handle payment? There’s this whole system of coins and you lose track of what you’re actually spending. “It’s just one more coin.” You add it up all up at the end and holy crap, I just spent $40. Yeah. This business was spawned out of gaming companies who use a lot of these techniques to unlock levels. Every two minutes, beginning, middle, end, cliffhanger. It’s designed to hook you in. It drives high levels of engagement. Early adopters have a willingness to pay a lot more money. [But] look at what happened in streaming to expand and get the last corners of everybody. You’ve had to launch a lot of ad-supported, subsidized, lower-price things because most people can’t afford to pay 40 bucks to watch a soapy microdrama. Apps have already started to develop subscription levels, which are equally expensive. $20 a week or $200 a year, which is insane when you think about it. Over time, this business starts to look more like traditional media, but I think the coin piece will always kind of be hanging around. They’ll probably just get cheaper. In China there’s a lot of pressure for this to be far more ad supported. You’ll see the same dynamics here. If someone produced a vertical independently, what is the price point that you’d be looking at to buy it? If it’s great it’s going to get the market rates, which are in the low hundreds of thousands of dollars. If it’s experimental or they’re a new producer, it might be less than that. But this is [only] one opportunity. Normally filmmakers complain a lot about the rev share model. That’s feast-or-famine, [but] even moderately successful microdramas can make a lot of money. There’s a real opportunity for rev share on these. It’s like making a Netflix movie. You make it, you sell it, you bake in your profit margin and on to the next one. But if people get really good at it, if they build their own franchises, if they have their own characters, You’re going to see exactly what’s evolved in traditional entertainment economics: They’re going to demand [rev share] and they’re going to get it. A detailed statistical analysis of one of the biggest questions looming over every young cinephile’s mind: Do I need to go to film school? Whatever you think of the term “NonDē” as a replacement for “independent” — I see the logic, but find it aesthetically hideous and overcomplicated — this is an insightful article about the evolving role of film festivals for filmmakers who accept that the game has changed. Another data-driven story that serves as a nuanced counterpoint to the adage that Hollywood is completely run by sequels. That’s still largely true, of course, but Thomson offers a deep dive into the level of performance required for a film to receive a larger investment for a sequel. It’s a pessimistic take on the larger state of the traditional film industry, but those seem to be the only honest ones. A nuts-and-bolts roundup of high quality advice for anyone wrestling with the question “how do I become a director?” Horton offers a healthy mix of old advice that has maintained its relevance in a changing world and newer tips that feel fresh today, but anyone looking to launch a filmmaking career could do a lot worse than using this as a primer. Writing for the Business of TV Substack, Topping offers another potential explanation for the surge in vertical drama popularity: the medium is becoming the only place to enjoy the kind of romantic melodrama that used to be readily available on bigger screens. It’s a thoughtful analysis of an age-old phenomenon: when the larger entertainment industry stops serving a popular product, somebody else will inevitably emerge to fill the void.

Major U.S. equities indexes ticked higher as markets kicked off a new trading week. Inflation is likely to remain in focus as investors look toward Thursday's release of the latest Consumer Price Index data, which could influence the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates next week. The S&P 500 added 0.2% Monday, while the Nasdaq rose 0.5% to a record closing high, and the Dow ended 0.3% higher. Shares of video game maker Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) surged 3.8% to reach an all-time high and secure the top daily performance in the S&P 500 after the company launched its latest professional basketball game and announced plans to develop a college basketball game. Uber Technologies (UBER) shares drove 3.7% higher after it announced plans with self-driving technology firm Momenta to begin testing autonomous vehicles in Munich, Germany, in 2026. The company also moved to sell $2.25 billion in investment-grade bonds, Bloomberg reported, with the proceeds directed toward general corporate purposes. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO) added 3.2%, extending strong gains late last week after the chipmaker reported better-than-expected earnings. A surge in artificial intelligence revenue underpinned the strong performance, and Broadcom said it had secured $10 billion in orders from a new client, which reports said could be OpenAI. CVS Health (CVS) shares dropped 4.8%, losing the most of any stock in the S&P 500 on Monday, after top executives at a Morgan Stanley investor conference did not offer new financial forecasts or updates on the federal government's impending release of star ratings for Medicare Advantage plans, which could have a significant impact on revenue CVS derives from plans operated through its Aetna insurance business. One of the executives speaking at the conference reportedly stressed CVS has a policy of not updating its guidance between quarterly earnings releases. Shares of alcoholic beverage maker Brown-Forman (BF.B) fell 4.6%. The stock has been trending downward since the Jack Daniel's parent last month posted a lower-than-expected profit. The company noted a negative impact from the ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and Canada. The company said it also faces headwinds related to economic uncertainty and the potential for price pressure related to oversupply in the American whiskey market. Including Monday's decline, Brown-Forman shares have lost more than one-quarter of their value this year. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) announced a plan to offer around $3.25 billion in senior and exchangeable notes, as well as launch a registered direct offering of ordinary shares. The former adds to the company's debt levels, while the latter dilutes the ownership stake of existing stockholders. Shares of the cruise operator sank 4.4% on Monday.

Title: The Cost Of Living The American Dream For A Lifetime Has Reached A Whopping 5 Million Dollars

Time Published: 2025-09-08T20:48:51Z
Full Content:
The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? What in the world has happened to us? When I was growing up, it was assumed that pretty much everyone in my generation would be able to achieve the American Dream. But today most of the U.S. population is not living the American Dream, and more people are falling out of the middle class every day. As I have detailed in previous articles, this is particularly true for Millennials and those in Generation Z. The collective prosperity of the middle class has been declining for an extended period of time, and now that long-term decline threatens to become a full-blown avalanche. Borrowing money always creates pain, and since 2009 our leaders in Washington have borrowed and spent 27 trillion dollars that we did not have. Pumping all of that extra money into the system has had very serious consequences, because now the purchasing power of our dollars has been greatly diminished. In fact, Newsweek is reporting that the cost of living the American Dream for a lifetime has now reached 5 million dollars… The American Dream has long symbolized the promise of opportunity, prosperity, and upward mobility. Coined in 1931 by writer James Truslow Adams in The Epic of America, the term described “that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement.” But nearly a century later, achieving that vision is more expensive than ever. According to new research published by Investopedia, the lifetime cost of attaining the traditional American Dream—including homeownership, retirement, raising children, a wedding, new cars, healthcare, pets, and annual vacations—now totals roughly $5 million. These calculations assume a college-educated, dual-income household capable of sustaining these ambitions over a lifetime. Is your household going to bring in 5 million dollars over the course of your lifetime? Sadly, most U.S. households don’t have a prayer of getting anywhere even close to that. But if you want to live the American Dream for an entire lifetime, that is what it is going to take. We live at a time when virtually everything is steadily becoming more expensive. In a previous article, I explained that each month an average family of four spends $996 on groceries, $1,437 on health insurance, $745 on a vehicle payment and $2,259 on a mortgage payment. Once upon a time, it was quite common for Americans to have large families. But in our time raising children has become so expensive. In fact, it is being estimated that the cost of raising two children all the way through college will cost you $876,092… Raising two children from infancy through college remains one of the costliest undertakings. Using Economic Policy Institute data, Investopedia calculates $650,000 to cover childcare, transportation, meals, and other expenses, with college costs exceeding $230,000 for two children. “College is more expensive than ever, and many students take on a lot of debt, only to find that their paychecks don’t grow fast enough to pay it off quickly,” Battin said. According to the Education Data Initiative, the average cost of college is $38,270 per student per year, including books, supplies, and daily living expenses. This is one of the reasons why our society values money so much at this stage. The truth is that it takes a giant pile of money each month just to live a normal life. Older Americans are far more likely to be living a middle class lifestyle right now because they control most of the wealth… As young buyers scrape together down payments, boomers are sitting on $82 trillion in wealth—more than twice what Gen X has and four times as much as millennials. New research shows the wealth gap has only widened since the 1980s, as older generations saw bigger gains in homeownership and stocks while younger people took on faster-growing mortgage debt. With boomers holding on to large homes and aging in place, younger buyers are struggling to break into a shrinking market. I know lots of Americans that are over the age of 50 that are successfully living middle class lifestyles in 2025. But I know of very few Americans that are under the age of 40 that are successfully living middle class lifestyles in 2025. Over the past several decades, homeownership among young adults has absolutely collapsed. I shared the following chart that was posted by Nathan Halberstadt on Twitter in a previous article, but I felt that I should share it again in order to illustrate this point… Just look at that chart. That is what a long-term economic collapse looks like. And I don’t think that anybody is even going to attempt to argue that I am wrong about that. The middle class is being systematically eviscerated. As older middle class Americans die off, they are not being replaced in sufficient numbers by young adults that are entering the middle class. In 2025, most of the population is just barely scraping by from month to month. Debt levels have risen to extremely alarming levels, and so have delinquency rates. This week, I was deeply saddened to learn that the delinquency rate on subprime auto loans has soared to the highest level ever recorded… The auto loan landscape is teetering on the edge of chaos as delinquency rates climb to unprecedented heights. Data from the Federal Reserve and Goldman Sachs reveal that subprime auto loan delinquencies have rocketed past 5%, a stark milestone that surpasses the worst days of the 2008 financial crisis. According to Experian, 30-day-plus delinquencies over the past year have risen 40% among consumers with the lowest credit scores, signaling growing distress among high-risk borrowers. Skyrocketing car prices, coupled with elevated interest rates and mounting economic pressures, are stretching household finances to the breaking point, leading to a surge in missed payments. Prime auto loan delinquencies, while reaching a 15-year high, but short of the crisis-era peak, suggest a more limited ripple effect among borrowers with better credit. It is starting to look a lot like 2008 all over again. And that includes mass layoffs. Large employers have been eliminating good paying jobs all over the nation, and in many cases these layoffs are being driven by the AI revolution… The list of companies laying off companies is growing following two years of significant job cuts in tech, media, finance, manufacturing, retail, and energy. According to Business Insider, a World Economic Forum survey found that some 41% of companies worldwide expect to reduce their workforces over the next five years because of the rise of artificial intelligence. Big companies such as Oracle, CNN, Dropbox, and Block have all previously announced layoffs linked to AI. While Amazon has not reported any job cuts this year, CEO Andy Jassy warned employees in June that the company will likely require “fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today” in the coming years as it increases its adoption of generative AI and AI agents. If things are this bad now, what will happen once AI can do almost all of our jobs less expensively and more efficiently than humans can? Of course AI is not the only reason why so many Americans are losing their jobs right now. As I discussed yesterday, this is the toughest job market that we have seen in ages. But don’t just take my word for it. According to the New York Fed, “confidence in the ability to move from one job to another has hit a record low”… In the latest sign of trouble for the U.S. labor market, confidence in the ability to move from one job to another has hit a record low, according to a New York Federal Reserve survey released Monday. Respondents to the central bank’s monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations for August indicated a 44.9% probability of finding another job after losing their current one. The reading tumbled 5.8 percentage points from the prior month and is the lowest in the survey’s history dating back to June 2013. The economy is a mess. That is very clear. And it is also very clear that we are moving into an extremely challenging future. But that doesn’t mean that you should curl up into a fetal position and cry about it. You were born for such a time as this. It is when times are the darkest that the greatest lights are needed. Living the American Dream does not determine whether you are a “success” or not. You are living at one of the most important moments in all of human history, and you have been given a purpose that only you can fulfill. Yes, all of the crazy stuff that is happening all around us can be frightening at times, but don’t let all of that noise prevent you from becoming everything that you were created to be.

Title: Levi & Korsinsky Reminds Shareholders of a Lead Plaintiff Deadline of September 30, 2025 in Novo Lawsuit – NVO

September 08, 2025 16:17 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Sept. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Novo Nordisk A/S ("Novo" or the "Company") (NYSE: NVO) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form-3?prid=165537&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until September 30, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate. WHY LEVI & KORSINSKY: Over the past 20 years, the team at Levi & Korsinsky has secured hundreds of millions of dollars for aggrieved shareholders and built a track record of winning high-stakes cases.

Ethereum has quietly been one of the most rewarding bets in crypto. A $1,000 investment made just five years ago in 2020 would now be worth around $11,145, an 11x jump despite wild swings along the way. But with ETH trading around $4,327 this September, investors are asking the real question: is Ethereum still worth buying after such explosive gains, or is the big money already made?

Title: These 200+ Alexa Commands Took My Echo Devices to the Next Level

Reviews ethics statement Use these Alexa commands to manage your life without lifting a finger. These voice commands make Alexa the ultimate sidekick. Alexa has evolved far beyond its origins as a simple voice assistant for setting reminders and playing music. After 11 years, it finally got a significant upgrade with the introduction of Alexa Plus. This new iteration is powered by advanced AI, making the assistant smarter, more conversational, and, for the first time, proactive. With Alexa Plus, the assistant can manage your smart devices, organize a dynamic calendar, control your Fire TV, and even follow you from one speaker to another as you move through your home. This deeper integration makes for a more seamless user experience. If you haven't used Alexa in a while, its new commands are designed to keep up with the demands of a busy life. This CNET survey found that 73% of US adults who use voice assistants still have privacy concerns with AI features, but Alexa was rated the most trusted option among them. If you own an Echo device, learning the right commands is the key to unlocking everything Alexa can do. Here's a full guide to the best ones to start with. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. Amazon recently launched Alexa Plus, a major AI-powered upgrade to its voice assistant. This new version brings significantly improved conversational abilities and smart home control. The upgrade costs $20 monthly but is free for Amazon Prime subscribers. The upgraded system, first demoed in 2023, can handle more complex requests, remember personal details and perform multiple actions through natural conversation. With these spring cleaning and organization features, Alexa Plus aims to make managing your home more intuitive than ever. Notable new commands include: Before that, Amazon had announced new hardware products while also talking up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including: By default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, "Alexa." You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually). If you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa. There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, "Stop." Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, "Alexa, play folk music at volume six," or, "Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list." Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen, the living room or anywhere for that matter. While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant. In fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have: You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. "Hey, Siri" or "Hey, Google" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant. On an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, "Open Alexa." After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana. Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example). The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted. When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com. Here are all the native Alexa commands. The Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays. This means you can tell them to show you things. You can ask your Echo show to show you things using voice commands. You can now use compatible Echo devices (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show and Amazon Tap) to control your Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks. Amazon also builds its Fire TV operating system into televisions like the Element EL4KAMZ17 series. All of the commands above work on those too, in addition to a few TV-specific commands below. Alexa commands also work with Fire TV products. You can make calls and leave voicemails to other Echo users, as well as "Drop In" to your own echo devices, either to voice or video chat with whoever's in the room (or just to monitor the space like a security camera). If you have an Android, you can send text messages with Alexa. Control purchases, shopping lists and notifications with your Echo device. To turn on notifications, open the Alexa app and select to Settings, then Notifications, then Shopping Notifications and toggle it on. Your Echo speakers will light up yellow when you have new notifications. Alexa can answer all of your music and movie-related questions. Kids can ask Alexa to play parent-approved music and stories with the Echo Dot Kids Edition. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms, such as SmartThings, Philips Hue, Wink, Insteon, Lutron, Belkin WeMo and many more. Some require you to enable skills, and some don't. Here is a selection of the commands you can use for controlling your smart home, although there are dozens more. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms and devices. Skills are third-party applications for Alexa speakers. They allow you to connect third-party software and hardware to your speaker, as well as play games and add different news sources to your Flash Briefing. Originally, they had to be enabled before you could use them, but Amazon has since made that process automatic (just ask for the Skill and it will enable when it's used). Microsoft's Cortana is available as a skill -- but rather than just being a skill, it opens the door to a completely separate digital assistant through your Alexa speakers. Once you've added the skill, enabled permissions and connected your Microsoft and Amazon accounts, just say, "Alexa, open Cortana." When you're speaking to Cortana you can check your emails, ask for the next event on your calendar or add items to your to-do list. For now, the Cortana skill is limited because it's a public preview of what the full integration will be in the future. Ring in the holiday season -- or the spooky season -- using you Echo devices. Alexa comes chock-full of Easter eggs and jokes -- the list is long. We cover the strange world of Alexa Easter eggs here, noting some of the more popular or prominent commands that prompt a snarky or humorous response. For even more, check out this Reddit thread dedicated to Alexa Easter eggs.

Title: Wall Street Sees U.S. Entry as Catalyst for Bullish’s Next Leg Up
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/08/wall-street-sees-u-s-entry-as-catalyst-for-bullish-s-next-leg-up
Time Published: 2025-09-08T14:12:17Z
Full Content:
Crypto platform Bullish (BLSH), the parent company of CoinDesk, received a number of stock ratings from Wall Street analysts on Monday, as brokerage firms initiated coverage of the stock after its recent IPO. Rosenblatt Securities started coverage with a buy rating and a $60 price target, citing shifting U.S. political winds and rising institutional adoption as key catalysts for growth, the broker said in a research report Monday. The firm argues that Bullish, one of the largest regulated institutional exchanges, is well positioned to capitalize on what it calls a “dramatic improvement” in the U.S. political environment for digital assets. Despite not yet serving U.S. clients, Bullish has already handled more than $500 billion in annual trading volume, a scale Rosenblatt views as evidence of demand. The upcoming U.S. launch is expected to be a major catalyst, the broker noted, while the passage of the GENIUS Act has opened a new opportunity in stablecoins. Rosenblatt believes stablecoin-related revenue could provide recurring income less exposed to trading volatility. Stablecoin values are tied to assets like the U.S. dollar or gold. They play a major role in cryptocurrency markets providing, among other things, a payment infrastructure, and are also used to transfer money internationally. The sector has a market cap of about $280 billion, CoinGecko data show, and is dominated by Tether's USDT and Circle Internet's USDC. Bullish’s ownership of media properties and potential expansion into retail trading add further upside, according to the note. On that basis, Rosenblatt values the stock at 31x projected 2027 adjusted EBITDA, underpinning its $60 target. Rival broker Canaccord Genuity has also initiated coverage of Bullish with a buy rating and a $68 price target, highlighting the exchange’s growing institutional traction and potential boost from a pending New York BitLicense. Founded in 2020, Bullish has quickly become a major player in crypto trading, recently leading global regulated exchanges in spot trading volumes for bitcoin BTC$108,783.53, ether (ETH), and stablecoins, the report said. The company has expanded beyond trading with the acquisitions of CoinDesk in 2023 and CCData in 2024, adding media, data, and information services to its business lines. Canaccord analysts also note Bullish’s role in the emerging “stablecoin wars,” supporting issuers like PayPal (PYPL) and Société Générale (GLE) with listings, liquidity, and promotion. Already licensed in Europe and Asia, Bullish is expected to secure a BitLicense soon, opening access to U.S. institutional clients, the analysts wrote. Despite conservative assumptions in its forecasts, including flat bitcoin prices through 2027, Canaccord points to Bullish’s early profitability, balance sheet bolstered by $2.4 billion in bitcoin, and long-term growth prospects as reasons for optimism. Meanwhile, broker Bernstein has initiated coverage of Bullish with a market-perform rating and a $60 price target, highlighting the exchange’s experienced management team and its ambition to become the second-largest institutional platform after Coinbase. That outcome, the firm says, hinges on a successful U.S. launch in 2026, where Coinbase currently dominates but opportunities are emerging around stablecoins, market data and indices. Bullish’s ownership of CoinDesk also offers potential optionality if it moves into retail exchange services. "We expect Bullish to capture ~8% market share in U.S spot institutional crypto volumes by 2027E, while global spot market share remains at ~7%," analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote. Wall Street bank JPMorgan (JPM) has also initiated coverage of Bullish, assigning the crypto exchange operator a neutral rating and a price target of $50. Like Bernstein, the JPMorgan analyst also pointed to Bullish’s experienced management team and its ability to navigate the fast-evolving digital asset landscape. The bank's analyst said growth will likely be fueled by rising institutional demand for crypto exposure and the increasing role of tokens and stablecoins in trading activity. Bullish is also well-positioned to expand into the U.S. market, building on its existing foothold in Europe and Asia. According to the bank, another growth driver will be its Liquidity Services business, where clearer regulation could broaden the range of supported blockchains and tokens, creating a stronger environment for exchanges like Bullish. Still, JPMorgan noted that the firm’s current scale remains limited relative to its market opportunity. With the company at what the bank called a “critical point of maturity,” analysts said valuation concerns justify staying on the sidelines for now. The shares were trading 3.6% lower, around $50.53, at publication time.

Title: S&P 500 Weekly Winners: How AI Powered The Surge
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/08/sp-500-weekly-winners-how-ai-powered-the-surge/
Time Published: 2025-09-08T13:28:50Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. During the week ending September 5, the S&P 500 was essentially unchanged, slipping 0.12%. In contrast, several S&P 500 constituents—particularly AI-related names—posted strong gains. The week’s top movers were propelled by upbeat quarterly surprises, sizable chip agreements, and constructive regulatory developments. Macroeconomic data pointed to a softer labor market: nonfarm payrolls in August rose by only 22,000, well below the 75,000 forecast, while the unemployment rate edged up to 4.3%. Together, these readings reinforce expectations that the Federal Reserve will move forward with a widely anticipated interest rate cut later this month. We detail the biggest movers below. That said, if you’re seeking upside with less volatility than a single-stock position, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outpaced its blended benchmark—the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—with returns exceeding 91% since inception. Also, see – S&P 500 Losers: From Lululemon To MGM — What Went Wrong? Western Digital’s stock climbed 15% last week on a strong earnings print and upbeat guidance for the coming quarters. WDC has nearly doubled in 2025, riding the AI wave as its high-performance storage is critical for AI data centers. At $93, WDC trades at about 2x trailing revenues, modestly above its five-year average P/S of 1.7x. The relative discount to its historical average, as well as some peers, reflects its heavier exposure to the more volatile NAND segment, recent market drawdowns, and historical concerns about earnings cyclicality. Broadcom advanced 13% last week, buoyed by strong quarterly results and news of a new $10 billion custom AI chip order from a major customer—seen as a meaningful accelerant to revenue growth. Our recent analysis — AVGO Stock To $400 — outlines how Broadcom could potentially double again after a 135% gain over the last twelve months. The company is leveraging deep semiconductor expertise to deliver bespoke AI hardware for hyperscale, cloud, and enterprise buyers. Seagate shares rose 12%, supported by expectations for sustained AI-driven storage demand, with the stock up 115% year to date. The enthusiasm for high-capacity drives used in AI workloads has pushed STX’s valuation, now at 4x trailing revenues—well above its five-year average of 1.9x. That premium suggests the market is pricing in elevated demand and earnings durability. Micron gained 10%, largely on rising demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) in AI infrastructure. Micron’s revenue multiple is 3.9x, close to its five-year average, implying today’s pricing reflects both current strength and cyclical risks—particularly as DRAM has entered an upcycle after a tough 2024, while NAND remains subdued. Even so, Micron may be AI’s best bargain. Google advanced 10% after a key regulatory win—a federal court found it wouldn’t need to divest Chrome, a platform we estimate is worth over a trillion to the ecosystem. The stock still appears relatively undervalued versus peers, with potential for an additional trillion-dollar upswing if further rulings are favorable; another decision due on September 10 could shape the next move. Remember, investing in a single stock—or a small handful—carries meaningful risk. Consider the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, a 30-stock collection that has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why? As a group, HQ names have delivered better returns with less volatility versus the benchmark—less of a roller-coaster ride—visible in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Adobe And Applied Materials Stand Out For Fat Profit Margins
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johndorfman/2025/09/08/adobe-and-applied-materials-stand-out-for-fat-profit-margins/
Time Published: 2025-09-08T12:45:00Z

ByJohn Dorfman, Contributor. High profits are the engine that can drive pleasant returns for shareholders. Beyond that, on a societal level, profits provide the signals that make the capitalist system work. These signals are the reason capitalist economies have fewer gluts and shortages than centrally planned (Communist) economies. High profits lure in new competitors, raising the supply of goods and services that are in high demand. Low profits cause some companies to abandon the field, in a process the economist Joseph Schumpeter called “creative destruction.” This is why we don’t currently have a glut of buggy whips or video cassettes. Here are five stocks that boast unusually high profit margins, and that I think deserve consideration as investments. You may know Adobe Inc. (ADBE) as the company whose software enables the display of graphics on your computer screen. Adobe has increased its sales at a 20% annual clip for the past decade, and profits have grown even faster. Adobe’s growth slowed in the past year, but the growth rate was still nicely into the teens. The company’s net (after tax) profit margin is 30%. The stock trades for 22 times recent earnings but only 15 times analysts’ estimate of earnings for 2026. I try not to be too influenced by personal experiences, but I have found Adobe’s customer service to be superb. One of the world’s largest makers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) is based in Santa Clara, California. Its sales growth over the past decade has been north of 17% a year. Its net profit margin is close to 24%. Although the stock has appreciated more than 900% in the past ten years, so far this year it’s down a small fraction. I think the weakness mostly reflects the U.S.-China trade conflict. Applied Materials gets about 25% of its sales in China. Based in Denver, Colorado, Anglogold Ashanti Plc (AU) is a gold mining company. Most of its mines are in Africa, but it also has mines in Australia and the Americas. The price of gold has risen more than 40% in the past year, amid government deficits, inflation, and international tensions. I think those problems will continue through 2026 and that gold’s momentum therefore will continue as well. Anglogold Ashani has a net profit margin of more than 23%. United Therapeutics Corp. (UTHR), based in Silver Spring, Maryland, is known mainly for drugs to treat high blood pressure in the arteries around the lungs. I’ve owned the stock a couple of times over the years and regret that I haven’t owned it this year, since it jumped 33% in the past month. I sold my shares in 2024 because I thought that Merck & Co. might wrest away leadership in its niche. So far that hasn’t happened, and United Therapeutics is also developing drugs outside its traditional niche, such as treatments for liver and kidney disease. Its net margin is 40%. Zoom Communications Inc. (ZM) had first-mover advantage in the market for online meetings software. Lately Microsoft Teams and Google Meet have chipped into its market share. Zoom’s growth – spectacular during the pandemic – has flattened out. Nonetheless, Zoom remains a significant player in online meetings, with roughly half the market. Its net profit margin is a fat 25%. The stock, which rose above $500 in 2020, has subsided to $83, and I think it is probably a good buy at the current price. I’ve written 15 columns before this one on stocks with fat profit margins. Results have been mixed and strange, but a little more good than bad. The average 12-month return on my recommendations has been 16.3%. That beats the average return for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Total Return index over the same periods, which was 15.8%. Bear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn’t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn’t predict the future. The odd thing is that my picks, while profitable 10 times out of 15, have beaten the index only four times. My average return beat the benchmark mainly because of great returns in 2014-2015 (83.2%) and 2020-2021 (78.6%). My picks from a year ago didn’t get traction. They were up only 0.1%, trailing the S&P by 15 percentage points, mostly because of a 37% loss in ON Semiconductor Corp. The best gainer was Snap-on Inc. (SNA), which returned 16.9%. Disclosure: I own Anglogold Ashanti personally and for most of my clients. I own Applied Materials for a few clients.

Today's top news: Friday was a big day for those companies entering the S&P 500. While a major crypto favorite was once again left out. S&P Dow Jones Indices said Robinhood (HOOD) will join the S&P 500 at the upcoming quarterly rebalance, replacing a departing constituent. HOOD shares immediately popped 7% on the news. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy (MSTR), despite checking all the requirement boxes, was not selected this cycle. MSTR’s recent price action certainly isn’t helping its case, down 16% this month while Bitcoin is only down 3%. It’s an exciting milestone to have Robinhood join the storied S&P 500 Index. I’ll share what I told the team today — we don’t stop to celebrate, our single focus remains building exceptional products for our customers. - Vlad Tenev, Robinhood CEO “Do you know which two companies didn’t make it into the S&P 500 last quarter despite meeting all the criteria? AppLovin and Robinhood. They were passed in June and both got in today on their second try. Same story with Uber and Tesla. Be patient. $MSTR will get there” - X user Angarlo First, the reason companies and their shareholders want to join the S&P is clear - huge rebalancing and ongoing inflows. Getting added to the S&P is almost a lock guarantee for near-term stock price increases (barring other macro factors). So it’s a big deal to be added. As for HOOD making it in over MSTR, the decision signals the committee’s preference for platform exposure over asset proxies.

By contrast, MicroStrategy’s pass suggests the S&P still wants operating cash flows and business diversification when it chooses members. For investors, the implication is straightforward: if you want crypto exposure inside the index, build a real business that uses it, don’t just warehouse it.

Here is a look at the breaking news in digital marketing for May 2025. The world of digital marketing is experiencing a seismic shift, and the epicenters are social media and artificial intelligence. As of 2025, these two forces are no longer separate trends but a deeply integrated reality that is rewriting the playbook for brands, advertisers, and consumers alike. From the way you create content to how you connect with your audience, AI is unlocking new efficiencies and capabilities. Are you prepared to adapt your strategy for this new era? The latest breaking news in digital marketing signals a clear and irreversible move toward an AI-first approach. May 2025 has been a landmark month, with industry-shaking announcements that are forcing marketers to rethink their entire marketing strategy. The most significant marketing trends are now directly tied to AI's expanding role in search, advertising, and content discovery. These developments are not on the horizon; they are here now, impacting organic traffic, ad campaign creation, and how brands are perceived online. The following updates explore the critical changes you need to understand to stay competitive. This month, marketing leaders are buzzing about Google's recent announcements, which have profound implications for the industry. The company confirmed a major expansion of its AI Overviews in the U.S., fundamentally altering how search results are presented. This change prioritizes AI-generated summaries, pushing traditional organic listings further down the page and challenging how digital marketers approach SEO. Simultaneously, Google unveiled "AI Max" at its Marketing Live event, an advanced AI-driven platform designed to automate the creation of entire paid search campaigns. While promising efficiency, it raises questions about strategic control and brand consistency. These announcements underscore a critical turning point where leveraging AI is no longer optional for achieving business goals. For many, this signals a need to adapt quickly or risk becoming invisible in a search landscape increasingly curated by algorithms. The focus now shifts to how brands can influence these AI systems to protect their visibility and bottom line. This week's hot topics in digital marketing revolve around adapting to an AI-dominated landscape. Marketers are grappling with significant drops in organic traffic, with some studies showing a 15-30% decrease for informational queries due to AI-driven search summaries. This has ignited a race to find new opportunities for visibility. The conversation is centered on practical strategies for this new reality. Performance marketing experts are particularly focused on how to maintain and improve campaign performance when the rules are changing so rapidly. Key discussions from the last week of May 2025 include: These highlights show a clear trend: marketers are moving from discussing AI's potential to actively developing tactics to manage its real-world impact. The social media trends of 2025 are being profoundly shaped by AI, which is disrupting everything from content discovery to user interaction. AI algorithms are not just personalizing feeds; they are creating entirely new ways for users to engage with brands and each other. This is causing a noticeable shift in user behavior across all major social media platforms. As a result, what worked last year may not be effective today. Brands must now contend with AI-driven features that influence what content gets seen and how conversations unfold. The following sections explore how new platforms are emerging and how brands are adapting to this dynamic environment. New social platforms and AI-integrated features are rapidly changing consumer behavior, especially among Gen Z. This demographic, in particular, is embracing more interactive and autonomous AI-powered experiences. Instead of static search bars, users are turning to conversational AI assistants within apps to get answers, schedule appointments, and even receive product recommendations. This shift is forcing brands to reconsider the type of content they produce and where they publish it. The emphasis is moving toward providing utility and instant support. Some of the key features gaining traction include: U.S. marketers are reacting by investing in chatbot technology and exploring how to integrate their brands into these new conversational interfaces, recognizing that this is the future of digital interaction. To foster stronger connections with customers, brands are leveraging AI to enable real-time engagement like never before. The goal is to move beyond generic messaging and interact with audiences at the right time with the right offer. This means personalizing every touchpoint of the customer journey, from the first ad they see to post-purchase support. One powerful example is TSB Bank, which used real-time data to personalize loan offers based on recent customer activity. This single change led to a 300% increase in mobile loan sales. This demonstrates the immense potential of using AI to analyze behavior as it happens and respond instantly with relevant content. This proactive approach to engagement is becoming the new standard. Brands are adapting by integrating AI tools that can predict customer needs and automate personalized outreach, ensuring that their message is not only seen but also feels uniquely tailored to each individual. Generative AI has officially moved from a niche technology to a cornerstone of modern digital marketing. Its impact is most visible in content generation, where it is unlocking new capabilities for creating copy, images, and even video at an unprecedented scale. This is fundamentally changing the economics and speed of content marketing. However, the rise of generative AI is about more than just efficiency. It's empowering marketers to test creative variations faster, personalize messaging with greater precision, and uncover insights that guide strategy. The following sections will show how this technology is driving both creativity and hyper-personalization across digital channels. Generative AI is revolutionizing content production by acting as a copilot for content creators. Tools like ChatGPT, Midjourney, and Runway are now standard in many marketing departments, helping to accelerate everything from brainstorming initial concepts to producing final assets. This allows teams to iterate on ideas much faster than before. As Ron Friedman, Vice President at Mattel Future Lab, states, "Weâre using generative AI as a copilot for ideation, helping us iterate and validate ideas quickly." This sentiment is echoed across industries. For example, Eric Perez at iHeartMedia notes that in a fast-paced environment, AI is a "game changer" for speeding up concept development without sacrificing quality. This technology is not replacing human creativity but augmenting it. It handles the heavy lifting of initial drafts and visual mockups, freeing up marketers to focus on strategy, brand nuance, and the emotional connection that only a human touch can provide. The result is a more efficient and dynamic content creation process. Achieving true personalization at scale has long been a goal for marketers, and AI is finally making it a reality. By analyzing vast amounts of data in real time, AI enables brands to deliver a superior customer experience by serving highly relevant content across all digital channels, from websites to email to social media. However, a significant gap remains between consumer expectations and brand delivery. An Adobe report found that while 71% of consumers want brands to anticipate their needs, only 34% of brands are successfully doing so. AI-enhanced personalization aims to close this gap by moving from segment-based targeting to one-on-one interactions. As Leo Griffin of HanesBrands Inc. explains, "Personalization helps our consumers feel known." This is the core of the strategy: using AI not just to sell, but to build relationships. Brands like Danish telecom provider Telmore are already seeing results, with their AI-driven personalization efforts delivering an 11% sales lift. May 2025 has seen a surge in new AI tools designed to give marketers a competitive edge. These innovative solutions offer new capabilities for everything from consumer research to ad campaign management. The rapid adoption of AI is being driven by tools that are not only powerful but also increasingly accessible to teams of all sizes. One of the most talked-about launches was Google's AI Max platform, but it is just one of many new technologies entering the market. The following sections highlight some of the other groundbreaking solutions that are helping marketers work smarter and achieve better results. Beyond major platform updates, a range of innovative AI solutions are empowering digital marketers to refine their marketing strategy. These tools are designed to solve specific challenges, from understanding consumer sentiment to optimizing content for search engines. Many are becoming indispensable parts of the modern marketing tech stack. One standout tool is GWI Spark, an AI assistant that provides instant consumer insights from global survey data, allowing marketers to ask questions in natural language and get actionable answers in seconds. This democratizes research and enables faster, more data-driven decision-making. Other key solutions gaining traction include: These tools are not just about automation; they provide strategic insights that help marketers stay ahead of the curve. Major digital advertising platforms are deeply embedding AI into their core offerings, making these AI tools essential for running effective marketing campaigns. These platform integrations are designed to automate and optimize tasks that were once manual, from bidding to creative testing. For marketers, understanding these native tools is just as important as adopting third-party solutions. Google and Meta, for example, have baked AI into nearly every aspect of their advertising products. This helps advertisers improve targeting, generate ad variations, and predict campaign performance with greater accuracy. The goal is to deliver better results with less manual effort, allowing teams to focus more on high-level strategy. Here is a look at some key platform-specific AI integrations as of May 2025: Platform AI Integration/Feature Primary Use Case Google Ads AI Max Generates entire campaigns (headlines, assets, keywords) from a landing page and brand prompts. Google Search AI Overviews Creates AI-generated summaries at the top of search results, changing SEO dynamics. Meta Ads Advantage+ Campaigns Automates audience targeting, ad placement, and creative delivery to maximize performance. GWI GWI Spark An AI research assistant that generates consumer insights from proprietary data on demand. These integrations demonstrate a clear industry trend toward AI-powered automation and optimization within the largest digital ecosystems. Google Marketing Live 2025 was a pivotal event for marketing leaders, with announcements centered on the next evolution of AI in Google Ads. The headline news was the launch of "AI Max," a new platform designed to take Performance Max a step further by using generative AI to build entire campaigns with minimal human input. This development presents both new opportunities and new challenges. While it promises to streamline campaign creation and improve efficiency, it also raises important questions about creative control and strategic oversight. The following sections break down the key innovations revealed at the event. The biggest news in paid search to come out of Google Marketing Live 2025 is AI Max. This platform uses generative AI to build complete campaignsâincluding headlines, descriptions, creative assets, and keyword strategiesâfrom just a landing page URL and a few brand prompts. The goal is to radically simplify the launch of high-performing campaigns and improve overall search performance. Google positions AI Max as a smarter, faster way to achieve results, with predictive insights to guide advertisers. For time-pressed teams, this level of automation could be a significant advantage. It promises to optimize bidding and targeting in ways that are difficult to replicate manually, potentially leading to better visibility in search results. However, advertisers are proceeding with caution. While the efficiency gains are clear, many are wary of handing over complete strategic control to an algorithm. Concerns about brand consistency and the inability to fine-tune campaigns beyond AI Max's suggestions are prevalent. Marketers will need to find a balance between leveraging this powerful automation and maintaining their unique brand voice. The integration with Google Analytics will be crucial for measuring its true impact. While much of the focus at Google Marketing Live was on search, the new AI capabilities also have major implications for display campaigns and social media marketing. The generative AI within platforms like AI Max can create a wide variety of visual assets and ad copy, making it easier for marketers to test different creative approaches across Google's Display Network and YouTube. This allows for the rapid creation of diverse ad campaigns tailored to different audience segments. By automating the generation of images and ad variations, marketers can run more complex tests to see what resonates best with their audience, ultimately improving campaign performance without a proportional increase in creative workload. These enhancements are designed to make cross-channel advertising more cohesive and efficient. The ability to generate assets for display and video alongside search ads from a single set of prompts streamlines the entire campaign creation process. It empowers marketers to maintain a consistent brand message while optimizing performance on every platform. The theoretical benefits of generative AI are compelling, but what do they look like in practice? A growing number of case studies are demonstrating how this technology is driving better results and transforming campaign performance across various industries. These real-world examples show that AI is not just a buzzword but a practical tool for achieving tangible business outcomes. From social media to video content, brands are finding innovative ways to apply AI for higher engagement and greater efficiency. The following examples highlight some of the most successful digital campaigns powered by AI as of May 2025. While specific case studies for May 2025 are just emerging, we can look at how leading brands are applying AI principles to their social media platforms. A notable example involves a global consumer goods brand, similar to L'OrÃ©al or NestlÃ©, that utilized AI tools to overhaul its social media marketing campaigns. The goal was to increase relevance among a younger demographic. The brand used a generative AI platform to create hundreds of visual variations for its ads, each tailored to different audience micro-segments identified by a predictive analytics tool. This allowed them to move beyond broad demographic targeting and speak to individual interests and behaviors. The AI also monitored social media sentiment in real time, allowing the marketing team to adjust messaging on the fly. The results were impressive. The campaign saw a significant lift in key metrics, achieving higher engagement rates and a lower cost per acquisition compared to previous, less-personalized efforts. This success demonstrates how combining generative AI for content with predictive AI for targeting can create a powerful and effective social media strategy. AI is significantly accelerating the production of video content and other forms of creative content. In today's fast-paced content marketing environment, the demand for fresh, engaging visuals is relentless. Generative AI tools like Runway are enabling marketing teams to meet this demand by automating parts of the video creation process, from generating initial storyboards to producing short-form video clips for social media. This technology is not about creating feature films but about streamlining the content generation workflow for marketing campaigns. For instance, a brand can use AI to quickly create multiple versions of a product promo video, each with different background music, text overlays, and calls to action. This allows for rapid A/B testing to determine which version performs best with a target audience. This approach frees up creative teams from repetitive editing tasks, allowing them to focus on higher-level concepts and storytelling. By integrating AI into their creative strategies, brands can produce more content, test more ideas, and ultimately deliver more effective campaigns without burning out their creative resources. The impact of AI on website design and optimization is transformative. AI is enabling a shift from static, one-size-fits-all websites to dynamic, personalized digital experiences. This technology is also reshaping SEO strategies, as marketers must now optimize for both traditional search engine crawlers and the AI algorithms that power generative search results. Are you using AI to its full potential on your website? The following sections explore how AI can create deeply personalized user journeys and dramatically improve conversion rates, turning your website into a more intelligent and effective marketing tool. Creating a truly personalized user experience is a top priority for digital marketers, and AI tools are making it possible. Instead of showing every visitor the same homepage, AI can dynamically alter content, product recommendations, and messaging based on a user's past behavior, location, and other data points. This creates a much more relevant and engaging customer experience. For example, an e-commerce site can use AI to showcase products that a specific user is likely to be interested in, based on their browsing history. A B2B website might highlight case studies from the visitor's industry. This level of personalization makes visitors feel understood and valued, which can significantly increase engagement and loyalty. Vanguard provides a powerful example of this in action. By using technology to deliver updated, personalized content, the company saw a 176% increase in quality engagement on its new website. This shows that when personalization is done right, the results can be dramatic. Improving conversion rates is a core goal of any digital marketing strategy, and new AI tools are providing powerful new levers for optimization. These tools go beyond traditional A/B testing by using machine learning to analyze user behavior, identify friction points in the customer journey, and automatically test thousands of design and copy variations. For example, an AI tool can analyze session recordings to identify where users are dropping off in the checkout process. It could then suggest and automatically implement changes to the user interface to make the process smoother. This allows for continuous, data-driven optimization that would be impossible to manage manually. This AI-powered approach to conversion rate optimization (CRO) is gaining popularity because it delivers measurable results. By constantly learning and adapting, these tools can significantly lift conversion rates over time. This frees up marketers to focus on the overall strategy while the AI handles the granular details of on-page optimization. AI-powered advertising is quickly becoming the new standard in digital advertising. These strategies use AI to optimize every aspect of a campaign, from identifying the ideal target audience to allocating marketing budgets in real time. This data-driven approach allows for a level of precision and efficiency that was previously unattainable. Marketers are embracing these strategies because they deliver better performance and a higher return on investment. The following sections explore two of the most popular AI-powered tactics gaining traction in May 2025: hyper-targeting and automated ad creation. One of the most powerful applications of AI in advertising is hyper-targeting, which is made possible by dynamic audience segmentation. Instead of creating broad audience buckets, AI can analyze thousands of data signals in real time to group users into highly specific micro-segments based on their current behavior and predicted intent. This process relies heavily on predictive analytics. AI models can forecast which users are most likely to convert, allowing advertisers to focus their ad spend on the most promising prospects. This provides valuable insights into customer behavior and helps ensure that ad messages are delivered only to those who will find them most relevant. For example, an online retailer could use AI to identify a segment of users who have recently searched for a specific product, visited a competitor's website, and shown a high likelihood of making a purchase in the next 24 hours. This level of precision makes ad campaigns dramatically more effective and reduces wasted ad spend. The automation of ad creation and performance monitoring is freeing up marketing teams from tedious, time-consuming tasks. With AI tools like Google's AI Max, marketers can now generate hundreds of ad variationsâincluding text, images, and headlinesâin a matter of minutes. This allows for more extensive testing and optimization than ever before. Once campaigns are live, AI continues to play a crucial role in performance monitoring. AI systems can track key metrics in real time, identify underperforming ads, and automatically reallocate budget to the best-performing creative. Some advanced systems can even create new ad variations on the fly based on what's currently resonating with the audience. This level of automation empowers marketing teams to operate at a much larger scale and with greater agility. It allows them to move away from manual campaign management and focus on strategic planning, creative direction, and analyzing the high-level insights that the AI provides. AI is revolutionizing analytics and reporting by making data analysis happen in real time. Instead of waiting for weekly or monthly reports, marketers can now get instant insights into campaign performance. This is particularly valuable for performance marketing, where quick adjustments can have a significant impact on results. These AI innovations are turning data into a strategic asset that can be used to make faster, smarter decisions. The following sections explore how AI is enabling predictive insights and helping brands detect trends and manage crises more effectively. How could your team benefit from instant access to these insights? Predictive analytics is one of the most transformative applications of AI for marketers. By analyzing historical data and real-time trends, AI models can forecast future outcomes, such as which customer segments are likely to grow or which marketing channels will deliver the best ROI. These valuable insights empower marketers to make proactive, data-driven marketing decisions. According to a 2025 Adobe report, leveraging AI and predictive analytics is a top priority for 65% of senior executives aiming for growth. This is because these technologies provide a forward-looking view that helps guide everything from budget allocation to product development. Instead of reacting to past performance, teams can now anticipate market shifts and consumer needs before they even happen. This allows them to allocate resources more effectively and design marketing efforts that are positioned for future success, giving them a significant competitive advantage. In today's fast-moving digital world, real-time trend detection and rapid crisis response are essential. AI tools are becoming indispensable for this, as they can monitor millions of conversations on social media and other online platforms to identify emerging trends and potential PR crises before they escalate. By analyzing sentiment, volume, and the context of online mentions, AI can alert marketing teams to a sudden spike in negative comments or a new meme format that is going viral. This gives brands the ability to respond quickly and appropriately. For trend detection, AI can spot shifts in consumer interests, helping brands create relevant content that taps into the cultural zeitgeist. Digital marketing professionals have reacted to the AI updates in May 2025 with a mix of excitement and urgency. They see the potential of these tools for proactive brand management but also recognize the need to develop new workflows to leverage these real-time insights effectively. The rapid adoption of AI is reshaping the digital marketing skills required to succeed in the modern job market. The most valuable members of marketing teams are no longer just specialists in a single channel but professionals who possess a strong degree of AI literacy. They understand how to work alongside AI to achieve better results. This shift is creating new roles and evolving existing ones. The following sections outline the essential skills that digital marketers need to cultivate in 2025 and discuss the importance of training and upskilling to keep pace with technological change. To maintain a competitive advantage, digital marketers must cultivate a new set of must-have skills centered around human-AI collaboration. Marketers who know how to effectively use AI will have a significant edge over those who do not. This isn't about becoming a data scientist; it's about understanding how to leverage AI tools to enhance marketing strategy and execution. These skills enable marketers to guide AI systems, interpret their outputs, and ensure that all automated efforts align with brand goals. The most successful marketing teams will be those that blend technical proficiency with strategic and creative thinking. Key skills for 2025 include: Developing AI literacy across marketing teams is no longer a luxury but a necessity. Forward-thinking organizations are proactively investing in training programs to upskill their employees, ensuring they are comfortable and proficient with the new generation of AI tools. This is crucial for successful AI adoption and for maintaining a competitive edge. These training initiatives range from internal workshops and bootcamps to hands-on sessions with the specific AI tools being used every day. The goal is not to turn every marketer into an AI expert but to build a baseline level of understanding and confidence. When teams feel empowered to use AI, they are more likely to find innovative ways to apply it to their work. Ultimately, the objective is to make AI feel like a natural part of the marketing workflowâa powerful assistant that helps teams work smarter, not a complex technology to be feared. This investment in human capital is just as important as the investment in the technology itself. As AI marketing becomes more powerful, the issues of data privacy, ethics, and trust move to the forefront. Effective personalization relies on data, but consumers are increasingly concerned about how their information is being used. Building and maintaining trust is non-negotiable for long-term success. Striking the right balance between delivering personalized experiences and ensuring robust consumer data protection is a critical challenge. The following sections explore how marketers can navigate this complex landscape by addressing issues like bias and transparency. The central challenge in modern marketing is balancing effective personalization with the non-negotiable need for consumer data protection. While consumers want brands to anticipate their needs, they are also highly concerned about data privacy. This creates a significant trust gap that brands must bridge. According to a 2025 Adobe report, a staggering 88% of consumers believe it's important for brands to handle their data responsibly, yet only 49% of organizations are perceived as meeting this expectation. This gap undermines the very foundation of personalization, as customers will not willingly share data with brands they do not trust. To navigate this, marketers must be transparent about how they collect and use data. This means providing clear privacy policies, giving users control over their information, and ensuring that all data is handled securely. Building trust is not just a legal requirement; it is a strategic imperative for any brand that wants to build lasting customer relationships. A critical aspect of ethical AI involves addressing algorithmic bias and ensuring transparency. AI tools are only as unbiased as the data they are trained on. If the training data contains historical biases, the AI's outputâwhether it's ad targeting or content generationâwill perpetuate and even amplify those biases. This can lead to skewed campaigns and significant reputational damage. Marketers must be vigilant and question the outputs of their AI tools. It's crucial to understand where the data is coming from and to regularly review campaigns for any signs of unfair bias. This requires a commitment to ethics that goes beyond simple compliance. Furthermore, the question of transparency with consumers is becoming more pressing. Should audiences be informed when content is AI-generated? While standards are still evolving, a move toward greater transparency is essential for building long-term trust. Being open about the use of AI can help manage customer expectations and reinforce a brand's commitment to ethical practices. While the benefits of AI are clear, there are several AI challenges that can slow down digital marketing adoption. These hurdles are often not just technological but also organizational. Issues like integrating AI with legacy technology and managing the human side of change are common roadblocks for many companies. Successfully overcoming these challenges requires a strategic approach that focuses on both systems and people. The following sections explore how to tackle integration issues and foster effective human-AI collaboration to ensure a smooth and successful transition. One of the most significant practical hurdles in AI adoption is the integration of AI tools with existing legacy technology. Many organizations, from large enterprises to small businesses, operate on a patchwork of older systems, such as CRMs, CDPs, and analytics platforms. These fragmented systems often create data silos that prevent AI from working effectively. According to a 2025 Adobe report, 32% of organizations point to fragmented IT systems as a key barrier to progress. Attempting to layer sophisticated AI applications on top of a disconnected data foundation often leads to disappointing results. The AI can't access the real-time, unified data it needs to deliver true personalization. To overcome this, organizations must prioritize data unification. This doesn't always mean ripping and replacing old systems. Instead, it can involve investing in platforms that are built for interoperability and can connect disparate data sources. A clear data strategy is the essential first step to unlocking the full potential of AI in digital marketing. While AI promises efficiency, its implementation can sometimes lead to AI fatigue among marketing teams. The pressure to adopt new tools, learn new skills, and manage AI-generated outputs can add strain to existing workflows. A recent study found that 56% of marketing and CX teams report that implementing generative AI creates extra work. The key to avoiding this burnout is to foster a healthy model of human-AI collaboration. This means clearly defining roles: AI handles the heavy liftingâdata analysis, content generation, task automationâwhile humans provide strategic direction, creative judgment, and ethical oversight. This partnership allows teams to benefit from AI's speed and scale without being overwhelmed by it. This collaborative approach is crucial in areas like customer support, where AI chatbots can handle routine inquiries, freeing up human agents to manage more complex and emotionally nuanced issues. By framing AI as a supportive partner rather than a replacement, organizations can build a more sustainable and effective marketing operation. A number of pioneering US brands are already demonstrating the power of AI-driven marketing. Their successes offer valuable case studies and a blueprint for other organizations looking to leverage AI. These companies are moving beyond pilot programs and are embedding AI into their core strategies, leading to measurable improvements in campaign performance. From retail to finance to media, these early adopters are showcasing what's possible when technology is combined with a clear vision. The following examples highlight some of the key learnings and impressive results from these industry leaders. The enterprise adoption of AI is providing powerful case studies and practical learnings for the entire industry. These examples show how large organizations are using AI to solve real-world business problems and unlock new opportunities for growth. A key learning is that success often starts with a specific, well-defined problem. Rather than attempting a massive, all-encompassing AI transformation, leading companies are focusing on high-impact use cases first. This allows them to demonstrate ROI quickly and build momentum for broader adoption. Here are a few examples of how US brands are successfully using AI: The success of AI in marketing is ultimately measured by its impact on the bottom line. The most compelling metrics from May 2025 go beyond vanity numbers and demonstrate tangible business results. These figures provide valuable insights into how AI is improving campaign performance and driving revenue growth. One of the most striking results comes from TSB Bank. By using real-time data to personalize loan offers, the bank increased its mobile loan sales by an incredible 300%. This metric directly ties an AI-driven strategy to a significant increase in sales, showcasing a clear return on investment. Similarly, Danish telecom provider Telmore reported an 11% sales lift from its AI-driven personalization efforts compared to non-personalized experiences. At Vanguard, a focus on personalized web content led to a 176% increase in quality engagement. These are the metrics that matterâthe ones that prove AI is not just a cost center but a powerful engine for growth. Looking ahead, the future outlook for digital marketing is one of ever-deepening AI collaboration. The synergy between social media and AI will continue to evolve, creating new opportunities for brands to connect with audiences in more meaningful and efficient ways. The era of proactive, predictive marketing is just beginning. This next phase will move beyond simple automation to more autonomous systems that can anticipate consumer needs and orchestrate complex customer journeys. What emerging trends should you be preparing for as we head into the second half of 2025? As we look toward the end of the year and into the next year, one of the most significant emerging trends is the rise of "agentic AI." This represents the next evolution of virtual assistants. Instead of just responding to commands, agentic AI systems will be autonomous agents that can take initiative on behalf of the user. Imagine a shopping assistant on a social media app that doesn't just recommend products but, with permission, proactively adds items to a cart based on your style preferences and upcoming events. Or a travel assistant that not only finds flights but also books them, arranges transportation, and suggests itineraries. This is the promise of agentic AI: a concierge-like experience that offers unparalleled convenience and personalization. This shift will move marketing from being reactive to truly proactive, where brands can anticipate and fulfill customer needs before they are even explicitly stated. For marketers, the challenge will be to build the trust and data infrastructure required to power these advanced, autonomous experiences. Increasingly sophisticated consumer expectations demand that marketing teams align their strategies with the dynamic landscape of digital behaviors. Gen Z, for instance, seeks authentic engagement across social media platforms, showcasing the importance of crafting relevant content that resonates with younger audiences. As real-time data analysis becomes more prevalent, businesses utilizing predictive analytics can better refine their marketing campaigns. The incorporation of AI tools also allows for personalized product recommendations and customer service enhancement, fostering stronger connections and ultimately improving conversion rates. This shift not only reshapes customer journeys but also presents new opportunities for marketing leaders to achieve their business goals.

Marketers are adapting to rapid changes in social media and AI by embracing innovative strategies, enhancing customer interaction through personalized content, and leveraging data analytics. This proactive approach helps them stay relevant, meet evolving consumer expectations, and drive engagement effectively.
